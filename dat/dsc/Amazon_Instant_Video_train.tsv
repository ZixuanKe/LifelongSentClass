I highly recommend this series . It is a must for anyone who is yearning to watch `` grown up '' television . Complex characters and plots to keep one totally involved . Thank you Amazin Prime .	1
Mysteries are interesting . The tension between Robson and the tall blond is good but not always believable . She often seemed uncomfortable .	1
This show always is excellent , as far as british crime or mystery showsgoes this is one of the best ever made . The stories are well done and the acting is top notch with interesting twists in the realistic and brutal storylines . This show pulls no punches as it enters into the twisted minds of criminals and the profiler psychiatrist who helps out in a northern english city police force . The show looks like it is shot in Manchester but it is called by another name in the show . One episode is not on this disc the excellent 'prayer of the bone '' which is on a seperate disc . Still crime shows do n't get much better than this one on either side of the ocean . It 's just a great show that never has had a less than well made episode . Unfortunately like all British shows you only get about five shows a year , but these are an hour and a half shows , still one could hope for at least 8 of these a year . The realism and depth of the main character Tony Hill as protrayed by the excellent Robson Green is well worth viewing because he just makes this role truly part of himself in everyway . I bet he went to crime scenes even in real life to research his role . But the writers too must be applauded for their way above average stories . Lets hope this show continues on for many years to come .	1
I discovered this series quite by accident . Having watched and appreciated Masterpiece Contemporary : Place of Execution , I was keen to read the novel ( which inspired the TV adaptation ) by Val McDermid . The novel was very well-written , and a nail-biting suspense thriller . Then I discovered that Val McDermid wrote other novels as well , and a couple of them inspired the TV crime drama Wire in the Blood.I finished watching all of Season 1 and have become a fan of this gritty crime drama that follows the investigations led by DI Carol Jordan ( Hermione Norris ) . She is assisted by clinical psychologist Dr. Tony Hill ( Robson Green ) , a rather eccentric figure who delves deeply into the minds of serial killers , studies patterns of criminal behavior and profiles criminals . His methods may seem strange at times , but he always manages to get results . Both Jordan and Hill make a strange if compelling pair , with Jordan analyzing a case based on evidence , and Hill working based on his knowledge of deviant behavior and what makes people commit disturbing crimes.Unlike some of the `` cozy '' mysteries such as the long-running Midsomer Murders - Set One and The Complete Inspector Lynley Mysteries , Wire in the Blood is not for the faint of heart . The crimes are horrific , sometimes involving children , almost always patterned on deviant behavior and the suspects are almost always very disturbed individuals . The crime scenes are difficult to watch as are the way victims are found and even the forensic examinations are graphic and unsettling . Though compelling , this is not really a show to watch in one sitting , and may very well give viewers nightmares.The first season contains three main stories , each divided into two episodes : The Mermaids Singing - Hill is on the trail of a seriously disturbed serial killer who targets homosexuals.Shadows Rising - The skeletal remains of a young woman is found , and when further evidence turns up , DI Jordan and Hill realize they have a serial killer on their hands , one with a penchant for dark-haired young women.Justice Painted Blind - Another unsettling case , this time revolving around an old child abduction and murder case . A couple of apparently random murders turn out not to be so random after all when it is discovered that the victims do share a connection involving an old court case where the accused was found not guilty . This throws up a whole bunch of suspects , including the parents of the murdered girl.The writing on this crime drama is excellent , and Robson Green is credible as the clinical psychologist who has a rare knack for profiling and getting under the skin of some of the most dangerous criminals . The drama also explores the chemistry and tension between Hill and DI Jordan , all of which result in a riveting show that keeps viewers coming back for more.The streaming was good overall with only a little delayed streaming during Episode One . There were no glitches on the other episodes . The picture quality could be improved though as it did seem a bit grainy to me .	1
This is the best of the best comedy Stand-up . The fact that I was able to just watch continuously one comedian after another was great . I had the best laughter I have had in a long time .	1
Funny , interesting , a great way to pass time . I usually enjoy standup comedy and is this is a good show for me .	1
I love the variety of comics . Great for dinner TV entertainment because of length of each episode . Many of the featured comics have gone on to even bigger TV specials so it 's great to see some of their earlier material .	1
Watched it for Kevin Hart and only Kevin Hart ! He makes me laugh . The best comedy comes from pain and Kevin does his comedy with a huge heart .	1
Enjoyed some of the comedians , it was a joy to laugh after losing my father whom I was a caregiver for	1
All the comedians are hilarious . I have seen them all before on Comedy Central but what a great idea to put them all together . I love Amazon prime and I love their shows . They are so much better than Netflix . I got rid of my Netflix Amazon rocks and Netflix well it thymes with rocks but in a bad way .	1
Very funny . Some of the comedians were funnier than the others . We were laughing so hard the dog thought something was wrong with us	1
Great variety of good comics . Each show is just the right length to not get boring . The comics are really funny too .	1
I loved the humor of the stand-up comics featured here . I only got the free episode listed at the beginning of the season , but it probably gives a good idea of what is contained in the rest of the season . I have actually watched several episodes of this season when I was having a free 30-day trial membership in Amazon prime , which I eventually plan to become a paid subscriber to .	1
Season 2 of It 's Always Sunny In Philadelphia is mandatory for anyhow who watches the show to own . This season has some of the greatest episodes in Sunny history !	1
Each episode gives me more entertainment than anything else on the tube . though I may not want to have these characters as real friends - the women are hot though - the plots and characters make for great viewing.Do not see myself abandoning this series.I give 5 stars to every episode and season of Always Sunny in Philadelphia ! Thanks Amazon !	1
Got these for my son 's birthday . He says they are great ! They are funny so give them a try ! OK !	1
Gave this to a good friend and ordered another for myself . Very funny ! I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys irony and a good laugh .	1
Out of all the new comedies that have come out in the last ten years , Sunny is as the top of my list . You need an affinity for quirky , offbeat humor to enjoy it , not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor . The first season consisted of just seven episodes , but established the core characters and operators of Paddy & # 8217 ; s Pub ; owners Dennis , Mac , and Charlie , and waitress/Dennis & # 8217 ; s twin sister Dee . In Season 2 ( ten episodes ) , Danny Devito comes on board as Frank , Dennis and Dee & # 8217 ; s dad . The show & # 8217 ; s creators ( Rob McElhenney/ Mac ; Glenn Howerton/Dennis ; and Charlie Day/Charlie ) are hilarious as actors , and also as writers . Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me . It & # 8217 ; s one of those great ensemble casts that & # 8217 ; s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character , resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode . These first two seasons have some of my favorites , including & # 8220 ; Charlie Has Cancer , & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Charlie Got Molested , & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare , & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Hundred Dollar Baby , & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody & # 8217 ; s Ass. & # 8221 ; Like most fans of the show , I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes , and considering that he & # 8217 ; s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL , it & # 8217 ; s clear how important he is as part of the cast . But that & # 8217 ; s not a knock against anyone else . I can & # 8217 ; t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis , Dee , Mac , and Charlie , and even though Frank was n't there in the beginning , it would definitley hurt the show to lose him . As far as current TV comedies go , no one else is doing anything funnier than & # 8220 ; Always Sunny , & # 8221 ; and these first two seasons show it .	1
4.5 starsI knew nothing of this until a friend lent it to me this weekend . I laughed . Often . At things that are n't supposed to be funny , but as any serious fan of comedy knows , those can be the best laughs . I walked away feeling lighter and happier . If that ai n't comedic success , what is ? IASIP is like Seinfeld if the SeinFour were ten years younger , Irish , and ran a bar in South Philly . These guys have clearly studied Sein and Curb very closely , and their tight timing and topics and banter are all very Larry Davidesque ... but they go places even LD wo n't . The best two shows of the 7-episode first season are about cancer and abortion ; I howled at some moments . These guys have done what so many guys want to do : make a show about how funny they are . Except , these guys really are funny . Sometimes . But hey , no one 's always hittin ' homers , even on comedy 'roids , so I cut these three some slack and marvel at how tightly they work together . There 's a lot to be said for working with old friends , if they have talent : the camaraderie and timing here are born of many years of drinking and laughing and thinking and falling down , no doubt . And these three guys are each pretty dang funny , each in his own fashion.DeVito is ok but I liked the first season best for its rawness . Still , as the later shows get a little more polished it 's often in good ways.If you do n't like drinking , if you insist on PC language from your friends and neighbors , and if you are in general just plain uptight about people living and thinking the way you want them to , look elsewhere . But If you enjoy tying one on and laughing your butt off at the endlessly silly idiocy that accompanies being alive in America these days , you may just find Always Sunny to be almost always funny .	1
I enjoyed the first season a lot . The 4 main characters are very funny with their self centered ways . The second season they added Danny Devito ( Frank Reynolds ) as the deranged father figure . Now most of the story lines revolve around him . Not as funny . Maybe it 's better to just leave well enough alone .	1
This series revolves around 4 friends who run a bar in Philadelphia and who go through a variety of difficult but extremely funny and often extravagant situations . I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress . What a suprise : this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl . I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer , discovering a friend 's grandfather was a nazi . It also tackles the strange love men sometimes has for guns ets ... In some ways it is difficult to describe and understand if you have not seen this gem of comedy .	1
Watched Charlie Day give a commencement address and then decided to check out his show . Found this show surprisingly GOOD ! The cast is funny but they deal with real world guy and girl issues I . A fun , but informative way . Highly recommend it and not just for the laughs .	1
I was pleasantly surprised with this `` out of the box '' series . Good writing , good acting , laugh out loud situations . Devito showing up in the second season gave it a little boost as he 's always dependable for turning the mundane into the hilarious.It 's basically about 3 jackass friends in Philly who own a bar and get themselves into offbeat situations . What I liked best is that it is not the clice venue for the young and the beautiful . It often hi-lightes the old and the ugly and in doing so cultivates a good portion of the laughs.Worth you time and money ... .bg	1
I wish I were a part of this cast . This is the funniest stuff ever . YOU MUST GET THIS IF YOU ARE A DIE HARD & # 34 ; SUNNY & # 34 ; FAN !	1
Who says the sitcom is dead ? Not since Arrested Development has a sitcom been this truly hysterical and quick paced that you do n't know what to expect next . It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , originally premiering on the FX network in 2005 , revolves around four friends : Charlie ( Charlie Day ) , Mac ( Rob McElhenney ) , Dennis ( Glenn Howerton ) , and his sister Dee ( Kaitlin Olson ) ; all of whom own and run an Irish bar in downtown Philadelphia . They get into all kinds of crazy hijinks through misunderstandings and just plain bad judgement , ranging from being mistaken as a gay bar to Charlie lying about having cancer . Yes , there 's nothing really wholly original about the show 's premise , but it remains hysterically funny throughout . The second season of the show finds Danny DeVito joining the cast as Dennis and Dee 's father , who is n't the sanest of the bunch either . This DVD set compiles the first two seasons of the show , and is definitely worth picking up for viewers who turned it when it first premiered , as well as newer viewers who may be anxiously awaiting the upcoming and long awaited third season of this very funny show .	1
I heard about It 's Always Sunny from a Kevin Smith Smodcast . If you have n't been force-fed the usual formula comedycrap replete with obnoxious laugh tracks , you might just like it.It 's not a continuous knee-slapper but just some good ol ' off-center comedy . Welcome back Danny DeVito - sure he 's doing the same ol ' DePalma character , but I STILL think it 's funny . For me , it 's another one of those sit down and plow through a DVD at a time . I would never have had the patience to watch these one at a time on the tube when it aired ( that 's just me ) .	1
funny thing . My brother 's been trying to get me to watch this show forever . As it turns out , I get the videos of the day , everyday , and one was Charlie Day giving the commencement speech at his alma mater , Merrimack college in New Hampshire . it was then I realized that its Always Sunny in Philadelphia , was his show , and he 's from New Hampshire where I 'm from also.of course , this is what prompted me to actually start watching the show . I really enjoy it , it almost seems unscripted . The best part is , it 's on Amazon Prime for free . How can you beat that !	1
Fan-tastic . This is a show about terrible people being terrible , and it 's hilarious and mean and perfect . Watching the characters grow into such vile monsters is a real joy . Seriously !	1
I love this show and I do n't think that will ever change . I hate all of the characters and I mean that in the best way . Hilarious .	1
I love it 's always sunny and wanted to own the seasons , but did n't want to spend a lot of money . Came to Amazon and managed to buy seasons 1-6 for less then $ 25 ! ! Way pumped ! The discs were clean , no scratches , worked perfectly . No problems at allAs for the first seasons of it 's always sunny , you either like it or you do n't . I used to hate this show , but it 's now one of my favorite shows . If you have n't seen it yet , then get on it player !	1
Wish I had watched this show when it began back in 2001 . Very happy that it is available from Amazon to stream . I 've watched 5 seasons in 3 weeks ! Will keep you on the edge of your seat ( if you suspend reality a little bit ) . Highly recommend !	1
Non stop action with edge of your seat thrilling plots with a new turn every minute . Cast of great stars keep all events seeming like weeks but actually are in 24 hours	1
I had a hard time following this show when it was on TV but now that it is on Prime I can watch the episodes in a row without commercial interruption . I now can watch all of them at my leisure . I am so excited that I ca n't wait for another day to watch more ! And I think Keifer Sutherland makes the show . I would like to tell all viewers out there that you should be on Prime because all of these episodes are for free with your membership . Many of your TV episode series are for free and tons of movies . So you all out there join Amazon Prime !	1
Season 5 24 is fantastic . Each episode gets more and more exciting ! I keep thinking , it ca n't get any better than this , but guess what ! It does ! Fantastic show , no show can beat 24 ! I am a wreck when its over , but I love it so !	1
Seson five is killer ! I would recommend this dvd set to anybody ! Full of suspense killer action ! Jack is a bad ass ! Buy it , you wo n't regret it !	1
This show is like a runaway train ride . Every episode has poor Jack in some death defying crisis . Really enjoyed the ride .	1
For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies , no other show comes close to 24 . You 'd think the premise ( every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time ; thus 24 encapsulates a full day ) would get old by now , but , surprisingly , the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting , must-see season . In fact , this might be the best season of them all . The thrills and nail-biting suspense ( as well as the SPOILERS alert ) begin early in the season five opener , with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents ( one of which is tragically successful ) . Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland ) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House . As he becomes the most wanted man in America ( he is framed for Palmer 's assassination ) , he must try to ferret out the true culprit ( s ) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains . On a personal level , he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends , the alienation of his daughter Kim , and the fact that his former girlfriend Audrey Raines ( Kim Raver ) might have moved on.There 's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing , the Sopranos , Grey 's Anatomy , and House for best drama . The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping , edge-of-your-seat plot line , with its manic twists and turns , to the no-quarters-given , full speed ahead performances of the cast , but specially of Kiefer Sutherland , who gives his all in inhabiting his role . Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity , lying just beneath an icy cold surface , and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts , when he 's reacting to something personal to him . He makes a scene work , even without dialogue . Very good stuff . And , no , you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts , of course . Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss , while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime . Mary Lynn Rajskub ( Chloe O'Brian ) continues her highlight role as CTU 's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative . Meanwhile , James Morrison , Roger Cross , Kim Raver , Carlos Bernard , Louis Lombardi , and Sean Astin become the season 's dependable , solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes . There 's no comfort level at all here , as you 're never sure who would survive in the end ( but , with this show , were you ever sure ? ) . Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust ( Please , no ! ) .So , the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5 , 2006 , just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six , which begins next January on Fox . Season Six , by the way , picks up nearly two years after season five 's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack 's estranged dad , Phillip Bauer . Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard , Kal Penn ( Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle ) , Peter MacNicol , Regina King , and the beautiful Rena Sofer . I ca n't wait to own season five and , then , to see season six . Long live Jack Bauer !	1
Revel in his awesomeness ! ! ! For he is a god amongst men and he is deserving of all praise that can possibly be heaped upon him . The one time the Emmys got something right ! ! Jack Bauer is as close as any fictional character has become to being superhumanly powerful , and at some times his recurrent circumvention of the bureaucratic system , assaulting his friends and co-workers , his flagrant abuse of `` prisoner 's rights '' and his uncanny ability to fight his way out of any trap ... it may require a little bit more suspension of disbelief than would normally be necessary in a lesser show , but the very core of this show is Jack Bauer , or more specifially , Kiefer Sutherland and his increasingly better performance each season of 24 . When he is having a particularly emotional moment , you feel it exude from the screen ... . this is just an example of the power that Sutherland brings to this show . Also standing out as always is Mary Lynn Rasjkub as the wonderfully ascerbic and wicked-tongued Chloe O'Brien . The introduction of her character is one of the best things that 's happened to this show . But this season has some other stand-out characters : one that was introduced in season 4 and a brand new one . Fans of the show know these as President Charles Logan ( the wonderfully slimy Gregory Itzin ) and his first lady Martha Logan ( the amazing Jean Smart ) . Their interplay and their performances are almost as key as Sutherland in this season . Another thing that came to be almost an in-joke is that three members of the cast of the original ROBOCOP film appear in different parts of the series , which as a fan of that film was just really cool to see . Whether or not that was intended , it 's still a nice touch for genre fans . Julian Sands has lots of fun chewing up scenery as the evil Russian-yet-English-Accented Terrorist . The premise is per usual : Jack must defy all odds to save the country and avenge his personal losses . But the plot itself is of a higher level of complexity and tragedy this season than prior seasons . The way it begins is ALMOST as shocking as the way the season ends . And the ending of the final episode of the season ... that scream you heard in the whole of the United States and parts of Canada and Mexico ... that was me . January 2007 CAN NOT GET HERE SOON ENOUGH ! ! !	1
The first five seasons of 24 are the best thriller/escapism you 'll find on television . It 's fast-paced , big-budgeted , over-the-top ( sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top ) , and mostly clever . But I do n't think ANY of the previous seasons ( or the lame season 6 ) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same ( tired ) gimick of everything happening in real-time , but what set this season apart for me was it 's more focusd plot-line . Several of lead character Jack Bauer 's friends are killed or attacked and he 's out to find out who and get revenge . Ok , sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical ( terrorists trying to release poisonous gas ) , and sometimes it 's not always that interesting ( CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN ! ) . But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty ( thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast ) .Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I ca n't recommend buying this season enough ( thought why there 's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me ) . Yes it 's a couple years old now , but it 's still the best ( and most affordable ) 24 episodes of action you 'll find anywhere .	1
Just finished the 5th season of this very riveting series . I must admit the season started off with a Bang ! When you watch it you will see what I mean . However , about mid season I had to push myself a little to get through to the last 1/3 of season , and I am SO glad I did ! WOW ! talk about being on the edge of my seat . This season really does have more of an edge to it . A fictional Syntox gas , nerve agent , is involved , terrorist plots , political corruption and some of the main characters are bumped off ! Loved this season and would highly recommend it to anyone !	1
Absolutely great show ! Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat ! Makes it very hard to turn it off !	1
While I had kind of given up on 24 , this is a good return to form for the series . It starts with the assasination of previous president Palmer and as the season advances we see how Jack , who has come back from the dead for many , is confronted with a group of russian separatists who have gotten some nerve gas . The way the story unfolds gets slightly too straightforward from the middle of the season on but it is still quite exciting stuff . Kim comes back for a short period also .	1
I particularly like the fact that the show ( which I missed when broadcast ) subtly introduces the moral dilemmas of the situations .	1
In the aftermath of season 4 , Jack Bauer ( Kiefer Sutherland ) had to fake his own death and go into hiding . But he ca n't seem to stay in retirement for long . Someone knows Jack is alive and targets his friends , forcing Jack to come out of hiding to face down terrorists yet again.Meanwhile , it is an important day for the United States and President Logan ( Gregory Itzin ) . He has been working hard to iron out an anti-terrorism treaty with Russia , and that treaty will be signed that day . But the treat of terrorists in Los Angeles with stolen nerve gas just might be enough to derail the treaty.Season 5 won an Emmy for best drama , and it was well deserved . Even after five years , this show is gripping drama with excellent writing and acting . I am glued to my seat every week , breathing only during commercial breaks . This season the threat and storytelling seemed more focused then previous years , adding to the drama.There were a couple flaws this season . I sure do n't remember the explanation of who knew Jack was alive at the beginning of the season . Maybe it was mentioned and I missed it . Furthermore , we have yet more examples of lack of security at CTU . While it does make for gripping drama , it does seem like they could come up with a new plot trick every so often.My biggest complaint this season was the body count . We lost several key characters from previous years . While I understand the producer 's desire to keep us on the edge of our seats , ca n't anyone from the show live happily ever after ? It honestly got to the point I dreaded seeing anyone who had been on the show before for fear they would be killed off.Still , these are minor issues with a truly wonderful show . I 'm counting down the hours until the next season premiers and we can start the rush all over again .	1
( BEWARE , SOME SPOILERS BELOW ) Man , this is really a violent , dark and totally avoid of humour show . But 's the beuaty of it : there shows around about very differente themes.The proposal of 24 hours is to give you non-stop action , non-stop twists and , also , a lot of bloodshed . It 's interestin also to see through the shows the incredible amount of highly trained , superbly financied and intelliegnt people willing to do harm to good old Uncle Sam , be them American , Muslin , German , Rusian ... Also , the terrorists portrayed in the show are capable of mobilizing killer squads in less time than it takes to say `` Killer squads '' ... But , suspension of desbelief is something required to any show ( if we wan na just see reality , just check the news , not a show ! ) , since they respect tha canon and `` mitology '' described by that show itself . In that respect , 24 is respectul to itself.I 'm also one of those that consider Season Five the best season of them all . There are so many ingredients . Kim Raver is acting better than ever ... the rhythm is breathtaking all the way ( although the death toll is incredible high , even by thwe show standards - to kill Almeida , David Palmer , Michelle , Edgar Stiles , all of them in one single season ... uau ... ) Yes , I denitely think this is the best season of 24 until now .	1
This is a banner series for this extraordinarily conceived and executed television series . From its explosive opening through 24 hours of plot twists , exciting action , and devastating loss , this season is absolutely superb . Be warned though -- -there 's lots of unexpected killings in this season and several favorite characters are disposed of . You just do n't know what to expect from this Emmy-winning series.Kiefer Sutherland won his much deserved Best Actor emmy as Jack finds himself confronted with one impossible task after another . The supporting cast is superb : James Morrison as CTU director Bill Buchanan ; Mary Lynn Rajskub as the neurotic but brilliant Chloe ; Kim Raver as Jack 's former love Audrey ; William Devane as irasible Secretary of Defense ; Louis Lombardi as the plump and human Edgar ; Jayne Atkinson as the Homeland Security Director ; Sean Astin as the pompous replacement ; Peter Weller as the vicious assassin ; Glenn Morshower as the stoic Aaron ; Jude Ciccollella as Mike Novick ; Julian Sands as the evil terrorist ; and of course , Gregory Itzin and Jean Smart as the President and First Lady , who were robbed of their supporting actor Emmys , and who are just fantastic in these pivotal roles.24 is one of the best series out there and this season shows why .	1
24 , Seasons 1 - 8 are some of the best I 've ever seen ! From the first hour , every scene is filled with suspense and anticipation . JACK BAUER ( Kiefer Sutherland ) is a story hero that is always two steps ahead of the bad guys which helps keeping me from throwing rocks at my i-pad ( the bad guys ) ! Ca n't wait for the next season to show up ! & # 128522 ;	1
Love the show . Period . Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons ( something of a marathon over the last month ) .Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date . It starts strong and does n't let up until it 's over.As to packaging and the discs themselves : the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve , much like the Highlander series and a few others . The first discs contain the episodes themselves , and the last disc contains some bonus materials . Season 5 , however , breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases ( the 4th holds the bonus features disc ) . A change of page in packaging , but still quite attractive , with approximately the same shelf footprint ( if not slightly smaller ) .Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks , scene selection menus , and bonus features . I might note however , they 've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu ( looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system ) . However , on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence . So , it was n't completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par . Of course I do n't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound , so I ca n't test under all conditions . But if there were any video or audio issues I did n't notice them . Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns . But I 've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios , so I would n't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall , I highly recommend this for anyone who has n't seen 24 , and who likes the spy/thriller type show . If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita , you 'll probably like 24 as well . There are some `` intense '' scenes and probably some harsh language , so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters , if at all .	1
24 is the most fun series I have ever seen on tv . I love keifer Sutherland and it appears to me that a lot of actors get good parts and get in a lot of acting . Also this series has people , even the bad guys speaking articulately and very rationally . We are seeing a show full of admirable people not a bunch of losers . That must be a part of the popularity of the series.Note something else , these people comply with the human requirement of pronouncing judgement .	1
There was lots of action , I love it , Cant wait for the next season , very good acting . A lot of actors I remember . I would recomend to everyone .	1
Season Five was the winner ! Of course , Kiefer and the regular cast absolutely rock , it was fantastic to see as much of Agent Pierce as we did this season , and Gregory Itzen and Jean Smart ... ... well , what can I say about them other than === shoulda won the Emmys ! ! !	1
We were not fans of 24 until a family member gave us Season 7 DVD . The show is well done , we get a kick out of the fact that 24 shows is equal to 24 hours of activity . And laugh that no one ever takes a nap or eats during any of the shows . We are now working on Season 6 and then will catch up with the new show on TV this season .	1
The shocking opening moments of the fifth season of 24 literally blew away everything that we 've come to know about the show . Alliances are challenged , close friends are lost -- all the while Jack Bauer tries to keep his sanity and find out who the real culprit is behind one of the most trying days in American history.The cast is perfect , the storyline is compelling , and the action is never ceasing . This season had by far the most suspense as well as the most cliff hangers . After I finished watching an episode , I usually wanted to go right to the next and watch it right away ! There is , however , a big plot hole in the season . The fate of Evelyn Martin and her daughter was never covered , and I found that unfair ; an entire episode depicted their plight , and I feel it should have been resolved , whether she was killed or left alive by Henderson.Any show that can make a person sympathize with someone while viciously rooting against them ( i.e . Logan ) is a stupendous show . 24 delivers all of that and more , with its best season to date.9/10	1
I loved this season of 24 . I loved almost everything about it , even the death scenes . I felt like nobody was safe , and anybody could die ! I especially loved the episode where everyone is trapped in C.T.U . with the nerve gas everywhere . I also loved the surprise ending with Jack being taken hostage by the Chinese who were still after Jack from season 4 . I highly recommend this season to all fans of 24 . And I just saw the season six trailer . I 've watched it over three times and I ca n't wait .	1
I am watching each season of 24 on Amazon Prime Video and thoroughly enjoy each season . The twists and turns in each story are amazing , plus the shows give you mystery , action , love , betrayal , and so much more . It can take some time to get through an entire season because there ARE twenty-four 45 minute episodes . But whatever time you have to devote to this series is well worth it .	1
I 'm a fan what can I say . I just watched seasons 1-5 . 5 was one of my favorites , Jack seems to be going rogue more , the president is a despicable character . The various sub plots are on the verge of repulsive but the writers reel it in or at least end them with Jack Bauer justice . This season you should watch .	1
By now I 've gotten into 24 pretty deep . I like the intensity of this real time format . I really enjoy watching Jack save the world .	1
I enjoyed nearly all the seasons of 24 and this is probably my third year I have watched them . So excited they are bringing the show back though it may be somewhat different . I enjoy dramas such as & # 34 ; 24 & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Covert Affair & # 34 ; . Good luck to the 24 actors and crew and hope the new show will do well .	1
`` 24 '' is like Red Bull -- once you 've had it you 're addicted . The fifth season of `` 24 '' revolves around one central mystery : who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination ? It 's a thrilling season -- probably the best since the first season -- and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007 . Interestingly after having watched `` Casino Royale '' its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like `` 24 '' which were , in turn , inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there . There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you have n't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD . This also features a brief episode `` prequel '' to the sixth season like previous sets had . We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland . There 's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you 've watched the show ( or are watching it now ) it wo n't really provide anything new . Th `` 100 Episode Reel '' is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives . If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox ( at least during the Holidays ) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show . Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show , a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show , a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes . I have n't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really , really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging . This is a terrific set for an outstanding season of the series.What I would love to see if Keifer Sutherland and Donald Sutherland featured during a season .	1
great acting . Lot of cliff hangers . good direction . absorbing - could n't stop watching it . i would recommend it to anyone .	1
While Season One of 24 focused much of its attention on President David Palmer , Seasons 2-4 saw the Oval Office by and large take a back seat to the missions of Jack Bauer and CTU . However , Season Five brings some of the attention back to the sitting U.S. President ( this time Charles Logan ) and ends up with a much more well-rounded storyline.For a basic ( non-spoilery ) plot summary , a group of Russian terrorists threaten to release canisters of nerve gas in the U.S. , leading Bauer to be reprieved from his thought-to-be death in order to help stop the crisis . As CTU begins investigating the terrorism , however , it quickly becomes clear that the terrorists are working with a high-ranking government official , and the conspiracy begins to be unraveled.To be honest , at first I was skeptical of all the focus on President Logan , as did n't like his character and was n't sure that he could command the camera as well as his predecessor Palmer . However , by the end of the season , Logan is easily the most enjoyable/interesting character on the show . His acting , along with his wife , chief of staff , and head of security , really gives the show the Presidential presence it lacked since that first season.Of course , there is still more than enough of Jack Bauer and his fellow CTU agents ( Audrey Rains , Bill Buchanon , Edgar Stiles , Chloe O'Brien , etc . ) to go around , which means that intense drama ensues in every single episode . The writers have an amazing way to take a character that looks like a creep ( think Tony Almeida and George Mason in the early seasons ) and , by the end of a few episodes , have him become a noble hero , and that tradition continues in this season as well.The only `` knock '' I have on this season is that the cliffhanger endings of each episodes are n't quite as shocking ( e.g . Nina Myers does n't appear out of nowhere ) . However , I think that was more of a creative choice by the writers , as the story is actually more coherent that any season besides the first one . Instead of seemingly changing the plot of the show with every episode , Season Five slowly crescendos until the big finale.So , fans of 24 can purchase this season with confidence knowing that they will still get their action , drama , suspense , and some great twists and turns along the way .	1
If I had a friend Like MacGyver , than I would have try Survival Island and we would win all the money .	1
MacGyver can work his way out of anything with his knowledge of physics . He is a master of problem solving . I think everyone would enjoy seeing his stories .	1
It was Good and funny I enjoy it it is worth watching a family movie Just enjoy very light Enjoy	1
As usual , MacGyver is as exciting as ever .	1
James Bond minus the adult stuff . Great show that shows the mind is still the best weapon . Sure there is some liberal stuff thrown in but it is family friendly . And who ca n't resist the MacGyverisms as you think could that work . Maybe not but it will make the kids think and want to experiment . Good stuff for the whole family .	1
Well , I enjoy them for many reasons . i remember Mark Harmon when he played football for UCLA . He made the right career choice instead of getting banged up and damaged from the NFL he is raking it in with all of these hit series year after year .	1
What happened with Tony and the plague he was dying from . HELP ! It 's killing me to know ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Season three opens , with Gibbs going after Kate 's killer , Ari . And to try to throw alot at us , NCIS gets a new director , Jenny Shepard played by Lauren Holly . Now Shepard and Gibbs do have some history , since both were partners at NCIS at one time , also . To proclaim Ari 's innocence , is Massade officer Ziva David . And I 'm sorry , I did n't like her then . And I do n't liker her now , She and pretty much all of Massad is built up like they are the only agents that are extremely tough , they 're unstoppable . So Ziva and Jenny try to convince Gibbs that he 's wrong , and Gibbs even makes the only logical argument against Ari 's innocence . That if he were innocent , he would turn himself in . So , after much arguing , he gets Ziva to follow him . And Ziva kills Ari in Gibb 's basement , And we get each persons view of how they saw Kate in this episode . Now , I would have inserted Paula Cassidy to the team after this . Since there was some obvious chemistry between her and tony , but no . We get Ziva , and she is built up like I said . As this unstoppable , lean mean killing machine . The best of the best , and I 'm sorry , but she 's abrasive and annoying . And I still have a hard time accepting her to the team , Gibbs magically trusts her more than any other member of the team . season three is a good season , and Ziva is the on ; y reason I did n't give it 5 stars . Although season three does end with almost getting blown up , going into a coma . Waking up from that coma , and thinking it 's 1991 . And we get to meet Gibbs 's mentor , Mike Franks . Which leads to gibbs trying to stop a terrorists attack . Only the generals wo n't allow it , and Gibbs ends up Quitting NCIS . All in all , season three is still awsome . Like I said before , my only problem is Ziva . The introduction of a new director , and then Gibbs leaving .	1
NCIS changed in third season..and gotten strongerAt the end of season two , Kate was shot and died . Season three handles her death in the openning two parter `` Kill Ari '' which also introduces the audience to Ziva David ( Cote de Pablo ) and the new NCIS director ( Lauren Holly ) .The change comes in many ways , Gibbs seems harder after Kate 's death and it shows during the season , which builds to the two part season finale `` Hiatus '' ... a cliffehanger to open season four . all the character grew from Abby , Ducky , Mcgee and especially Tony.Most say change is bad , for this show is GOOD and we the audience reap the benifitsBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD	1
We have watched the first and second season and we love the series . We are now watching the third season and just like the first two we love the NCIS Team and the plots are excellent .	1
Please see earlier rant on season 4 . I like that they do not always end on a shocker , sometimes they just quietly say good bye . It can be so hard to replace characters but they have a knack for it . Good season for sure .	1
What is there to say about NCIS ? LGG..slappin the back of peoples 's heads.Abby..man what a great show.I watch this every Tuesday night , though Los Angles is better .	1
Started watching NCIS marathon on USA Channel ( had never watched the show ) and got hooked . I have since purchased every season through Amazon and am enjoying every episode . Great show .	1
Season 3 is much easier to use because CBS Video has splurged on the Play All function and subtitles . I started to like NCIS with the introduction of Cote de Pablo who looks like a cross between Winona Ryder and Salma Hayek . This is the season with the `` homos on the train '' line .	1
Love having the Instant View feature on Amazon.com . I have used this feature many times and will do again . Would highly recommend to friends and family .	1
as one of their own is shot and killed by the terrorist Gibbs has been hunting Ari . The season also shows how the different NCIS members are dealing with this tragic loss in a two part episode Kill Ari . This in turn leads to the new characters , Ziva David and the new NCIS Director ( who has more than a little history with Gibbs ) .This all blends in well and the new members of the team pick up right where they left off . With all the quirkiness and fun that they have in each show , it only helps to show much the actors/actresses have grown together and it makes NCIS one reason that i love to watch not only this show . But others of the same caliber . I am looking forward to season four as well as the 3rd season ended in a particular way . It leaves a lot of things open for the following season.But it also answers a few questions before the season is up like Gibbs past and how that affects him in his job today . I love all the characters in the show-Abby , Ducky , Dinozo ( sp ) , `` Probie '' , Ziva and the like . As each of them has their various moments throughout the season from killing an undercover cop , to a prisoner dying in custody or a mentally deranged ex-boyfriend that just wo n't go away.Along with some cool special features , NCIS is a show that is best watched from the beginning so that you get the full effect . So buy the 1st seasons and start from there . By the time you get to season 3 you 'll be well versed and know what all the buzz is about . NCIS is the real deal when it comes to TV shows period .	1
It is a well-done TV series that can absorb cast changes and continue to deliver excellent shows . NCIS Season Two ended with the shocking murder of Agent Caitlin Todd . Season Three opens with two major cast additions . Cote de Pablo joins the team as the beautiful and dangerous Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David , while veteran actress Lauren Holly , as Jenny Shepard , becomes the new director of NCIS.The changes put iconic Senior Agent Jethro Gibbs ( Mark Harmon ) in the awkward situation of working in a new agent while getting used to a new boss who is a former love interest . The rest of the team , still grieving for Caitlin , are slow to embrace Ziva but will be won over by her obvious competence , and by her hilarious efforts to master American slang . Wisecracking Agent Tony DiNozzo ( Michael Weatherly ) in particular will find that Ziva forces him to raise his game in a way that Caitlin never quite did.The exciting two-part season opener resolves the still-open case of Agent Todd 's murder . A two-part season ender places Gibbs ' service with NCIS at risk . The audience will learn more about Gibbs ' past while contemplating another season-ending cliff-hanger . In between , the team will handle serial killers , terrorists , and kidnappings with its usual mixture of brisk police procedural and entertaining repartee . Six special features about the making of the show are included in the DVD set . `` NCIS : The Third Season '' is very highly recommended to fans of the series .	1
This series has it all in the & # 34 ; crime & # 34 ; solving genre : Great cast , humor , story lines and gadgetry to keep you coming back for more . Especially enjoy the new addition replacing Kate 's character .	1
Season two ended with the murder of Caitlin Todd by the double agent Ari.The NCIS team is not going to allow this to go unpunished and the first two shows deal with this.Former Mossad intelligence officer Ziva David 's replacement of Caitlin is not without problems as the team deals with both loss and acceptance.Complicating matters is a new director that has a romantic past with Gibbs.This season the Director of NCIS moves out of the shadows and into the light . From now on , the Director is a full-fledged character and an important part of the story.Tony , Tim , Abby , Ducky and Jimmy are perfect in their roles.Jethro is boss , maverick and teacher while being larger than life.The cases are engrossing , complex and intelligent.The on-going interactions and personal stories support the show and fit the characters.This is an excellent series and this is an excellent season .	1
This is one of very few current TV shows which is worth my time to watch . Most of the shows on TV now are vulgar , violent , unfunny or intent on pushing an offensive social or sexual agenda - even the so-called animated comedies . Even the game shows are leaning way Left ( Jeopardy clues etc. ) . Most Reality shows are just plain stupid and fall into the above description as well . Though NCIS is often more GP than G rated , it has great characters and good plots .	1
This said it was used but you could n't tell . The box had just a little wear on the corners other then that it looked new . Would order from them again .	1
Great storylines and very believable great i would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years and love the show	1
I love this show ! It is interesting and is a show I have great fun watching with my dad when he has time off . The characters are funny and the banter is excellent .	1
It was rough enough for the fans of NCIS to lose Kate Todd by having Ari Haswari snipe her at the end of Season 2 . So , starting Season 3 off by showing Kate 's murder from Ari 's POV is a little rougher . But the two episodes that start off Season 3 of NCIS -- the two part `` Kill Ari '' episodes -- really bring up a subject in this series that had n't been fully fleshed out . Obviously , these two episodes allow the regular characters to come to grips with the loss of Kate -- the irony of Kate 's ghost talking to Ducky and Ducky not talking back to the ghost , the overall story of how the survivors all see Kate . McGee seeing a superwoman , Abby seeing Elvira , Tony being Tony in seeing Kate ( That schoolgirl outfit ) , and Gibbs seeing Kate as he last saw her -- with a hole between her eyes . Just as obviously , `` Kill Ari '' allows for the introduction of Cote De Pablo 's Ziva David , the Mossad/Masada agent liased to NCIS in the wake of Kate 's death and Lauren Holly 's Jenny Sheppard -- Gibbs ' former partner/lover who rose beyond working the field to the NCIS director 's job.But my observation after a couple of viewings of this box set is that the underlying story of the season is the revelations about the history of Leroy Jethro Gibbs . For much of the first two seasons , Mark Harmon 's `` tough , no-nonsense investigator '' ( To quote the liner notes on the set ) has always had an understated sense of humor that has allowed him to smile quitely at the office interaction between the members of the team while presenting his harder face . But that exterior begins to crack in the `` Kill Ari '' episodes ; the mystery surrounding Jethro 's background begins to unfold as Ari murders Kate , then takes his shot at Abby and captures Dr. Mallard . This is what starts leading Jethro to being close to Ziva -- maybe no one notices , but because of the information that she uncovered about Jethro and fed to her half-brother Ari , Officer David feels partially responsible for Kate 's murder.Through Season 3 , we start getting clues to who Jethro is and what he keeps from everyone -- the flask that we see at the end of `` Under Covers '' , his continued attraction towards redheads ( It certainly is no coincidence that Holly/Sheppard is a redhead ) , and the subtleties of his relationship with Ziva -- forged in an oddly shared tragedy . Of course , much of all that goes on in the season comes to a head in the `` Hiatus '' two-parter at the end of the season . We find out why Gibbs is what he is , how many of his actions have prepared DiNozzo for running the team and prepped Tim for being an agent ; and how the discoveries affect his relationship with Dr. Mallard and Director Sheppard.As always since this series started , the performances are stunning . Mark Harmon continues to embody the toughness and instincts of Jethro , but also had to be very nuanced as Gibbs ' painful history comes out.Michael Weatherly 's Tony DiNozzo continued being the second coming of David Addison ( my usual Moonlighting aside ) , but Tony had to face growing up and being a decision-maker/leader ( `` Bait '' ) , and had a difficulty through this season that he had n't had in the previous two -- ZIVA.Cote De Pablo flipped the dynamic of the team . As Ziva , Cote brought a much more formidable presence to the squad . In the first two seasons , Tony could get Kate off-balance with his remarks and his stunts , offending her Catholic schoolgirl sensibilities . In the third season , Ziva -- partially because of her background , partially because it was just HER -- was able to get Tony off his feed more than he thought possible . An example of this -- aside from her driving , or her mangling of slang -- came up in `` Probie '' , when she was able to get Tony to reveal why he was receiving calls from a sperm bank . De Pablo was able to affect a very cool and very canny customer in Ziva . Many viewers are always going to miss Sasha Alexander , but Cote is a wonderful fit.Sean Murray 's Tim McGee is still a wonderful work in progress ; the nerd-boy field agent who continues to get tortured by DiNozzo in a big-brother/little-brother fashion . He still seems over his head at times , eager to please Gibbs ( Or at least keep Jethro from popping him one in the back of the head -- is n't it funny how The Head Slap has become one of the show 's many trademarks ? ) . Plus , there 's whatever seems to be going on in his private life , whether or not it 's with Abby.Of course , what can be said about Pauley ? Perrette is a scene-stealing wonder on screen , especially in Abby 's lab when she 's mainlining the `` Kaff-Pow '' or getting Bert to do what he does ( Her stuffed hippo -- YEAH , THAT ONE ) . Plus , we get surprised by Abby 's ability with duct tape ( `` Frame Up '' ) and her temper in general ( `` Bloodbath '' ) .David McCallum 's Dr. Mallard continues to be the second coming of Jonathan Quayle Higgins , though not as prissy as Robin Masters ' major domo . Ducky continues to tell his stories while working his was through the cadavers . Plus , we get another visit from Nina Foch as Ducky 's mom late in the season , getting a surreal moment when she 's visiting the NCIS HQ.Many people thought the introduction of Jenny Sheppard as fluff . Given the underlying story of the season , Lauren Holly 's character was actually needed . Jenny became an insight to Gibbs ' relationship issues and why he stays operating as an investigator -- basically , she knows certain things about Jethro that his squad are n't privvy to -- though as it turns out , she does n't know the whole story ( Until `` Hiatus '' ) .The good guest shots in this set have to start with Sasha Alexander , and her completion of the Catlin Todd storyline . Her ghost appearing in various forms to the team members was striking ( Of course , her schoolgirl outfit in Tony 's vision was typical Tony ) . Rudolf Martin 's Ari Haswari was brilliant -- slick , dangerous , deceptive and unstable . I found myself regretting Ari 's storyline being completed -- he could have been Wo Fat to Gibbs ' McGarrett ( Hawaii Five-O reference ) . It 's always fun when Jessica Steen drops in to trade remarks with Weatherly as Paula Cassidy . Michael Bellisario 's turn as Abby 's lab assistant is a comical and dangerous turn . Finally , we ca n't forget Muse Watson 's introduction in the `` Hiatus '' episodes as Gibbs ' mentor when he joined NIS , Mike Franks . Franks ' amusement at the changes -- the female director in particular -- are tempered by his having to fill in many of the blanks for Gibbs when Jethro is recovering from amnesia.Ultimately , the season of change that is NCIS Season 3 is a storytelling wonder -- full of the humor and action that has been the staple of the series since it 's beginning , but also the undercurrent of melancholy that permeates this season . The loss of Kate really becomes the latest in a series of painful losses for Gibbs -- but we never realize it until the end of the season .	1
We love NCIS and all the seasons are great . Anyone who enjoys the characters will like this season . Beware of scenes in the autopsy room .	1
Season Three lacks the edge that the first two seasons had , but the characters remain complex and the plots , unpredictable -- except for the demands of the formula . Visually and auditorially effective .	1
It is Doctor Who ( Classic ) Season 1 what else is there to say ? If you are a true Doctor Who fan than you can not miss watching these classic , see all of its humble beginnings.Only thing we have seen that is a problem , is that there if several seasons missing , it would be nice to watch every Doctor Who up to date today .	1
This is a great example of the & # 34 ; Dr being stuck in ancient earth & # 34 ; theme that shows up over and over in the decades that follow . Other than the time travel there is not much science fiction here . It is very interesting to see the Dr interacting with his & # 34 ; crew & # 34 ; and how he is more like the captain of a ship rather than the more active character that he becomes over time . Probably the most interesting thing about this episode is how it shows the cultural mores of the 1960s . If you enjoy ancient TV this is a gem . If you are expecting anything like the modern Dr you probably want to skip ahead a couple decades .	1
I had always heard and read about Doctor Who 's & # 34 ; early years & # 34 ; , but had never watched . What a pleasant surprise . This enterprise has been a winner since the beginning . I 've got a lot of shows to watch ! !	1
My first Dr. Who was Tom Baker back in the 1980s . I watched every episode and even taped them to watch over and over . When many years later I found the early ones I laughed because they were so silly and the technology was hysterical , cardboard , plastic tape , logic errors , and then I realized that they were made in the 1960s and were made for children . Funny , I never thought of it as a children 's show . I was nearly 50 when I first watched and it grabbed me instantly ! So now I am over 80 and I still love it . Even these funny old ones . A truly wonderful show for any age .	1
I rated this a 4 star because the film was grainey . I suppose this is the best it could be after all of these years . What a treat you start learning about Dr. Who 's start	1
Season 12-16 are getting the same review . Tom Baker ( my dad 's favorite ) fits not only the role of the Doctor , but also time in Earth 'real time ' . The introduction of the sonic screwdriver , New companions which continue to defy the command 'stay here ! ! ' Short episodes make this a great binge . The cerebral side of the Doctor as well as 'the classic Dr.smile ' grow into the story line .	1
The Doctor is the longest running si fi on television and there is little dout as to why . It 's great .	1
The Ark in Space is a great story . It has everything you need for classic SciFi : aliens wrecking spaceships , teleporters , life and death decisions with the human race in the balance and of course the 4th doctor . It is all here ... unfortunately the rest of the season is missing from Amazon . Sigh ... .	1
Compared to today the special effects are comical , but that justs adds to the fun of watching these old shows	1
The older Dr. Who series always has a theatre quality to it . Tom Baker is the Doctor I grew up with , so it feels good to stop by and see these episodes again . This one features Romana , one of the better companions I feel ( though she was kind of forced on the Doctor ) .Generations today always want a female Time Lord ( ok by me ) , and well , there you go . Romana is a Time & # 34 ; Lady & # 34 ; . She 's as smart as the Doctor , but lacks the experience he has traveling the universe . She also seems to usually be very calm in a tight situation against his silly antics some times . They make a good pair.So if you ever wanted to see what a female Time Lord ( excuse me , Lady ) might be like , check out these episodes .	1
It is great filling in some of the blanks of what happened to that character or how did the doc meet this character ! it would be great if you would get more missing episodes .	1
In episode # 17 ( part 1 ) listen for a bonus at the 2:26 mark , give or take a second . That being said , Tom Baker 's Dr. was the best until the new 2005-present series . Historically in real time this is a 'post Star Wars ' timeline . Keeping to the look and feel of Dr. Who was getting lost as the 80 's progressed but this is still in the good phase of the show 's run .	1
The best and lonest running sifi on tv ever . I have been a fan since 1970s . I think my wife loves it more them myself .	1
enjoyed all episodes of season 16 I only hope it continues with 2014 ( season 56 ) cant wait for it to appear	1
The writing in this season is amazingly well done . As is the acting . The character actors playing the bad guys and the heroes accompanying the Doctor are top notch .	1
While some of the special effects are so old they detract from the story , Tomb of the Cybermen is still enjoyable to watch . Troughton as the doctor is great because he shows the snide humor that shines in later doctors . Sadly because so many of the oldest episodes are missing we do n't get the back story of the doctors companions but we do get to start to see some of the origins of the Cybermen mythos . This is great fun and a must for any fan of the doctor .	1
I have watched Dr. Who for years and enjoyed these early ones . The thing I liked the best about this Dr. Was the way he would get confused and say & # 34 ; Oh dear & # 34 ; all the time . He is very sweet , and I loved him just because he was Dr. Who . Since it was a children 's show , this might has had a lot of appeal to a child . for myself , I tend to forget it was started for children , and watch it avidly every time .	1
if you like Dr. Who it is well worth watching to see some of the history of the show . It really is too bad that they do n't have more of these classic episodes .	1
A great show about the Cybermen . The episode centers around the tomb of the cybermen and the old look of them is pretty cool . I only wish there were more episodes in the AMAZON library .	1
I appreciate technology and seeing the dreams fot the future . I will watch additional Extreme Engineering seasons . thank you for tne presentation .	1
I 've lived in Boston for many years and have driven on these roads since the day they opened . After ten years , this video is a very interesting look at the past , and the promises vs. the reality of what became of the Big Dig project.Ironically , or perhaps prophetically , the film begins by showing a section of new tunnel ( at time = 2:06 ) . This is the EXACT LOCATION where ( on July 10 , 2006 ) the ceiling collapsed on a car , killing passenger Milena Del Valle . The heavy concrete panels were glued in place with epoxy cement that had not been applied properly . It was ultimately determined that ceiling panels were n't actually needed in that location , so today , the ceiling that appears in the video is no longer there.Such was the theme for most of the Big Dig 's design and construction . Too many things were `` never attempted before '' , `` biggest in the world '' , `` cutting edge '' , and/or other custom-designed or unproven technologies . At the same time , the well-connected engineering and construction contractors deliberately made things more complicated and expensive than necessary , so as to maximize their own profits . One notorious example of this became known as the `` Ginzu Guardrails '' . Instead of using industry-standard round pipe hand rails in the tunnels , an engineering contractor ordered custom-designed stainless steel hand rails with sharp vertical edges . Besides being much more expensive , they earned the `` Ginzu '' moniker for their ability to slice through accident victims like a knife ! Today , many of the original hand rails have been destroyed in accidents and have not been replaced ; other sections have been deliberately removed because they are too dangerous . As was the case for the section of ceiling that collapsed , these hand rails were not really needed at all.Of course , it 's not all bad ; the I-90 extension to the airport has been a great improvement . The Ted Williams tunnel ( a.k.a . the Frozen Head tunnel ) was one of the first sections to open and the quality of construction is much better than all of the other tunnel sections that were built later . Unfortunately , most of the tunnels under Boston were built very poorly and most disturbingly of all , were not properly sealed to be watertight . In the winter , the leaking water forms huge icicles and ice patches that require application of large amounts of salt inside the tunnels . The large volume of water ; combined with the freeze-thaw cycles and corrosive salt effect ; was not something the tunnels were designed for . Consequently , the concrete and steel in the tunnels is deteriorating much more rapidly than expected . In another ill-advised design , the aluminum tunnel ceiling light fixtures were attached with steel brackets . Two dissimilar metals in a moist , corrosive environment are always doomed to corrode , and sure enough , in February 2011 the fixtures began falling into the roadway . ( they 're now temporarily held in place with plastic tie straps , but must all be replaced ) As if the initial construction cost was n't bad enough , the ongoing maintenance costs of the Big Dig will only get worse as the shoddily constructed sections continue to fall apart.I could go on and on about so many other things , but the bottom line is that the cost of the Big Dig was way more expensive than expected and way more expensive than necessary . So much money was spent on this one project , that there was nothing left for other highway projects in Massachusetts , or for the mass transit projects that were initially promised as mitigation for the environmental effects . For most drivers in Boston , the traffic is just as bad if not worse , but instead of being stuck in traffic on Boston 's old elevated Central Artery where at least you had a nice view , now you 're stuck in traffic in ugly , filthy , crumbling tunnels.The film ends with another ironic quote at time = 33:03 - `` Nobody in five years or ten years is gon na remember the cost , they 're gon na look at this thing and say : 'what a beautiful job ' `` .It would be laughable , if it were n't so very sad.Note for road geeks : Time = 24:05 has a very old aerial view of the Charles River crossing , showing the original elevated ramps that connected the Upper/Lower deck to the Tobin Bridge . Time = 24:42 shows the City Square tunnel under construction in Charlestown , before the loop ramps and Leverett Connector bridge were built .	1
Some are better than others but overall I enjoyed these . In many cases I was surprised at the enormity of effort , design , and equipment required to do these big jobs .	1
Love to see where men build and keep striving for better . It 's nice to live in a day when things naturally progress .	1
It would have been much better if the program shows the specific details they are talking about , instead show the faces of the people speaking about the project.This is a TV show , not a radio .	1
Not the best show ever made but you do learn . I would love more in depth info but I do understand there is only so much that a show can divulge . But I will say you will learn a lot and some episodes are done very well others not so well . But hey give it a shot you may have an engineer in you waiting to get out .	1
The series is in the older square video version . Made for the older TV types , but it 's still a great series . Inspirational and mind boggling . Some of the amazing things they come up with are absolutely incredible .	1
These guys are great and they have a fantastic team . There have been a couple of knock-off shows that were n't even in the same galaxy as the Mythbusters . I would give 7 stars if I could ! !	1
I 've been a Mythbusters fan for a long time and while I 'm still not used to the US narrator ( coming from the UK where it is narrated by a Brit ) I made my way through all the Mythbusters series again on Amazon Prime.The show takes us through those things we always thought we knew about but often did n't . Watching the whole seasons through , it is obvious that while Adam and Jamie were younger in this season they were also a lot angrier at each other . Perhaps they learned each others quirks as the seasons progressed but it is interesting to go back to the early days . You can also view how the budget for the show started increasing over time as their initial experiments were low cost and generally done near the shop , now they have massive explosions in man made lakes and mining quarrys.I recommend this show to my friends and it is often discussed in the work place . Everyone with an interest in science , explosions and humour should be watching this show .	1
Interesting and kind of educational . Though the filming is n't the best possible at all times , this is a great show for those of us who wonder about what 's true and what 's not . I highly recommend for everyone who 's curious , and those who like scientific explanations for things .	1
These guys are a little bit crazy . It is a fun series to watch . You never know what they are going to do .	1
I 've always enjoyed Mythbusters . Glad this show has gone as long as it has because I can always pull up an episode and be entertained even though I 've seen most of them before .	1
Probably the best children 's show since Mr. Rogers Neighborhood . I wish they 'd kept it going . This show has not one moment of anything I ever worry about my children watching . It 's wholesome , educational , and actually interesting ( lots of kids shows fail hard on that last one ) . My favorite thing is that unlike Dora the Explorer or Diego , no one *ever* encourages the audience to be loud . Also , while they do & # 34 ; play Blue 's Clues & # 34 ; in every episode , the shows are not all the same . The structure changes slightly each time , which is fantastic . To get what I mean by that , try watching an episode of the exceedingly vapid Animal Mechanicals for a comparison ... it 's painful .	1
My 2 1/2 yr old granddaughter who is only allowed limited TV time , is quite the connoisseur of children 's shows . Blues Clues is one of her favorites , and explains to me what is going on , and which host is on the show ( apparently Steve went away to college ) .	1
This is great for my grandchildren . As an educator I know how important it is to encourage children to think and problem solve . That is exactly what this show does . My 22 month old twin grandchildren love it and it is the only show they are allowed to watch .	1
My grandbaby loved this show very much . She still looks for spots all over the place . She was mezmarized totaly .	1
Really ? have you ever met a kid who did n't like watching this show whether with joe now or steve in the past ?	1
Blue 's Clues has been around for well over a decade , but this 90 's gem still shines in contemporary times with content that rivals any other children 's programming today . Educational and at a level that is attractive to a wide range of ages , Blue 's Clues is a staple for educational / enjoyable children 's shows .	1
Granddaughter , age 5 , ca n't get enough of Blues Clues Season 1 . I must say tho that when she viewed later seasons that changed Steve 's role to another guy , she did n't like it . So she watches the seasons with the original Steve over and over .	1
So glad Blues Clues is on Amazon Prime ! ! My kids love it : ) Thank you so much Amazon ! Just wish y'all had other shows , like Little House On The Prairie , and all os the seasons of Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman .	1
I love this program . The kids get so involved in the entire show . I really chuckle as the little ones really think they can be interactive .	1
My 3-year-old son likes Blue . His attention span is still pretty short , so he does n't usually make it through an entire episode . But , he repeats & # 34 ; a clue ! a clue ! & # 34 ; often throughout the day .	1
Good , clean , moral show . Teaches them a lot and not just wasting time watching useless junk . Good for kids and fun for adults too	1
I 'm not crazy about my son watching TV , but I make an exception for Blue 's Clues . It is very sweet and my son loves it .	1
Very instructional and cute . Both my 7 year old and 1 1/2 year old love the show ! More seasons for Prime members to stream ! !	1
My daughter ( 5 ) really enjoys this show . It 's colorful and interactive . She gets to help Blue ( the dog ) solve problems .	1
Such fun and so educational . Perfect show for toddler . I love to watch the learning . Highly suggest this show for supplemental learning .	1
Awesome tv series . My son loves blue clues . Wish it was on more often . He likes then one where Blue talks in the videos too	1
My grandson ask to watches this all the time . He is a big fan of this show . The streaming is excellent so the picture quality and sound is clear .	1
My 2 and 3 year old grandsons love Blue 's Clues . I bought Season 1 and downloaded it to my Kindle Fire . They like to sit in Nana 's lap and watch Blue and Steve ... .and it gives Nana a good excuse to hold and rock the boys .	1
Steve is a genius with children -- he really knows how to elicit their feedback and engagement with the story , and it never feels like he is above his audience . And it is not too jarring or obnoxious like some children 's shows can be .	1
There are a lot of kids ' shows that are super , super annoying . This one is cheesy , but it is sweet , and I especially love Steve . I love how this show teaches kids about deduction and gives them the chance to solve mysteries .	1
i grew up watching blues clues and now my daughter can enjoy the great music and teachings from fun blue	1
This is a great edicational show . My kids have watched the entire run of blues clues . They love to watch blue and Steve	1
My children love this show . I will give a great example from my four year old from last week . We come to a stop sign and she reads S T O P and says that spells stop . We were really impressed , we have been working on letters for quite a while now , but she could comprehend stop means stop . We asked her if she learned it in K-3 . She said no she learned it on blues clues . Just a side note I know some people are going to read this and say . Well if he did n't have his kid in day care they would be smart ... or something of that ilk . Our children are in a small Christian school and they did n't have enough teachers so my wife became a full time volunteer to help the kids . I 'm not a fan of preschool , I do not sit in judgment of those who do . It 's just a personal choice for us . Back to the show my children have learned so much from this show . hope this helps .	1
Our two year old loves watching Dora . If your kid loves shows like Bubble Guppies , Backyardigans , Umizoomies then this show is probably right for you .	1
Well if my two year old had a say she would give it ten stars . I think the show has gotten better since it 's introduction . I do n't mind her watching it at all and the fact that she surprised me by counting to 5 in Spanish says a lot .	1
What is bad about Dora . Not one thing . This is my grand children 's all time favorite . The first thing out of their mouths are & # 34 ; I need Dora & # 34 ; . Recommend to anyone	1
I enjoyed watching Dora and Boots and the Gang with my Granddaughter on Saturday morning . The plot lines are simple and easy for her to understand , ( she is a preschooler ) , and she was really engaged . She loved being a part of the story when Dora asked her to participate . She was so involved in what was going on . We had a lot of fun , and we will enjoy watching it again very soon . We love Dora ! ! ! !	1
I like Dora . Both my kids like to watch this show . The music and lessons taught are very helpful . All the interaction with other characters are great and telling Swiper to stop swipping is hilarious , Love all seasons of Dora .	1
We purchased this season for our daughter who loves Dora using the Amazon Instant Video app for Wii . We have no issues with play or image etc.Unfortunately , my husband and I can not stand Dora . She sets our teeth on edge . But our daughter loves Dora so we put up with the show . I do n't feel that my daughter has gotten much educational value from Dora , to be perfectly honest . She 's learned more from Ni Hao Kai-lan , Yo Gabba Gabba , Little Einsteins , and Team Umizoomi . I only took off one star for this since Dora is entertaining for toddlers ( admittedly the target audience , not parents ) and for some reason kids love her .	1
The colors are bright and cheerful . Great story lines.kkeps a child 's attention while teaching them life lessons.My grand child really learns a lot from this show	1
My 18m/o loves this show it teachers her friendship , Spanish , and how to solve problems . It is age appropriate too .	1
The little short videos is just right for her . It helps her learn to count and limited Spanish as well as sequencing . Very helpful for learning to read .	1
My 2 year old grand daughter loves Dora and all her friends ! It 's a very positive toddler/kids show . It 's also educational , fun and entertaining .	1
My 4 yr old loves Dora and always enjoys going on adventures . She also like to speak other languages and thinks it is so cool .	1
Entertaining and informative for the young minds . Granddaughter already is counting to 10 in Spanish and has picked up several words ( colors ) . She is only 2 .	1
my child loves it . It is the ABC animal episode . We do n't generally like Dora but this specific episode is really cute and keeps my little guys attention .	1
The grandkids really love Dora the Explorer and is a very good way to learn beginning Spanish a language that they will probably need later on in life .	1
I believe it 's a very positive show , she can learn both languages , English and Spanish and also , about friendship ! Is n't that awesome . Only three seasons are on prime but its really worth the cost .	1
dora teaches problem solving , spanish , manners and fairness . my son loves this show , as most kids do , but i feel good letting my son watch this show , because he always comes away learning something and the show is very interactive , it prompts kids to talk back to the tv and answer questions and solves problems .	1
My two-year old daughter LOVES this show.It 's interactive : it engages the viewer to repeat a set of instructions , dance , and shout at Dora 's nemesis , Swiper , `` Swiper , no swiping ! '' The cast includes Dora , Boots ( her sidekick ) , the Map ( it gives directions to help Dora on her journey ) , the Backpack ( provides a toolkit to resolve any issues ) , and Swiper the Fox.The show is also educational because it teaches viewers a Spanish word or two during the show . Think Spanish 101 . In fact , some people I know brush up on their Spanish by watching a few episodes before taking a Spanish quiz in class ( yes , Dora 's pretty thorough ) .The storylines are predictable , yet they are always entertaining to my two-year old . Not a day goes by where she is n't yelling at the TV , `` Swiper , no swiping ! ''	1
My son loves this show . He is always asking `` more Dora more Dora '' I like how the show will pick up where u last left off	1
No matter what episode it is , my son has been hooked on this cartoon since he was a little baby ... he 's learn alot of words and general knowledge watching this ...	1
Age appropriate cartoon packed with learning for my little ones . great job with the show options amazon prime . well done	1
I love the ease to remember songs for my kids , and that it helps them work on their memory . It 's got rally cute characters too . I so like that it teaches Spanish too	1
I am a nanny an the little girl love this show . Every time we go shopping she screams backpack ( what she calls Dora ) when she see it .	1
My kids enjoy this show . I like that it 's got some educational value and is n't annoying for me to watch with them .	1
My girls ages 3 and 4 absolutely love Dora and they enjoy these episodes from season 2 . They stream easily on the Roku .	1
I have two young children and we love almost everything Dora ! The shows always have some element of learning , My girls have actually recognized Spanish words in books now that they have heard Dora speak them .	1
My grandson LOVES Dora the Explorer and he learns a bit of Spanish too which really is n't the goal of watching this program .	1
Both my sons love watching Dora . The language is appropriate for 3-5 year old kids and boots is an awesome addition to the characters .	1
My kids love to interact with Dora . Both my one year old and 3 year old learn with this show .	1
This video downloaded ok . It did have to buffer it once but I 'm not sure if it was my iPad or what but it did great after that , had no problems and I would recommend this video to anyone with little kids !	1
My granddaughter just ca n't get enough of Dora . Two years old and it 's perfect for her..she is learning a little bit of spanish , and the stories are a wonderful learning tool .	1
Who does n't love Dora ? My three-yr old granddaughter is being expertly prepped for K-2 . Just as my previous four grandkids . The vocal response to Dora 's questions say it all . Five stars , Dora , five stars	1
My grandsons love Dora . I find myself watching right along with them and learning new words . If you have a preschooler please try Dora . She is fun and entertaining .	1
Great show for young kids . My thee year old son loves Dora & Diego . Educational & entertaining for kids & will make them want to sing .	1
Two year old likes it , but it is very hard for an adult to watch more than one or two episodes without pulling their hair out .	1
Educational and entertaining to the grandkids . Would recommend for anyone with preschoolers . Hope to see more seasons in the future !	1
Good clean and colorful fun for a four old . I can always be sure that she will be entertained as she learns about the world she lives in	1
On our third round of Dora with our youngest and it is still great . Going to miss it when they are too old to watch . : ( The blend of math , patterns , comprehension and problem solving is so key to development at the young ages . Dora is great .	1
The quality is as good as can be expected from a 10-year-old cartoon , but it plays smoothly . One odd complaint -- the Nickelodeon & # 34 ; intro & # 34 ; is MUCH louder than the rest of the cartoon for some reason , and that 's consistently true across all of the Dora and Diego cartoons . When watching you may want to adjust the volume down ( or mute ) until the intro is done to save your TV speakers and possibly your ears . The cartoon itself is cute and well-structured for younger children , that eventually understand what Dora is asking for and the order in which things happen on the show . My 2-year-old girl loves it and would watch an entire season straight through if I 'd let her . It 's the first cartoon like this to really capture her attention for an entire episode so that alone makes it worth the recommendation for younger children .	1
She 's so enthusiastic and has great adventures ! Our son and daughter both love Dora shows ! They 're great enthusiastic fun and the kids learn a little too .	1
My granddaughters , ages 5 and 3 , can not get enough of Dora . They ask to watch it every time they visit . We love it because this show teaches the girls so much . Would highly recommend this to all !	1
My two year old loves this show . I personally find it kind of annoying , but it was n't made for adults , was it ?	1
This series was always dependable . It always resolved itself satisfactorily . The characters were sensible , disciplined , and willing to have fun .	1
If you 've never seen the franchise get the movie starring Kurt Russell first.Then get all 10 seasons ( there is a boxed set of all 10 ) .Nuff said ! ! !	1
SG1 is everything a show should be , intelligent , funny , attractive- this is sci fi that deserves to stick around for a long time .	1
I found it to be an enjoyable series though the recognizable science was a bit thin . Towards the end it seemed to me the writers had explored pretty much what could be done in the premise of the show . It was a good idea to stop when they did . If you like science fiction , I think you will like this one .	1
Oh the finale ! ! Did you get the feels ? I did . Man I cried once ( on the inside ) when I re-watched the most memorable of episodes . Ahh ! Why did you have to leave us ! !	1
A great show that will make you laugh , cry and cheer . Fantastic acting and loveable characters . What more do you need in a show .	1
I 'll admit , this is not one of my favorite episodes . This episode was not great , but it was okay . It gave you a bit of a background look into Valla and her family . The showing of Vala 's father in this was very nice , as we do n't know much about her , besides her being a thief before . Also , this was a good opportunity to see Landry and his family a little closer . However , the funniest and most favorite part of mine will always be the ending . Probably one of the funniest scenes in the SG-1 series . I feel so sorry for Teal'c . Good episode .	1
Stargate SG-1is one of those shows that the good guys win most of the time.Lots of action , Lots of humor if you pay attention.I would recommend to most anyone how wants Sifi , action or adventure	1
what an episode . its episodes like this that make me realize that SG-1 isthe best scifi ever . I hope all feel the same !	1
Good cast , good stories . Well directed and well-written . And of course Richard Dean Anderson is always good even if this role is definitely different than his more famous one Angus MacGyver .	1
Always buy this series , and am sorry that it is , as a weekly show , ending.Therefore it is good to be able to have the last season ( I have all the others ) as it is one of the best in the field - science fiction - apart from old faithful Star Trek . Always miss Richard Dean Anderson , that wry and handsome wit , but Shanks and Browder , let alone Claudia Black , what a terrific actor ! more than make up for his loss . I always wish more of Amanda Tapping 's abilities apart from sheer mathematics that she is forced by plot to come out with at least four or five times per episode could be utilized in more interesting directions , but she is the greatest also . Look forward to her in Stargate Atlantis.Stargate SG-1 season 10 is a worthy product and has been added to my collection with great satisfaction.Linda Sheean	1
This show is fantastic ! I love how they wind ancient culture and Myths into futuristic events ! It 's a lot of fun to watch , especially if you 're into ancient myths and such .	1
IT WAS RELLY GOOD I LOVED IT , WAS FUNNY AND PLENTY OF ACTION & # 62 ; I WOULD WATCH IT Again Just Enjoy	1
Stargate was a good movie and an even better series . Very imaginative and well acted . Recently , I rewatched the series and enjoyed it very much .	1
Love the characters and seeing them as they develop over time . Very fun show . Episode 200 is awesome . Love it	1
While the writers gave us a new enemy in the Ori it also felt a little redundant to do so somewhat since they already were notified that the series would end here . It felt like the writers were hoping that the backers and producers would renew the series for this new saga but after ten years it was time to give the series a decent finale and while you do get the finale it felt a little weak for what the series was.If you already have the other past seasons and for the price of this set I 'd say go ahead and add it to your t.v . show collection while not on par with the past eight seasons it still has for the most part an intriguing story and cast to make you watch the season through to the end .	1
Warning ! Many spoilers ! Additional Warning : Thanks to Canadian and British television , the final episodes of STARGATE SG-1 have already been shown through much of the world . The following review is based on having seen everything including the series finale.And so after an amazing ten year run , STARGATE SG-1 comes to a dignified end . Sorta . Plans for a couple of TV movies are already in the works , so the plot ends that are left somewhat open at the end of the series will probably be resolved at that time . It is hard at this point to know what the show 's legacy will be . It never received the critical acclaim that series like FARSCAPE , BATTLESTAR GALACTICA , FIREFLY , or even BABYLON 5 received , and one ca n't point to specific ways that it has altered or molded other Sci-Fi series , but simply being around for a decade is unprecedented in Sci-fi . Yeah , DR. WHO has been around longer , but its presence has been far more episodic and it has sometimes been prey to a budget smaller than a kids ' show ( though certainly this is not the case for its present incarnation ) . It certainly did a number of things right . The writing remained strong throughout . The production values were strong from beginning to end . And if it never scaled the peaks of brilliance of other series it still managed to produce many memorable moments . Perhaps its legacy is something to be set aside for a decade or so.What is amazing is that the tenth season was a largely successful effort at self-recreation . Season Nine had been plagued by pregnancy . Both Amanda Tapping and Claudia Black ( and some of the outfits Ms. Black wore in Season Ten reveal that she has fully recovered from having given birth -- the highlight of Season Ten might have been the outfit she wore in the high school reunion episode from near the end of the season ) had children during that season . I 'm a huge fan of kids and having babies , but it does n't mesh well with making TV shows . Tapping was missing for the early part of the season and Black for most of the middle . Both were present for the entirety of Season Ten . Black 's real life pregnancy fed into the plot of Season Ten , with her giving birth to a mystical child who became the super-empowered leader of the Ori . Adria ( played by Monica Baccarin , Inara from FIREFLY ) grew into a full-grown woman with overwhelming powers in a matter of weeks . Throughout the season SG-1 has to struggle against their most powerful foe yet , who nonetheless harbors affection towards her mother , hoping to convert her to a belief in the Ori.What makes Season Ten work for me above all else is Claudia Black as Vala . Although I have long been a fan of the show , I 've long felt that there was a central problem in the core cast . Though Richard Dean Anderson 's Jack O'Neill was ever the wise cracker , there was a lack of genuine humor at the core of the show and despite the implied attraction between O'Neill and Samantha Carter , no real romantic chemistry . But Vala is really , truly funny and a real sex post as well . And it was brilliant to team her with the wound-too-tight Daniel Jackson rather than Col. Mitchell ( which would have been expected , since Black and Ben Browder portrayed what was perhaps THE great romantic couple in all of TV Sci-fi , Aeryn Sun and John Crichton on FARSCAPE ) . Vala and Jackson are great together , with the unconventional and free-spirited Vala both appealing to and threatening the Boy Scout Jackson . As a huge fan of Claudia Black 's Aeryn Sun , who was a stern and serious character , it was delightful seeing her be such a goofball on this show . All in all , her character brought a bit of anarchism that was frequently lacking on the show . If I have a regret with the series coming to an end , it is in not knowing what happens to her next . In one of the most endearing touches of the season , the Stargate program only very gradually decides to allow Vala to become a part of the SG-1 team . The season 's opening credits start off with the main four marching through the gate , but the week after she is allowed to join , just as the four start to walk through , Vala scampers up to join them.The main plot for the final season focused on the ongoing struggle against the Ori , a group of ultra religious fanatics . With religious fundamentalism dominating both domestic and international news , with both Christian fundamentalists in the US trying to force public opinion to conform with their beliefs and Islamic fundamentalists trying to force the rest of Islam to conform with their violent and intolerant readings of the Koran ( readings that the vast majority of Muslims do not agree with ) , nothing could be more relevant than intolerant religious zealots who are willing to kill those who do not agree with them.There were some significant farewells in Season Ten . Samantha 's father , who had seen his life extended several years by accepting a symbiote and becoming a member of the Tok'ra , finally did die . And not only Thor , but also the entirety of the Asgard died as well.Although STARGATE SG-1 was noted for its huge , epic , cliffhanging finales , the series finale was surprisingly subdued and quiet . But also , I thought , remarkably appropriate . I 'm sure there was the temptation of a `` Big Ending , '' but instead they decided to focus instead on a relatively unspectacular , intimate episode in which time is essentially frozen for a few decades . The main five simply spend some time together , while Vala and Daniel actually live a life of romantic bliss . Typically , they manage a brilliant scientific solution to their dilemma at the end , with only Teal'c retaining any memory of the preceding decades . As the show ends he smiles bemusedly as Vala and Daniel fall into their bickering ways . But we know the potential that remains.So , a classic series comes to an end . It was n't the best Sci-fi series ever . It was n't the most ground breaking . And it is n't likely to be one of the more influential . But it was the longest running uninterrupted Sci-fi series in the history of Sci-fi and introduced us to a host of memorable characters . Yeah , it had some unpleasant quirks . It used `` Science as Magic '' to such a degree that it almost became a parody of itself . It reused plots endlessly . I mean , just how many alternate universe episodes did we really need ? And how many times were there multiple copies of the same character ? ( I suspect that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA 's refusal to use the same plot device twice or to EVER employ science in magical fashion owes a great deal to the abuse of both by SG-1 . ) Still , the show took us to a host of wonderful places , introduced us to some wonderful enemies , and continually managed to entertain and delight . And we got to know the core group of characters quite well . Not many shows get ten seasons ; even fewer manage ten seasons so well . The show was starting to seem a bit old by the end , but it managed to do what almost no series ever gets to do : last ten years and still have something left in the tank at the end .	1
This is a spin off from the movie Star Gate with Kurt Russell and James Spader . The series starts up where the movie left off.The shows were well written , and the acting was good.Of course Richard Dean Anderson gave the show its ' sense of humor . Give the show a try . Based on science fiction it was the cast that gave Stargate SG 1 a 10 year run on TV .	1
In case you are n't familiar with the show , this is the final season DVD set.It 's a TV show that lasted 10 seasons and gave the viewers a realistic world of science fiction that often made you think if it 's really fiction.Imagine finding an ancient artifact that allows you to travel light years away to another planet and explore the unknown . What you discover is fascinating , exciting and dangerous ; We are not alone and we are not as advanced species as we once thought.I 've been a Stargate SG-1 fan since the beginning.This DVD will complete my collection as I already seen all the episodes . This is for my personal archive of what I consider the best Science Fiction show.I have been a long time fan of Science Fiction . I watched various Star Trek Series , Space 1999 , The Avengers , Doctor Who , just to name very few.I loved them all for what they gave me ; a momentary escapism . They all have given me a place where I can immerse myself and enjoy the wonder of another place and time.Then came the Stargate SG-1 . I 'm sure many will argue what is the most influential SciFi of all times . But if you ask me what show gave me the most satisfying and lasting impression as the best SciFi , it 's Stargate SG-1.I have to thank the writers and the chemistry of actors who made it the most enjoyable show .	1
The 200th episode was pretty dumb , and there were too many episodes that got away from the ongoing theme ( the Ori ) , but it was still pretty good , especially for 10 seasons . Glad they could wrap up the Ori in the follow-on The Arc of Truth movie . Stargate Atlantis is still the best of all of these Stargate shows .	1
Stargate went ten seasons , this alone should tell you how good the show was . The military man , the alien warrior , the nerd and the sexy scientist . Get it them all and you will have entertainment for some time to come .	1
This series is very adventure filled . Not only that but we love the concept of being able to travel to other worlds through a star gate worm hole . How awesome it that ! in just seconds you 're there . We watched several episodes a night and could n't wait til the next time we were able to watch . It was fun to see what the team was up to next and what lie ahead on the next planet . You definitely wo n't be bored with this series .	1
and everything in between during the 10th season of `` Stargate : SG-1 '' . By the way , this IS N'T the end of SG-1 as two direct-to-video TV movies are due in 2008 with stand alone storylines . During the 10th season we get to see the resolution of the conflict between the alliance and the Ori , the end of the Asgardians and the continuing blossoming romance between Dr. Daniel Jackson ( Michael Shanks ) and Vala ( Claudia Black ) . The show went through a lot of change during the last three seasons as storylines were wrapped up , new storyarcs developed and new characters such as Lt . Colonel Cameron Mitchell ( Ben Browder well known to sci-fi fans from `` Farscape '' ) and Vala ( Claudia Black anther `` Farscape '' alum ) providing the show with an additional injection of energy . Beau Bridges came on board adding spark to the show as well . Richard Dean Anderson is missed during the 10th and final season but his spirit is kept very much alive by Browder and Black in their roles . Michael Shanks , Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge proved to the the strongest link in the chain between the old Stargate and new.The story arc episodes are among the best while some of the stand alone episodes are ( with the exception of a few ) probably the weakest of the 10th season seeming like filler at times . The stand-alone episodes may or may not appeal to you like those on `` The X-Files '' and `` Farscape '' these episodes stand or fall based on the strength of the plotting and how realistic the wrap up is within 45 minutes . Some episodes as a result are better than others with some abrupt resolutions using the old ex deus machina ( represented as help from Stargate Command or other sources sometimes unexpected ) where more time could have been devoted to the story expanding it over more than one episode . As a long time `` Farscape '' fan I was happy to tag along after the cast changes and found that if you gave the final two seasons a chance , they were extremely good at the best of times.The show experienced a lot of change during the last three seasons which would make one expect them to be lesser seasons than the previous 7 . Nothing could be further from the truth . The new characters were perfect additions to the show adding after the departure of Richard Dean Anderson as Colonel Jack O'Neil . The addition of Beau Bridges as Major General Hank Landry to replace long time cast member Don Davis ( Davis ' character was promoted and he appeared in a couple of episodes during season nine ) who played Major General George Hammond and various guest stars ( Fred Willard , Robert Picardo a regular on `` Star Trek : Voyager '' started appearing in season 9 ) helped spruce up the last season of the show . It also helped that the Ori story arc was nicely resolved during the last season as well.The show looks pretty good but there are some digital artifacts evident in the transfers . Most of you wo n't notice them or care but for those that do keep in mind the amount of information packed on each disc . The 10th season has been packaged in the slimline packaging that was rolled out with season 8 . I 'm sure these will show up on Blu-Ray but the show looks fine here and is well priced.The DVD has commentary tracks for every episode except one ( and I suspect that was probably an accident as one episode has TWO commentary tracks . They probably scheduled the wrong episode for the second commentary track ) , deleted scenes , featurettes in the Director 's Series focusing on 1 director for 1 episode of each disc . We also got the usual assortment of photo and production galleries included as well . There is a trailer that for the first of the two Stargate direct-to-video movies `` Stargate SG-1 : The Ark of Truth '' ( the second one also coming in 2008 is `` Stargate SG-1 : Continuum '' involving time travel and reportedly will feature Richard Dean Anderson ) .The 10th season varies but overall it 's a good one that SG-1 fans will enjoy .	1
I was very pleased to find this on Criterion 's pre-release list , but not surprised - it 's just the sort of little-known cinematic gem that Criterion does wonders with . In fact , I 've been looking for a copy of this for some time , having first seen Eddie Coyle years and years ago , the memory of the film 's stark realism and mood etched in my mind like few others . This is definitive 70 's Noir and a title fully worthy of a pull-out-all-the-stops release that Criterion consistently provides . What a fine addition to the Criterion title catalogue , the choice reflecting - as usual - an impeccable sense of film history on the part of Criterion 's staff .	1
`` Eddie does n't rob banks ... He 's about this high in the bunch but he gets around more than any man I 've ever seen , '' says Dave Foley ( Richard Jordan ) , a baby-faced Boston cop about as amoral as the wiseguys he hunts . Eddie Coyle ( Robert Mitchum ) is a worn out , two-bit gunrunner . He provides untraceable revolvers when required . He draws the line at machine guns . Eddie is honorable in his way . He loves his family . He 's just a low life who is n't all that shrewd . The fix he 's in , because he ca n't take any more jail time , is what this superb Peter Yates ' movie is all about. '' Look . I 'm gettin ' old , y'hear ? '' Eddie tells a young hood who deals in machine guns . `` I spend most of my life hangin ' around crummy joints with the punks drinkin ' the beer , eatin ' the hash an ' hot dogs and watchin ' the other people go off to Florida while I 'm sweatin ' how I 'm goin ' to pay the plumber . I done time when I stood up but I ca n't take no more chances . Next time it 's goin ' to be me goin ' to Florida . '' Now he 's facing more prison time for foolishly agreeing to drive a getaway car when he should have asked his friends some questions . He 'll do just about anything to cut a deal for no jail time . He 's nearly 50 . He does n't want his wife to go on welfare , does n't want his three kids made fun of because their old man is doing time . He 's squeezed by Dave Foley to inform ... and Eddie decides he 'll rat a little . He 's too believing to understand he might be tagged for ratting big time . It 's all betrayal , but Eddie does n't really understand betrayal . All those friends of Eddie 's make us wary every time we meet them : Scalise ( Alex Rocco ) , who robs banks , sometimes violently ; Jackie ( Steve Keats ) , the dangerous dealer in stolen machine guns ; Dillon ( Peter Boyle ) , owner of a low-life bar who knows more about things than Eddie does.The movie looks as hopeless as the Boston weather . It 's the cold end of fall , filled with drab , chill days where parking lot asphalt is always wet . We 're into Eddie 's life in the low lane , where the anchors in the crummy strip malls are a tired Woolworth 's and Barbo 's Furniture Store . It 's a lousy life and it belongs to Eddie Coyle . `` Have a nice day . `` Director Peter Yates sets up scenes -- an exchange of machine guns , a bank robbery , a family held hostage , a stakeout in a commuter train lot , a night on the town -- that are so naturally established that we might miss how skillfully they build the story and show us Eddie 's life . We 're never sure if things are as hopeless for Eddie as they seem . Yates keeps us on edge , and he adds layers of Eddie Coyle 's sad and foolish trust.This is one of Robert Mitchum 's best performances . Mitchum still looks like he might be a tough guy , but his Eddie Coyle is a man who has had the force of his life wrung out of him . He 's been in the life forever . He does the jobs others ask him to . He does n't ask very many questions . He 's just not smart enough . Mitchum takes all the hard edges off his usual persona and gives us an aging loser whose life is on the skids , and who does n't understand just how badly off he is.The Criterion release looks just fine . There is a commentary by Peter Yates .	1
This film was a minor letdown after reading all the five star reviews . There 's nothing intrinsically wrong with the film . My theory is that after years of being out of circulation it 's reputation exceeds it 's actual artistic worth . Everything here is aces , though . Good direction , atmosphere and writing . The acting is superb with the stolid Robert Mitchum leading the cast . I particularly liked Steven Keats ' gundealer and Richard Jordan 's duplicitous fed . I think we 've been spoiled by the high quality of films in this genre with Sidney Lumet 's `` Prince of the City '' and Martin Scorsese 's `` The Departed '' . Recommended without reservation but not as enthusiastically as some .	1
An essay by David Mamet turned me on to George V. Higgins , and , completest that I am , I devoured all his novels . He is the smartest dialogue writer I have ever read . Last year 's & # 34 ; Killing Them Softly & # 34 ; got the wit , zing , and poetry just right , and the delivery by Brad Pitt and James Gandolfini was amazing.Robert Mitchum is more realistic in his approach , so , while the dialogue is not delivered with the great timing of Pitt and Gandolfini , his physical presence is completely believable as the low-level mobster , Eddie Coyle.Otherwise , kind of plodding .	1
this is one of those individualistic and remarkable films that for some reason has slipped under or past the usual critical and viewer recommendations -- hat tip to a.o . scott for highlighting it as a critic 's choice in the new york times . `` friends of eddie coyle '' is in that peculiar variant of film noir where `` good and evil '' have been entirely extracted from the narrative dynamic , leaving only the tactical calculations of characters swimming a turbulent world of existentialist gray . it only gradually becomes clear that some of these low lifes are thieves , some are gun runners , and some are cops , or how exactly the thieves and gun runners are connected , or that acquaintances are hit men , and hit men will , for a price , take down even those they invite to enjoy a hockey game . the narrative shifts back and forth between set piece bank robberies or gun purchases and one on one conversations in which the protagonists alternately manipulate , flatter , wheedle , bluff , coerce or inform on one another -- all filmed in a flat , clinical , procedural style strongly reminiscent jean-pierre melville 's `` army of shadows '' ( 1969 ) . the whole is knit together by the fate of eddie coyle , embodied by robert mitchum in an unsentimental but nuanced performance , who attempts to balance the demands of treasury cops ( who might help him in a forthcoming sentencing for smuggling liquor ) and the needs of armed criminals ( who provide eddie 's livelihood ) . the film is a grim and tragic examination of human beings who must negotiate trust and threat as part of their daily survival , and where the winners are those who can do the most reliable service for `` the man '' ( or for `` uncle '' ) ; the weak are those who only have the weak to rely on .	1
Mitchum is always spell binding & he is again . As a kid `` Thunder Road '' became part of my psyche ( saw at a drive-in ) . The song - I will remember to my grave . Keely Smith as his girl friend could n't have been more seductive or more in love w/her moonshine runner . Mitchum always managed to be in trouble no matter which side of the law he was on . His classic detective films are hard to find - `` The Big Sleep '' & `` Farewell My Lovely '' . AGAIN why do most reviewers blab it all ? Paragraphs & paragraphs & paragraphs telling one about a film ... ever so boring . Me thinks these folks have too much time on their hands . I digress ... this film is certainly worth watching . Impossible to notice other actors - Mitchum w/his sleepy eyes & conspicuous laid back attitude could charm the fur off a pussy cat ...	1
Though often dismissed by critics as `` walking through '' his roles , Robert Mitchum ) was perhaps Hollywood 's most underrated actor . True , many of his films were not worthy of his talent , but when he did get a good script ( e.g . THE NIGHT OF THE HUNTER , HEAVEN KNOWS MR. ALLISON , CAPE FEAR ) , his performance was always mesmerizing.Arguably , Mitchum 's finest screen performance can be found in THE FRIENDS OF EDDIE COYLE ( 1973 ) , now available on DVD from The Criterion Collection.Directed by Peter Yates , who supplies audio commentary on the disc , the film is set in Boston and casts Mitchum as a small-time felon , a family man facing a 2-5 year sentence on a smuggling conviction . His only hope of avoiding prison is to give an FBI agent ( Richard Jordan ) information that will help to bring down some bigger bad guys ... like the men who have been on a bank-robbing spree and killed a teller during their last job.Mitchum 's problem is that , if he `` rats '' on those guys , his life is not worth a plugged nickel.Peter Boyle co-stars in the picture , playing Mitchum 's `` friend , '' a former felon who is now a bartender and also supplies confidential information to the Feds.Adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins by Paul Monash , this is a gritty , first-rate crime drama , shot in almost a semi-documentary style . Mitchum 's performance , particularly his first scene in which he explains to a young punk gun dealer how he got the nickname , `` Fingers , '' is unforgettable.The Criterion package contains a booklet of essays on Mitchum and the film .

`` The Friends of Eddie Coyle '' , adapted from the novel by George V. Higgins , is exemplary of the kind of film noir that was unique to the 1970s . It shares the chaotic noir world with films of the 1940s , but protagonist is fast being rendered irrelevant by a rapidly changing world where even corruption is n't what it used to be , and he knows it . It 's fitting , then , that the protagonist should be played by an aging Robert Mitchum , conflicted hero of more than a few films of the classic noir cycle . Eddie Coyle ( Robert Mitchum ) is a hood who runs guns for the Boston mob . Caught in a recent trucking job set up by his bar-owning friend Dillon ( Peter Boyle ) , Coyle is looking at a probable 3-5 years in prison . He ca n't afford to do the time , so he considers snitching on his gun supplier to a federal agent , Dave Foley ( Richard Jordan ) , but the feds are more interested in a recent string of bank robberies.Eddie Coyle is a man from another era . He ponders how much and whom he is willing to betray to keep himself out of prison . He paternalistically lectures his young gun supplier ( Steven Keats ) about how rough the business is and the importance of caution and reliability . Eddie is playing by some old rulebook that is no longer applies . He does n't realize he 's being played by just about everyone . He catches on too late to how the game of cops and robbers is currently conducted . `` The Friends of Eddie Coyle '' was an ironic title for a cynical and depressed era . Made the year the Watergate scandal broke , it 's hardly surprising that law enforcement is portrayed as no more ethical than outright criminality . Shot on location in Boston , director Peter Yates ' style is unadorned but includes a lot of procedure -how guns are obtained and banks robbed- that enhance the film 's aura of authenticity.The DVD ( Criterion Collection 2009 ) : Spine # 475 . Bonus features are a Stills Gallery of 22 behind-the-scenes images captioned by director Peter Yates and a feature commentary by Yates , recorded in 2009 . This is one of Yates ' favorite 3 films of the 25 films he directed . He talks about choosing the locations , the cast and performances , including a lot about Mitchum 's work on this film , his own `` style of reality and simplicity '' , and the filmmaking process . Also included is a booklet featuring an essay by film critic Kent Jones and a 1973 profile of Robert Mitchum from `` Rolling Stone '' .	1
Stargate Atlantis in my opinion is the best of the SG franchise . The characters are excellent ... lots of action , wit and even wisdom !	1
As I 've said in all my reviews , I love the Stargate shows SG-1 and Atlantis , not so Universe . I like the way they spun off the whole Atlantis discovery as the foundation for extending SG-1 which was great , but ran it 's course and was in decline at the end . It allowed some new characters , albeit with familiar personalities , along with keeping alive some old favorites with vague tie in 's to their ongoing lives as well as bringing Samantha Carter back for a season to head the program ( in addition to all her guest appearances ) . I think the 3rd season of Atlantis was its best . I knew from the start it would have a shorter shelf life than SG=1 because the premiss had already been pretty thoroughly explored in SG=1 . A whole new universe allowed for some new bad guys , but the SG teams and the predicaments they can get into are finite before they are like plots different show . I enjoyed their greater familiarity with the ancient technology but being Hyperspace or Warp drives , the technology is simply a backdrop to the episode storyline and seasonal/show ones . I could n't have stood waiting as long watching Stargate for them to develop defensive technologies and fight the enemies effectively . I enjoyed the show and season 3 was at its peak as it was becoming a formula rotated through the seasons by season 4 and season 5 it is hard to get enthused when it begins by them canning a long time character who was well liked by fans and characters , replacing her with someone that I would have enjoyed having run Stargate for two shows and then get eaten by a Raithe no matter how much they tried to make it fun watching him have to change his ways to deal with the realities of being in the field . The characters had become familiar such that losing main ones was difficult in this season making for some heavy shows , but also began the rotation that made it less upsetting when one was lost . The only thing that sort of always left me in question was how on Atlantis they dealt with exploring an entire Galaxy with a few SG teams while back in the Milky Way they had a ton . I realize there were more finite resources in the beginning , but by season 3 they had the huge city fairly up and running and enough trade partners to support a much larger military presence which all things considered I think back home on earth they would have been cranking out as many starships as possible because in the big picture they would need a fleet not a couple of ships . i know they added on , but over years given the stakes I believe an international governing body would be funding mass production of those things so there was always one by earth , one by Atlantis and others for missions and with force . It is part of what started to become a little to familiar , the desperate situation with impossible odds solved by a miraculous discovery at the last minute . Great for a show , or a movie , but when it becomes cyclical it eventually translates to a show formula and the interest just begins to wane . I did appreciate the writing around the problems they faced were of their own making many times ( waking the wraithe early , messing with the replicator programming , genetic experiments on the wraithe to make them human ) and the moral questions they raise in parallel with the real world application of genetics . How much knowledge is to much before we are dabbling in areas we do n't have enough seem to be evolved enough to have in our hands as they represent to much power , to much danger . But for Star Gate fans I think Atlantis was a comfortable spin off that allowed a few more years of enjoyment of their & # 34 ; world & # 34 ; but unlike the Star Trek franchise that dealt with all universes the & # 34 ; world & # 34 ; created via the stargates became to self contained limiting the growth of the plots . Bottom line is by this season you know what your getting and enjoying it , where in the seasons to come it started to get old and thus the show faded away . Good , even great for periods , but limited from the start by being set in the present . Great run while it lasted .	1
Phenomenal set of writers who seem to know how to keep the series action packed and with characters who the audience enjoy watching . Strongly recommended for the SCI-FI junkies in the world .	1
I love anything Stargate ! ! ! ! ! One of the very few scifi series left on tv ... ..sad : o (	1
Season 3 is as exciting and suspenseful as season 1 and 2 even though I 've watched this series before . Truly great Sci-Fi !	1
The story lines and acting are superb in Season Three of Stargate Atlantis . The best thing about the series is the varying episodes emotions from humor ( Tao of Rodney & Irresistible ) to sadness ( Sateda & Sunday ) . I really feel the actors are comfortable with their characters and are willing to explore more . As always , I love the extras . The behind the scenes and the commentaries are always good . This is definately worth the purchase .	1
I love this series . This is the third or fourth time through for me . The characters of John Shepherd , Tayla , Dr Weir , Ronan and Dr. Becket and Dr McKay are unforgettable . It is a wonderful space fantasy . Whenever I want to escape into another world I go to Stargate Atlantis . I imagine how cool it would be to travel to other worlds through a stargate/wormhole and meet other people who of course speak my language , English . The SG-1 series is good too and was the beginning of the Stargate series . In the beginning of Stargate Atlantis Jack O'Neil passes the torch to John Shepherd . Very cool indeed .	1
Clean and fun Sci-fi . Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe . Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil . Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi . This was probably the best season for this series .	1
They should 've created feature films for release in theaters of these tales.I hope we 'll see more of these actors in the future .	1
At first I was hesitant to start watching the series because I really liked SG-1 and did n't want to be disappointed . After watching the first season I was hooked .	1
It is so good that i have watched it for a second time . Just imagine if this were true . Great cast .	1
i have loved all the sg series . it can get a little slap stick every now and then , but its still one of the great series of the last few years	1
Tell us why you chose this rating ? Well , there is really only one answer I can give , only one word that sums up my feelings about this show : yes .	1
I just finished watching the third season DVD set , and while Stargate Atlantis is still my favorite Sci-Fi show , I was rather disapointed.Here 's why. ( Warning ! Spoilers below ! ) First , story arc failure . I was expecting a huge advancement in the story arc concerning the Wraith , but it just did n't happen . Sure , they appear in a few good episodes , but it did n't seem like the story with respect to them in particular moved at all.Second , killing off Dr. Beckett . I really liked him . Maybe I 'm dating myself a bit here , but he was kind of like Scotty and McCoy rolled together but with a cooler head . This very lovable character will be missed.Third , rehashing the replicators . With an entirely new galaxy as our backdrop for this series , why do the replicator thing all over again ? It was original enough on Stargate SG-1 , but I was amazed that Atlantis started a story arc with replicators too . Are they going creatively bankrupt already ? Fourth , rehashing old sci-fi standbys , like the `` weird alien thingy or disease that causes loyal comrades to start killing each other '' . Did the original Star Trek do this in the episode `` The Naked Time '' and was n't it done again by Star Trek Next Generation as the second or third episode in that series ? Fifth , bringing back a whole ship full of `` ancients '' just to kill them all off by the end of the two part episode . So , the `` ancients '' have gone from being a great and mysterious race of humanoids from the past to an expediant plot device . We can create them and destroy them at will just to get and episode or two . Could n't an `` ancient '' or two have been spared and used as secondary characters ? Would n't that have been interesting ? They could have helped explore the rest of the city . Their ship could have been recovered . There 's so much that could have been done with them that wasn't.Sixth , lack of character development . Tayla could be a full-fledged warrior princess with a rich heritage and tons of wisdom , but she seems little more than a pretty ( to say the least ) face with a great body who never uses contractions ( reminds me of Barbara Eden in I Dream of Jeanie ) and tilts her head a lot . And then there 's Ronan the Monotone Macho man who does nothing for me but must appeal to a certain demographic so he 's still there.Still , the season ended with a special effects spectacular and a tightly written script that showed just what the Atlantis team is capable of . And , of course there 's the wealth of special features and commentaries that you get as part of the standard package with Stargate franchise DVD sets , and that greatly adds to the value of the set.I have n't seen any of season four . Here 's hoping .	1
Love this show and all the stargate series shows its a shame they only got 5 seasons because there was alot more you could do with the premise .	1
I really like Stargate Atlantis . I like seeing the characters from the first Stargate series working with the current ones .	1
I 'm a big fan of this series . The constant fight with the wraith is exciting and makes for good character development . No worries no spoilers here but expect Ann exciting season with very high stakes .	1
While this series has n't reached the level as its predecessor overall the series does grow in entertainment and quality per episode , especially as we get some screen time with some of the other background characters in the series as well . While the Wraith remain the primary enemy on the series we also get some intrusion from past enemies as well from G'aould to the Replicators as well as some cameo time from some of the SG1 team members too . While Shepard is no Jack O'Neill he has started getting his own personality it seems that fits the series well and while the super model leader Teyla still feels unneeded she has become somewhat less annoying in the series as well . If you have the Stargate series I say for the price these sets are going for that it 's a pretty good bargain to add the five seasons of Stargate Atlantis to the shelf as well ... .	1
Stargate Atlantis is a fun and intertaining series . Full of action , good characters and imagination . My husband and I both really love the series .	1
This is a great sci-fi fiction show for the whole family . We enjoy watching it . Very glad the whole show is on prime to view .	1
This is by far the best season so far . I kept looking forward for nighttime to watch an episode.One thing I like about this season is that some episodes follow on the previous ones . In other words , many episodes are not standalone . Many viewers do prefer standalone episodes , and producers certainly do . For producers , having standalone episodes means a viewer can jump in and watch the series at anytime during the season . This has the benefit of increasing ratings . For some viewers , standalone episodes are also an advantage since they can watch and enjoy an episode without having seen any other episodes . I , on the other hand , prefer continuity , sort of like 24 Hours . For this reason , I thought this season of Stargate Atlantis to be the best.I do have a few comments about this season:1 . Dr. Beckett dies in a very simple plot . I was really very disappointed . Beckett was one of my favorite characters , and I often wished he was given more of a principal role . The writers also did a lousy job in the episode in which he was killed . They could have killed him off in two or three one-hour episodes that followed up on each other , thus adding more suspense and thrill . On the other side of the coin , though , killing off a principal character also means that all characters on the show are susceptible to death -- none are superhuman . We know James Bond never dies in his movies . However , next time a character is threatened with death in Stargate Atlantis , we will be glued to our seats , wondering whether he or she will die ! ` Death in the air ' makes the episodes more suspenseful.2 . The character of Teyla ( Rachel Luttrell ) has not been developed , and she does not have much to say that is interesting . She is also dressed up in a way to make her look sexy . Should n't she be wearing a uniform ? Can you imagine a female soldier in Iraq wearing her outfit ? 3 . Jason Momoa as Ronon is another underdeveloped character . Sometimes he is annoying . He also is sparsely dressed , being topless most of the time . Like Teyla , I would imagine he 'd wear a uniform . Do n't they ever get cold ? 4 . Dr. Weir 's ( Torri Higginson ) character is also weak . She should be given more principal roles . There are rumors that she might be replaced in upcoming seasons.5 . There is too much Rodney in this season , and this gets to be annoying at times.6 . In one episode , a ship full of ancients is found . They reclaim Atlantis , and basically kick out the Stargate team from the city , who all return back to Earth . However , in the second episode they are all killed . That was really bad storytelling . As one reviewer pointed out , could n't an `` ancient '' or two have been spared and used as secondary characters in latter episodes ? They could have helped explore the rest of the city and reveal its many secrets . We could have also known more about the ancients and their culture . Furthermore , their ship could have been recovered and used to fight the Wraiths . There 's so much that could have been done with the surviving ancients that wasn't.7 . The episode `` Common Ground , '' in which the Genii kidnap Sheppard and enclose him with a Wraith was fascinating . We discover that the Wraiths not only drain another creature of life , but can also give life as well . For the first time , a bond is formed between a Wraith and a human . Wraiths are shown to be human after all . Humans hunt and kill prey ( animals ) in order to survive . Wraiths kill humans because we are prey to them , and they need to feed on us to survive . Viewed in this context , are n't Wraiths and humans the same ? It all boils down to survival of the fittest.The season ends with the city blasting off into space . Having lost all power , it just floats in space . I ca n't wait for season 4 !	1
This is the best of the three shows ( SG-1 , Atlantis , and Universe ) . Too bad they dorked with the actors in the last 2 seasons .	1
Yet again another fantastic & # 34 ; Gate & # 34 ; series . Intelligently executed script , an almost perfect cast and just enough babes and bullets to keep you coming back .	1
the entire series from the first season through the final fifth season is a marvelous creation of imagination . I love the characters and a course the city with all it 's amazing technology listening leo 's be under comprehension in some cases should n't even be in a position . The monsters better created each week or dangers of the universe springs both in outer space in technology lovers races that they came in contact with . The rating the central 1 . I enjoyed the up organic feel the race very similar to the movie series alien having that to organic look to the interiors of the ship and there insect always of preserving food and consuming the life force of human being	1
Good series Very happy that William Fitchner joined the crew . He 's such a good actor and adds a lot to the show .	1
I never watched this show on TV . I had heard about it but I could n't add one more to my queue . Then the show ended after season 5 , my shows went on hiatus for the summer , and I wanted a show to watch . I have to say , I 'm not only glad I picked this show , I 'm glad I actually waited until now . I blew through the first season real fast and thought maybe I 'd take a break , except that did n't happen because of the nice cliffhanger at the end so immediately in went season 2.Like I said in the title , this show is like a drug . I blew through season 2 faster than the first season . They 're out , they 're on the run , the Fox River Eight . T-Bag is the villain you love to hate . Scofield is still the modern day MacGuyver . Sucre gets far more interesting . Burrows really is able to reveal his bad- @ $ $ nature , and the plot continues to thicken with `` The Company '' . I 'll warn you , you 're not going to want to stop here , you might want to just get the entire collection and take a vacation so you can watch it all .	1
This is an addictive show . Suspense that leaves you wanting to fast forward to next week so you can find out what is going to happen next .	1
More fun from the behind bars , okay they are on the run now , oops hope that does n't spoil it for you ! !	1
This is a very good second season . Granted they are not in Prison anymore . They broke out and are on the run with other prisoners . Added new people to the mix and they fit in well . This show has a lot of good action , drama and story.Has a lot of intense scences as well as surprises . The bond between the brothers is done well . The man that steals the Show is Agent Kellerman . A very good series to own .	1
From beginning to end of season 2 Michael Scofield ( Wentworth Miller ) and his brother Lincoln Burrows ( Dominic Purcell ) are on the run from the police and government agents that want them dead . The other convicts lives are on the line as well since all of them have been ordered to be killed . They also want Dr. Sara Tancredi ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) dead or anyone else who has tried to help Scofield and his brother . To show that these guys are n't messing around , season 1 regular Veronica ( Robin Tunney ) is killed violenty at the end of the first episode of this season.William Fichtner plays Agent Alexander Mahone who we think just wants to catch them but it later turns out that he has been ordered to kill them . Plus that 's not all that makes this guy a threat ... .he 's extremely smart and always seems to know what Scofield 's next move is going to be . Which is another thing that makes this season so thrilling . You never really know what this guy is going to do next or who he 's going to find next . I was hoping he 'd find and kill T-Bag ( Robert Knepper ) but that sleaze ball makes it through the whole season . I do n't wan na see this guy die because Knepper is bad at playing him or anything . I wan na see him die because Knepper is fantastic at making you hate this worthless piece of garbage . He 's a rat that kills innocent people and slizzers his way away through most the season.Paul Adelstein as Agent Paul Kellerman is back after Scofield and Burrows . But he makes some important decisions as the season goes on and turns out to be just what they need if they want to clear Burrows ' name . So there 's a lot of character development going on in this season . There 's a lot of running going on this season but since this show has great writing it 's always engaging and you never really know what is going to happen next . So it 's not just a whole lot of brainless chase scenes through the whole season . It 's always exciting and has you at the edge of your seat . Plus there is still some scenes where they are captured and have to figure out how to escape . Hell this season has everything really . It 's really a must see !	1
The first season of `` Prison Break '' was amazing and it solidified it as one of the best new shows on network television . When it ended , with the escape of 8 of the convicts ; I wondered how they would keep the show going . Well , they did it ... The 2nd season is different from season 1 in scenery and in story . And , I 'm going to get this out of the way right now , it 's not quite as good as season 1 . The first season was smart , suspenseful , and entertaining . Season 2 is suspenseful and entertaining ... But not a single episode on here captured the heart-pounding 2nd to last episode of season 1 . Still , viewing all these episodes a 2nd time ( I watched them all while they were airing ) ; It 's still an amazing show . When the show begins ; Michael Scofield ( Wentworth Miller ) and his brother Lincoln Burrows ( Dominic Purcell ) have successfully broken out of Fox River . Along with them are John Abruzzi ( Peter Stormare ) , Fernando Sucre ( Amaury Nolasco ) , David `` Tweener '' Apolskiss ( Lane Garrison , who 's had a recent run-in with the law himself ) , Theodore `` T-Bag '' Bagwell ( Robert Knepper ) , Benjamin `` C-Note '' Miles Franklin , and Haywire . With the entire world knowing their faces , they `` Fox River 8 '' begin running ... With new character , F.B.I . man Alexander Mahone ( William Fichtner ) guessing their every move . This season develops the relationship between Michael and Sara , the doctor who aided the cons in their escape , and also makes you feel more for the characters . One amazing aspect of this show is that you actually like the characters and want them to succeed despite their wrongdoings . The best example I have of this is the character T-Bag , a convicted rapist & pedophile who is easily the most dangerous of the bunch . Many viewers of this show have a strong connection to T-Bag and love the character . This is not a result of good writing , but a result of good acting . Robert Knepper plays this character so well , you root for T-Bag to succeed . You do n't want to see him killed off or shipped back to prison . The fact that the Emmy awards have n't even acknowledged Knepper is a complete travesty . If this was a movie , Knepper would be nominated for an Oscar . But all the actors are good and with season 2 , they 've only got better at playing the roles . They 're gotten under their character 's skin and have really became them . The chemistry between Miller and Purcell is terrific . You believe that they are actually brothers . Fichtner as Mahone is terrific as well . He has that icy stare and intenseness that John Malkovich has and does an amazing job as the sympathetic F.B.I . agent that you love to hate . Like I said , the show is n't as smart as season 1 ... There 's many episodes where they seemed to make up things as they went along ( Michael 's tattoo has become a ploy and a plot device . The writer 's can make new tattoos appear whenever they wish ) and the way they handled the Haywire character could have been better . There were times when they disregarded him for several episodes , when really he should have been caught by episode 3 . There 's no way that Haywire could 've remained out longer than Abruzzi . But the suspense factor is way up there . Every episode has me on the edge of my seat , wondering what was going to happen next ( Even though , I already knew which makes it even more impressive ) . If you have n't jumped on the `` Prison Break '' bandwagon yet , you should ... I missed the season 3 premiere last night and I truly want to cry , because I ca n't wait to see what happens next . When you have a TV show that can you get that pumped up , you know you 've found something special ... And `` Prison Break '' is damned special all right . Fine acting , terrific writing , and nail-biting suspense . I said this is my review for season 1 a long time ago , but I 'm going to state it again . If this was a movie , you can bet that Oscars would be involved.GRADE : A	1
As the second season of Prison Break opens , things get moving along rather quickly . Michael ( Wentworth Miller ) , Linc ( Dominic Purcell ) , Sucre ( Amaury Nolasco ) , C-Note ( Rockmond Dunbar ) , and John ( Peter Stormare ) have escaped from prison and are on the run . After going their seperate ways , shady FBI Agent Mahone ( William Fichtner ) arrives on the scene with one main intention : stop Michael and Linc from escaping the country . In the meantime , T-Bag ( Robert Knepper ) goes to some great lengths to get what he wants , and Captain Bellick ( Wade Williams ) is still hot on the brothers ' trail . The conspiracy that was apparent in season one is even more farther reaching here , as revelations are made that will cost everyone involved dearly , and by the end of the season , not everyone that has been here since the beginning will still be standing . What makes Prison Break so good is that the show never relents from it 's break neck pacing . This could easily be a bad thing , but the minds behind Prison Break manage to keep the constant flow stable enough so you never know what to expect next . Even with the major change of scenery for the main characters , the show stays more compelling than ever as it becomes a high octane game of cat and mouse . Undoubtedly one of ( if not the ) best shows on prime time network television today ( and on Fox ) , Prison Break just keeps getting better , and by the end of the season finale , you 'll be salivating for more .	1
It was interesting how the roles became reversed . Michael is now the prisoner in one of the worst prisons possible and the brother is now the free man . Talk about twist of fate . I was excited to see T-bag back in the second season . He 's a mean , rotten man , but somehow he just grows on you . You kind of believe there 's some good in there , some where .	1
Love this show . Plenty of twists and turns.really good , great cast and acting . Lots of great guest stars to keep it fun and interesting .	1
I vaguely remember it the first time . There was a lot of hoopla and you were n't normal if you could n't converse about each weeks episode . This time I was ill and decided to have a marathon . It all melted together . The actors , the script , music editors producers . it made me scream at the tv like an idiot and laugh like '' haywire '' and cry as though my brother was going to the chair ! ! ! ! ! Wentworth is amazingly beautiful ! eye candy . & lt ; sorry > had to put that in ! One of the funniest quotes I have ever heard came from Balak 's mouth '' omg you are slower than a bunch of stutterers at a spelling bee '' just the visual made me crack up ! the only unfortunate part is season two ! I hope it gets better the episodes are n't as nail biting and a little predictable and I did see the second season before ! ! give my review later for 2..	1
Breaking out of prison is one thing . Dealing with the inevitable and complicated fallout and consequences afterwards is another.In the second season of this series , the characters discover just how hard it is to regain a normal life , a life not spent on the run . C-Note has a wife and sickly daughter who suffer to a degree because of him and he nearly kills himself . T-Bag 's twisted logic tells him that his former lover will take him back into her home , but he does n't face reality . Bellick thinks he can find the money but ends up imprisoned in a foreign country and has left Sucre 's beloved woman locked up somewhere.Haywire ends up dead , as does Tweener , while Mahone and others involved in the conspiracy and the hunt create their own hell.Scofield and Burrows try to hide out in Panama with Sarah , but all goes asunder and Scofield is now in the hellish prison of that country.In such a bleak world , it 's amazing that any of these people keep trying to carve out a life for themselves .	1
Just finished watching it - bought the UK version last week.Good but not as good as season one.Some lame weak writing there.More like a fugitive show than the very unique original first season.Great acting again from Michael , Linc and the crewPlus some good actionso I recommend buying it	1
I have kept up with Bones through the current season and I have to say that I think season 2 is my favorite season ! The chemistry , the stories are especially excellent and enjoyable to watch !	1
My overriding impression of `` Bones Season 2 '' is that perhaps Booth and Brennan were getting too close in season one , and forces needed to be put in place to put some distance between the two . The first was by replacing Jonathan Adams ( Dr. Daniel Goodman ) with Tamara Taylor ( Dr. Camille Saroyan ) as Brennan 's boss , who , by the way , had a romantic relation with Booth when they were in New York . The second was to introduce a romantic interest for Brennan , in the form of FBI agent Tim Sullivan ( Sully ) , who replaces Booth while he is sidelined for a psychiatric evaluation by the premier guest character on `` Bones '' , Gordon , Gordon Wyatt , played by Stephen Fry.Wyatt and Booth have some of the most delicious scenes outside of the episodes where Booth and Brennan get close.In retrospect , it is just a bit hard to take the interchange between Brennan and Saroyan in the first few episodes . Booth is surprised at her arrival , and resists Saroyan 's direction . I suppose the reason it 's odd is because we all suspect from the outset that in the lab , and with Booth , Brennan will always be the alpha dog . After all , the show is named after her.Overall , I would say season 2 is as good as season 1 , and better than season 3 ( It is rated better than both seasons 1 and 3 . ) Season 1 had the `` getting to work together jitters '' and season 2 had the `` separation moves '' . The main season 3 arc was simply not as good .	1
The Bones tv series is a great show . David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel work so good together and even though it is a crime drama , there are also plenty of light moments that will make you laugh . I love it and hope this series goes on for many more seasons .	1
I admit that I found myself caught up in the TV whirlwind that is Bones . But with good reason a show that focuses on solving crimes via skeletal remains mixed with humor , sorta romance and danger . It all equals a wildly addictive TV show that has you coming back for more with each episode watched.It stars David Borenaz and Emily Deschanel as partners working together . Along Dr. Brennan and her crew of coworkers who are just as important to the show as the two stars in it . All kinds of things take place in the 2nd season with more storylines resolved and new ones opened up . They are just as addictive and compelling as the first season and they even have an addition to the team as a whole in a new director ( Tamara Taylor ) for the Jeffersonian.I love the way the season progresses with the different members of the team reaching new personal goals and other things ( marriage ( sorta ) , promotion ) . It 's exciting to see a show this good actually stick around for more than a minute . I can only hope that Season 3 picks up right where this season ended on a very high note and full of possibilities this time around . That i 'm sure will have even more people flocking to check out this all around well written , directed and acted show in Bones .	1
Bones is a great TV show . Not like about 90 % of the Trash on TV.. It is fun to watch , and keeps you going.. If you want a good TV show . THis is one to get ! ! ! ! !	1
I had n't watched Bones until I picked up the first season on DVD when I was looking for something different to watch . Now it 's one of my favorite shows -- much more fun than CSI , a little gross at times , but over all one of the best shows on the tube right now .	1
I think Bones is a very good show . I love all the characters and the chemistry between all of them is fun to watch .	1
Better than the first . Know a bit more about the history of the characters and their motivations . Dr. Seroyan is excellent addition . You get a hint of grossness of the murder victims but not over much . The writing is still excellent and holds your attention . Looking forward to the new season and more cases .	1
I loved this season of Bones even more than season one , as more of the cast are developing to fuller characters , with new subplots to keep things tied together , and more really cool forensics.Dr Brennan ( Emily Deschanel ) continues to struggle with her desire to feel normal emotional connection , while her intellect keeps her from exactly getting there , and while the chemical tension with her partner simmers under the surface . Thrown into the mix are new moral dilemmas due to her developing knowledge of her birth family , and shades of gray start to infiltrate her world of black and white . Can one be a moral ( justified ) killer ? Etc . Forgiveness and love are examined in rather unique waysBones is very good TV , that I can enjoy with both my wife and my teens.So if you have already watched season one , get season two ( but really , watch one first for the character development that is quite good ) and have a marathon fun weekend !	1
O Happy Day ! As presented in widescreen , here 's Season 2 of Bones . The great news is that there 's no slack off at all from season one 's most excellent run . Involving forensic conundrums and grim visions of death once again winningly meld with great drama , humor , pathos , and tenuous romance . Emily Deschanel as forensic anthropologst Dr. Temperance `` Bones '' Brennan and David Boreanaz as FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth ( David Boreanaz ) continue to dazzle as television 's most electric investigative duo.Whereas Booth is the intuitive people person , Brennan is still mostly socially in the dark . She remains dispassionate and driven in her pursuit of her personal Holy Grail , the truth . As always , her ability for drawing accurate observations from ruined human remains proves invaluable in solving FBI cases . As ever , the perceptive Booth and her free spirited best friend Angela are her main conduits to understanding the , to her , bewildering labyrinth of emotions and social decorum . Deschanel is great at allowing the audience to glimpse the wounds just beneath Bones ' supremely confident exterior . She and Boreanaz are magical , and their chemical synergy remains the overwhelming draw of this series.There 's a barrage of big technical jargon used on each episode , but that does n't keep me from being sofa-ed in rapt attention . This show is so clever that my attitude more or less echoes Booth 's : `` Keep talking . I 'll catch up . '' The mysteries are compelling enough , but when thrown in with the engrossing human elements , it makes me want to tune in to the show that much more . The squints , while intimidatingly brainy and toiling away on a wavelength drastically foreign from that of average folks , are nevertheless engaging and very sympathetic characters . The supporting cast is remarkably good and quirky , bolstered by this season 's newcomer Tamara Taylor and by occasional guest stints by Ryan O'Neal , Stephen Fry , and the wonderful Patricia Belcher ( as no-nonsense attorney Caroline Julian ) . It must be noted that T.J. Thyne ( Hodgins ) and Michaela Conlin ( Angela ) share an endearing chemistry.Season 2 introduces a couple of curve balls , beginning with the arrival of Dr. Camille Saroyan ( Taylor ) as Brennan 's new boss at the Jeffersonian Institute , with whom Bones instantly clashes . Then mix in some office romances ( except the one we 're hankering for ) . Offer up a serial killer or two . And , thru all the cases she works on , Bones still fixates on her mother 's unsolved murder and her father 's disappearance . On this , some light will be shed.My favorite episodes are `` The Truth in the Lye '' ( Tub of goo ! ! So cool tub of goo ! ! To quote Bones : `` Even for me , this is disgusting . `` ) , `` The Woman in the Sand '' ( Booth goes ultimate fighting and , Omigawd , Bones in a sexy black cocktail dress ! ) , `` Aliens in a Spaceship '' ( Hodgins and Brennan are entombed in a car and must come up with makeshift ways to surviva as air runs out ; raw-emotioned acting by Thyne and Deschanel ) , the nerve-wracking `` The Blonde in the Game '' and its equally harrowing follow-up `` The Man in the Cell '' features the return of clever serial killer Howard Epps from last season 's `` A Man on Death Row '' ) and the season-ender `` Stargazer in the Puddle '' ( Bones learns more about her mother ) .Special Features include optional episode commentaries on `` The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House '' ( with Emily Deschanel ) and on `` Stargazer in a Puddle . '' Boreanaz does n't commentate this time ; perhaps , his effort last season was deemed too loopy . Disc 6 offers `` The Memories in the Season '' featurette ; `` Visceral Effects : The Digital Illusions of Bones '' featurette ; 8 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary by the Executive Producers ; and the gag reel.By the way , the episode commentary on `` The Glowing Bones in the Old Stone House '' reveals that an unaired 22nd episode will debut in the third season . Does that mean there 'll be 23 episodes in season 3 ? One hopes ( but doubts ) .	1
This second season is exploring new ways and avenues where bones are of course multiplying at leisure and for our best pleasure . Yet this second season is quite new in several aspects.First and foremost the season is widely open to personal matters and it explores the private , and at times not so private , relations between the members of the team , after the boss has been changed to a woman , which rebalances the sexual ratios . Bones herself is courting and going out with an FBI agent who has temporarily replaced Booth while he was sort of suspended and deprived of a gun after shooting a clown on top of an ice-cream vendor 's van . But in the end she will not go through the process completely as far as leaving the Jeffersonian for a life of full leisure and farniente.Zack manages to get his doctorate and to be hired in the job he was holding as an intern because he goes to Angela and begs for help on his look and manages to become presentable , which means he can now stand in court and testify seriously in a deportment that can carry the agreement of the jury . So far he is no longer obsessed by sexuality but he encounters a great difficulty : he is summoned by the White House to go to Iraq . But this time this reference does not lead to any political dissertation or even cogitation on the subject . Political questions are systematically and carefully avoided in this second season.Jack and Angela are finally realizing they love each other and even decide to get married and they finally find themselves in front of a priest ( in fact a black priestess ) in some church for the last step when the State Department steps in and reveals Angela is already married in some kind of broom stick over-jumping ceremony . More later , I guess.Booth is entangled in the hands of a British shrink after his shooting the clown on the ice-cream vendor 's van and he is a perfect sucker , building a full barbecue for the shrink under the shrink 's blackmailing procedure of retaining the document he must sign . This same shrink will also step into Bones ' psyche as some kind of private counselor . Agent Booth and Doctor Brennan will not be able to establish some kind of personal relationship , especially since Temperance 's father reappears in her life and even saves the situation a couple of times . But he has to be arrested by Booth and be brought to court for his ancient crimes , including the attack against the deputy chief of the FBI , though this one was crooked to the utmost , his lips kissing the heels of his shoes or something like that.Booth reestablishes for a short while a relationship with the new boss of the institute , Dr Camille Saroyan , with whom he had had a liaison some time ago in another life . But that can not last more than one or two episodes . This is characteristic of all these people : they are unable psychologically or administratively to build balanced and normal relationships . Is it a side effect of their jobs or professions , we can wonder , or simply personal immaturity ? That level of the season blurs out the various crimes and cases they examine and solve . And these cases do not deal with political issues or even with immigration , except one case about some strange Chinese practice of burying the bones of a man with the bones of a woman so that the man has some company on the other side of the road . Most cases are plain simple crimes in America and among Americans . But they often deals with social problems like the mother of a severely handicapped girl : what can the mother do to help her child the genetic victim of a deadly disease that keeps her retarded , even if it is only for a short time before she dies ? Some of these questions are crucial : do we have the right to experiment on human beings new treatments that would enable astronauts to reinforce their bones that get highly decalcified due to prolonged sojourn in space ? Some of the cases are plain vicious crimes and it is fun to catch the killers who are most of the time not at all the one or the ones we were expecting . Suspense is always with us even if the personal and more sentimental level of this season makes that suspense not as intense as I would personally prefer it to be.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne , University Paris 8 Saint Denis , University Paris 12 Cr & eacute ; teil , CEGID	1
These are the kind of replays that are always entertaining for the whole family . Enjoyable and good to relax in front of .	1
Generally I 'm not a fan of procedurals ( shows without a continuing story , where each episode stands on it 's own and isabout 'procedure ' ; legal , medical , etc ) , but this is as close to an exception as I 'll get.Give credit to excellent writing , directing and acting , and having supporting characters that are rich and really addsomething to the show . When it 's at it 's best this can be downright terrific , bringing me to tears more than once , andmaking me laugh out loud a few times too . It can be very , very smart.While the 2nd season represented growth , mostly by focusing even more on our running characters and their ongoing stories , it can still be hit or miss . Every 3rd episode or so is really special . That 's a higher batting average than the first season.The other episodes are still good , almost always watchable , ( one or two really do n't work ) , but often you can see the twistscoming a mile off , or the jokes get a little stale.The show is at it 's best when the episodes are really about the often funny , sometimes heartbreaking inner lives ofour running characters , and not simply about brilliantly ( and inevitably ) catching the bad guy/gal . Or when it 's dealingwith the more human side of forensics - the grief and pain of those left behind . That 's when this well made show moves waybeyond 'clever crime of the week ' status .	1
I tried the book series but could n't get into it-both before the tv Bones began and after watching it-they are so different . The series is a wonderful mix of science , friendship , sexual tension between the two leads and `` who did it '' - the murder that is , that I am getting each season til I have them all . Watch the show on FOX and get hooked as I did .	1
Again I really Love this show and the people are great the story keeps you wanting for more each week ...	1
Whiel the first season of Bones was slightly imperfect , partly due to the real geekiness of its actors , it was a pleasure to watch . Fortunately with Season two the craetors have managed to make this an even better series . Boreanaz ' stigma of having played Angel in the Buffy franchise is now completely gone and we can identify him with agent Booth completely . Bones social ineptitude is also put more on clear display this time . These are the two main things that mange to make the chemistry between them even stronger than last season .	1
The show is fast paced and a bit thin on story but it is still fun and better than many network shows . Bones is based on the forensic science unit of the Smithsonian Institution . The show always has a murder that the show has to solve forensically and the relationship between the workers who seem to work 24/7 adds some spice . The stories of the Grave Digger and Brennan 's father are my favorite .	1
Fortunately , the second season of BONES mantains the high standards achieved int he first season.The chemistry between Bones and Booth only improves . Also , the additon of a new female head chief ( Cam ) for the Jeffersonian team was a clever idea and worked nicely . This , adding to intriguing plots , superb support roles by Ryan O'Neil and Stephen Fry , scaring villains like Eppes and the guy that buried BOnes ( the first case to not be solved - probably until further episodes ! ) and the `` love angle '' with Hodgins and Angela conspired to make this great television .	1
Bones are the best series if you like crime and love story then these are the best series for you	1
Season 2 explores the relationship and the background of the show 's characters . Their relationships are tested by trials , tribulations , killers trying to get them and trying to save each other . This is a really good show . It is well written , interesting and captivating . David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel have great on-screen chemistry . Dechanel portrays `` Bones '' very well . She is quirky in all the right ways .	1
I loved Kathy Reichs ' books centering on the Temperence Brennen character and read them all . The show is somewhat different from the books but still very pleasing . Reichs continues act as an executive producer/consultant and it shows in the forensic goodies . Emily Deschanell is perfectly cast for her role as the tile character , and David Boreanz as well as her FBI cohort . Plenty of humor to offset the gruesome details of the murders they investigate . If you like crime procedurals , you wo n't be disappointed in this show . There is also some nice romantic interplay among the various cast members as well . A very attractive cast . The shows are consistently enjoyable .	1
Building on the momentum of its first season , this Fox series continues successfully combining the morbidity of forensic investigation with the intrigue of budding office romances.Spicing things up , an old girlfriend of Booth 's , Dr. Camile 'Cam ' Saroyan ( Tamara Taylor ) becomes Dr. Brennan 's boss ( `` The Titan on the Tracks '' ) . Initially uncertain they can work together , they soon hammer out a workplace agreement , creating a truce.Ironically , this hard-nosed boss 's life later becomes endangered after she inhales a toxin in `` The Man in the Cell '' . It creates a little drama in the workplace -- and for viewing audiences -- while she is recovering.Booth also has a personal problem of his own to deal with during this season His ex-girlfriend is letting her new boyfriend spend time with their son -- whom he is very protective of ( `` Mother and Child in the Bay '' ) . Boreanaz does some of his most convincing acting as the 'concerned parent of a young child ' . I am shocked that the writers of this series have n't promoted it through more balance of Booth 's parenting . `` The Girl With the Curl '' obviously drew it 's inspiration from the still-unsolved Jon Benet Ramsey case . Brennan and Booth have to figure out who killed a child beauty queen before tragedy strikes again , and are visibly concerned . They 've seen all kinds of stuff on this job , but learning what children undergo to be considered 'pretty ' really pushes their limits . They are further surprised to discover the actual identity of the killer .	1
I really enjoyed this TV series , and I found it superior to season one.In season two , the relationship between Dr. Brennan and Booth is well developed , albeit unpredictable , especially with the newly introduced and sexy new boss . There are a lot of tensions , thrills , passions , conspiracies , and sex in this season . Some episodes were extremely well though-off and intriguing . I did like the most the episode on the astronaut . Are there aliens from outer space , and did one just fall down to Earth ? Watch the episode to find out.This series will teach you a lot of medical terms as well as how crimes are committed ( and how not to commit crimes ) .	1
... Season 2 is where Bones hits its stride . S1 was a fanatastic season , and what hooked most of us who have continued to watch this series , which is , by the way , currently one of the most well-written , character-driven , comprehensive shows on network television.And it is the well written episodes ( that frequently tie-in to the past season and also allude to the future ) and the absolutely outstanding and superior characters that make this show pretty damn flawless . From `` Bones '' herself , to the self-depricating and sometimes hilarious Agent Booth ( if nothing else this show showed how much range `` Angel '' DIDNT give David Borneaz , which is not something I thought I 'd ever write ) to the supportive cast ( like Jack and Zach , you find out more and more about them practically each episode ) to the sometimes-present tertiary cast members ( for my money , there is NOT a more appealing character on the show than federal prosecuting attorney Caroline Julian , who says things so nuanced and powerfully , you just want to hear her read the phone book ) this show will make you a unshakeable believer by this second season.Its not perfect . Some of the dialogue is a little too Lifetime for me , on occasion , but this is the exception , not the rule , and being so well rounded is probably why both my wife and myself can fully agree on this show as one of our favorites.If you are n't watching Bones , you are missing out on possibly the best prime-time show on TV .	1
This show got even better in its second season , with the arrival of the tough new Cam as the boss of the squints , the wonderful Stephen Fry appearing as Booth 's psychiatrist , Angela and Hodgins falling in love , and wonderboy Zach being promoted and getting a new haircut in the process . The characters and the show are really coming into their own now . I look forward to season 3 .	1
The interaction between Bones and Booth got even better this season . The change in other characters helped develop the series .	1
Most British comedy always gives me a laugh or twenty , but one in which pretentiousness is skewered is especially enjoyable .	1
I continue to find a visit with keeping up appearances a delight . Every one of these people are true professionals . None of us would want a neightbor with hyacinth , but we love to watch others deal with her .	1
Love this series and watch it over and over . I am sure many people who watch it know a person like Hyacinth , which makes it even more humorous . I am so happy I can watch it any time I want a good laugh with my Premium membership .	1
This is one of my favorite comfort series and is great for a good cheer up . Hyacinth 's life revolves around appearing & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; than her station would really allow and is hilarious . Having someone of high quality nod at her in her mind makes her best friends that she can brag about . Patricia Routledge is excellent in her role as are the actors her play her husband , friends and family . If you have n't seen this show , you need to . You wo n't be disappointed !	1
When life is busy or frustrating , I turn on Hyacinth and relieve stress . Good laughs are helpful and she provides so many . Feel sorry for Elizabeth , but she 's an angel and we think Richard is wonderfully written and acted , poor guy . Very entertaining .	1
I enjoy British comedies . The language makes me think and stay focused.This comedy has always gotten laughs from me .	1
I found this show by accident and fine it hilarious . I love Hyacith , Richard and the rest of the family . A well written and acted show . I miss some of the dialog due to the accent but the more I watch the better I understand . A very funny sitcom .	1
If you enjoyed Season 1 of Hyacinth and her attempts to impress all her friends and acquaintances , then you will also enjoy Season 2 . Brother- in-law Onslow and sisters Daisy and Rose keep popping up just in time to overturn Hyacinth and Richard 's dinner party plans or a visit to a nobleman ' s estate . Neighbors , the milkman , and and the postman also try their best to avoid Hyacinth , but ca n't quite seem to sneak by her house without running into her and getting a lecture on having cleaner shoes , better milk bottles , finding lost mail , etc . Of course , having her 90 year old `` Daddy '' thinking he needs to protect the area from imaginary bomb attacks does n't help Hyacinth in her quest to be the best hostess either . Enjoy another fun filled season !	1
English humor can be a little hard to understand sometimes , but funny enough to keep me laughing & watching repeatedly until I began to get it	1
Clean , funny and plain right down silly . Great acting and fun to watch . I would recommend this to a friend .	1
Dragged out in the beginning . Was interesting to a point . The others I have said are a bit better . Event , Defiance , and Falling skies where better . Hope that helps . Looking forward to seeing more of those and grim . This has the cast , just needs better to the story line .	1
I remember seeing part of this miniseries . It is a good one and worth watching . Interesting plot and concept . Plus the acting is really good .	1
Overall the mini-series was well handled and held my interest right up to the end . The end , however , was more of a stopping point than a wrap-up as it left most of the important questions unanswered.This one may be good to-rent for those who are die-hard science fiction fans but will have a limited audience in others . I enjoyed watching it once but will probably not watch it again .	1
British actors do a great job with this unusual alien invasion story . What is it like ? Well , do n't expect state-of-the-art special effects ; do n't expect elaborate costumes , spaceships , or aliens . Rather , you will find a delightful British cast who makes the story line work , because you like the characters.The storyline ? It starts with WW-II when a strange craft and `` being '' crash ... but very soon we are transported to out current time period and must figure out what happened with the WW-II discovery . I wo n't share much more of the detail of the story except to say that aliens have come to invade ... both good and bad aliens.Note well : it is a short series , but I was involved in it after the second episode . The storyline builds from episode to episode , as does the excitement . For anyone who likes Sci-Fi and also for those who like good acting , this series is worth the watch . It is n't spectacular like `` Falling Skies '' on TNT , but it will pleasantly surprise . I give it 4 stars .	1
This is one of the more campy and fun SciFi shows to come from the BBC . It has some of the same arch sense of humor that makes the Dr. Who series so beguiling , but with a slightly darker and more dangerous edge .	1
I have given this 4 stars for only one reason ; it has an excellent ending in the tradition of the best classic science fiction tradition . That 's what really saved the series for me . It 's not a huge time investment , and it 's worth watching despite the terrible acting ( even the good actors are appallingly bad ) and the bizarre plot ( it 's as if the writers wanted to cram several completely different plots into one short mini-series , leading to a real mess ) . If you love classic science fiction I think this is worth a try , but if you stop before the end you 'll probably be left disappointed , as in all other regards this is a 2-star show .	1
I wish it had continued and gave more back story on the bad aliens and the good aliens that sent the Lieutenant from WW2 to warn them . It did prove Einsteins theory of relativity was correct . The show would have made a great television series . I wo n't give any more spoilers . Happy watching	1
I like scifi . Looked for series 2 but was n't available . I 'd like to know what happened to her and her colleague !	1
Am enjoying it but wish that more of the scenes were better lighted . Hard to see sometimes . A range of accents makes adds to the interest .	1
Starts out as what you may think is a typical alien film . But , as you get into it you may find yourself enjoying the unexpected turns . I would have given 5 stars if the effects were just a bit more realistic .	1
unfortunatley , I seem to be watching the seasons out of order ( i can get several seasons on amazon , other ones from different places ) - but the season is great - good twists & change-ups - now just get amazon to make all the seasons available ...	1
Wow the season with Ozzie . Watching him swim and do so many of the challenges was fun . Definitely one of the good seasons !	1
If you love survivor then you will want to checkout this season . This is one of the better seasons.Love it .	1
No spoilers.I LOVED this season . The division in the tribes was incredibly entertaining and I loved seeing the drama that played out because of it . There 's several big name players that come from this season and for good reason - they 're amazing Survivors and a lot of fun to watch.If you 're looking to spend money on a season of Survivor , it does n't get much better than this . I highly recommend .	1
I 'm loving the ability to go back and watch the seasons of Survivor I missed ! I was especially looking foward to this season because one of the castaways is from the same small town as I am . Please Amazon , get more older seasons soon !	1
This is another great show with scenery that is not to be missed . The challenges and rewards allowed the contestants to enjoy the native island culture .	1
Wonderful . Need all seasons available to buy .	1
Yul is a great Survivor and is the mastermind of the entire season and deserves to win . Jeff Probst declares he was disappointed that Ozzy did n't win because of how well he dominated all the challenges . Ozzy is one of the best players to ever play the game and his game is pure according to Yul . He does n't screw anyone in his alliance over and physically is a step above anyone else in the game . Yul is much smarter than Ozzy and gets more respect from the other players . Jonathan Penner is pretty funny and owns Probst in some of the back and forth at challenges . In the start of the game the tribes are divided by ethnicities into 4 tribes , which has never happened in Survivor . After the Asians dominate the first 2 challenges the tribes are mixed up . The hidden immunity idol plays a big role in this season . It 's pretty cheap that you get to play it after the votes are read , so the person with the idol never gets any votes . This is a great season of Survivor , you should buy it .	1
if for no other reason , select this season and admire oscar in all his glory ! this man 's smile will break hearts around the world ...	1
Horatio and his crew just keep on doing what they do best , convict the folks that think its easy to get away with killing folks . They do it with style , class , determination and sometimes a sense of humor as well . Really loved the season 5 opening episode in Brazil that was really cool to see them go there and take down a criminal that thought he was getting away with killing someone dear to Horatio . Very solid season 5 throughout with various crimes and different drama that affected everyone at the CSI office from gambling to ex 's that just wo n't go away . It has something for everyone especialy loved the special features with Wolf ( Ryan Togo ) showing us the ends and outs of the real CSI Miami office and what goes on there very cool.Looking forward to season 6 with the way this one ended , i know it come out in typical CSI Miami fashion with a bang .	1
This season slowed down a little bit compared to season 4 . Intensity was there , but as the season progress , less chaos between episodes . Opening was cool in Brazil . Season closer was n't that hyped , though the story was good . Highlights : Delko almost dies , Horatio saves a stripper , Wolf gets fired , and nicer looking cars . . .	1
Loved the characters , their interactions , the crimes and how they were solved . Love to see this show renewed . Great fun , entertaining , and educational ( for those of us who know nothing about catching the criminal ) .	1
The first couple of episodes were n't the best but overall , it is a good series . It kinda looks like they are just putting something together to have a show on a couple of the episodes . That is my only negative . A couple of the old case files came back into the picture and the bad guy comes to justice . I love it when they do that ! Another good season for Miami : CSI !	1
This is another great police show , it also gets better each season and you also learn more background each season.Some of the eposides get emotional at the end of them this season .	1
Well one after another , I enjoy them all usually . The lighter ones give me a break from the intensity . That can help , especially watching before going to bed .	1
To me , season four is the last of the great NCIS seasons , until season Nine . Gibbs is in Mexico , Ziva is on the run after being framed by a former massad officer who everybody thought was dead . Tony is the team leader , and Mcgee is no longer the probie . Ziva calls Gibbs in mexico , and he agrees to come back to the states to help . The F.B.I gets involved . But in the end , Ziva proves that she 's an Investigator first now , and gets the killer to talk . Which clears her , and allows Gibbs to go back to Mexico . But not for long , as Fornell asks Gibbs 's help in solving a case , which he does . And decides to come back to NCIS for good , the stories in season four are outstanding . The Halloween story alone is worth watching , as a marine is attacked in his home . And his daughter is kidnapped , and all throughout the case , Ziva thinks that the Daughter 's mother is the one who kidnapped her own daughter . But alas , in the end she is wrong . Or the creepy episode , `` Smoked '' . Where a body is found in a chimney , the body of a sadistic serial killer with a toe in his stomach , only come to find out his wife was the actual killer . As she buried the bodies in their yard , and the episode ends with Gibbs asking fornell how he thought the toe got in the guys stomach . There are two threads of stories throughout this season , one is Tony has a new girlfriend , and Gibbs has a Girlfriend Col. Hollis Mann . We also find out , that Mcgee is a fictional writer . We 're introduced to Shariff , in two incredible episodes , where they stop the terrorist the first time , and Gibbs is almost killed the second time they meet . Also in this season , we eventually find out that Tony 's girlfriend is his undercover assignment for Director Shepard . As she tries to get an international arms dealer La Grenoulle , now Ducky had been mad at Gibbs for quitting , but eventually they become friends again . And Paula Cassidy and her team are killed in an explosion , in a really powerful episode , season four ends with Jeanne and Dinnozo getting in a limo , which is her father 's , and there is La Grenoulle . Season four again , is the last of the great NCIS seasons .	1
For some reason , we had never watched this show . Once we saw it we fell in love with it and have now watched season 1 though season and are anxiously awaiting season 11 .	1
I hated Mark Harmen for years . I saw him in 2 roles where he was a really bad dude , and so convincing I decided he must be a bad dude for realz . When NCIS came along I said & # 34 ; I 'm not watching that A hole & # 34 ; . The everyone kept telling me how much fun it was and how I was missing it . I got the first couple seasons on sale and decided to give it a shot . All is forgiven Mark . The show is smart , funny and fresh every time . they do not go too far on gore or violence and they always look good , even in a prison camp which is not easy . You can start with any season and still enjoy but I suggest begining at the begining .	1
Love NCIS - enjoyed Season 4 . Watching every episode of every season to date to have a better understanding of the characters . This is an awesome show .	1
The first two episodes ' guest stars are Eyal Podell and Brandon Barash - both sleeper stars biding their time in the land of Daytime Television aka soap operas .	1
Love this show and love having the DVD 's to watch anytime I wish . I am looking forward to purchasing seasons 7 , 8 and 9 ( when available ) to complete my collection . We purchased seasons 1-6 for Christmas : - )	1
as we all know Season 3 leaves us with Gibbs gone from his position as the head of the NCIS team . He 's out of the fold but comes back in a case by case basis for the first few episodes . As Tony is in charge of the team since Gibbs has been gone and is n't really too keen on giving that position back . Among them being Ziva gets framed for murder when a bombing takes place while she 's out on the town . It only takes another episode or two and Gibbs is back and running things . All the actors/actresses come together to make this show what it is . A throughly engaging , story driven and all around fun show to watch.It just clicks from episode to episode with various cases in need of solving and a couple that delve deeper into the inner workings of the Director . As she has a history with one of the criminals that the team is trying to apprehed . The fourth season of NCIS continues to roll on and bring us excellent stories . I 'm looking forward to checking out the next couple seasons on DVD very soon . Keep the show going it is one of the better and more interesting shows out there .	1
My wife has become incurably hooked on this show and the eclectic cast of characters . It is entertaining to watch as a result of clever writing and convincingly portrayed characters . The plots are extremely varied even though they all boil down to the same crime scene investigation theme . There are both ongoing story lines as well as satisfactory resolution of crimes in each episode . The person who dreamed up the character of Abbey deserves a gold star and the role is convincingly as well as entertainingly played .	1
`` NCIS : The Fourth Season '' will delight fans with the entertaining mixture of tight police procedural and humorous team interaction they have come to expect . This season will bring something extra , what exective producer Don Bellisario terms `` a season of secrets . `` The opening three episode story arc concerns the return of Senior Agent Gibbs from his hiatus in Mexico recovering from injuries , including partial amnesia , suffered at the end of Season Three . Along the way , we will learn that Israeli Mossad Agent Ziva David and acting team leader Tony Dinozzo have secrets from Gibbs . In the course of the season , we will learn of Abby 's secret romance and McGee 's secret hobby . Most importantly , we will learn of Director Shepard 's secret vendetta against the arms dealer named Le Grenouille , for which she is prepared to bend and beak rules , and which will place Gibbs ' team at risk by season 's end . `` NCIS : The Fourth Season '' includes eight special features on the production of the show , of which the most entertaining may be a two-part roundtable with the cast . The cast answers questions about the show put by viewers , and the viewers may come to appreciate just how well cast the show really is . `` NCIS : The Fourth Season '' is very highly recommended to its fans .	1
Great fun to enjoy again and again . Enjoy the characters , especially Abby , Ziva , and Ducky .	1
This is a season of on-going story linesGibbs could not be allowed to retire and the first couple of shows bring him back to active duty.This season has several strong individual episodes.Witch Hunt has the famous Abby as Marylyn Monroe at Halloween.The episodes Once a Hero , Driven , Dead Man Walking and Smoked are excellent stand-alone stories.Twisted Sister and Friends & Loves present a McGee in a new light and are major steps in this characters development.Their are a number of story lines , some major and some just fun , in this season.Special Agent Lee and Jimmy have several encounters in less than appropriate places lending some comic relief.The publication of McGee 's first book has some team members upset with how their portrayal.The decision to retire creates problems for Gibbs ; Tony became team leader and is involved in special projects for the director . These are ongoing stories during the season as problems are `` resolved '' .Tony falls in love.Director Sheppard establishes her authority and hate for an arms dealer known as `` La Grenouille '' .The producers call this the `` season of secrets '' and season five the `` season of answers '' .	1
I do n't have television , have n't for 11 years . When I learned CBS was allowing free viewing over the internet I checked it out and started watching episodes of CSI , CSI NY , CSI Miami , and NCIS . I found NCIS to be my favorite and this particular show Dead And Unburied is my favorite so far . I enjoy the light-heartedness of NCIS . So I decided to download this episode from Amazon Unbox.I really wish Amazon Unbox would allow me to burn shows I 've purchased . As it is they are restricted to viewing on my computer . When Unbox expands this service to allow me to burn DVDs I will likely purchase many more shows this way . I like selecting individual shows .	1
I have ordered all the seasons of NCIS so far and have had no problems with any of the DVDs . All have come fast and when they said they would come .	1
another great season . My only complaint is how it ended . it was just over . It was like the writers just ran out of steam and left us hanging . The development of the characters in this season has been a great .	1
If you like comedy and drama the show is for you.It is a spin-off of the jag series that was on a few years ago , and both shows show you how military law is enforced.It is so well written that the hour thier on passes on so quickly .	1
I have not had a chance to view this DVD yet but it appears to be in good condition . Thank You	1
Great series and would recommend it to anyone over the age of 18 years I gave it a five star rating	1
Season 4 of NCIS comes off as more a labyrinth than `` The Season Of Secrets '' as CBS promoted it . The main characters all seem to start in different areas -- Gibbs in Mexico , Tony as Team Leader , Tim no longer the `` Probie '' , Ziva being Ziva ... but as the season rolls on , all the lines start coming together . Jethro 's return from Mexico is n't exactly greeted by Jenny Sheppard , and Ducky Mallard 's indifference to Gibbs is puzzling . Tony is in a serious relationship ( Or is he ? ) , and it 's driving Ziva to distraction . Tim has suddenly come into money -- lots of it , evidently . Abby is falling for a little person . Ducky 's assistant Jimmy Palmer is finding himself in a hot affair with the new Probie.And Jenny is running an off-the-books investigation that gets the Christians In Action ( Initials , folks ) upset at NCIS.It 's a complicated season where all the characters undergo some changes ; mostly pleasant but some not . Mark Harmon brings Gibbs back from Mexico a little softer ( Though not to the team ) -- enough to allow himself a relationship . Michael Weatherly gets to have Tony grow up -- some -- and have his well-known intrusiveness into his coworker 's private lives flipped on him by Ziva . Cote De Pablo allows the Mossad liason to fall for an ill-fated nuclear inspector in `` Dead Man Walking '' , but Ziva starts having `` Tony issues '' that do n't slap her in the face until the end of the season . Pauley Perrette 's Abby is as she ever is -- the attempt to give up `` Kaff-Pow ! ! '' was classic . David McCallum 's Ducky allows some hurt to show through in his relationship with Gibbs early in the year . Brian Dietzen and Liza Lapira 's sequences in-and-around the morgue were wonderful asides , and made up for the missing `` head slaps '' .But Lauren Holly was most intriguing in this season . She took a character which some viewers considered cheesecake in Season 3 , and gave her a very uneasy edge . The investigation of La Grenouille seemed legitimate , but as the season went on , Jen 's personal stake -- and what it could cost NCIS -- became apparent . This led to Sheppard not being cast in a good light through much of the second half of the season.This season also became a good spotlight for many of the recurring characters . Certainly key to the season were Susanna Thompson -- Hollis Mann , the CID investigator who got Gibbs ' attention -- and Scottie Thompson as Jeanne Benoit , the doctor who made DiNozzo settle down . Joe Spano 's usual visits as T.C . Fornell , the FBI agent/friend/rival to Jethro were a delight . But Muse Watson 's Mike Franks -- Gibbs ' team leader when Jethro first joined the then-NIS -- was a treat ; an old-fashioned type who got things done not within the rules ( Wonder where Jethro got that from ? ) . We lose Jessica Steen 's Paula Cassidy in `` Grace Period '' , and that 's a shame . But Armand Assante 's was insidious and slick as `` The Frog '' , and David Dayan Fisher 's turn as Trent Kort -- the CIA operative in with La Grenouille -- is also notable.In it 's run , NCIS has always had an ongoing storyline that gets buried in the usual action -- the identity of the terroist who infiltrated the MTAC in Season 1 , the return of Ari leading to the two words ( `` Sorry , Caitlin '' ) at the end of Season 2 , and the uncovering of Jethro 's life story in Season 3 . Season 4 becomes about Jenny 's investigation/obsession , and how it affects the whole office . It is aninteresting and ominous turn in the series . It does require the viewer to follow along closely , but in the end , all the main characters find themselves at the center of the puzzle .	1
I am one of those people who chooses not to pay for cable so I buy the programs I enjoy and know that will enjoy watch many times . This series is one of my favorites and I have just about all of the seasons . I really like William Peterson so I am not sure I will buy any more once he leaves in season 8 or 9 . I find that when I watch them again I see something I missed the times before so it is well worth the money to be able to have control over what I watch and when I watch it .	1
This particular season is excellent . I cant wait until season 8 lands on Amazon.CSI is far superior to the other CSI shows ( New York & Miami ) . Season 7 ends with a bang and leaves you drooling for more , like every other season.Great series , great acting , great stories ! ! !	1
Excellent !	1
There are various things going on with the people this time around . Whether its Gregg witnessing a gang beating and becoming a victim himself `` Fannysmackin '' . Katherine having a little too much to drink and winding up in a motel and wakes to wonder whether she 's been assaulted or not . It 's a lot going on in other episodes as well with various issues . It goes without saying that you wo n't be bored anything or character in Season 7 of CSI as they continue to up their game and keep finding more interesting cases to tackle and underlying stories between the office as a whole.After 7 seasons one would think that CSI would be slipping up or become complacent about its longevity . But that is so not the case especially with Season 7 . Each episode has a little something different to it whether its `` Lab Rats '' where the other workers in the CSI office take a front seat to try and help Grissom solve the mystery behind the miniature killer . This is an ongoing arc throughout this Season and it requires all the characters help in piecing together exactly who 's doing this and better yet why . `` Living Doll '' , it ends with a cliffhanger as Sarah has been kidnapped by the miniature killer leaving things wide open on what will actually happen to her will Grissom , Katherine and the others make it to her in time.Some of my favorite episodes from this include : '' Built to Kill , Part 1 '' '' Fannysmackin '' '' Living Legend '' '' Lab Rats '' '' Living Doll '' the season ender with a big cliffhangerThe whole season is worth purchasing in any respect as in also includes Special Features- '' Inside Built to Kill '' , `` Miniature Murders '' , `` Who Are You ? Inside Living Legend '' , `` Las Vegas : The Real Crime Solvers '' , `` The Evolution of CSI : Season 7 '' and `` Smoke and Mirrors : Directing Feature Television.Excellent in all respects from the writers , storyline , actors/actresses , guest stars , lighting , various backgrounds and mainly the attention to detail . That everyone involved puts into this show on a daily basis , i 'm impressed.5 out of 5 stars	1
C.S.I . Crime Scene Investigation - The Complete Seventh Season DvdQuick Delivery ! New Condition . Excellent series.HIghly recommend Amazon ! !	1
Am enjoying the entire series - once you get into the characters , you just want more . Came to me quickly and in great shape .	1
This , by the way , is the second review I 've written for this - do n't know where the first one is . Having said that ... Each season I keep saying the same thing , - this show keeps getting better and better . I feel this show always manages to stay fresh and interesting and I love it more and more with each new season . I ca n't wait for this release.The first episode in this season is Built To Kill where we are waiting to see more of what we found out in the last episode of season 6 - that Grisolm and Sara had gotten together . My favourite episode is Happenstance where identical twins have been seperately killed and the team try to work out whether the case is related or not . If you want a total recap of each episode then here it goes : Built To Kill 1 - Foul play is suspected when an apparent suicide victim still has the gun in his hand , and a flower delivery woman is found crushed to death in the middle of a Cirque du Soleil performance . ( Look for a special appearance from John Mayer.Built To Kill 2 - Grisolm investigates the murder of a rock star , which is complicated by the discovery of a miniature replica of the crime scene at the house . And Catherine tries to determine if she was raped after waking up nude in a seedy hotel.Toe Tags - A group of dead bodies in the Las Vegas morgue get to know each other while CSI tries to solve the crimes that got them there.Fannysmackin ' - ( another favourite of mine ) A gang of street thugs is beating and killing people all over the city . Greg witnesses one of the crimes taking place and becomes a beating victim himself.Double Cross - A lounge singer is found crucified inside a Catholic church , and the church 's new pastor fails to disclose that he knows the victim from all the way back to high school.Burn Out - A pedophile arsonist maintains his innocence in the disappearance of two young boys , but he is also willing to help the investigation by giving Grissom insight on the potential kidnapper 's mindset.Post Mortem - Greg has his day in court for running over and killing a street gang member right before his own beating , and a second crime scene replica is found -- this time after the murder of an elderly woman.Happenstance - CSI investigates the deaths of estranged identical twins : one from a gunshot wound , and one from an apparent suicide . The two deaths do not appear to be related , but are they ? Living Legend - ( the only boring episode ) The team searches for a link between a current string of murders in Las Vegas and a notorious mob boss who disappeared in the 1970s.Loco Motives - Gil finds a third miniature crime-scene replica at a murder site , and CSI tries to find a link between the three otherwise-unrelated murders.Leaving Las Vegas - Catherine tries to link an accused killer to a second similar crime in a small town after he is found not guilty in the first trial , and Gil announces that he is going on sabbatical.Sweet Jane - The C.S.I . team does n't know what to make of their new member ( Liev Schreiber ) , who joins them in the hunt for a serial killer , active since the 1970's.Redrum - Keppler proposes that Catherine create a phony crime scene to help catch a murderer , and to keep it secret from the other investigators . However , Nick quickly figures out that something is fishy.Meet Market - The discovery of a badly burned corpse uncovers a plot to illegally harvest bones and tissues , and the death of a middle-aged wife appears to be connected to her relationship with a high-priced male companion.Law Of Gravity - When one Trenton cop is murdered in Las Vegas , a second threatens to expose Keppler 's past if he does n't make the case and the evidence go away.Monster In The Box - Grissom thinks the miniature killer is dead , until he receives another miniature crime scene . However , unlike the others , this one predicts a crime scene that has n't happened yet.Fallen Idols - A star high school basketball player disappears , and the investigation reveals that he gave an STD to a couple of his classmates.Empty Eyes - Six showgirls who live together are murdered in their home , and Sara is distressed when the final victim dies in her arms . However , she may have left Sara a vital clue that could help her ultimately identify the killer.Big Shots - A death in a drive-by limo shooting and the dragging death of a young woman turn out to be related crimes , and Greg discovers that the brother of the young man he ran over may have been involved.Lab Rats - With Grissom out of his office and all of the detectives out in the field , Hodges and the lab other techs try to discover new clues in the miniature killer case.Ending Happy - A washed-up boxer is found dead at a nearby bordello . There are several suspects , motives , and signs of injury . But the medical examiner is having a hard time figuring out which blow was the actual cause of death.Leapin ' Lizzards - CSI discovers that a woman may have been murdered , and her head mounted on a wall as a trophy , because the killer was convinced that she was actually a powerful alien reptile . ( Quite a bizzare episode and a bit of a departure from what you 're used to seeing on CSI ) .The Good , The Bad And The Dominatrix - After an unsuccessful attempt on Lady Heather 's life , Sara discovers Gil 's prior relationship with her . Meanwhile , Nick investigates the death of a woman apparently hit by a taxicab.Living Doll - The miniature killer is ready to strike again , and Sara will be the next victim . Will CSI stop her in time ? Throughout the season you see the theme of the miniature killer . It started out slowly and built up speed toward the end . Because of the killer and what he/she has done to Sara , Grisolm ending up blurting out to the others about their relationship . At first the team are n't sure if they heard right or not , but it becomes apparent that they are a couple and that 's almost as exciting as working out who 's behind these miniatures.If you are a CSI fan , you are bound to love season 7 . It truly gets better always and I already ca n't wait for season 8 .	1
As many people said this show kept getting better each year.The crimes are interesting and the cast is believable and solid.The introduction of the new Character Keppler was a great move although his sudden demise due to a corrupt cop is this seasons one strained aspect . After all if the corrupt cop was going to kill his partner he would be unlikely to do it in Vegas when he 's from Trenton . However that 's not implausible and he was after all blackmailing Keppler . So people do things all the time that do n't make any sense even bad cops . So even a strained episode of `` CSI '' is still top rate entertainment.Overall the series was at it 's peak during this season and the next.The ninth season is excellent too but long time viewers are without three of their favorite characters . As many posters pointed out this is one of the entire series best seasons and that 's true enough because it remains a fascinating show and thankfully there 's no techno soundtrack like on later episodes of `` CSI New York '' . ( which is a great show otherwise ) . And that 's just another reason to enjoy this wonderful show .	1
THis season is better than the sixth ! ! More story is given about Grisham and Sarah . The miniture killer was strung all the way through the season . It was great ! It seems like the show is going to continue to get better . The ending is left with a cliff hanger and that is the only negative .	1
If you like to watch police t.v . shows this series is great for learning about police investigations . This is also the season were the team is played with by the minature killer that leaves a model of the same crime scene the CSI team is investigating , and you also learn more about the series characters .	1
The seventh season of the smash hit , original C.S.I . found the show still going strong , as opposed to when many network hits fizzle out by this time in their life . The season opens with Grissom ( William Petersen ) and Sara ( Jorja Fox ) keeping their relationship secret as a mystery unfolds regarding a killer who leaves behind exact , incredibly detailed , miniature replicas of the crime scene . As the rest of the season unfolds , Greg ( Eric Szmanda ) finds himself in a predicament he never foresaw , Catherine ( Marg Helgenberger ) finds herself playing the role of victim , and when Grissom goes out of town , a shady transfered cop named Keppler ( the excellent Liev Schreiber ) arrives on the scene ; culminating in one of the best storyarcs the series has ever seen . As the season winds to a close , the CSI 's close in on the miniature killer , and the season concludes with one of their lives in jeopardy , and the others desperate to make things right . Undoubtedly one of the best seasons of the show in it 's entire run , the original ( and best ) C.S.I . remains one of the best crime dramas to ever grace prime time network TV , and the seventh season is a prime example why .	1
This CSI Season is another great one ! Stories are always interesting and enjoyable . Peterson is one of my favorites . Would highly recommend !	1
I have all the seasons currently available on DVDs - watching the 3d season right now and it never dissapoints . I am not even pretending I could understand most of its mathematics , but the `` adaptation '' is done with real elegance so that your average non-mathematician is often nicely tickled by understanding so much : ) The series also keep a careful and well balanced proportion between brain part and emotions part , so the relationships and friendships are interesting to watch but they do not drag a clever and fascinating crime series into a family drama.One of the best crime/investigation series around , together with Criminal Minds , Without a Trace and CSI . Hope it stays around for many more seasons .	1
This season 's writers and the regular actors continue to produce exciting and engaging stories and roles to yield another interesting season . It may not be the same caliber as the previous ones but it continues to provide entertaining episodes and peek my interest in the characters development ( and love interests ) .	1
I am a big fan of this series , each new season brings something new to the back stories of each character . I highly recommend .	1
I enjoy this series , especially the interaction of the two brothers and their father . I recognize it is not especially realistic , but it is nonetheless , thought provoking and enjoyable .	1
who thought that a show about mathematics and crime solving would be both interesting and engaging to watch at the same time . Season 3 is chock full of engaging characters , situations and stories that will keep any and all interested in this ever growing and popular TV show . Numb3rs is on the way up and Season 3 has more than enough intrigue , mystery , romance and quite a bit of betrayal in it ( The Janus List ) a lot of things get brought out into the open and one surprise that i didnt ever see coming at all.Enjoy this one because from the looks of it Rob Morrow , David Krumholtz , Judd Hirsch and the rest of the gang are in for heck of a ride in Season 4 .	1
With every episode it seems to get better , the story lines are excellent and the characters are great . I love the family dynamic that is shown in each of the stories told .	1
My son is a statics masters student going onto his PHD , this show so reminds me of him and the math that he does , it just makes you realize that math is everywhere no matter where we are , sorry to see that the series ended so soon	1
We have enjoyed all of the episodes , like the characters , content is educational , love Professor Epps ! Recommend to all viewers .	1
I loved it . Good action , great characters and educational if you are into math and equations . I would watch it again too .	1
An excellent program if you enjoy math and science . If not , the characters are fun to follow through the ups and downs of work and college life . You have to love Finehart ( ? ) .	1
A friend of mine recommended that I watch this show . I love the characters plus it has a little bit of everything , action , romance , 'smarts ' ...	1
Again , it 's all about the numbers ! Numbers bring in the bad guys ! Brother duo are still offering up great sleuthing situations using FBI technics with plenty of math formulas . This season add more story with some sad news and some funny surprises .	1
Great series and enjoyable to watch.I like how math is used to help solve the different cases.The characters are really down to earth and this series showed life outside the F.B.I.office . Mike	1
It 's always difficult starting a review you know most people wo n't like but here is goes.What I really like about numbers : it makes geeks cool , no hot steamy scenes ( ie family oriented ) , main characters are decent people , it is n't gory , good story lines.The main thing I do n't like about numb3rs is that it ' missing some vital connection with the characters . Because I ca n't stay involved with the characters I tend to notice the poorly played / directed moments in the show . I also wonder about how reliable the technical stuff is , I 've goggled some of the smaller thing ( that I thought were cool ) and ca n't find them or they do n't pan out . I would n't worry about any of that if while I were watching it I had enough emotional involvement to care if one of the characters died but after 3 seasons if a main character was killed off I 'd just wonder how that would change the shows dynamics.One other thing that drive me a bit crazy is that the show acts like the FBI ca n't even use the bathroom without `` Charlies '' help . I understand its a tool to show how vital he is but he gets 911 calls and guilt trips from his brother before it 's necessary , like at the very beginning of a case.So , while I recommend this show , especially for family viewing and believe it 's well above average , I still ca n't say it 's great .	1
We watched this show every weeek when it was on . Well , may have missed a few . The shows are memorable and we mostly recall them very well and enjoy them as much as the first time . Some things just wear well and this show has something .	1
The storylines in this season are awesome ! **SPOILER**My favorite part of this season is Charlie and Amita finally get together officially .	1
I give this five stars because not only is this series funny , but it is insightful into the nature of governments and bureaucracies . While this show is poking fun at the British government , it would be easy to envision something quite similar in Washington .	1
My favorite characters are Sir Humphrey and the Minister . Sir Humphrey can twist a simple sentence or command of the Minister in such a way that you can not remember the question at all . He is a riot .	1
great series , the casting and acting is terrific . the & # 34 ; yes , prime minister & # 34 ; series is also excellent . anyone who enjoys political satire will like these shows .	1
Rarely do I give a rating like this to anything but British comedy is a weakness of mine and the actors in this series was always first rate .	1
I usually watch a more serious program , but end the night with one episode of this program . The humor puts me in the right frame of mind for a good night 's sleep.Anyone who likes BBC comedy will thoroughly enjoy this program .	1
& # 34 ; Yes Minister & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Yes Prime Minister & # 34 ; are excellent BBC programs . Intelligent , entertaining , enlightening , witty , and fun . The one-breath convoluted statement that bureaucrat Humphrey delivers in each episode is delicious .	1
I bought it and it is on my computer ... I love the ingenuity of these men and the children who went with them . This was a great and inspirational story of survival and the continuity of life , the good life , the healthy life . The actors expression was quite believable and I say it was very well done . Thanks Amazon .	1

This was my intoroduction to sci-fi when I was in 2nd grade . Certain episodes were so vivid that they etched themselves permanently in my memory . Upon watching them again , I see how they are also emotionally appealing and surprisingly sophisticated , both in their science and in the lack of `` feel good '' deus ex machina endings that mar so many otherwise excellent Star Trek stories.I think by far the best story of this lot is `` The Man Who was Never Born '' , which exudes a kind of timeless anguish . It still moves me to think of the deformed Landau , who was truly brilliant . But the `` Architects of Fear '' is also wonderful , with the good man sacrificing himself in vain and communicating his love to his wife from his horribly altered form . They are both tragedies with grand conceptions behind them , truly unique . `` The Galaxy Being '' and `` The Sixth Finger '' are also deeply affecting and believable in their way . These are all timeless themes in hard sci-fi , done extremely well.There are some bad episodes too , but overall the good ones are worth the price of admission . I do not see why some reviewers are angry at the format of splitting season 1 into 2 volumes - it does n't cost more.Warmly recommended as a piece of TV history that still stands on its own as outstanding hard scifi .	1
I bought this episde of the Outer Limits purely from never forgetting watching it back in the 60 's . It was one of my favorites then and still is .	1

I never would have thought I would enjoy a show like this . WOW ... what a show . Honestly , I could do without the foul language and the nudity and in most cases such would cause me to go elsewhere . But this show is one of the BEST crime drama 's I 've ever seen . The main character , Dexter Morgan , is one of the BEST lead characters ever . The supporting cast of characters ( everyone from his sister to girlfriend ( s ) to the many police officers ) are all excellent as well . But wow ... the story is soo good ! It just pulls you in and keeps you wanting more .	1
Michael C Hall , hot off the HBO series Six Feet Under , plays the title character Dexter Morgan in this series from Showrime Entertainment . A crime scene investigator from Miami who is an expert on blood . He also likes to seeking revenge on those criminals who escape the law by loopholes in the justice system . Believe me this is no CSI show ! Created by novelist Jeff Lindsay , Hall and his supporting cast ( including Lauren Velez , James Remar , Julie Benz , and Jennifer Carpenter ) create an interesting portrait of man whose blood is dipped in both worlds . Hall 's baby face showcases an evil side underneath his devilish killer smile . The show is an interesting character study as well as a great murder mystery.There is the Ice Cream truck murderer who is stalking Dexter and leaving killer clues . The mystery unfolds in these 12 episodes and you will be intrigued by the last episode . This is like a good British televsion series , a full complete story unfolded in 12 parts.The extras on the fourth disk are two episodes of Showtime 's The Blotherhood ( which is also available on DVD ) , audio commentary on the 12th episodes , and a true life crime story . Those of you with computer can read the first two chapters of the latest Dexter novel and a download of the Showtime show the Tutors ( soon to be on DVD ) Even without the extras , this is a five star killer show ... its a bloody good time . This , like House , is what great TV is all about ! I can not wait until October for season twoBennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD	1
I just finished watching Dexter : Season 1 and it is phenomenal ! I 'm an avid movie watcher and TV series watcher ! Ive watched all the seasons of CSI Vegas and Law & Order SUV , The Shield ! Dexter is far superior to all of them . Season one starts out good , gets alot better half way through as the characters develop and ends with an amazing season finale ! Showtime hit a homerun with this one ! Im looking forward to Season 2 and have already lent my Season 1 set to a friend !	1
Loved it . I have always wondered what was the hype around this show . Now I know . This show is amazing .	1
I will admit to some hesitation at even wanting to watch this show.I sit in Dialysis 2.5 hours a day 5 days a week . Sitting in Dialysis is hard , the recliner chairs are most uncomfortable having two 15 gage needles stuck in your arm is at best painful . Nor having anyone to talk to is the pits.what i did is bought ( what was at the time ) the only portable blu ray player on the market and started watching blu ray movies.i was told about Dexter by friends and everyone that told me about it loved t. `` it 's about a cop that kills on the side '' they would tell me . after a few of them talked me sensless about it i thought i would try it.I loved it from the first show.Set in Miami , Dexter works for the police department figuring out how blood splatters from the victems of knife or gun shot wounds . but he has a darker side . he himself is a killer . his step father taught him how to channel his instincts and kill thoughs that are `` unworthy to live '' .It ; s dark , often funny , and very bloody . this is not recomended for those that can ' stand people screaming and bleeding a lot . but it is for those that have a dark sense of humor	1
This set has been reviewed extensively so I wo n't get into too much detail except for why I gave it 5 stars . There are a lot of repetitive shows out there , about 100 regarding vampires , another hundred crime or law shows , etc . Yes , this is a crime show but they put a spin on it like no other . A serial killer who kills serial killers , rapists , murderers , etc ? Awesome . The narration is actually amusing . The storytelling is amazing . I love it . It gets my 5 star vote .	1
or those that ca n't stand the sight of blood because it is in abundance in this show . Along with Dexter ( a guy with more skeletons in his closet than a graveyard ) and his repressed memories of a violent tragic indicent early in his life . As the season builds we get to see glimpses of it with more and more being revealed until . It builds up with a face to face confrontation with the Ice Truck Killer ( a few surprises ) abound in the first season finale and it leaves things wide open . For the series and all of its characters.I believe that Season 2 will continue to impress and draw in new folks in the process . Excellent story , lead and supporting characters and backgrounds leaves you with the first season of Dexter . An up and coming show that gives those established shows a serious run for their money .	1
Dexter is an interesting watch . We get the outside looking in as a monster tries to live camouflaged among its unwitting prey . Along the way , we see many layers of psychosis and neurosis flayed away . Maybe there 's more to Dexter than is immediately seen.The story for the first season bares only the most simplistic resemblance to the first novel in the series . Though I 've read the book and watched the show quite a few times , I would be hard-pressed to pick one over the other . The cast is amazing , and the intro sequence tells you everything you need to know about the series.The special features for the DVD set falls to the abysmal side . Slim pickings for commentary tracks , no deleted scenes , but we get a handful of other Showtime series episodes . I do n't know about you , but I bought Dexter to watch Dexter , not to watch episodes of the Tudors or whatever else they threw into the DVD set . And they did all this sans English subtitles ( which matters to a guy like me , being partially deaf ) .The only thing worth while about this set are the 12 episodes of Dexter . If that 's all you are shopping for , go at it . Me , I 'm looking at getting the series on BD and hoping for better material . But the show alone is so good , I ca n't rate this lower than 4 stars .	1
Dexter Morgan is good at his day job , that of a blood spatter analyst in Miami PD 's forensics unit . But he 's bloody brilliant at his other job , the one where he gets to murder . Whatever effed up sitch it was that caused Dexter 's amnesia regarding his early childhood , it 's left him dead inside , an empty shell , a calculating cold fish . He co-exists with something he calls a `` Dark Passenger , '' essentially this urge that compels him to kill and kill . Recognizing the predatory beast inside Dex , his ex-cop foster father , Harry ( James Remar ) , took the boy under his wing , reoriented his twisted appetites to a more productive cause . He instilled in Dex an elaborate code of ethics , taught him to target only other serial killers . He taught Dexter how not to get caught , how to blend in . Dads are awesome . And Dexter has steadfastly abided by the Code of Harry . His kills have been righteous kills.This Showtime adaptation is based on Jeff Lindsay 's riveting series of books , and if you have n't read them , well , what 's the hold up ? Dexter Morgan is so emotionally detached he makes Dr. Temperance Brennan seem positively warm and cuddly . Social cues to which we effortlessly respond are baffling puzzles for him . Perversely , there is something innately likable about Dexter . Michael C. Hall plays him with stunning complexity . It helps that , like in BURN NOTICE , we 're privy to his inner musings . Dexter is often humorous and whimsical . The girlfriend ( Julie Benz ) he pretends to care for does n't suspect a thing . Even Dexter 's jittery , potty-mouthed cop sister , Deb ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , does n't have an inkling.DEXTER THE FIRST SEASON hooks you in straight away as Dexter finds his bragging rights as Miami 's resident monster challenged by an innovative fellow serial killer whom the press eventually dubs the Ice Truck Killer . It 's an edgy cat-and-mouse game that would span the entire season and cause Dexter to ask serious questions of himself . The lovely twist is that Dexter accepts the Ice Truck Killer 's tauntings with glee , perhaps like calling to like . For Dexter , it 's an opportunity to play with someone just like him . Never mind that it 's readily apparent that this rival knows everything about Dexter Morgan . Dexter shrugs this off . He 's having fun.The Ice Truck Killer 's modus operandi is eye-catching . He drains his victims completely of their blood and he freezes the corpses , amputates their limbs to a precise measurement . It 's fun - and creepy - watching Dexter try to contain his excitement as each perfect frozen body part surfaces , each bit a gauntlet thrown in Dexter 's mug.Most each episode also features a `` serial killer of the week '' motif , some heinous repeat murderer targeted and eventually carved up by Dexter , and these lesser villains are required so that we do n't lose faith in Dex as a badasss dude , given his inability to track down the elusive Ice Truck Killer . It 's a pretty good supporting cast , too . It was n't long before I was keen into what these other characters were up to . Jennifer Carpenter is my second favorite actor on this show . She is one sexy , combustible , never-stop-cussing cop chick . But I do question her instincts . She 's Miami PD - an ex-Vice , newly minted Homicide Detective - and yet in all these years she has n't caught a whiff of her adopted brother 's true nature ? And then she does something else which ends up absolutely mortifying . And then there 's Erik King whose angry , loose cannon character , Sgt . Doakes , is the only one who gets the heebie jeebies from Dexter . Doakes bullies Dexter so much , I sort of wish Dexter would just disregard the Code of Harry for once . Except that Dexter remains as cool as the other side of the pillow . He 's a monster who 's got his priorities straight . You need to not miss this show . It 's wicked funny , cleverly written , and terrifically acted ( especially by Michael C. Hall ) . Rife with moral ambivalence , DEXTER rewards its audience with unexpected - and frequently unsettling - moments . And you 're hooked before you know it.The DVD set 's bonus features : - 2 Audio Commentaries by the Cast & Producers : `` Return to Sender '' ( with Jennifer Carpenter , David Zayas , Lauren Velez , and Erik King ) and `` Born Free '' ( with producers Sara Coleton , Clyde Philips , & Daniel Cerone ) - `` The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course '' - `` Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation '' - feature on a real-life police investigation in 2001 with particulars on blood spatter analysis- 2 Free Episodes of Showtime 's Hit series BROTHERHOOD- A computer-compatible function which allows you to stream two episodes of THE TUDORS , to read the First 2 Chapters of Jeff Lindsay 's newest novel DEXTER IN THE DARK , and play the newest CSI Video Game `` CSI : HARD EVIDENCE '' - Cast Biographies	1
Had a friend who loaned me season 1 , and after watching it I ordered seasons 2-4.This show has plenty of drama , to many twist 's and turns to figure out what 's next . Lot 's of humor ( you ca n't help but like Dexter 's one liners ! ) Just waiting for season 5 to come available !	1
What a clever premise ! A sociopath with serial killer tendencies is spotted at a very early age by a seasoned police officer ( while the child is up for adoption ) . The Officer adopts the child and takes the opportunity to carefully ingrain in him that he is ONLY to kill others like him ... serial killers ... .who have managed to slip through the system and remain free . Dexter learns to be one of the best blood spatter experts at the police station.This is extraordinarily interesting as Dexter narrates his inner most thoughts , and we get to learn how a sociopath , with no empathy or understanding of how `` normal '' people feel , navigates through society mimicking how people behave . That is fascinating . The acting is dead-on and the writing is crisp and taught . My ONLY issue with this series is the foul , gutter mouth of Dexter 's sister ... it is so extreme that it feels like slaps in the face.Really good television .	1
This concerns only the first season of this series and I know some of the things will not seem right to those who have watched the next seasons . But that is just the point . The first season has characteristics that will change later and the meaning will change too . I will keep within the very limits of that first season . What we gather from the first episodes is that this blood technician working for the Miami PD is the adopted son of a police officer . He was adopted at the age of four by this police officer because he had been traumatized by the killing of his mother with a chain saw by some drug dealers . At once the series insists on the fact that this trauma caused an irreversible damage in the psyche of the child who is fascinated by death and needs killing just like junkies need their drugs . He is addicted to inflicting death to other people . We will only learn quite late in this season who his real father was , after his death actually , so we will never know the man really . We will not be given in this season any detail about the death of the mother beyond what I have said . And all the detail that comes up now and then is always flashbacks in the memory of the child that Dexter was . Dexter recovers that memory little by little just like any child or even adult would do in the case of a traumatic event . His foster father just tried to bring this death impulse of his within some acceptable limits , within a certain code : you can kill but to survive hence you have to kill people who are just plain dirty ( I sort of remember this is the code of Anne Rice 's vampires ) . And that 's what he has been taught and trained to do . First hide your impulse . Second pick the proper criminals . Third do it so professionally that you can never be suspected . This ideology then is very typical . You can survive any trauma if you know what you are , if you accept what you are and if you find out why you are what your are . When you finally know , then you are clear . The term comes from Hubbard but it is the one that is needed here . It may change later . This concept of clarity is doubled then with the Skinnerian concept of absolute determination of your whole being and future by the mould into which you have been cast in the very first years of your life . In this case , Dexter is a killer because of his trauma that happened when he was four , hence he will be a killer all his life . No one can change that . One can only teach the kid a code , a method , an art to do things along a certain ethical line and not to be caught . That is pessimistic but that is not the main interest of this first season . The main interest is that another serial killer , the Ice Truck Killer , though not being a copy cat , is obviously aiming at this Dexter . And his crimes that are very special in their style , method and delivery are there to titillate Dexter , to chase or bait Dexter into a trap or a corner . Little by little we will learn the connection between the two and that I wo n't reveal . In the end Dexter will have the upper hand and kill his competitor , along his own method , more or less . The second interest of this series is how Dexter can keep his secret for himself in his own private life , hiding it from the women he is going along with , from his own sister ( foster sister for sure but sister anyway ) , from his direct colleagues , from his department , etc . It is subtle and difficult and there the actor is doing quite a good job , though the series is more building the meaning with the environment of the character than with the acting of the actor . As usual in American series the actors are rather static and the stage director , the series director and the set designer are building around him or her a composed visual moving environment that builds the meaning of the expression or speech of the actor . Note in this case most of the discourse of the main actor is his own voice over the pictures . He is telling us a story and it is often a commentary of what we can see . The next and essential quality of this series is of course the real artistic and artful suspense that is built in each episode and in the twelve episodes of the season and that lets us absolutely breathless most of the time , even when we finally know who the Ice Truck Killer is , and then the suspense does not go down one iota . In other words this series is so far , first season only , Dionysian , quick , fast , dense , exhilarating , inebriating , intoxicating and many other things of that sort . In one word it is addictive and habit forming . You may , if you have ten hours and a half at your disposal watch the twelve episodes in one go and you will never be bored , tired , de-concentrated . Try it and you will like it I am sure.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne , University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines , CEGID	1
Do n't get me wrong , its an entertaining show , and at 20 bucks , you should definitely grab it . To compare it to shows like Six Feet Under is absolutely ridiculous though . The idea of Dexter being a sociopath is not exploited to its full potential , IMO . Too much of the time he blends in so much you forget all about it , then you have to be reminded by forced voice overs and flashbacks . This is a good DVD set though , I see lots of folks complaining about the transfer . What can I say , do n't spend 50 zillion bucks on your TV/Home theatre and you wo n't be so disappointed . For 20 bones you get 12 doses of Dexter , AND two episodes of Brotherhood , and one of The Tudors if you have the time to screw around with the PC feature . Not bad considering that people were lining up out the door to fork over 100 bucks for The Sopranos not too long ago .	1
a relative recommended this show to me , and I 'm glad she did ( because since I do n't subscribe to Showtime ) ... I was n't aware that this series existed , until recently . Thankfully , Netflix took care of that little problem for me.Dexter plays a vigilante of sorts , a hero with a very dark side ... he gives justice to those that the criminal justice system ca n't find or put behind bars.Michael Hall is a great actor , balancing a killer on the one hand and a likeable , lovable professional forensics expert on the other ... ..as he interacts in his various relationships.The show has comedy , drama , tension ... .it had just about everything ... I guess one would label this a `` dark comedy '' type of series . Very dark.All the other characters in the show are interesting and fun to watch , and we see the dramas played out in their life through the eyes of Dex.This is a truly original series that hooked me quickly with its stories and interesting characters- highly recommended !	1
This is the introduction season . They want us to learn about the characters and take an interest in them.Dexter is a sociopath serial killer . Adopted and raised by a police officer , Dexter learned to appear `` normal '' .Training as a forensic specialist , coupled with his Father 's training keeps his killings from official notice.Set in Miami , Dexter works for the police helping them solve cases . Along the way , Dexter kills the bad people that have beaten the system.This season revolves around `` The Ice Truck Killer '' and how this affects Dexter.The humor is dark . The dialog is witty and cutting . The acting is above average , no one is miscast and all work well together.The story line is not overly complex . If you think about it , you will see where the story is going . Even with that , it is fun.If you find the idea of a serial killer working for the cops funny , you should enjoy this .	1
Well , I have to say , when I heard about this show ... ..I detested the idea , thought it was gloryfiying serial killers ... .SWORE I would never watch ... ... happened to be trapped working out and watching TV when a episode came on ... .I thought Meh ... .just get it over with ... .well I was hooked from the first scene ... .I could n't hardly wait for the next weeks episode , so I decided to give in to my `` dark side '' ... .lol ... and buy the first and second season . I REALLY like this show , it is slick , entertaining , innovative , well written and acted ... ..over all as stated in the title this is just a BRILLIANT show and I am really glad I was forced to give it a chance and not miss out on this stellar show !	1
I have read the entire series of Dexter novels and was pleasantly surprised to find out that Showtime has dramatized the series . Ye potential readers and viewers , be aware ! ! The Showtime series differs from the books in several ways . The ending of the first book and the first series are not the same . The TV version fleshes out the other characters , such as Rita . the girlfriend and the police lieutenant , La Guerta and introduces a new character in the person of Esme . The book is an intense ride within Dexter 's mind with a focus on his relationship with his Dark Passenger . The details of his relationships with other humans are not as detailed as in the series.Having said this , I highly recommend both . It will be interesting to see how Showtime adapts the second novel.I think Showtime has done a great job of casting in this series . I remember Michael Hall from `` Six Feet Under '' and I think he makes a perfect Dexter.Also , CBS is now showing Showtime 's Dexter on Sunday evenings at 10 pm . It cuts too much from the Showtime series for my taste , but it is better than most of the junk on TV .	1
If you do n't start out liking it keep on watching it gets better . Below are my ratings of each individual season.Season 1 : 7/10Season 2 : 8/10Season 3 : 6/10Season 4 : 10/10Season 5 : 9/10Season 6 : 9/10Season 7 : 10/10Season 8 ( the final season ) is hopefully good .	1
This is absolutely one of the most original series around . No surprise there because Dexter first appeared in book form ( see link below ) . If someone had told me I would be riveted by a book written from the viewpoint of a serial killer , well ... I would never believe it . But Dexter was almost ... loveable and he has a certain morality , believe it or not.The series is different but I found it equally intriguing and quirky.Here 's the real irony in this series : someone who is so far from having normal human traits , who really does n't understand love or sexual attraction , can reveal insights into what it means to be human in a way that a more stereotypical series does n't . It is similar to the way the dark parts of paintings illuminate the light , each complimenting the other . Dexter is dark but he is n't simplistic and he has a wry sense of humor.I was pleased that some of what had attracted me to the books managed to get on screen as well , including Dexter 's unique humor and a certain presence that resonates from page to film . That pleased me . What is most amazing to me is how this series actually reverberated emotionally and touched my life in ways I never believed possible , considering the focus of the series.This could have been a flop . It was a brave move to put something like this on the air and I feared ( before I saw the first episode ) that the depth and complexity of Dexter , hiding beneath that slick , seemingly inhuman surface , would be lost . But my fears were groundless , thank goodnes.Dearly Devoted DexterDexter in the Dark : A NovelDarkly Dreaming Dexter	1
Always thought serial killers are scum but I kinda like having Dexter around just to even things out , balance the bad with the ... whatever .	1
The acting the writing the concept ... ..it has great replayability as well for viewing a second time . It 's like silance of the lambs/six feet under/CSI all rolled into one quality show .	1
4.7 starsThis show is excellent mainly due to the tight bond Hall makes with this character . I 'm not crazy about any of the acting here except Hall 's , but he 's flawless throughout , bringing a subtlety that few actors on the big or small screens ever master to this degree.Nearly every episode is well-written , paced , and directed ; the season arc is a good one and plays out nicely , no need for spoilers here ! It does get a little gory at times , but the series is about a serial killer , after all . I have some very queasy thoughts about why a series this twisted is so popular , but I guess it 's just another Clint-type revenge drama where psychopathic violence is justified by ( a vaguely ) moral imperative ; we do need our foreign policy to start somewhere.Hall is even better here than in Six Feet Under , where he was superb . He carries Dexter effortlessly on his shoulders , but one can feel the amount of work and care he 's put into this role . It 's as impressive as Gandolfini 's Tony Soprano , and that 's saying a lot . As is usual for most of the best cable dramas , the first season seems to be the best , so savor this one if watching it for the first time.Miami has n't looked this good and this bad since Michael Mann was in town .	1
I love Dexter , who knew being so bad could be so good . love the concept of the show , its something different for me to watch with all the detective shows out there . Would most surely recommend . The show is about a serial killer who only kills bad people and serial killers .	1
The first few seasons really shine , Dexter is a fresh storyline , with suspenseful plots , and great acting . This show stands head & shoulders above most of what else is out there .	1
Dexter is the most amazing , clever , funny , dark and thrilling program I 've almost ever seen . It is brilliant and unique and interesting and thoroughly enjoyable . The fact that we can actually like a serial killer is amazing in itself.Michael C Hall is fantastic as Dexter . He is intelligent , lost , and almost unable to feel love for another human . The story lines are chilling and keep you on the edge of your seat - you are always guessing . The writing is superb and witty and smart . I never read Jeff Lindsays books , but now I think I 'll go buy them and read cover to cover.Trust me ; this show is one that grabs you and wo n't let go till the ride is over . Just when you think you have things figured out , they might take a different turn . It 's addictive and one of the best programs you 'll ever see . It 's great and I love this .	1
I loved Michael C. Hall in Six Feet Under so I was excited when he chose to do another cable TV show . This show turned out to be even better than Six Feet Under . Michael C. Hall plays a serial killer who kills only bad people . This creates a moral ambiguity that the show plays up nicely . Is Dexter a good or bad person ? How do we really feel about him ? How does he really feel about himself ? At the time we are exploring the story , Dexter is evolving from a character who states he lacks human feeling to someone who seems to feel more and more with each passing day ( or episode ) . The show is brilliantly done . I 've read the book and it is a pretty straight forward story . To build the story up , the writers of the show build up the characters and made them even deeper characters . I am just so impressed with the work . They can even make me angry because I 'm so involved and one of my major characters is affected in some way . I am attracted to Dexter and repelled by him at the same time .	1
Showtime 's creative and terrific series of DEXTER is so fresh and uber-cool that we just have to applaud everyone who works on this awesome cable TV series.It is so rare to watch a television show that rivals or even feels like you are reading a rich novel . Usually they screw it up , whether it be Hollywood big screen adaptations of the Sci-Fi channel - they all usually suck eggs.But not Showtime ! They are currently way better than HBO . With the richness of feel and look at the miami-based Dexter , the actors and writers here truly shine above most others of all arenas of television and/or Box Office standards.And the 2nd season thus far is just as good - if not better !	1
Television has been called a vast wasteland . I 've heard people rant and rave for years about having so many channels and nothing to watch on TV . And then I started looking at two things . The first was my television watching schedule which has actually begun cutting into my DVD watching schedule ( so little time , so much to watch ) . Then I looked at my shelving unit and noticed the number of TV series collections there . People are wrong . There is plenty good to watch on TV . And DEXTER is an example of it.For those who are n't aware , DEXTER is a series on Showtime , so many of you might not have seen it . If that 's the case you 're in luck because the series has been released on DVD . While season two has just hit shelves in blu-ray format , the focus here is season one.Dexter Morgan ( Michael C. Hall ) is a forensics blood splatter expert for the Miami police department . His job is to help collect and understand evidence found at the scene of a crime that involves blood and blood splatter patterns . Oh , and on the side , Dexter is a serial killer.Stay with me here because he 's not a bad guy really . Well ... then again maybe he is . After all he is a murderer multiple times over . The difference is that Dexter only kills bad guys . Dexter kills murderers , pedophiles , arsonists and the like that got off due to some technicality . But he always verifies that they were guilty before taking them out of the picture.Dexter 's foster father Harry ( James Remar ) was a police man who found Dexter at the scene of a crime before adopting him . Harry recognized the killing instinct found in Dexter at an early age so he helped him to channel that , to use rules that he established for Dexter , to get through life . And via Harry 's rules , Dexter now kills bad guys using his job as a means to find just the right victims.So there is the basic set up for the series . But it 's so much more than that , filled with layer upon layer of subtext and inner meaning that is revealed as the series progresses.Season one focuses first on letting us know who Dexter is and who the surrounding cast of characters involved with him are . First off is his sister Deb ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , a seemingly spastic patrol officer dying to become a homicide detective . Deb 's enthusiasm for the job is off set by her self deprecating ways and the giddiness she exhibits for all things.At the stations there are two main characters who affect Dexter . The first is Lt. Maria Laguerta ( Lauren Velez ) his direct supervisor who at times seems to have a personal interest in Dexter . A woman who 's made it where she is by hard work , she has a storyline of her own involving police office politics as the series progresses.The second is Sgt . James Doakes ( Eric King ) , Dexter 's apparent nemesis . Doakes is a hard boiled cop from top to bottom , a no nonsense sort who wants answer and wants them now . Doakes is constantly badgering Dexter , offering everything from name calling to in your face attitude . One would think that eventually the two of them would reach a point where there would n't be room for both of them in Miami . One would think.Along with these major players there is an assortment of cast members in the squad who round out the ensemble in the best way possible . And each gets enough screen time in season one to make them a character to care about . The interaction between them on a personal level comes into play as the layers of Dexter unravel.On the personal side , Dexter actually has a girlfriend . Normal on the outside , but not within . It seems Dexter has taken her as his girlfriend to help appear normal . It is through his thoughts ( voice over into Dexter 's mind runs throughout the series ) concerning her that he lets us know he is devoid of emotion , that he has no feelings . His involvement with her is purely as a means to offer him cover.Rita ( Julie Bienz ) is a battered wife , or at least she was . Dexter 's sister was on call when her ex was arrested . Paul , her ex , was a wife beater extreme and a drug user to boot . Now in prison , he gets release part way into season one and a subplot here involving him trying to reinsert himself into his family 's life crosses Dexter 's life as well.With characters and plot lines established , you would expect the series to kick off with Dexter showing what he can do . Instead , Dexter finds himself in a competition of sorts when a new serial killer hits Miami . And this killer is leaving calling cards that Dexter not only finds discomforting but amazing as well . He 's impressed with the style and artistic ability of the killer who leaves his victims in pieces and drained of blood.As each episode continues the tale , we find that this new killer referred to as the Ice Truck Killer ( when it 's discovered that he uses one to haul victims from their murder location to where he leaves their bodies ) knows something about Dexter . He leaves small clues at first for Dexter to find . Eventually he leaves Polaroid 's of Dexter 's past as well . It seems that the perfect serial killer is being stalked by his own serial killer.Season one not only defines who the character of Dexter is it offers the world he lives in and tosses in his biggest match to boot . How Dexter became who he is and what influences him is told in flashback . His motivations are shown by the end of this season as is the identity of the Ice Truck Killer . But will that change who Dexter is ? Doubtful since season four begins soon.What makes this show so unique is that it combines one of the most frightening characters one can imagine , a soul less who cares serial killer , with one of the wittiest funny line spouting people seen on TV . Dexter tosses off subtle one liners non-stop and each one offers a glimpse behind the mask and a laugh as well.But the amazing thing is that not only do we find ourselves repulsed and attracted to the same character , we find in the writing that there is more to him than is even he realizes . The character of Dexter may think he possesses no emotions whatsoever but his emotions run deeper than he realizes . And it seems as though his journey of self revelation may be what 's driving the series forward in later seasons.Also Dexter offers something that many of us would never want to admit we seek . An avenging angel out there doing what so many would love to know is going on but at the same time turn their head and condemn on the outside . Like Jack Bauer of `` 24 '' , a hero who uses tactics we claim to hate while hoping someone like him exists to protect us , Dexter is the privately admired solution for those who feel that the worst of criminals are let lose on technicalities . We would fear someone like Dexter while at the same time would love to see someone who does n't let the bad guy get away with murder . Even though this is what Dexter does , murder.There is no way to offer up in this short space just what it is that Dexter is about . Police procedural . Police politics . Serial killer . Murder mystery . Family complexities . Killing tutorial . Hilarious dark comedy . All are a part of Dexter and all come together in a fantastic package.If you 're not afraid to try something a little different , then you need to give Dexter a try . I know the season one set I watch belonged to my son . After watching I intend to get a copy of my own . And to continue with it down the line . I 'm already hard at work watching season two on blu-ray to write about . Unusual , quirky , off beat , scary , normal ... all are words that define Dexter . And yet none can explain what this series is all about . Watch and see .	1
Who knew a serial killer could be so charming ?	1
Once you watch one , it will be tough to stop watching them . Great mix of having a per episode mystery of sorts and having a season long build-up .	1
Wow ! I finally watched my very first episode of `` Dexter '' last weekend , and I ended up finishing Season 1 in its entirety within a few days . This is an amazing show about Dexter ( Michael C. Hall ) , a Miami-based forensics experts who also happens to be a serial killer . However , Dexter is a NICE serial killer in that he has a strict moral code that he always adheres to : He only kills people who are violent criminals themselves and deserve to be punished . The first season of `` Dexter '' revolves around another serial killer that 's been terrorizing the state of Florida . The Ice Truck Killer has a nasty habit of murdering prostitutes , cutting them up into pieces , and arranging their bodies artfully in very public places . Dexter works with members of the police department , including his adopted sister , Deb ( Jennifer Carter ) , to find the killer . However , Dexter ca n't help being fascinated by the Ice Truck Killer 's meticulous technique . He soon begins communicating with the killer , who seems to have an uncanny connection to Dexter and starts using his murders to trigger painful , repressed memories from Dexter 's past.I became hooked on this show very quickly . Hall is amazing as Dexter , who is probably one of the most complex characters in television history . The supporting cast is excellent , especially Carter , Erik King as Sergeant Doakes ( the only person who suspects Dexter of any wrongdoing ) , and James Remar , who portrays Dexter 's father in flashbacks . I 'm not particularly fond of Rita 's character ( portrayed by Julie Benz ) . She 's incredibly wishy-washy , but I can definitely see why Dexter was drawn to someone with her personality . I also think the whole Ice Truck Killer identity revelation , intriguing as it was , could have been a bit less obvious . ( I figured out his real identity and true connection to Dexter right away , so either the story was a bit too predictable or I am just incredibly brilliant . ) Overall , though , `` Dexter '' is a very unique and compelling show . I have no idea how the program will manage to surpass its first season , but I ca n't wait to find out .	1
I had never seen Dexter before not having showtime but after seeing the show on a regular station I was hooked and ordered the first season , loved it and am waiting for the second season which I ordered to ship . It 's definitely addictive . The show is well written you actually like this serial killer	1
Sometimes I find connections to Hollywood in the strangest places . In the case of Dexter , it was at my day job . Now my office job is not normally the place one associates with a show like Dexter , but it turns out that the sister of the guy I worked with worked on the show . The fact that the show is on Showtime and thus can portray gore and violence as appropriate to the medium ( like HBO 's Rome , for example ) piqued my curiosity . Unfortunately , it took me over a year to actually view season one . I 'm sorry I waited so long.I 've done enough research on serial killers ( and their fictional cousin , slashers ) to know that they 're easy to mess up . And an entire season about a serial killer from the serial killer 's perspective is fraught with peril . Fortunately , Dexter hits all the right notes to keep an audience engaged for the entire season.Dexter Mogran ( Michael C. Hall ) is a serial killer with a cause . His father , Harry ( James Remar ) recognized his adopted son 's homicidal tendencies and trained him to stalk the most despicable of prey . These were the lowest of the low , the scum that Harry in his job as a cop saw frequently escape justice . Dexter became a Final Solution of sorts , eliminating people neatly and efficiently while at the same time fulfilling insatiable desire for bloodshed . Literally.In his day job , Dexter is a blood spatter analyst . He works side-by-side with his adopted sister , Debra ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , probably the most annoying character in the show . And yet , she 's annoying on purpose - her frail , waif-like reactions to men and the rigors of her job make her alternately pathetic and vulnerable , feral and misguided . In short , she needs Dexter 's calm , creepy presence . Rounding out the cast is career-climbing Maria Laguerta ( Lauren Velez ) , coworkers Angel Batista ( David Zayas ) and Vince Masuka ( C.S . Lee , formerly of the show Chuck ) and my favorite character , foul-mouthed Sergeant James Doakes ( Erik King ) . Doakes is the only person who sees Dexter for what he is , but he ca n't prove it.Dexter feigns a personal life as well . He has a girlfriend , Rita Bennett ( Julie Benz ) , whose last relationship was so emotionally scarring that she fears intimacy , which suits Dexter just fine . Indeed , all of Dexter 's life is an act , from the jokes he cracks to the donuts he brings to the pleasantries he exchanges with Rita . He 's a monster masquerading as a person , and the only reason it 's not more obvious is because everyone else has more pressing problems.Dexter 's job puts him in a unique position to both appreciate the art of the kill and find new victims . Despite his penchant for murdering his victims , Dexter 's murders are relatively clean - he drains his victims of blood , hacks the pieces up , and tosses them into the ocean . And so it goes : find some sleazeball who escaped justice , kidnap him or her , murder , dump the body , repeat . Until one day , another serial killer who seems to know intimate details about Dexter 's past begins sending messages through his own unique style of doll-like murders.The ending of season one wo n't be a shock to observant viewers . It 's not the actual ending that matters but the journey getting there . Dexter 's narration is amusing and wry , his cadence just off enough that he comes across as disturbed yet functional . Surprisingly , the show is n't very gory at all . Dexter would probably be less sympathetic if we were subjected to every grisly detail . In fact , by cutting away from the most gruesome scenes , Dexter has to remind us that he 's one of the bad guys - the Code of Harry is as much the anti-hero 's code that we see in a multitude of other crime-fighting shows . It 's a credit to the writers that Dexter is both a monstrous , damaged human being and yet still human.Ca n't wait for season two !	1
This is the leader of the pack in terms of Showtime 's original series . This is the only show they have that I feel can compete with HBO . The acting and writing are amazing , especially Michael C. Hall ( who got an Emmy and Screen Actors Guild nomination for this part ) .If you can handle the macabre , allow yourself to enter Dexter 's world . You might find it hard to leave until the first season is over .	1
Dexter has finally made his Blu-Ray debut , and the glossy , well-made series looks wonderful in the format . Besides some relatively small BD-Live features ( including seeing the first episode the third season ) , there really is n't anything here that was n't on the standard-def version of the Complete First Season , but for Blu-Ray owners who have n't taken the plunge into Dexter 's world , this is definitely worth checking out . Below is my original review for first season.The interesting concept of this Showtime series makes it reason enough to check it out . Michael C. Hall ( Six Feet Under ) plays the title character , who works in forensics for the Florida police by day , and is a serial killer at night . Because of his job and upbringing by a police officer foster father ( James Remar ) , Dexter knows how to cover his tracks while wearing his mask of humanity by day . Slowly though , things start to take a turn when another serial killer with connections to Dexter 's own mysterious past rears his head , and soon enough our title character is caught in a bloody game of cat and mouse . What makes Dexter so good is the approach taken to the theme of the series by the creators and Hall himself . What could have easily flopped and failed miserably instead evolves episode by episode as we attempt to see what makes Dexter tick . The rest of the cast is excellent as well to say the least . Julie Benz ( the vampiric Darla from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel ) is superb as Rita : Dexter 's rape victim girlfriend whom he keeps around so he does n't have to bother with sex , HBO 's Oz veterans Lauren Velez and David Zayas as fellow cops , and hottie Jennifer Carpenter ( whom Hall has recently married , seriously ) as Dexter 's sister . Not since Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer has there been an interesting and above all chilling glimpse into the mind of a madman that walks among us . Spectacular , and definitely worth picking up even if you never caught the show on Showtime during it 's first season run .	1
Coming off some serious withdrawals from both Six Feet Under and The Sopranos ( the only reason I subscribed to HBO ) , I took a `` stab '' at Dexter . It took a couple of episodes for me to warm up to the character , but I did.I soon found myself rooting for a serial-killer who works for the cops which , to me anyway , means the writing is pretty good . The setting of post-Miami-Vice Miami is a visually interesting backdrop - although a little too much at times . Dexter has my interest and I 'm devouring DVD after DVD as fast as they can be delivered . So far , it 's scratchin ' my itch for a solid cable series .	1
OK , so the show has some major flaws , its not well written , nor particularly well acted . Dexter is still entertaining and very addictive . It is definitely a & # 34 ; god , its already 1AM , ok , just one more episode & # 34 ; show.Taking a step back after watching it , Dexter is way too capable ( getting evidence from the garbage disposal in 3 minutes ? ) , the plot lines are 'predictably unpredictable & # 34 ; ... but all the same , put the blinders on and enjoy , I did	1
One of the best seasons of Dexter besides 4 and 7 in my opinion . With a great villain and awesome story this was a perfect start for everyone 's new favorite serial killer .	1
I guess my biggest complaint about DEXTER is that it is n't nasty ENOUGH . The premise if phenomenal ... Dexter is a blood-spatter expert investigating murders by day and a murdered of killers by night . By channeling his impulses to kill in a `` helpful '' way ... he is actually a hero . I know , I know , anyone who kills is bad ... but seriously , the people Dexter knocks off are mostly brutal serial-killers themselves ... killers who knock off children and other innocents . Dexter is doing the world a favor . And that 's the problem ... he is so meticulous in who he kills that his dark side is really never more than a naughty wink . There 's no real ethical dilemma for the viewer in rooting for Dexter.But do n't get me wrong ... the show is a blast nonetheless . From it 's super-saturated Florida colors , to its sly & witty narration , the show is top-notch and very entertaining . Michael C. Hall is perfect as DEXTER . While his performance is n't exactly a tour-de-force of evil ( like Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS , for example ) ... it is a lovely , inventive performance . He brings nuance to the role of a guy who has to fake smiling ... and because we know he 's faking , we 're kinda in on the joke . We can be `` amused '' along with Dexter at his ability to fool most of society into liking him.The only true `` dark side '' to Dexter is his inability to love . He has a girlfriend , but only to help himself look normal . He is very good to her and her kids , and the poor girl ( damaged from a previous , abusive marriage ) just adores Dexter in return . But he does n't really have feelings for her , and this colors all their scenes together . This is the ethical quandary that I wish Dexter 's killings also had.The other thing I really like about the show are the flashbacks , showing Dexter being raised and groomed for his work by a very understanding foster father , who happens to be a cop . James Remar plays this part so well ... it 's probably the best role this long-time character actor has ever had . It 's a small part , but he brings great strength to it . And great love and concern for Dexter . You always hear that parents will do ANYTHING to protect their kids ... Remar 's character is the ultimate example of this.Also , the opening credits of the show are AWESOME ! ! Creepy and clever.So , while the show , to me , is n't perfect ( I would prefer it a little darker ) , it is still HUGELY entertaining , well-acted by its lead and well-filmed for a relatively low budget . If it sounds like your cup of tea , I think you 'll like it a lot . If the basic premise turns you off ... then do n't even bother watching !	1
Season one sets the tone , pace and wildly engrossing phenomenon known as 'Dex ' ; a doughnut buying , deftly sincere serial killer who lives by a code.I 'm often asked 'how can you watch a show about a serial killer ? & # 34 ; Easy , if the plots are interwoven , the circumstances bizarre and the outcomes unpredictable . I hope it stays off network TV , they do n't deserve Dexter .	1
I love this show . It definitely creates a yin and yang to the serial killer persona . Plan on ordering the other seasons . Item arrived on time , packaged well and as expected .	1
Honestly was surprised how watching a serial killer who kills other serial killers sucks a person into the show so easily .	1
To this day I still believe the 1st season is still the best season out of all the dexters . The future seasons tend to drag on too much and dexter does n't get enough kills by taking out bad people from the world . The first season has nearly one bad person in each episode that dexter eliminates but as the season progresses to 2,3,4,5,6 etc you find that Dexter starts to get bored and is surrounded by so much life drama bull crap that he ca n't even kill anymore bad guys !	1
... I dont know what it is . It would be easy to drop the ball on this subject and make a bad series . It is , after all , something that most people ( fortunately ) have little knowledge about , and it could attempt to be written for the masses , and `` dumbed-down '' . But its not.Dexter is chilling , but in an informative , eye-opening way that a good documentary does . Michael C. Hall , who I thought was pretty wooden in Six Feet Under , plays the conflicted sociopath brilliantly . A strong supporting cast strengthens and already strong show.I realize that being sympathetic to a seriel killer seems counter-intuitive , but it is the intelligence of the writers that draws you in to Dexter 's world . You ALMOST feel bad for the guy for the hand he 's been dealt , and SOMEWHAT admirable for the way he 's made lemonade out of his life 's lemons.This show could n't exist on network TV , and like many other `` rawer '' shows , needs a lot of room to run . I 'm interested to see how far they can take this series from a consistency standpoint , but if S2 and S3 are a fraction of S1 's quality , I 'll be there for the ride .	1
This Showtime series stars Michael C. Hall as a sociopathic serial killer who targets only individuals he feels deserve his attention because of loopholes in the justice system . Dexter is an expert on crime- scene blood splatters . We often see him at crime scenes as the police and forensic experts put together how a crime was committed.Dexter is a sullen , strange guy who does his job well but has trouble relating to people . In Season One , we learn his backstory . His father , sensing an unnatural desire in his son to kill , councils the boy on how to channel his feelings so that innocent people are n't harmed . These scenes reminded me of a superhero `` origins '' tale . Depending on how you look at it , Dexter is either a hero who rids society of reprehensible , murderous villains , or an elusive criminal whose killing rampage must be stopped . One thing , however , is certain . Dexter is very cool , and is unlike any character on television . Hall heads a fine cast in a sort of `` Law and Order '' series with a touch of the Grand Guignol . Blu-ray bonus extras include the featurettes `` The Academy of Blood - A Killer Course '' and `` Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation , '' and the first episode of `` Dexter , '' Season Three .	1
Dexter Morgan - blood Spatter Expert and Serial Killer . He 's been living a double life for a while now and has kept that paart of himself shelves and out of the way . The only person who knew was someone from his past , and that person taught him a great many things on staying alive in such a mad world . Dexter also has a squad of people aroudn him you will get to know , a sister you will get to know even more , and a case you will grow to love featuring The Ice Truck Killer . In this episode we see Dexter ( and see the overlap better book 1 and this season ) and the way he sees blood , not to mention the Dark Passenger . We also see the ITK and the way he kills and the way Dexter admires the person 's style.Its like living in Dahlmerland - that 's how the book put it - except there are no rides ( thank goodness ) .M.C . Hall is the PERFECT Dexter . After 3 seasons of him I can say he is the reason that Dexter connects with people and is not a monster to us . Watch the show - you will see . Jennifer C - his sister Deb - is also a unique personality here and you will grow to enjoy her . She has a sailor 's mouth and keeps in shape and loves to pick the wrong type of people . She plays it to a tee . And the rest of the cast are great as well and , if you think you know how it all ends because you read the book , you are wrong . The book and this are different in a lot of ways AND the end is a strong part of it . So , readers , watch this as well.Closing this up , the twists and turns are great and learning about Dexter 's past is a wild ride . You learn a lot in this season , too , and you see how Dexter was `` made . '' You also see other things , bits that are spooky and the things he does away with , making you wonder exactly what the Dark Passenger is doing riding shotgun with Dexter.So many rules - so many graves . He is in the perfect place to be himself , that 's for sure .	1
A Showtime production , Dexter is an anomaly . It is a brilliantly written , intriguing , and totally engrossing series , that is seldom predictable . Besides a compelling storyline , and characters that seem real , what makes the series even more unique , is that the protagonist , Dexter Morgan ( Michael C. Hall ) , a blood spatter expert for the Miami police , is a cold blooded murderer.Hall 's unusual role is the key to the series , and his performance is a riveting , and captivating character study , that makes Dexter a very hard show to turn away from . Morgan is guided by the ` Code of Harry ' . Harry ( James Remar ) was Dexter 's adoptive father , an ex-cop who recognized that his traumatized son , had homicidal tendencies . To help him survive , Harry trained Dexter to channel his desire to kill in a 'positive ' direction , by instilling the directive to kill only those who truly deserve to die . This twisted morality is quite bizarre , and makes for fascinating viewing , as Dexter kills ceremoniously.Presumably to contain any spilled blood , plastic sheeting is typically spread all around the area , and Dexter himself is also covered with plastic sheeting . Victims are taped down naked to a table top face up , helpless and unable to move . After drawing a blood sample for his collection , Dexter gets to work . The dead body is chopped into pieces , and the remains placed in trash bags . Few of the grisly details are actually shown , but the presentation is still pretty chilling . The series has a wicked sense of humor , as Dexter discusses his thoughts through narration , as he nonchalantly goes about his business , which includes murder . Harry is dead , but appears frequently , in flashbacks . Harry 's biological daughter Debra ( Jennifer Carpenter ) , also works for the Miami PD in homicide . She is eager , enthusiastic , loves to swear , and has a problem with authority.The twelve episodes play like a chapters in a book . Unlike most weekly series , the format does not always involve solving a particular case within the episode . Instead , the story unfolds broadly and more naturally , with information about Dexter and his past , coming in small bits . Dexter is dealing with coming to terms with his emotions , or lack thereof , and watching how this affects the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend Rita ( Julie Benz ) , is fascinating . Benz 's performance is pretty amazing , playing an abused woman trying to start a new relationship.The central underlying story concerns a serial killer known as ` Ice Truck Killer ' , who specializes in neatly slicing up his victim 's bodies into bloodless pieces . The whole concept is diabolically macabre , and well executed . The killer has taken a special interest in Dexter , and tension and suspense grows more intense , after the killer 's identity is revealed with a few episodes left to go . The killer has an elaborate plan , though he is forced to improvise when the pursuit begins to close in . As Dexter begins to recall the horrific circumstances surrounding his mother 's death , the killer makes his play . The writing is outstanding , and keeps you off balance . Approaching the conclusion , things get a little shaky in the turn , but control is reacquired , and Dexter finishes wildly and dramatically , with a stylistic flourish that does not cheat the viewer.Dexter is refreshingly different from most forensic procedurals . Although dealing with violence and death , there is n't a lot of fighting , shootouts , or chases . The focus is on character and story development . While there are things that go over the top , or are illogical , unlike programs like the CSI franchise , the level of drama is n't routinely pumped up by threats , flashy violence , condescending dialog , or music . The police in Dexter work ` normally ' , with no overly dramatic background music , while routine tasks like , processing the crime scene , performing tests , or analyzing evidence take place . The level of acting by almost everyone involved is excellent , from the minor characters to the leads . The writing is not perfect , but the characters and their dialog , are mostly credible , showing the audience some respect . There are no long winded pretentious speeches sprouting psychobabble , phony overdramatic situations , and characters trying to top each other , or engaging in supercop behavior . Criminal Minds or CSI Miami , this is not.The series is far from perfect , and does n't escape being ridiculous . While a darkened room , draped with plastic sheeting , with a naked victim tapped down helpless , is a terrifying scene , it makes little sense , unless Dexter has giant rolls of plastic sheeting , and maybe a case of packing tape in his car . The time it would take to actually prepare the scene , and put up all that sheeting would be ridiculous . Tape and plastic sheeting are excellent for retaining evidence like fingerprints , would have to be destroyed . Dexter disposes a couple of bags of body parts per kill , but what happens to all that tape and plastic sheeting ? Over the course of the season , Dexter takes chances , makes mistakes , and has several close calls , and is clearly under suspicion , at the conclusion , setting the stage for the next season.One of the few negatives is the lack of subtitles , and the inappropriateness of the extras . Two episodes have commentary tracks , but some of the other bonus materials , are not directly related to the series . The mini-documentary Witnessed in Blood , covers the forensics for an unrelated criminal case . And two episodes of Showtime 's series Brotherhood are included , presumably as an attempt to promote that series . More material specifically relevant to Dexter , would certainly have been preferred . Otherwise , needless to say , the series is highly recommended to fans of the forensic crime genre .	1
I was hooked after the first episode . I love the concept : a blood splatter expert who seconds as a serial killer that preys upon other serial killers . Michael C. Hall seems as if he was born to play the role of Dexter . Every season there seems to be one central character that Dexter must hunt down , amongst various other serial killers and murders that end up getting chopped up on his table . This season follows Dexter & # 8217 ; s pursuit of the Ice Truck Killer & # 8212 ; a sadistic serial killer that chops bodies into pieces after draining all of their blood . He & # 8217 ; s named the Ice Truck Killer because it is believed that he drives around in an ice truck before dumping the bodies off . Great pilot season . If you have not seen this show , this is definitely one you do not want to miss .	1
This is n't one of those shows or movies about a serial killer who just does it for fun . Dexter Morgan targets people very specifically and only those whom he believes have crossed a line or violated one of his standards . For example , Dex would never molest or kill a child , so he kills a man who has done such things to choir boys . This is not a defense of Dex , just a clarification.What makes him even more complex is that he did not suffer abuse at the hands of his loving foster parents ; he maintains a good relationship with his sister , a cop ; he works as a forensic examiner for the police ; he fakes emotions as best he can with his girlfriend and her kids ; and feels nothing at all , most of the time , unless it 's a sense that he must get rid of someone.Michael C. Hall 's performance and voiceover work are very strong . He 's stretched out further than he could with his character on the late , great Six Feet Under .	1
If you 're reading this you either are 1 ) a fan of the show 2 ) want to know more about it to see if it will appeal to you . Michael C. Hall ( `` Six Feet Under '' ) plays Dexter a vigilante serial killer . By day Dexter works as a splatter analyst in the police department using blood patterns to help determine exactly how a crime occurred.We have a true anti-hero as the focus of the series -- a serial killer who almost seems to have a conscience because he focuses on dealing out justice ( and focusing his urges ) to those he feels are evil . His father a police officer instilled a code to help him direct his `` urges '' and distinguish between good and evil.Showtime has attempted to improve the quality of their shows and their DVD releases with some mixed results . I found the image quality to be anything but subpar for a DVD . It 's a very good transfer . Is it high definition ? No , but this is n't an HD-DVD and the quality for a standard DVD is very good although there are some digital compression issues that crop up occasionally.The one complaint I have is simple -- no chapter indexing where you can see specific scenes for each episode . Sure you can skip through it by hitting the next button but it 's kind of unusual in this day and age for new shows to NOT have this . The second is minor and others have pointed it out -- the menu is a very basic design that looks like it could have been done by an amateur.You also have to reset audio for each disc as you watch it for 5.1 as it automatically defaults to 2.o . To be sure many of these are minor points but they do contribute to the enjoyment of the show if handled well.The special features are an improvement over some previous Showtime series but far from perfect . We get two episodes of the excellent Showtime drama `` Brotherhood '' . We also get `` Witnessed in Blood - A True Murder Investigation '' a very good featurette that focuses on splatter analysis and what it reveals about a murder . It ties in to `` Dexter '' because that 's what Dexter does for a living on the show and it also helps him to break a number of cases . We also get a commentary track that I have n't listened to yet as well as an online link to watch two episodes of the new Showtime series `` The Tudors '' and a pdf file with the first two chapters of the new Dexter novel . I suspect that `` The Academy of Blood : A Killer Course '' is along with the DEXTER novel excerpt buried in the DVD-Rom portion of the disc . You wo n't be able to watch it or access it on a regular DVD player which is just plain sloppy as this is n't indicated on the package.We also get biographies for the actors . While the extras here ( including two commentary tracks on the set are very good , the show could have used more commentary tracks and the involvement of star Michael C. Hall on at least one of them . Also , the special features really need to be more clearly indicated as to whether they are DVD accessible , PC accessible and where you might find them on the disc.Minor Plot Spoilers : Dexter 's father a police officer recognized early on his son 's proclivities and tried to give him moral guidence and boundaries so that he can function in our world but , more importantly , use his `` skills '' to hunt down those that prey on others.Dexter is conflicted -- he knows that he 's not normal and he also knows he does n't fit in ( he has difficulty with emotions having to fake his way through it ) . He also recognizes what he is and how his father tried to shape him into something `` better '' .When he goes toe-to-toe with the Ice Truck Murderer and tries to track down this nasty serial killer he gets a glimpse into his own soul but also recognizes that unlike his evil doppleganger he can choose his actions and not just act on his instincts.END OF PLOT SPOILERS : Overall , Dexter is a terrific show . The second season has also gotten off to a bold start . The first season used the novel DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER as a starting point . For the second season the writers/producers have chosen to depart from the novels which should make for an interesting move . This is a solid set that could be improved with future seasons .	1
`` Dexter '' is built on an intriguing premise : a man with antisocial personality disorder experiences murderous impulses but lives by a code - he can only kill murderers . Kind of a twisted play on Freud 's concept of sublimation . The series did n't initially appeal to me , but overall I 'm pleased that I stuck with the first season . Michael C. Hall plays the titular character , a forensic expert in blood splatter . He works alongside a group of detectives assigned to some of most brutal Miami murders ; one of these cops is Dexter 's adopted sister , Debra Morgan ( Jennifer Carpenter ) . Dexter was adopted as a child by a Miami cop ( the now deceased Harry Morgan ) who recognized that Dexter was antisocial . Instead of allowing Dexter to go down the path of juvenile delinquency ( and inevitably murder ) , Harry developed a code for him - you can kill but only under certain circumstances . Harry also encouraged Dexter to do things to make him seem normal , such as dating , to help him hide his true nature and go undetected . Most episodes feature Dexter stalking a serial killer , with a season long plot involving Dexter 's fascination with the `` Ice Truck Killer . `` The series features excellent writing and direction , which helps make the somewhat unbelievable premise feel realistic . The acting also is top-notch . Hall does a nice job of making Dexter charming and likeable ( so that we can believe that he can fit in at work and his relationships ) while also adding a bit of edge through his lack of true emotion , superficial charm , and violent impulses . We can sense that evil lurks just below the surface , kept in check only by his adherence to his code . It 's a solid portrayal of an extreme case of antisocial personality disorder , and the series is n't afraid to make its protagonist dark and somewhat frightening . The supporting cast is also terrific , with C.S . Lee scoring as Vince Masuka , Dexter 's lascivious co-worker who is a walking sexual harassment case . Likewise , Sgt . Doakes ( Erik King ) helps lighten the mood as the only person who seems to know that Dexter is not the good guy he portrays . I also enjoy the work of two `` Oz '' veterans - Lauren Velez as Dexter 's complicated Lieutenant , and David Zayas as Detective Angel Batista ( perhaps Dexter 's closest `` friend '' ) .Although I enjoyed the show , there were a few things I disliked about the first season . Debra 's insecurity is highly grating , and the actress gives a twitchy , affected performance . Dexter 's flashbacks to his days with Harry become extremely repetitive and unrealistic after awhile . The first few episodes were difficult to watch , and Dexter came across as quite brutal ; I was ready to give up on the series after these shows , but the character became more `` human '' in subsequent episodes . Finally , the last two episodes of the season , which focused on the Ice Truck Killer case , were overly melodramatic and lead to a rather unsatisfying ending . Although I approached the series with some trepidation and found it flawed , there 's enough to like about the Season 1 that I plan on watching Season 2 on DVD .	1
This series is absolutely one of the best cop shows I have ever seen . One reason is because Vick goes beyond what is dictated by the law and this is what a lot of citizens would do if they had the chance . At first I could n't decide if he was a good cop or a bad cop but by the end of the series I came to believe that he is just a mix of both.I can not really rate season 5 by it 's self because I actually do not see any difference in any of the seasons . They are every one a spell binding , ca n't wait till I see the next one kind of a series . One of the things that make it outstanding is that they do n't use an episode as a stand alone show . There are plots that continue through many episodes and mini plots that get solved in one episode.My wife and I stayed up way past our normal bedtimes many nights because we kept saying ... lets watch just one more !	1
Vic and the crew are a good ensemble cast who have so much going on in their lives you wonder how they 'll pull it off	1
Each episode builds the crescendo of anticipation of how Mackey and his Strike Force is going to out-do the previous episode of ball busting and head knocking .	1
I have watched all six seasons and I am about to finish the series . Every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat . The roller coaster ride is never ending and I am going to miss the series when I finish . I wish that there was something to take it 's place . Michael Chiklis and the rest of the cast step out of the story and grab you by the shirt and never let go .	1
This series is one of the classics of all time . The characters are unforgettable and painted from the broad strokes of good and evil and many shades in between . The themes are here to examine the human condition on so many levels that at times it makes your head spin , particularly when you compare it to todays events . What a show ! ! ! !	1
Good writing and acting make this show engaging season after season . At the end of each you wonder where it could possibly go next , and yet the writing team always pulls it off .	1
I loved this show . I had never heard of it until recently and I 'm glad I started watching it . Addicting .	1
A great series and this season turned everything upside down . Mackey and his crew are under fire and Forrest Whitaker is out to get them and bring them down . This was was one of the most emotional and shocking seasons ever for this great show . A must buy series if you love cop dramas . This is the best cop show . It is dark and it pulls no punches . Once you watch it you will want to see more . Show will have you hooked .	1
Season five sees the strike team under investigation yet again . You know the writing is good when you want the do anything it takes cops to succeed . While every episode is great there will be some big shockers at the end of the season . I am really glad I have the chance to catch up on this well written if gritty show .	1
Season 5 takes a turn with the introduction of Forest Whitaker as LT Jon Kavanaugh . Prior to his departure , Kavanaugh had been tasked by Captain Aceveco to find the dirt on Vic . Hellbent and determined , Kavanaugh does his best to do so.I do n't know whether it was his character , his acting or the side story , but I did n't like the introduction of Kavanaugh to the series . Sure , I believe many think the introduction may have been needed , but the subplot was often way too distracting .	1
Since this has been out for a while , and if you 're researching season 5 , hopefully you 've already seen the 4 before it , I 'll make it short.I 've seen every episode of The Shield , and the finale of this season is one of the best episodes of TV - of ANY show - that I 've ever seen.I think it 's the second best season ( second only to season 1 ) that this show has ever had.If you 're a fan of the show , what are you waiting for ?	1
I own all seven seasons of The Shield ; if you like the show , this was one of the better seasons .	1
Great show always full of action and on the go . Its not a show for kids and some adults may find it offensive but if you can get past that you wont want to miss the next episodes .	1
This season was good , but not up to par with previous seasons , partially because it was only 11 episodes long.Synopsis of the season : Jon Kavanaugh ( Forest Whitaker ) has been brought in to check on the Strike Team . He goes after Lem and tries to get him to turn on the rest of the team . The main story is basically the team trying to keep Lem out of jail . There 's also some cameos of Anthony Anderson as Antwon Mitchell . Also , Danni is pregnant , Billings has become Captain , Julian is partnered with a new trainee , and Claudette and Dutch 's relationship is strained due to a secret she is keeping from Dutch .	1
Great show lots of suspense good acting keeps you Awake and goes quick fast pace show to bad it 's off the air	1
I gave this rating due to a lot of reasons , one being the level of excitement to keep you wanting more , the other for how the series so far turned out .	1
If you purchase this DVD , make sure you watch the extras on disc 4 . Forest Whitaker discusses how the Kavanaugh character was conceived as someone who `` becomes '' Mackey as he pursues him , and you will certainly see a transformation over the course of Season 5 's eleven episodes . It would be very easy to over-hype Whitaker 's contribution if it were n't so spot-on perfect . On DVD 4 , series creator Shawn Ryan states that he wanted Whitaker for this character and there `` was no second choice . '' If you remember the famous 1998 episode of NYPD Blue called `` Raging Bulls , '' in which Dennis Franz 's Sipowicz and James McDaniel 's Lt . Fancy come to explosive blows after a long , slow simmer , imagine what happens immediately after Kavanaugh asks Mackey in a rage-filled voice `` Are you happy NOW ... Detective Mackey ? '' There was a strong undercurrent of racial tensions between the NYPD Blue characters , which led ( in a large part ) to them both reaching the breaking point , but Mackey and Kavanaugh are not at odds with each other because of their ethnicity . Over the course of the entire season , the subject is never approached and it is not a relevant detail in the conflict . They 're two men who began with the right motives and slowly let their circumstances determine their mission . There are mixed opinions surrounding the Glenn Close `` Capt . Rawling '' story arc experiment from Season 4 . In a few short days , Whitaker is back for a second season as Kavanaugh , and the events of Season 5 were grounded more in risk taking than stunt scripting . The Shield is a brutal , intensely creative show with one of the best casts and creative teams on TV . By creating synergy with the events laid out in the pilot episode ( and multiple references in the `` extras '' portion of the set to `` Shakespearean '' drama ) , it 's clear that this series aims very , very high and more often than not hits the target .	1
At the close of the fourth season of the Shield , there was reason for celebration . As season five begins , not much seems to have changed . Corrupt cop Vic Mackey ( Michael Chiklis ) and his Strike team are back together again , Antwon Mitchell ( Anthony Anderson ) is in prison , Rawling is gone , Aceveda ( Benito Martinez ) seems out of reach ; it seems like it 's business as usual . Then everything changes . Enter Forest Whitaker as Jon Kavanaugh , an IAD lieutenant who is making it his sole purpose in life to bring Vic down . His method : using Lem ( Kenny Johnson ) as a blackmail tactic to rat out Vic . But as we learn as the season progresses , not only do things not go as planned , but everything comes to a shocker of a conclusion that will have you beating the walls in anticipation for the sixth season . Also going on during the season are a variety of things : Julian ( Michael Jace ) breaks in a new partner ( Paula Garces ) because Danny ( Catherine Dent ) is pregnant , Wyms ( CCH Pounder ) looks to take another shot at being the Captain , and Shane ( Walt Goggins ) makes a choice that will alter the course of the show forever . As the credits roll after the season finale , it is clear that the end is quite near , which is bittersweet in a way , because if it 's one thing that Shawn Ryan 's gritty cop drama has proved , it 's that prime time cable TV can be nothing less than spectacular .	1
THE WRITING AND THE ACTING ARE SUPERB . IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER . THE BALANCE BETWEEN GOOD COP AND REALLY EVIL COP IS ALWAYS SURPRISING . IN SPITE OF ONESELF ONE ROOTS FOR THE BAD GUYS BECAUSE THEY ARE THE ONES WHO WOULD LEAP INTO FLAMES TO RESCUE A VICTIM . THE BUILDUP OPF SUSPENSE MAKES BINGE WATCHING ALMOST A NECESSITY . AGAIN , MY ONLY CAVILS ARE THE EXPLICIT SEX AND NUDITY WHICH ARE GRATUITOUS AND NOT NECESSARY IN AN OTHERWISE SUPERB SERIES .	1
This show is n't about feelings , but one of the best scenes in tv history makes two actors at the end really stretch their credentials . Shane and Lem really pull it off . The noose starts tightening for the strike team and their cheating ways .	1
If you have watched the previous 4 seasons you wont be disappointed with season 5 . The characters are expanded upon and some new ones are introduced to keep things fresh .	1
I started at the beginning and am working my way through watching every season - when it first came out I did not think I would like it and now I am hooked - great acting and entertainment ! !	1
Vic continues to walk on thin ice and make it to the other side . A fond farewell to Lem . We will miss you in Season 6 .	1
Another season demonstrating the mix of good and not so good that makes up all people . Adults only please - not a show for the kiddies or the timorous .	1
My two favorite shows of the past ten years have been `` The Sopranos '' and `` The Shield . '' As `` The Sopranos '' limps into its final season -- let 's face it , that show has n't had the same compelling intensity since its first three incredible seasons -- '' The Shield '' is still kicking major butt.The quality has never let up and I would highly recommend that you watch every season from the very beginning . The writing is so inventive and the acting is just dynamite.I ca n't wait to see where they 're going with this !	1
All roads for Vic Mackey ( Emmy winner Michael Chiklis ) lead to this . After Mackey killed Terry Crowley during the first season of `` The Shield '' karma was going to catch up with him sooner than later and now the Strike Team is under I.A.D . investigation by Jon Kavanaugh ( Oscar winner Forrest Whitaker ) . Mackey seemed on the road to redemption during the fourth season when the new captain ( Glenn Close ) gave him the chance to reassemble his team and make a difference in the Farmington police district . The investigation that she instigated which was designed to exonerate members of her team has turned into crusade where Kavanaugh will use any and all teams to bring down Mackey and his team.By the fifth season of `` The Shield '' I was afraid the show would jump the shark -- in fact it has done anything but that with writing that is still among the best on TV with morally complex characters sporting shades of gray to their personalities vs. being simple black and white caricatures of good guys and bad guys . Chiklis proves as he has over the last four seasons to be one of the best actors on TV with his complex portrayal of Mackey . Chiklis though would n't be where he is without the terrific supporting cast . During the fifth season Mackey 's nemesis begins to resemble him as he tries to bring down Mackey and his team . Mackey may be morally corrupt person but there is still a decent person buried somewhere within his soul which allows fans of the series to be rooting for him even if he is often the bad guy ( hey , he killed a cop in the first episode of the first season ! ) .The show looks grainy and dark which benefits the cinema verite/documentary look of the show with its handheld cameras and unexpected pans . As always Dutch ( Jay Karnes ) and Claudette ( CCH Pounder ) continue to be the moral center and conscience of the show and as fascinating as Mackey and his team are , these two detectives are equally as fascinating as they bring down a serial killer with perfect alibies and other difficult to crack cases . The politically astute former Captain of the station David Aceveda ( Benito Martinez ) continues to have a darkness to his `` moral '' character particularly after the physical assualt at the hands of an ex-con that occurred during the third season.The DVD has some great special features including commentary tracks with a nice mix of cast members , a featurette on the productio of the fifth season , a tribute to executive producer/director Scott Brazil who died during the sixth season and a Q & A ; session with Chiklis , producer/writer/creator Shawn Ryan and Forrest Whitaker discussing their characters and the development of the series . We also get deleted scenes as well as the sixth season `` prequel '' that sets up season six.The seventh season ( which will air this spring ) is reportedly the last season for the show so if you 've caught the bug for `` The Shield '' but fallen behind in watching the show , now you can spent time either catching the reruns or watching the DVDs in plenty of time for season seven.Highly recommended .	1
Every episode was great !	1
Gritty action and lots of it.I detest crooked cops but these guys made you feel for them.Beware lots of blood ... .	1
As a brand name , as a product , I trust South park to deliver entertainment quality more than any other . the Simpsons were great at one time , but the tired series drags on , so DVD 's of its latter years are as tired as its writing staff . South Park on the other hand is as vibrant as it ever was . The incredibly audacious creators of the series are the two most insolent creeps to ever blacken a studio . However , funny is funny . Moreover , whereas the Simpsons do not make many polical points ( being in prime time on network tv ) , South Park makes few shows that do NOT have political points . They skewer virtually everyone . Who else would show Gene Siskel , the harmless affable film critic , and JFK , in hell ? They are at their best when WE are at our worst . As we cower before threats from overseas , they did a brilliant piece about literally putting your head in the sand .	1
With season 10 the South Park creators set out to give us something that would challenge the creators of Family Guy and would set out in challenging those who like the Family Guy comedy . They also set out in making a point about the whole showing an image of the Prophet Muhammad on national TV , they set out in making a point about freedom of expression and not allowing terror threats to scare them . Did they win that war ? You 'll have to watch this season to find out.Episode 1 : The Return of Chef : In this episode we see Chef return to South Park after a time with the Super Adventure Club who we later learn that they are a group of explorers that show a special interest in the children of remote tribes . The boys have to cope with this change in Chef and the influence that the Super Adventure Club had on him . In reality this is the episode where we say goodbye to Chef for good , as in season 9 South Park had an episode called Trapped in the Closet which made fun of the `` Religion '' of Scientology . Isaac Hayes who was the voice of Chef is a Scientologist , he seemed to hold a double standard when making fun of religion . It 's OK to make fun of Christianity , Judaism , Mormonism etc but as long as you do n't make fun of Scientology it 's OK but if you do then Hayes said goodbye to South Park . This is an amazing episode and is really enjoyable listening to Chef speak as it 's chopped together dialogue from previous episodes.Episode 2 : Smug Alert : `` I know , for this episode let 's make fun of those people who drive environmentally friendly cars and suddenly think they 're better than everybody else . '' This is what Stone & Parker would have thought when coming up with the idea for this episode as they do just that . They pick up on the smugness of these people and tear them apart which is a very intelligent move by the creators . The story is simple ; Gerald , Kyles dad is now the owner of a hybrid car and he suddenly feels it 's his duty to insult those who have gas gusler cars . Gerald moves the family to San Francisco where everybody drives a Hybrid , but Stan being upset with this decides to write a song that will encourage more people to buy Hybrids which should get Kyle to come back home . This is a great episode with a great message about those people who to drive the hybrid cars , it takes the subject and says to those people `` I know you drive them , and I do n't care . `` Episode 3 & 4 : Cartoon Wars Part 1 & 2 : This is an episode that stirred up a lot of controversy as these two episodes were based around the whole image of Muhammad hysteria that was surrounding the media at the time . Stone & Parker had made the episodes with the clear intention of Comedy Central showing the image on TV and setting an example about freedom of speech but unfortunately it was n't to be . The story of the episodes are that Family Guy are set to show an image of Muhammad in one of their episodes ; Cartman being utterly offended by this sets out to put an end to Family Guy once and for all but he has one obstacle ; Kyle . These are a great set of episodes that just rip Family Guy to pieces when talking about their comedy , the whole notion of Family Guy being written my Manatees is brilliant and when you really give it some thought you start to think to yourself , `` Well maybe this is possible . `` Episode 5 : A Million Little Fibers : This is by far the weakest episode of the bunch as it 's an episode focusing directly on Towelie . He decides to write a book about his life but everything keeps going wrong and he ca n't get his book published because he 's a towel . He assumes a human personality and changes his book around which becomes an instant success and Oprah Winfrey wants to put her name on this book . This is really one of the weakest episodes out of them all and I think was just a filler to get to the next great idea.Episode 6 : Manbearpig : This is the typical insult episode that rips apart Al Gore over the movie he made called an Inconvenient Truth , it makes fun of the whole `` Look at me I 'm an ex-president trying to keep the limelight '' that seems to surround Al Gore . He has a new theory in South Park and that 's a monster that will be a danger to everyone , Manbearpig . Half man , half bear and half pig , he ca n't prove it but he 's super serial.Episode 7 : Tsst : I honestly do n't think I 've ever laughed so much at a South Park episode , Cesar Milan of the Dog Whisperer fame is called in to take control of Cartman and his bad behaviour . Using some techniques that would only usually be performed on Dogs , Cartman is n't happy about being humiliated and resorts to making some drastic plans for revenge.Episode 8 : Make Love , Not Warcraft : Everybody has them , everybody has that one friend who would quite openly admit that they would rather spend the day on World of Warcraft than go outside and play . Parker and Stone set out to make fun of these kids and show them that they need to get out more , some people may find it harsh but some people like myself would find it utterly hysterical.Episode 9 : Mystery of the Urinal Deuce : The world 's biggest conspiracy of all time will finally be uncovered when Eric Cartman exposes the true culprit behind the September 11th attacks . How will that person prove his innocence and who really was behind 9/11 . This is a funny episode that gives a big slap in the face of the conspiracy theorists , I ca n't help but think that Parker and Stone wanted to give their opinions on the subject in this episode rather than just be intelligent about it.Episode 10 : Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy : Eric Cartman is selected to become South Park elementary schools hall monitor , so he dons the look of a bounty hunter and sets out to clean up the halls . He accidentally stumbles upon a teacher in a relationship with a student and wants to put a stop to it . A very good episode with some strong home truths.Episode 11 : Hell On Earth 2006 : Satan is throwing the biggest Halloween costume party ever , and no one will be admitted without a wristband . Every detail must be perfect for the prince of darkness . But even Satan ca n't foresee everything . A prominent religious organization , an ex-lover and the antics of the most notorious serial killers of all time threaten Satan 's fun . A complete slaughtering of the my Super Sweet 16 girls which I personally feel was long overdue from the South Park guys.Episode 12 : Go God Go Part 1 : South Park Elementary faces strong opposition to the topic of evolution being taught to the 4th graders . The most vocal protests are from Ms. Garrison who has to teach it . Eric Cartman ca n't be bothered with what 's going on in class . He 's busy manipulating his own personal time-line to align with the precise release date of the Nintendo Wii . A great satirical episode that this time does n't poke fun at the notion of religion but pokes fun at a world without religion , would we all really get along like Richard Dawkins says we would ? Episode 13 : Go God Go Part 2 : Last week Eric Cartman froze himself in an attempt to make his three-week wait for a hot , new , gaming device pass quickly . A freak accident landed him over 500 years in the future and now he 's stuck there . The future is a tumultuous place with warring factions , angry sea otters and no Nintendo . Will Cartman find a way back to his own time ? A humorous look on a future without religion , how would we find a way to keep fighting if we do n't have the excuse of religion.Episode 14 : Stanley 's Cup : Stan Marsh has hit rock bottom . He 's got no job , no bicycle and his only way out of a bad situation , is to coach the local pee wee hockey team . Once a hotshot pee wee hockey player himself , Stan Marsh has tried to put those days behind him . But he 's still living with the memory of how let his team down when he missed the winning shot in the big game . Now , he 's about to find out that being a coach means facing your past . He 's determined to show his kids what it 's like to be a winner ! Personally I did n't understand this episode and it was n't very good , the whole children having cancer thing I think was simply for shock value.A really good season with two 2 parters that would have you thinking and laughing at the same time which is a trademark of South Park .	1
South Park is about the only consistently dependable TV show and the `` Go God Go '' 2-parter carries all the hallmarks of the franchise 's best episodes . Somehow the A and B plots of this story involve an impatient Cartman freezing himself into the future because he ca n't wait 3 weeks to play a Nintendo Wii , Mr ( s ) Garrison dating Richard Dawkins , and an atheistic future war involving humans and otters . If you 're a South Park fan , this is a must-watch episode .	1
These guys do n't pull any punches and that is why I love this show so much . This is another great season with up to the moment topics on real life ! With all the pussyfooting around these days , this is a breath of fresh air ... .even after 10 seasons !	1
OK , there are a few episodes in this season that are a little much . The social/political satire is still as strong as ever but the episodes are stretching more to make their points . Instead of being absurdly funny and clever , some of these episodes are just absurd and go out of their way to say , `` Look at me , look how shocking I am '' ( `` The Return of Chef , '' `` Smug Alert ! , '' `` A Million Little Fibers , '' `` Stanley 's Cup '' ) . Still , this season offers what I believe is the greatest SP episode of all-time and maybe the best thing I have ever seen on television : `` Make Love Not Warcraft . '' This episode is so well-done in animation ( yes , excellent SP animation ) and story-writing that I can not praise it enough . Plus , it includes music from one of my favorite singers ever : Paul Stanley ! Then there are the excellent two-parters when Cartman goes to the future ( Mrs. Garrison and that scholar guy are hilarious ! ) and `` Cartoon Wars '' where SP takes on Family Guy with references to other animated shows . `` Miss Teacher Bangs A Boy '' takes the female teacher/boy student love affair controversy to a level only SP can . The positives outweight the negatives here but it 's not perfect , so I ca n't give it 5 stars no matter how much I love the World of Warcraft episode . The cover of the box ( Target edition ) is awesome . You see the SP boys fat and pimply and , by tilting the box , you see their World of Warcraft characters.Disc 1 : '' The Return of Chef '' -- Controversial episode that got back at Isaac Hayes for leaving SP when it tackled the Scientology issue . Hearing old Chef audio clips , the SP boys notice something has changed drastically in Chef after his return from an adventure with a mysterious club . Yikes ! `` Smug Alert ! '' -- People of SP start buying hybrid cars and find out they 're threatening the planet with emissions of another kind . The beginning of this episode with Gerald acting all high and mighty in his hybrid was great . I thought it was going to be another excellent episode . At the point where the forest ranger explains what 's going on to Stan , things went downhill . Here , the episode tried a little too hard to make a statement . It is very contrived . `` Cartoon Wars Part 1 '' -- Fear engulfs SP when a Family Guy episode showing an image of Mohammad threatens holy war . While the nation buries its head in the sand ( literally ) , Cartman goes on a mission to cancel Family Guy and Kyle tries to stop him . `` Cartoon Wars Part 2 '' -- Pre-empted for a Terrance and Phillip television special ... just kidding . Cartman finds out something shocking about the writers of Family Guy . I 'll admit that show makes a lot more sense now . The Muslims ' retaliation was going in the right direction but ended up going the way of `` The Passion of the Jew '' which is unfortunate because it became stupid instead of funny . `` A Million Little Fibers '' -- Towlie promotes his memoirs but hits a snatch ... er ... snag when he lies to Oprah Winfrey . This episode is way over-the-top for my tastes and is not re-watchable.Disc 2 : '' Manbearpig '' -- Al Gore is super serial about a new threat to the planet . Can the man who invented the Internet save the earth from the vicious Manbearpig ? Wait ... is n't manbearpig an endangered species ? '' Tsst '' -- Mrs . Cartman has had it with her out-of-control son but , after failing on several nanny reality shows , has to resort to hiring a dog trainer . One of the better episodes of this season . `` Make Love Not Warcraft '' -- The best thing I 've seen on TV , period . Brilliant ! It 's interesting that here is one of the few times Cartman is a good leader who is n't a jerk to everyone ... except Butters , of course . `` The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce '' -- An unwelcomed sight in the boy 's room somehow leads to the unlocking of a 9/11 conspiracy . We get to meet the Hardly Boys who seem to be hardly ever not hard . The funniest part of this episode is how Mr. Mackey keeps hounding on finding more than a cake in the urinal . `` Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy '' -- A teacher at SP Elementary is having an affair with a student ... a very young student . Meanwhile , Cartman gets some real `` authoritie '' as a hallway monitor and treats his job as if he is a certain television bounty hunter . His assistant Beth with the big knockers is hilarious.Disc 3 : '' Hell On Earth 2006 '' -- Satan wants a Halloween party just like the Super Sweet 16 parties those snotty rich girls on MTV get . Meanwhile , the folks of SP keep summoning Biggie Smalls back to earth . A ho-hum episode . The Three Stooges take-off with Ted Bundy , Jeffrey Dahmer and John Wayne Gacey does n't do it for me . It just does n't make sense as Bundy would never hang out with those guys . Plus , Gacey would want to kill children , not adults and Dahmer would be killing young , dark-skinned men . `` Go God Go '' -- Mrs. Garrison is against teaching her class evolution until a handsome atheist scholar is hired to teach her class . Meanwhile , Cartman ca n't wait for the release of the Nintendo Wii so he has himself frozen but his defrost took longer than he anticipated . Tears came to my eyes when Mrs. Garrison described evolution to the class I was laughing so hard . `` Go God Go XII '' -- Cartman is stuck in the future where there is no religion and , therefore , no war ... yeah right ! I like how they say `` science '' in their slurs instead of `` God '' or `` JC . '' When Cartman calls himself in the past it is hilarious ! He finally gets to encounter his awful self but , of course , does n't learn anything from it . `` Stanley 's Cup '' -- To get his bike out of impound , Stan coaches a peewee hockey team that includes a player dying of cancer . This episode tries too hard to be heavy , but I guess that was the goal , er , point .	1
The landmark season of South Park saw Matt Stone and Trey Parker 's animated series back on top thanks to some scathing , satirical moments and just plain animated lunacy . It also saw the departure of Isaac Hayes , the voice of Chef , who departed after the previous season 's lampooning of scientology and Tom Cruise . His departure is spoofed in the opening `` Return of Chef '' which uses archive sounds of Hayes ' voice as Chef returns to South Park brainwashed by the Super Adventure Club , and seeling to `` re-connect '' with children . Things only get better as Kyle 's dad buys a hybrid car in `` Smug Alert ! `` , Al Gore seeks attention from anyone with `` Manbearpig '' , Cartman 's mom turns to the Dog Whisperer in `` Tsst ! `` , Satan has a killer Halloween party in `` Hell on Earth 2006 '' , and Cartman seeks to freeze himself in anticipation for the release of the Nintendo Wii in `` Go God Go '' . The best moments of the season however came with the two part `` Cartoon Wars '' which hilariously lampooned Family Guy , and it makes sense in a way you 've never imagined . `` Make Love , Not Warcraft '' satires the players of the incredibly popular online RPG , and `` Miss Teacher Bangs a Boy '' finds little Ike having an illicit affair . The only downpoint of the season is the closing `` Stanley 's Cup '' which finds Stan coaching a terrible pee-wee hockey team , for no apparent reason . This episode just is n't funny , at all . Despite that though , every other episode here in the tenth season is a winner , and ten years and still going strong , South Park proves that these kids are quite alright .	1
This season is not as good as other seasons , but it 's still alright . One of my favorite episodes is when it 's HALLOWEEN and Satan is throwing a big Sweet Sixteen party and acts like a spoiled rich teenager . Also Stan , Kyle , Cartman , and Kenny deal with the death of their friend Chef , stop Manbearpig , try to get a Family Guy episode pulled , defeat a nerdy gamer on World of Warcraft , and stop Ike from having sexual relations with his smokin ' hot teacher . ( Nice ! ) All this and more happen in SOUTH PARK : THE COMPLETE 10TH SEASON ! ! !	1
Episodes like `` TSST '' ( the Dog Whisperer episode ) and `` The Mystery of the Urinal Deuce '' ( featuring the Hardly Boys ) are funnier the second and third time around . The show is uneven , sure , but basically an American treasure . The real prizes in this season are the 2-parters , the `` Family Guy '' 2-parter and the `` Go God Go '' 2-parter featuring Cartman in the 25th Century . If you have n't seen either of those , you 've missed out on some of the best TV ever aired .	1
this was a well written account of the concentration camp of auschwitz . Withoudt making it overly grapic , it showed the horrot of what went on and the people who made the idea work . It covers the beginning of the effort to rid the world of Jews and other undesirables and continue until the trails after the war . If you have an interest in this subject , you will find this once of the better accounts .	1
A heartbreaking but realisitic version of the suffering of the Jews and the misconception of what should have been and turned out to be something more horrible . Great photos and exact images made you feel like you were right there in person .	1
Exceptionally well presented documentation of the pathway to Auschwitz ( Poland ) . This presents the Nazi ideology from the inception of the T-3 euthanasia program for disposing of those ( ethnic Germans ) who were mentally ill or suffered from other medical problems to the extermination of all peoples considered 'unworthy of life ' and prisoners of war . . . Poles , Russians and Jews . From a small pre-war barracks for Polish soldiers , it follows the path to the mass slaughter house it became during WWII . Included are multiple aspects of the killing process and how it evolved . Original architectural designs , diaries and personal interviews with both the SS and survivors accompanied by original footage ( Ukrainian ) and psychological profiles offers an overview of all that became Auschwitz.Video and narrative are well suited for those who prefer not to be exposed to all the sensationalism and gore often found in so many of these documentaries . Education and informative , an accurate presentation of Nazi ideology and euthanasia.The BBC series offers the opportunity for a comprehensive review of the consequences for both perpetrator and victim . For those that survived death , the path 'home ' was n't as simple as one might think . Russian POW 's were suspected of being 'spies ' and relegated to the Gulags of Stalin 's era . Others trying to return home found themselves victims of the Russia army and perhaps worst of all , deprived of their homes and possessions without any legal recourse . A tragic end to what is still considered one of humankind 's worst nightmares .	1
Taken from this perspective and from the notes of the Nuremburg trials , excellent 'history ' lessons . Made me want to read more of what actually took place that modern history books do n't really address .	1
The producers of this program really attempted to accurately portray historical events , so much so at times it was difficult to remember that the program was an reenactment .	1
I knew about Auschwitz , of course ... conceptually I knew what had been done there and I knew the horror of it . I just did n't grasp the full depth of WHY , nor did I realize how things were done . This documentary series is mind opening . It uses recently discovered plans and recreates what things would have looked like , it interviews people who made it through , it tells the story of the countless people who did NOT make it through and it helps us see with even greater clarity that this kind of atrocity must never ever be allowed to occur again .	1
This is a very interesting documentary regarding the infamous Nazi camp . I did n't know that the camp was used for anything other than the containment and murder of Jews , Gypsies and other people that the Nazis believed to be inferior . It was well worth the time to watch the series . I will probably watch it again at some point .	1
I thought I have seen all there is to see about the insane horrors of this place but this series tells a little more about why and how these people went through more than you can imagine and some survived to tell us . Man can not rule man .	1
If you were not altogether up on the Nazi period or if you were to young to really know about the Nazi 's & # 34 ; final solution & # 34 ; this series will certainly bring the horrors of that preriod front & center ! !	1
how horrendous that such cruelty and depraved indifference not only occurred BUT was then perpetrated again and is still happening in the world . We will never know the gifts to humanity that were destroyed there ... ..the brilliant minds , the spectacular voices , the symphonies unwritten , the cures not found ... .it reminds me of the holocaust of abortion here in the U.S .	1
The subject matter is appalling in itself . It is difficult to detach yourself emotionally from the horrors that were inflicted at Auschwitz.But , it is a BBC production and with that comes thorough , authoritative , accurate and objective presentation of the subject matter.It is worth watching as an historical document and not for entertainment , which it certainly is not ! I believe everyone should see this from the standpoint of understanding what a despotic and/or dictatorial regime can accomplish if left unchecked . When one person can rule an entire nation by personal decree as opposed to a balanced law making process , then anything and everything is possible , even to declaring a portion of your own population to be a dangerous enemy . There are lessons to be learned here .	1
Having been there as a child to visit , I wanted to see more of the history of the halocaust.Some things you need to remember .	1
Auschwitz : Inside the Nazi State makes for compelling viewing . It is divided into 6 chapters . The first chapter is titled `` Surprising Beginnings '' which basically introduces us to the origins of Auschwitz and how it was not initially designated as an extermination camp for Jews , but basically to house Polish political prisoners and later Russian POWs . In fact , the first gassing experiments in the camp were targeted at the Russian POWs.In the second chapter `` Orders and Initiatives '' , we learn of the plans of Hitler , Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich to kill the Jews on a massive scale . Auschwitz is prepped for this purpose by the construction of gas chambers and the use of Zyklon B , a form of poisonous gas that was initially used to exterminate vermin and a disinfecting agent . We also learn about the Lodz Ghetto and its infamous Jewish leader , Rumkowski who seemed a controversial character in oppressing his own people , though not spared death himself , in the end . The crude initial gas chambers at Auschwitz are also shown , in reconstructions.In the third chapter `` Factories of Death '' , the documentary explores how the systematic annihilation of the Jews was put into full operation , stretching all over Europe with Auschwitz being the center of extermination . The French authorities are also portrayed as being complicit in helping transport masses of Jews out of France to the `` east '' . The other camps of death are also discussed such as Treblinka , Belzec and Sobibor . It also mentions what happened to children of adult Jews who were sent off to work in the camps.The fourth chapter `` Corruption '' focusses on the blatant appropriation of murdered Jews and other peoples ' belongings and valuables for the use of the Third Reich . Rudolf Hoess , the commandant of Auschwitz himself was removed from his position under charges of corruption [ though he would return later to oversee mass killing on an astronomical scale ] . This chapter also mentions Dr Josef Mengele , the infamous Nazi doctor of death , and also about the setting up of a brothel in the camp . Most importantly , this episode also deals with the resistance against the Nazi oppressors , most famously the uprising in Sobibor.The fifth chapter `` Murder and Intrigue '' deals with the playing out of international politics during the last nine months of 1944 and how nothing much was done by the Allies despite knowing by then that the jews and other innocents were being systematically and mechanically murdered by the Nazis . This was much to the detriment of the Hungarian Jews in particular , for they were deported to their deaths at a time where the gas chambers and crematoriums at Auschwitz in particular were operating at their optimum capacity . It also focusses on the Sonderkommando , the Jewish inmates who were forced to help process new arrivals designated for gassing , collecting their possessions , and disposing of their corpses.The final chapter `` Liberation and Revenge '' deals with how the Nazis tried to conceal their atrocities towards the end of the war . It also covers some of the trials of the Nazi war criminals after the war , the impact of liberation on the surviving camp inmates etc.Each chapter has at the end an interview between Linda Ellerbee with various personalities , mainly members of faculty of universities about the issues raised by each chapter.The series is not only well-put together with the extensive research compiled , but also the reenactments of historical events with actors and actresses [ which I felt enhanced the series and not detract from it ] , the computer generated graphics of the camps as they were [ they are mainly ruins now ] , and also most importantly , the testaments of the survivors in the present . It is a truly heartwrenching experience to see and hear these brave souls relive their horrific memories of such a bleak period in the history of mankind . A must-watch . I would also recommend `` Shoah '' , a documentary that has more testimonies by survivors on the horrors they endured during World War Two .	1
The answer to the riddle is in the tittle . Once again Aunt Jane has to sort things out when a friend Ruth asks her to look in on her sister , Carrie Louise . You anticipate that Carrie has had it . And you meet many unbalanced and speedy characters . While you are watching you can miss the whole thing as they do it with mirrors.Well paced and the perfect English actors to match each part .	1
This Agatha Christie mystery had an American actor ( or a British actor portraying an American ) . I was intrigued with the women 's fashions , as well as the culture . The premise was interesting as well - a murder at a & # 34 ; disadvantaged youth & # 34 ; home , which also happened to be a grand mansion .	1
I 'm not giving away any plot information ! Suffice it to say that , as always , Hickson gives a superb performance and I hope to eventually own all the Miss Marple 's with her in them . You wo n't be disappointed with this movie as it stays fairly close to the book .	1
i started with season 1 friday the 11th of april . just got done with season 8 ..thuday april 18 ... i gorged myself with it..and fell in love with Keith Sutherland.. i hear he 's coming back.. season 9 can hardly wait .	1
Yet another blazing , edge of your seat thrilling 24 hours in LA . We lose a few more personnel but still manage to muddle through large scale corruption and the worst terrorists ever	1
A good story line and good acting . It 's a good thing I do n't have to wait for a whole week before catching the next episode . I was working nights when this was originally on TV so never got to watch it then . It would have been very hard to wait for a week before seeing the next episode . This series is very addictive .	1
More exciting than any current TV show ! I watch this on my tablet every night ... never miss if I can help it .	1
Each season is better than the last one , and that is saying a lot because they are ALL unbelievable ! I recommend this show to any age . I am so addicted to this show !	1
This dvd set rocks ! This whole season is killer ! Buy it people you wo n't regret it period ! Plus it came in great shape ! I would recommend this series to anybody !	1
Every episode has some serious problem that Jack Bauer seems to solve at the risk of his own life ( and others also ) . Love this show .	1
When & # 34 ; 24 & # 34 ; was on weekly we did n't start to watch it at the beginning and then often forgot to watch it , so it was hard to really get into it . BUT now that we are able to watch every episode from the beginning and in order without interruption have we loved it and are watching it again .	1
When this first came out I said bah ! do n't like donald sutherland , probably wo n't like his son , so I never watched it when it was on tv.When I got amazon prime , I was watching Life , loved that , 24 kept coming up as a recommended show , so I said what the heck ? ? Wow , it is so engaging , I 'd stay up til 4am watching episode after episode.It would be nice if 24 : Redemption was free to watch too , anyone want to loan me theirs ? was it made into DVD ? Some of the twists in season 6 seemed rather implausible but whatever , I wo n't go into it . Love the show , looking forward to watching the rest of it .	1
What can you say ... Jack Bauer is awesome ! You may have to suspend reality about the believability of the scenario , but the writers always play it out well .	1
Season 6 has varied reviews and a number of unhappy people , who claim that 24 is falling apart . I feel killing almost everyone in season 5 resulted in much of the dissatisfaction with season 6 . The new people have no history and no claim to our affection . If we are not watching someone we like and care about , we night think to much . This is something the writers need to consider , the people are what makes the show and they need to be preserved.The story line is standard and not deep . This is not a `` who done it '' or a deep thought provoking drama . Plots and sub plots have been taken from past seasons and put together for a new story line . During any hour , something occurs designed to make us want to watch the next hour . As the clock ticks down 59:57 , 59:58 something is happening that requires us to watch the next hour . This is a cliffhanger and a darn good one ! Jack , I agree with Secretary Heller . You are cursed to provide us with high-energy entertainment that is great fun as long as we do n't think to much . The series is much better on DVD , without commercials and waiting for next week .	1
Jack Bauer comes to the government 's rescue once again ! This is another great season of 24 and what is awesome about this season is we finally meet some of the main antagonist that are responsible for many of the tragedies that have occurred in Jack 's life ! A must see season of 24 ! !	1
I 've been addicted to 24 since the first season . The writers have a great sense of the Homeland Security , FBI and CIA . Just when you think you have the episode figured out , they throw a twist in and changes up everything . If you have n't had the opportunity to see this awesome program give yourself a treat and check it out . I promise you will enjoy 24 very much and possibly become addicted as I have become.It 's really a great TV program .	1
I liked all the seasons of 24 because of the fast moving action , never bored , always something happening . I would recommend it to anyone who like action movies .	1
How they even come up with this stuff is beyond me ! This show is great and it is even more awesome that it is included with Amazon Prime ! Thanks Amazon !	1
I gave it this rating for many reasons , it was a good season to watch and it keeps the viewer interested .	1
Jack Bauer is a moral avenger and just when we need such a phenomenon . Jack treats terrorists like they treat others . Also the series allows a lot of good acting and shows off a lot of articulate minds.We get to see justice , something the federal government is in the business of squashing .	1
I give Season 4 of `` 24 '' four stars not rated relative to it 's own normal standards , but in comparison to everything else on TV.Simply stated ... ... . even during a weak season like Season 6 , `` 24 '' is still better than most other crap on TV these days.In other words , even at it 's worse , `` 24 '' is better than most modern shows at their best.So many other shows on TV have become simple one trick pony and non-stop sex joke one liners that they have no substance except the cheap laugh.No wonder we now watch very few modern shows outside Court TV crime shows and exist primarily on DVD collections of past shows like ... ... .. Cheers , Wings , Silk Stalkings , Seinfeld , etc..etc..	1
We are catching up no 24 so we can watch the new series . We have become hooked on the drama of this show and are sorry we did n't watch it while it was such a big hit . it is now a BIG hit for us .	1
Nonstop action . Fascinating PLOTS all interwoven during the course of a day . Top notch ACTING of fully believable and intriguing characters .	1
I am re-watching the last three seasons to refresh myself . With the new season coming up I ca n't wait . Such an awesome show it really is top notch .	1
After two years in a Chinese prison , Jack Bauer is returned to America in order for C.T.U . to get the location of the man putting off bombs . Jack finds out it 's all for nothing and escapes to help save the day . Throughout this day , Jack teams up with terrorist who wants peace , there is an attack on President Wayne Palmer , the Vice President wants to bomb another country , Jack must find 5 suitcase nukes , stop his dad and brother , help his nephew , and a whole lot more ! This is one of the better seasons . One of the characters I do n't really like at first is Tom Lennox , then later in the day , I start to like him . Then , I do n't really like Vice President Noah Daniels , but toward the end of the day , I kinda like him . If you love 24 , and Jack Bauer , you 'll love 24 : DAY SIX ! ! !	1
I ca n't say enough about 24 , I LOVE each and every Season and Episode . If you like action , you will be at the edge of your seat with this Season . We are VERY hooked and stream from one to the next episode .	1
Keifer Sutherland is outstanding and all characters are appealing . New characters come into shows and stay for a while , and the stories always have unexpected twists and turns . The one thing you can expect is great acting , interesting plots , and unexpected turns . It 's great to watch .	1
More of Jack Bauer and his over the top method of saving America from terrorists . Very intense at tomes . Enjoy all of it .	1
I loved 24 when it was on tv and now after years I still love it . All the seasons are the bomb . LOL	1
Not sure which season was my favorite . I truly liked David Palmer as Pres so maybe Season 1and the final season when Chloe took on a commanding role .	1
Each episode is full of surprises , thus it was very difficult to quit watching . I was never be a fan of & # 34 ; 24 & # 34 ; before I start watching over Amazon Prime . Now , I love it . After finishing Season 6 , I have reverted back to Season 1 and am still enchanted .	1
I *think* this is the episode where someone FINALLY says to Jack what I 'd been thinking for about 50 episodes already . `` You 're cursed , Jack . `` THANK YOU . This poor guy . It 's like he 's got a little black cloud of bad luck that follows him around . Sure , he can pull YOUR bacon out of the fire , but HIS house will burn down in the process.That being said , it make me love Jack and root for him all the more . `` PLEASE let this man have SOMETHING good happen . ANYTHING . ''	1
Though widely-regarded as the weakest season ( barring early feedback about the just-released Season Seven ) of the TV series `` 24 '' , I still found the season to be just as emotionally compelling and intense as any of the previous efforts.I will admit that , for ( at least for me ) the first time in show history , the late-season plot ( regarding a piece of circuit board machinery ) became a bit unbelievable . Of course , all of `` 24 '' requires the viewer to suspend reality just a bit , but this time it seemed completely implausible that Jack Bauer would be allowed to complete his task . Aside from that , however , this season created some very thrilling moments and acting , including ( my highlights ) : -The introduction of some other Bauer family members ( let 's just say they do n't share Jack 's patriotism ) .-The `` Islamic prejudice '' storyline that mirrors the feature film `` The Siege '' in its high drama.-The acting of Vice President Noah Daniels ( played by Powers Boothe ) , who mirrors the inspired performance of Gregory Itzin ( Charles Logan ) from Season Five , who also makes an appearance in this season.-The return of Jack Bauer from his detainment in China and how ( or if ? ) he is able to transition back into normal society.As usual , the intensity of Kiefer Sutherland 's Bauer as well as the `` staff '' of CTU Los Angeles turn in great performances , with special props given to James Morrison as Bill Buchanan.Thus , I can not see where others saw this season falling short of previous efforts , as I found it to continue the `` 24 '' tradition of exciting plots , great acting , and mind-boggling twists and turns along the way .	1
This is worth getting alone for the second episode `` The Deadly Dolls '' guest-starring the great Vincent Price . While the plot is similar to so many other Voyage episodes with the crew being taken over by aliens desiring the Seaview 's nuclear reactor , the combination of Vincent and the hysterical Nelson and Crane puppets make this one an absolute pleasure.It is interesting to ponder how great Voyage would have been had it continued the combination of sci-fi and James Bond-type episodes seen during its second , and best , season .	1
This was the best season of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea starring Richard Basehart a hugely underrated American actor who has performed on stage , screen , and many guest starring dramatic roles on various TV series , movies made for TV , specials , and also has narrated many outstanding documentaries and has a career that spans from the 1940 's until his passing September of 1984 . The stories in the first two seasons were taught , gritty , with many of the episodes involving cold war espionage and a few aliens and undersea monsters tossed in here and there . Seasons 3 and 4 contained more monsters and aliens and centered more on fantasy . This was a show that was geared for all ages . Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea has been around since it originally aired on ABC on September 14 , 1964 and has been run on many networks in syndication since it went off the air in 1968 . All 110 episodes have also been released on DVD which I also own and I recently decided to buy season 1 on instant stream to go along with the other TV series and movies I have in my video library . I like the convenience of instant stream videos because I do n't have to get up to change DVD 's . I only have one negative thing to say about this and that is why seasons 2 , 3 , and 4 are not available on instant stream . I would like to see the rest of the series be made available in this format . It saves the wear and tear on my DVD 's . Unfortunately FOX released Voyage on double sided DVD 's and those do n't seem to hold up well with a lot of use . I really wish FOX had not skimped on the quality of the DVD 's for this and other series they have released on double sided DVD 's . I believe there will come a time when everything will be on instant stream and there wo n't be any more DVD 's to hassle with .	1
One of the great things about DVD is that classic television shows can be not only recalled but watched again . Some of them upon second viewing make you think `` Did I really think this show was good ? '' . But then again others make you realize that the shows you enjoyed from your youth were not just memories but were actually good shows . VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA is one of those series.As with the previous releases of the series , SEASON 4 VOLUME 1 , holds up as well as the rest . The improvement of color over black and white is an obvious one when comparing to season one . But the characters have now had a chance to develop on screen and become familiar to us all . Too bad the series left the air not long after.The sixties gave us some of the greatest science fiction television ever seen . As early as THE TWILIGHT ZONE and moving forward to THE OUTER LIMITS we had anthologies that held our attention . And as for serialized tales , we had the original STAR TREK and more . No person helped this era out more so than Irwin Allen.Allen was the creator of some of the most remembered sci fi series from the time including THE TIME TUNNEL , LOST IN SPACE , LAND OF THE GIANTS and of course VOYAGE . Each of these series has had a release to DVD and have had the opportunity to give those of us children of the sixties the chance to relive those moments that held our attention each week , an hour at a time , as we watched incredible worlds unfold before our eyes.As for VOYAGE , the story mixed a combination of military and peacenik in one . It told the tales of the submarine Seaview , a high tech sub designed and operated by Admiral Nelson ( Richard Basehart ) , a man who sees great things for the future and who uses his sub not as an offensive weapon but as a means to an end to help people around the globe.Along with Nelson are several main characters . The main one of these was Capt . Lee Crane ( David Hedison ) , his second in command . While Nelson offered an elder statesman , Crane was the young eye candy to draw in girls , a man of action who took control when needed . Robert Dowdell as Lt. Comdr . Chip Morton , Del Monroe as Kowalski and Arch Whiting as Sparks helped round out the all male cast as they tackled world crises around the globe , saving the world over and over again.This particular season gave us a number of items to be concerned about opening with an episode that showed the Seaview tossed about was a volcano was about to blow cracking the world in two . Vincent Price paid a visit to the Seaview as a puppeteer who took control of various crewmen . A well loved plot device of the sixties , the ability of a bad guy to transform his appearance to do harm to whoever he chose was used . And time travel was brought into the picture again as well.VOYAGE played out like STAR TREK taken to inner space instead of outer and with an all male crew instead of one more integrated . But then TREK was in the future and VOYAGE in the present . Scenes of both ships being tossed about due to either underwater explosions or photon torpedoes gave us the cast tossing themselves about from side to side of the set . One could expect anyone from either cast feeling comfortable changing sets.For me it was glorious to watch as the flying sub once again lifted off out of the bottom of the Seaview and broke surface to fly across the sky . Like many I was lucky enough to have purchased the Aurora model kit and make my own flying sub to take a place of honor on the top of my desk . To find one today means a prolonged ebay search and paying an arm and a leg . Better it remains a fond memory.Not so this series . It no longer has to be a memory . Instead it is something that can be enjoyed again and again . And it can be shared with my son and later perhaps my grandchildren.One of the best things that we can take with us , those of us who watched these shows when they were fresh and new , is the sense of hope that they offered . Rather than a post apocalyptic world of bombed out buildings and survivors clad in furs and remnants of clothing , we were shown a world where we could use science to help build a better world . We were offered a world where not just races and genders got along but aliens as well . Would n't it be great if the world had that same sense of hope once more ? Perhaps sharing these old television shows might just be the first step in that direction .	1
Heck , what a change of course ! Season Three of Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea altered dramatically the tone of the show . Gone were the clever plots about spies , Cold War , nuclear danger , secrete agents . Gone is the Nelson Institute location , different things like Veneza , etc.Admiral Nelson is onboard the Seaview in all episodes , and now the focus are aliens , monsters , mermaids , werewolves , mummies , dead Nazi agents , plant men , wax men , you name it . The Seaview `` rock and roll '' like never before , it 's a miracle it never gets destroyed.Gone is Riley , in comes Patterson.Season Two is the best for me , it will always be . Bu Season Three has its moments and , in general , maitained the good reputation of the show as a guilty pleasure show . It was in Season Four that thing went downhill drastically .	1
Great story ... .and one of the few genre shows that the ivory tower & # 34 ; brain trusts & # 34 ; have allowed to survive and develop . For what its worth , if you are getting into this show late , these boxed sets have gone on sale for something like $ 9.00 each right around Christmas the last couple years .	1
I love this tv show ! My daughter introduced it to me and I could n't stop watching it . I 've also bought and watched the 3rd Season . Very good ! !	1
This review has one slight spoiler in terms of what the brothers hunt in a single episode ... you 've been warnedThis season of Supernatural gives us a dose of comedy many probably would n't expect from a show that is `` scary '' . But the scary ramps up too . Everything escalates . The plot of Season One is extended greatly as Sam tries to track down others 'like him ' . We get great guest stars ( Katharine Isabelle from the Ginger Snaps films ; Linda Blair ... . LINDA BLAIR ! from the Exorcist ) and we witness the come back of one who becomes a fan favourite : Jim Beaver 's Bobby Singer . We also see what became fan favourite episodes such as 'Heart ' ( werewolf alert ) , 'What is and What Should Never Be ' ( djinns ) , and & lt ; SPOLIERS > -- -- - 'Tall Tales ' ( a Trickster , a la Coyote , Anansi , Loki , etc ) & lt ; /SPOILERS ) > .Religion comes to a head , and it is easy to see that it is going to intrinsic to future episodes . Hindu and Muslin faith enters center stage , and they do it well , given as much or more reverence than the Catholic and Christian dogma . Perhaps the greatest achievement of this season is that the writers merge the 'monster of the week ' theme by making those monster hunts have some allusion to the metaplot or even fuel the the on-going episodes . So just a head 's up : the show is quickly veering into theological discovery . But - they are smart enough not to shove it down anyone 's throat.Now , for the fun stuff : the CGI is outright brilliant this season , and it only gets better as the season go on . The audio is set for 5.1 Dolby Digital . As for Special Features , they are the ho-hum variety but made oh some not ho-hum by the crew and cast . It is easy to see these guys love their work . We have a few commentary tracks , deleted scenes on a few of the episodes , a 'making of ' in regards to the second jaw-dropping finale.This show is just getting started .	1
A good follow up to the first season . The cliffhanger from season one is answered . You meet a lot of interesting players in this season and the main vilian is no joke . A must buy series if you are into good action and a well told story .	1
This second season becomes tricky since it starts with the father 's death and ends with his temporary resurrection in order to be redeemed . At the same time Dean is dying and his father exchanges his own life for Dean 's but yet gives Dean the mission to look after Sam and save him , or kill him if he ca n't protect and save him . It ends with Dean doing the same bargaining as his father for the life of Sam who was killed in the dead western city of Cold Oak . Dean manages to get one year of living before he is reclaimed.This second season tells us too a little more about the demons . Apart from the everyday black-eyed demons who are tortured souls that stopped being human and became demons , there is a particular and more powerful one , the yellow-eyed demon , and though we are not told what or who he really is , he is what we can call a higher class demon . He is the one who accepted to take John 's life in the place of Dean 's . He is the one who has chosen Sam for a special mission that will be uncovered during this second season . What is that mission ? Strangely enough all the hunting is for that yellow-eyed demon nothing but training for Sam and the training is not only directed at Sam . This second season is focusing on the hunting by the two brothers of the yellow-eyed demon . But , this seems to be part of a plan elaborated by him to train Sam and make him understand his importance and his uniqueness . With others like him , that are called `` psychic '' in the series , they have been selected by this special demon to accomplish a task , that is to say lead the demonic army that is to break loose from Hell . Of these `` psychic '' , Sam will meet four of them , but there are more , all born on the same year 1983 , and whose mothers all died in a nursery fire . We come across them now and then but they do not seem to be very resilient . In a final attempt at selecting the right `` general '' to bring in the armies of Hell out of the deep , he brings together four psychic and a black veteran from Afghanistan ( who also has special abilities in a dead western city , Cold Oak in South Dakota , for the sole survivor to accomplish the mission.The Black chap , Jake , will manage , under blackmail from the yellow-eyed monster and menaces against his mother and sister , to kill Sam by cutting his spine through . He is an obviously well trained GI . But Dean will manage to revive Sam by a trip to Crossroads Inn , Mississippi to meet with a crossroad demon , that grants wishes that was tracked down in a previous episode , and to bargain his life against Sam 's . He will get a one year survival time for himself . But that enables the two brothers to go to Bobby who had noticed that evil and demonic elements were concentrating around a special zone in Wyoming.Sam will actually find out that in this sector there is a cemetery and a crypt in the center , built by Samuel Colt surrounded by churches connected by railroads building up a pentacle or pentagram , which is called in the series a `` devil 's trap '' , that can imprison demons if they enter it . The crypt in the cemetery is supposed to be the gate to hell , the gateway through which the armies of Hell will invade the earth . This is an important specification in the series . Several episodes are openly dedicated to Catholic beliefs : angels for one , but also a Catholic priest in a Catholic church who is shot dead on the steps to his church and can not receive the last rites . He becomes a haunting ghost and is redeemed by the priest of the church.This leads to a discussion that emerges several times on the existence of angels . Dean does not believe . Sam does believe . This definitely gives the series a Christian if not Catholic ring , especially with the number of times the Catholic exorcizing rite or ritual chant is used , though it is never uttered by a priest in the series , which makes it surprisingly iconoclastic . Never people believing in exorcism would consider a lay man could perform the rite . It is the same thing with the use of holy water . For example when Ellen , the inn-keeping lady of the roadside diner that is a meeting place for spirit hunters , comes at the end of the season for help after her diner and everyone in it were burnt to ashes , she is asked to drink a glass of holy water to make sure she is not possessed . This is definitely Catholic , but at the same time always performed by non-believers or even atheists . This is a reference to a religion from the point of view of people who are totally unconcerned by it as if you may not believe in God but God believes in you . Does he ? The special gun John Winchester had saved and kept for its final task and that he had traded with the yellow-eyed demon for Dean 's life and that still had one special bullet , was in fact the key to the door of the crypt that enables the armies of hell to come into this world . But the weapon only and not the bullet . The gun was recuperated , too late , by the Winchesters and the bullet killed the yellow-eyed demon , or can we be sure it did ? That 's when the tale turned ironical and sour . The poor Jake who had accepted , willy nilly and more nilly than willy , to be the servant of the demon did manage to open the gate and thus to enable the yellow-eyed demon to enter the final pentacle , but he was shot on the spot by the Winchesters . He probably died smiling since he thus saved his mother and his sister . But he got nothing out of the deal at all . That 's the irony of those devilish missions : the possessed do what they are supposed to do , and at times it takes a lot of energy from the demon to convince them . Like in this special case , where Jack has a mission that a demon or a possessed human could not accomplish since they could not enter the pentacle , but otherwise demons only take possession of human bodies and use them as `` meat suits '' But this second season has a touch of itself first of all in the constant debate about the worthiness of the fight , the worthiness of one brother being ready to die for the other and vice versa ( if it were true they might even die together one on top of the one on top of himself . ) This debate is constant , deep in many ways and perfectly well acted for us to believe that what is mostly a verbal claim no one ever makes true is probably true for these two brothers . That the father accepts to die in the place of his sons is normal since his sons are his heirs , his continuation into eternal human life . But for two brothers it is surprising especially since in our common vision of two brothers , even twins , and these are no twins , there is always some amount of hostility when it is not hatred and jealousy , which is indeed present in these two brothers . That can be explained by the fact they grew up apart from the world , taking care of each other while their father was hunting this yellow-eyed demon that killed his wife/their mother . Also , the animosity would rather be localized between Sam and John , Dean being the lever , the path between these two characters that have antagonistic trajectories.Those two brothers are so much in love with one another that they are ready to sacrifice their whole life for an adventure together . This is not inhuman . This is superhuman . This is an idealistic vision and the actors make us believe it is true , possible . That level of intimacy between two brothers is admirable and beautiful , even if , deep behind my mind 's eye I kind of doubt it a little bit.There is a last remark I want to make on this season . The South was finally represented this year with Mississippi , but in a rather unfavorable light as a place of demons , curses and other devilish traffics . Yet Mississippi is the place where the resurrection of Sam is purchased . We are no longer dealing with anything Christian here but with something like voodoo , the originally African religion of the Blacks in the South that has survived in spite of all the Christianizing performed by the whites over the centuries.But this leads to the plain fact that all black characters are evil in a way or another , either because they are easily manipulated by some demon or evil mind , or because they are sort of genetically evil , even Special Agent Victor Henricksen , who is shown as unable to see beyond his book of rules , and who is turned upside down and made a fool of by the two Winchester brothers and their female and not so much experienced lawyer . And fooled is a euphemism : he turns out to be a plain dummie . But the FBI agent will remain on the tracks of course because he is a Fox Beyond and you may choose , Insanity , Intelligence , Intuition or Impotence.We could say that they are doing wrong while hoping to do good : nave would be a better word to describe them . Jack is hoping to save the ones he loves , but does n't understand that the whole planet will die , while the Winchesters brothers are willing to die for the sake of humanity . The FBI agent is not trying to understand what is going on but wants to catch two fugitives that are threats to his un-supernatural world , where a ghost belongs in a book . He is too rational to understand , maybe to good at what he does to think outside his pragmatic , Cartesian referential mind . And he lacks the creativity or the beliefs that what is really and what he sees are two different things.The season ends well since it has finally redeemed the father and created a tremendous suspense as for the future since in twelve months Dean will die . That 's not much time with all the evil spirits that have been released from hell.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE	1
This is another fun filled , action packed , well written season with the Winchester clan . You just ca n't go wrong with this set ... something for everyone here ! !	1
This show is amazing . I know what you 're thinking . Two pretty boy actors on a CW show ? Ca n't be any good . But brace yourselves . They actually keep their shirts on ! In fact , they 're usually wearing layers . The show takes itself seriously , gives a lot of love to monster mythology and does a tremendous job of going through season story arcs . Season 2 is where they start to have a little more fun in the show and the dark humor shows up . They really begin to find their stride . If you 've somehow missed this show , you need to correct that mistake right now .	1
If you are a fan of the show you want to have this dvd set . I love the outtakes and extras it makes paying for the set worth it .	1
you have got ta check out Supernatural . At first glance I thought that a CW horror show would suck , but this baby does n't shy away from the gore at all . The classic rock music really sealed the deal for me , not to mention the hot chick of the week vibe it has going for it . The two main dudes , Sam and Dean , who can make or break a show like this , are both very natural and easy to root for . The second and third seasons are much stronger than the first ( which is also great , save for the episode `` Bugs '' ) with almost every episode ranging from very good to great . The `` monsters of the week '' are always interesting and the major storyline for the whole season really makes you feel the show is heading somewhere . So hop in the 1967 Chevy Impala and go for a ride .	1
Sam and Dean are back , with new Hunters to help them out . With time running out , and the Yellow Eyed Demon out there , it 's a race to get find him , and avenge their dad . And Soon , Dean makes a shocking deal .	1
From the tear-jerking premiere to the virtually perfect season finale , Season Two of `` Supernatural '' once again demonstrates how much better genre shows get in their second seasons . Take a look at `` Buffy the Vampire Slayer , '' a show which , by the way , has a heavy influence on this wonderful series . BtVS , like `` Supernatural , '' had humble beginnings , but blew the audience and critics away with a stellar second season . `` Supernatural '' does the very same.Everything that was good about the show in the first season was strengthened here . Dean and Sam 's relationship has become layered and , as it is really a story about the bond of the two brothers , becomes the dramatic center of the show . Replacing the `` monster of the week '' format of season one is an over-arching story that develops throughout the season . Even standalone episodes contribute to the main story of the season . If the high level of continuity maintained in this series is enough to get the horror/fantasy fan in you to get all sweaty , get this . The mythology is expanded and strengthened . The black and white , good and evil of demons/humans gets thrown into that grey area we 're all so interested in . The comedy -- again , very Buffy-esque -- is amped up , including many laugh-out-loud moments . The battle between the two brothers and the forces of evil becomes way more epic and also more tragic.All of this comes to a head in the two-part season finale , which is -- as I mentioned above -- a moment of television perfection . I have n't been so euphoric about serialized television since the moment Joss Whedon'sAngel - Complete Series Collector 's Setcame to an end in 2004.Along withHeroes - Season OneandVeronica Mars - The Complete Third Season , the second chapter in Dean and Sam 's journey was among the best of the Fall 06-Spring 07 television season.9/10	1
Great show . I got into it late but now I am a super fan . Too bad they have had some really bad recent seasons ( 8 & 9 )	1
This season is basiclly the exact same as with the first season . Only differences are different characters , different creatures , a couple more story arches start recurring and a couple big story arches are resolved . This season also has the same flaws as the first , it seemed to posess a crazy amount of hot girls and some of the dialogue between Sam and Dean got repetitive . Still enjoyed the suspense , the laughs , the mythology and the action . A good viewing .	1
I was not a fan of SUPERNATURAL after its first season , and indeed I 'm not a huge fan even after Seasons Two and Three . But there is no question that that show made some major strides forward in its sophomore and junior years , deepening the storylines and finding new and innovative ways to structure episodes . Because one of the biggest problems with the show in Season One was its episodic `` demon of the week '' narrative structure , the show grew far more interesting and engaging.In these two seasons SUPERNATURAL also became a far more playful show , willing to engage in self-parody and capable of poking fun at itself . In a way , this mimics the way that one of the shows that has most influenced the series , THE X-FILES , grew . That show for the first couple of episodes was almost unceasingly serious . It was a great show despite this , but it really took off once -- especially with several extraordinary scripts by Darin Morgan -- when it began mixing in comic episodes . Season Two of THE X-FILES saw a mildly comic ( though mainly jut flat out weird ) scripted by Morgan , late in Season Two about circus freaks entitled `` Humbug . '' But the first out and out laugh fest was another Morgan script , `` War of the Coprophages , '' in which Mulder and a scientist named Bambi do battle against cockroaches . ( Darin Morgan only wrote a half dozen scripts for THE X-FILES , but four of those would be among the ten best X-FILES episodes ever , one of them the Emmy Award winning episode `` Clyde Bruckman 's Final Repose , '' which is one of the finest TV episodes of all time , garnering an Emmy not just for Morgan but for guest actor Peter Boyle . ) Certainly THE X-FILES seemed to be an even greater influence on SUPERNATURAL in these two seasons than in Season One . One Season Two episode , in which Sam and Dean give offer Bobby differing accounts of events calls to mind THE X-FILES episode `` Bad Blood , '' in which Mulder and Scully give contradictory reports of events surrounding vampires in Texas ( along with a sheriff played by Luke Wilson -- both episodes were among the dozens of TV episodes or movies loosely based over the years on the great Kurosawa film RASHOMON , which details four incompatible accounts of events in the woods in medieval Japan ) . I do n't know how much of this can be credited to Ben Edlund ( creator of THE TICK in all his forms , as well as a writer on FIREFLY and ANGEL ) joining the writing staff . But in every way the writing in these two seasons showed a sharp increase in sophistication and flexibility . The scripts in Season One were stiff , uninteresting , and frequently just flat out boring . That was rarely the case as the show progressed . No doubt part of the improvement stemmed from the producers gaining new concessions from the CW , which surely allowed them to stray away from the standalone , episodic format that so thoroughly hampered the show in Season One.I frankly found just about every episode in Season One of the show to be completely forgettable . But several episodes in Seasons Two and Three stand out . For instance , one particularly good episode in Season Two does some great twists on the genie legends , with the help of an excellent guest performance by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA 's Tricia Helfer . That episode is emblematic of the new maturity of the show . I can honestly say that I was not surprised ( nor scared ) by a single thing that happened in Season One . It was almost intentionally predictable . But in Helfer 's episode there were some truly interesting twists and surprises . In just about every way , the show got better in these two seasons.I 'm still not what one might term a major fan of the show . Even after three seasons it is a fairly conservative show . It certainly has done little to redefine the horror genre and it has not expanded the scope of horror or fantasy in the way that either THE X-FILES or BUFFY did . Still , there is a great deal to say for a show that is excellent even if it is not innovative . And I admire any series that gets better as it goes along . I received the first three seasons of the series as a gift , but I frankly did not think I was going to continue with the show after finishing the three sets . But now I both plan to buy Season Four come this September and DVR the show upon its return this fall ( it will be going against a very similar show with what is surely a pretty substantial audience overlap , FRINGE -- why do networks do this ? -- the only then that FOX assures in doing this is that both shows will get lower ratings than they might otherwise -- still , FRINGE is a show I really love , so I 'll keep up with SUPERNATURAL via DVR ) . Hopefully I 'll enjoy Season Four as much as Seasons Two and Three .	1
Yes , the two leads are handsome and they may attract young female viewers . But this is not some beefcake sitcom . This is Supernatural , a very dark and often gloomy story of two brothers who can not live a normal life because they must carry on their father 's legacy of demon-hunting . This has dogged them since they were young and watched their own mother die from a demon attack.What complicates matters is that the younger brother , Sam , has some psychic abilities which sometimes put him at risk . Their father even told Dean that he might someday have to kill Sam to save him from himself and to protect others . This leaves Dean with a sense of anxiety that never lets go.What I really like is that many episodes do not have some happy resolution ; instead , the two brothers are left brooding on the life they are forced to live and the complications of their relationship and knowledge of each other . No wife or kids for these guys ; they are stuck on an endless road trip , running from harm or trying to destroy demons before they attack someone else.There are occasional lighthearted moments for comic relief -- thank goodness.Think of this as a cross between Buffy and the X-Files . In fact , many XF writers and producers now work on this show , and it has the same foreboding atmosphere and music .	1
Special Features : `` The Devil 's Roadmap '' , `` Webisodes '' , three commentary tracks , gag reel , deleted/unaired scenesThere was no witchcraft involved in the success of `` Supernatural '' . The show benefited from top notch writing , direction and performances with just the right dash of quirky humor to offset the horror elements of the show . The second season of the show picks up right where the first ended . Dean ( Jensen Ackles ) and Sam ( Jared Padalecki ) have located their dad ( Jeffrey Dean Morgan ) and have the fabled gun fashioned to kill demons in their possession . The trio confront the Demon that killed Dean and Sam 's mom only to find it leaping from person to person finally possessing their father almost forcing the boys to kill him . Driving the Demon out of their father the trio escape with the gun believing that they can still track down the creature , find out why it has harvested children with special psychic abilities and how it plans on using them in its `` war '' against humanity . Then a truck hits Dean 's 1967 Impala . Sam is injured but alive and Dean is on the cusp of death with internal injuries . John makes a deal with the Devil or , in this case , the Demon they were pursuing -- take his life for Dean 's . Before he dies John whispers something to Dean which will resonate throughout the rest of the second season.We get three commentary tracks on `` In My Time of Dying '' ( director Kim Manners and actors Ackles & Padalecki ) , `` What Is And Should Never Be '' ( writer Eric Kripe ) and the first part of the season two finale `` All Hell Breaks Loose '' ( Kripke , Manners and writer Sera Gamble ) along with deleted/unaired scenes on three episodes . `` The Devil 's Road Map '' is exactly that ; a map of the United States showing where each episode takes place in the country You can click on each spot and see material from John 's book with writers like Whitley Striber discussing the various monsters . We also see behind-the-scenes footage of the writers/producers discussing the creation of various episodes such as `` All Hell Breaks Loose '' . These are essentially featurettes on each episode and they are kind of cool . We also get Jared Padalecki 's original screen test on videotape . The quality of the screen test is typical for home video cameras as it was really never intended to be shown . It 's kind of cool to be able to contrast his first take on the character vs. the final performance from the pilot episode and subsequent character development over the course of two seasons.We also get three `` webisode '' featurettes including `` The Inside Scoop with Ivan Hayden/VFX Supervisor '' discussing the visual effects of the show , the overall look of these effects and how he approaches integrating the visuals into the show . `` Inside the Writer 's Room '' which also aired on the `` Supernatural '' website during season two features writer/creator/producer Kripke , writer/producer John Shiban and producer/writer/director Robert Singer where the trio point out that the show uses Urban folklore as the basis for most of their episodes . Sadly we ca n't see the board with story ideas behind them . We also get glimpses of some of the storyboards including plenty of clips from the second season . `` The Inside Scoop with Chris Cooper '' is the final webisode included and features the prop master for `` Supernatural '' who discusses `` all the toys '' that the cast use on the show . Cooper discusses some of the fun stuff he gets to create including the guns and devices that Dean & Sam use . The amusing gag reel rounds things out including a very funny scene where Padalecki has a practical joke played on him during shooting . `` Supernatural '' looks extremely good overall with nice color reproduction and detail . There are some digital artifacts and the images do blur a bit when there is rapid action on screen ( which could be due to the fact that the show is shot and mastered in HD although it largely captures the `` look '' of film ) but on the whole the show looks quite good.An exceptional second season with only a few dud episodes , I 'd highly recommend the `` Supernatural '' . The show has hip humor that manages to capture much of the fun elements that made `` The X-Files '' so memorable ( and hard to reproduce as the failed but interesting `` Kolchak : The Night Stalker '' from 2005 demonstrated ) . As with the previous the discs are housed in a fold out case with a brief synopsis and credits for each episode .	1
I just could n't wait to watch it , I do n't know , when I saw couple of episodes on TV I was like `` nothing special '' , but when I decided to give it a shot and start from the beggining ... .LOL I just fell in love with it . So after 2 seasons I was completly addicted to it . Season 3 is as funny as previous ones , lots of my favourite characters ( of course Logan and Veronica : ) ) I also liked the previev episode of season 4..but I do n't know if the season 4 was actually made or if the series was already cancelled : ( ( What a schame it would be , really great thing to watch : ) ) I enjoy getting new dvd 's to my collection like Veronica enjoys the thought about getting a PONY : ) ) ) I think this caracter is very funny-I WONT MORE VERONICA MARS PLEASE ! ! ! ! Whoever is in charge PLS ! ! !	1
This was such a wonderful series . The acting was so superb . Why do series get cancelled and the trash stays on ? I will never understand , but thanks to Amazon.com , I have streamed and watched every episode and will probably watch again . Yes , I know there will be a movie out next month , but that is just not the same is it ? Better than nothing maybe , but this series was cancelled with so many open questions . Like ending in the middle of a sentence . It neve should have been cancelled . Such a waste .	1
After all the fuss with the film , I could n't wait to check out what the show was all about . I 'm addicted ! I ca n't believe they ever canceled this show .	1
Such an awesome series . Too bad it ended without closure , though . Makes me leary of watching new series , because that seems to happen a lot . Loved Veronica throughout the series , however , she was a little over the top in this last season with the & # 34 ; cutie pie & # 34 ; behavior . But , overall , wonderful series .	1
Loved this series . We were so into watching that we had a hard time stopping . We watched the total season one episode after another until we finished it . Great season .	1
I just enjoyed it..it was always a well written script a good mystery andthe relationships were real . good job !	1
We began watching Veronica Mars because it was recommended . Glad we did watch - loved the characters and the fact that they kept showing up . Dick Casablacas was a character who was difficult to like - just shows what a good actor Ryan Hansen is . I hope they keep making more Veronica Mars ...	1
I love this show , I ca n't believe it only lasted 3 seasons . The main character is only a teenager but is very savvy !	1
Sad that it 's the last season . It 's a great show . I love the characters . The show can get pretty dark , but also very realistic . Looking forward to the movie next year !	1
Okay , I got & # 34 ; hooked & # 34 ; in amazon.com prime viewing Veronica Mars 10 years after this program first aired , and in the interest of those who were and are like me , late to the program , I wo n't provide spoilers . That being said , I 'm really so into this major plot line that I did jump ahead to the grand finale , and now I am watching all the 2nd and 3rd seasons the way one eats popcorn or salted peanuts -- I hate having to stop watching and go on to real life . I find that no matter what episode I watch , there is a great deal of continuity of story line , characters that Veronica 's sleuthing bring to life , and there is such genuine warmth between the father-daughter pair that make this series worth the time and trouble to watch . You could label me the & # 34 ; mountain girl who finally had time to see old TV shows worth saving & # 34 ; , oh but perhaps too trite . Anyway , what keeps me into this story is the completeness of every episode , and the way the final episode wraps up the characters very nicely . It keeps you guessing right to the end , no matter how many mysteries you 've see on TV or in the movies . Sorry that this is one for the history books . Well written and acted .	1
Well , now I know what all the hype was about and why they are making a movie . Because the series was cancelled suddenly with NO ENDING ! ! ! How dumb are these TV execs to cancel a show without allowing an ending ? I must see the movie when it comes out so I know how it ends . Kudos to Kristen Bell and the guy who plays her dad ( ca n't pronounce or spell his name ) and all the friends and boyfriends . I hope we get to see all these characters again soon !	1
My wife & I remember this series when it was on TV , but we did not pay it much attention . The teen-love-triangle-high-school-drama had been playing itself too much . However , recently , while being on bed rest for a few weeks & coincidentally seeing the new movie previews ; I was intrigued by the hype . Then I decided to give it a try . ( We are Amazon Prime Members & I saw it each time I logged in to watch a streaming show ) It was better than we expected ! It genuinely delivered - Veronica ( Kristen Bell ) sublimating her grief & pain into finding her best friends murderer , while helping her dad & fellow high school students with individualized cases - after they had all abandoned her due to the events of her father , then the sherif of Neptune , suffering at the hands of the wealthy , powerful parents . The stories , the filming , the writing was very good ! We were completely addicted to the show and watched it until it came to the final episode . Yes , it had it 's cheese & some Episodes did not quite hold true ; it was still a very good series , launched many young Hollywood actors & actresses as well as showing up some faces of previous young Hollywood actors/actresses now playing adult parents to this generation . We will be seeing the movie this weekend-now that I 'm off bed rest ! ( Can one be a Marshmellow in post-haste ? )	1
Always loved watching this series . Also watched latest Veronica Mars movie - it was great .	1
I absolutely loved this show . I see it has been listed as a cult thing and I 'm not sure what that means . I 'm a very senior Senior so my interest may be surprising but I had a hard time doing anything else until I 'd finished watching the last episode . All the good things said about this series are true -- I was just very disappointed to learn that it was ending with this season . I have recommended it highly to several friends , but have n't heard their feedback yet . What a gem !	1
This is entertaining for both young teenagers and up through older adults - probably kids too . I tries it out and was soon sucked in by the excellent character actors , most of all Veronica . each epidode has multiple plots and sometimes there are great 2 episode stories . Everything links back to an overall plot to keep you interested .	1
Could n't think of a thing . It is too bad the show ended after 3 seasons . Just watched the VM Movie . It was just enough to tie up some loose ends , but opened up new mysteries that I suspect will remain just that ... mysteries . The very last episode was really depressing . Keith 's roll especially was sad . Always the bridesmaid ; never the bride was wearing a bit thin.That being said ; I loved it anyway . Logan and Veronica - epic saga , spanning vast continents ... to paraphrase LoVe . If you have n't watched this series it is so sweet , sad , cleaver , romantic , mysterious and wonderful . Yep , I 'm hooked and got my hubby to watch all 3 seasons and the movie . We have grand kids , so it is fun for all ages . Ah , to be young again . Not ! Just kidding . Watching VM made me remember why I was glad to graduate HS and never looked back . It is painful being a teenager and this series was a reminder ( fictional though it is ) how vulnerable and at risk they can be . Food for thought .	1
Although I am not completely through season , I have enjoyed the eleven episodes I ave watch . I paused to was the movie version that was real eased in early March and to go on my trip to St Louis , Mo . But I do plan to resume binging on Veronica Mars to complete season three . I have thoroughly enjoyed this show and thank Amazon for making it possible . The cast , including guests performed superbly and made the show a legend within its rights .	1
- Veronica ( investigating Piz 's car , from which his moving-in stuff had been stolen ) : `` It does n't look like they jimmied their way in . `` - Piz : `` It was n't locked . `` - Veronica : `` College campus . All your worldly possessions . Where are you from ? Brigadoon ? `` Nope , Neptune in Cali is n't exactly as magical as Brigadoon . Neptune , like most places , hides its share of festering secrets and nefarious intents , which keeps busy the hardworking Mars Investigations agency , staffed by Keith Mars and his ever resourceful 19-year-old daughter Veronica . So for this 3rd and final season , we again say hello - and bid farewell - to these folks up in Neptune . With high school flush in her rearview mirror , part-time shamus , now full-time college student Veronica Mars turns her sardonic attention to life at Hearst College . But some things simply do n't change for our feisty heroine . She still helps out her dad in the gumshoe department and still suffers an exhausting relationship with her emotionally fractured bad boy of a boyfriend , Logan Echolls . And she still touts a rep for ferreting out , and digging in , and nosing about . And , since she does get results , she 's soon up to her neck putting out fires and solving campus dilemmas.Some plot SPOILERS follow.VERONICA MARS - THE COMPLETE THIRD SEASON is still very good , but it 's the weakest of the three seasons . This time the main ongoing story arcs revolve around Veronica hunting down a campus serial rapist and sleuthing another baffling murder . On a smaller scale , her mystery plate is heaped with servings the likes of a stolen team playbook , some missing tapes , an accusation of plagiarism , a vanished heiress , a secret society , a holdup at a costume casino party , etc . So add that to her freshman woes . And , being Veronica Mars , she also does n't take long to alienate an activist sorority and a raunchy fraternity , as well as the weasely assistant of her criminology professor . But at least her crime solving is made easier by her gigs as Library Helpdesk girl and as the photographer of the college paper . And she 's always got her buds to lean on , Wallace , Mac , and Logan , even if their onscreen appearances are sporadic ( just one reason this season is n't as good ) .But the show 's not all about Veronica ( it 's just mostly about Veronica ) . My second favorite character in the show is Keith Mars , and he has his own messes to muddle thru . Logan continues to have his own issues and comes close to overdoing the tortured soul thing ; Wallace juggles basketball with his mechanical engineering aspirations ; Weevil is now out on parole ( from his misdeeds in Season 2 ) but must maintain a job ; and Mac , well , she 's still shy . Meanwhile , Veronica 's clique widens in the forms of the happy-go-lucky , kinda dull Piz ( Wallace 's roomie ) and party girl , kinda dull Parker ( Mac 's roomie ) . So , hello , new loves and old loves , and there 's even a hasty wedding . As usual , it 's a blending of heartbreak and mystery and life lessons and surprises . Just life in Neptune.SPOILERS end.So I managed to blast thru all 20 episodes ( plus extras ) in one sleep-deprived - but worth it - marathon viewing session . Something to be said for watching your favorite shows on dvd instead of television , the dvds lending an instant gratification and an immediacy which suck in the viewer even more . Having said that , not only am I bummed out about the series 's abrupt demise but pretty upset that there was n't even a proper ending to the series . Again , only 20 episodes here , with the last one leaving its audience hanging off a cliff . Not cool , CW.Two paragraphs now about the plentiful bonus stuff , which can be found on the 6th disc ( there are 6 discs in all in this set ) . Most interesting and quite bittersweet are the two segments devoted to what would have been Season 4 : one 's a 12 minute clip giving us a feel for what the next season would 've been like ( Veronica in the FBI ) , the other has the series creators talking about their pitch presentation for season 4 and their planned new direction for the show . Both segments , to me , feel decidedly unsettling because most of the familiar stuff ( ie : the town of Neptune , the school backdrop , Veronica 's father and circle of friends ) had been taken away . A whole new mess of characters are introduced , all of whom I felt a bit hostile to.Under the banner `` Going Undercover with Rob Thomas '' ( and with his sycophantic right hand man Dan Etheridge ) we get 9 ho-hum featurettes : `` Main Titles : Why the Change ? `` ; `` Rob 's Directing Experience '' ; `` Favorite Guest Star Moments '' ; `` Veronica Mars : Mean Girl '' - in which series creator Rob Thomas addresses the public outcry that Veronica was too mean in season 3 ; `` The Politics of Veronica Mars '' - concerning the negative reactions to the show ; Thomas goes over his `` Favorite Veronica and Logan Moments '' and his `` Favorite Veronica and Keith Moments '' ; `` Do-Overs ? '' - scenes of which Thomas was n't too fond ; and `` Highlights '' - more of Thomas 's fave moments . Then 24 minutes worth of 16 unaired scenes with Thomas 's intros ; a 7 minute gag reel ( best was Enrico Colantoni 's many takes of `` I finally got the police report on the **** 's suicide '' ) . The Webisode gallery offers 5 clips , the most fun of which is Kristen Bell and Chris Lowell Q & A-ing each other . There 's also a guidebook which breaks down the episodes . A ton of extras here , so I should n't gripe ; yet I wish Kristen Bell and cast had done an interview or even an episode commentary.For three years VERONICA MARS has delivered the goods , consistently bringing it with the clever and the funny , with the heartwrenching angst and the occasional melodramatic twist . Once in a while , my thoughts were even provoked . Along with the crisp plotting and snappy banter , the show presented relationships that were complicated and fluid and real and multi-faceted mysteries which perplexed . But by this season 's end the show had kind of broken away from its normal pattern , that of each episode being pivotal and acting as chapters to one cohesive storyline . The last five episodes instead tended to be self-contained ones , and that 's when the show really began to feel fractured . There are less gems here than in the first 2 seasons , although most of the episodes are still darn watchable . If I had to pick favorites , three episodes instantly spring to mind : `` Debasement Tapes , '' in which Paul Rudd guest stars as a rumpled , near alcoholic rock star living off his old glory ; `` Postgame Mortem , '' in which a moping Logan ends up babysitting a cheerful 11-year-old girl ; and episode 20 , which ends the series just as things begin to get darn good.In the acting department , Jason Dohring ( the ever moody Logan ) again stands out . Enrico Colantoni continues to make a case for his character Keith Mars as being the best dad in the universe . My most cherished moments in the series have to do with Veronica and Keith doing their daughter-dad thing . There 's just this amazing level of understanding , caring , and humor between them , and conveyed wonderfully by Bell and Colantoni . Whenever they 're in a scene together , the world is good . And , as always , Kristen Bell , playing that spunky , tenacious girl detective , effortlessly carries the show.But , well , the show 's done now , and the superb cast scattered , with Bell having moved on to HEROES and Jason Dohring , to MOONLIGHT . But it 's still gon na take a while before the bittersweet lyrics to the theme song stop sticking in my brain : `` A long time ago , we used to be friends . '' VERONICA MARS , you see , it was a very good show . And , to echo Keith Mars on his daughter Veronica , `` I find her nosiness charming . ''	1
Good third season . The only thing that happened at the end is Logan and Veronica did n't end up together , which I was waiting for . A little disappointed . But then I decided to watch the movie .	1
I think it follows the quality of the other 2 seasons without falling in to the & # 34 ; same old & # 34 ; trap . It stays exciting but ends expecting another season , which as far as I know does not happen . There is a movie I have not watched yet , hoping that is as good as the series . I have enjoyed the series enough to go explore what other movies/shows they have done .	1
This show is fresh and smart and always had clever idea for new cases and stories yet it was canceled ? ? When Smallville which is sorta just dragging on these days is going on to it 's 7th season . But hey at least that 's way better than 7th Heaven which at least is n't coming back . Why ca n't the CW bring back Veronica if they could bring back the lame 7th Heaven after canceling it . I got into Veronica Mars the most this season , so it really bugs me that it got canceled . Hell I think everything was canceled but Smallville and Supernatural , so why would they have to cut this show too ? It was actually good even if Veronica could act just a little too much like an overly goofy version of Buffy . It was still a really good unpredictable teen detective show and beats a lot of the crap shows that actually were n't canceled this year !	1
We came into the seasons after they were over on the TV , but thought all three seasons were well written , entertaining , and fun . It was easy to get attached to the characters and were glad we could watch two at a time because you are often left with cliff hangers . Sadly , the end of this season left us with a major cliff hanger that will not be resolved until hopefully the movie coming out does . That was my only complaint . There should have been more seasons following this one .	1
For fans of the old Veronica Mars TV series , everything will fit like an old glove . I had never seen the series , but I still enjoyed the movie a whole bunch . Good for a rainy weekend afternoon . Does n't require a lot of deep thinking and no messages to ponder at the end . Just a good old fashioned murder mystery .	1
The third season was as good as the previous two . All and all it was a good series from beginning to end .	1
I had never watched this show before and came across it . I was so sad to find out that after season three , the show got canceled . To make matters worse , season 3 ended with a huge cliffhanger . It was a great show and worth keeping .	1
Yet the writing is superb . Characters are interesting . Story arcs are involved and the cast was spot on for the most part . I fired through three seasons in a month . Very unfortunate about the abrupt ending while we are on our 20th season and spinoff of the Jersey Shore .	1
Love Love LoVe Veronica Mars ! I wo n't spoil it for you -- but there are a lot of new adventures in store for the VMars crew . And the intrigue , wit , and repartee are still cery much intact . The only thing I was bummed about was the remixed tgeme song .	1
This show was fabulous and I highly recommend it for those who love mystery and action and strong , smart leading female characters !	1
So glad the fans stayed on them to make a movie , which I did watch as well . The actors are great , the stories as well . I hope they make another movie in a couple years to catch us up with them again .	1
i enjoyed her in high school a bit better . Though the show still is enjoyable and i would recommend nice fun show that is not completely dumb as many are today .	1
I am disappointed that this show ended after only three seasons . I love all the characters , especially Veronica 's father , played by Enrico Colantoni . I 'll definitely see the movie and hope it resolves all the issues left hanging by the early demise of the show .	1
This season continues to please with it 's twists & turns . When characters behaving predictably , it is believably so . The last episode clearly shows that the season ended and the producers pulled the plug without completing the story line , leaving the audience wondering what happens next ? Or what happens to conclude the story line ? Maybe the moving coming out in March will pick up the thread . However I hope to see some of the same characters . We have a girls night out planned for it .	1
With high school now completely behind her , Veronica Mars ( Kristen Bell ) heads off to college . In spite of her best efforts , she 's stuck in Neptune , attending Hearst College and living at home with her dad , Keith ( Enrico Colantoni ) . As a result , it 's really no surprise when mystery and danger find her again.Veronica 's well earn reputation and the person who can solve the unsolvable gets her involved in one case after another . Who is behind the `` Welcome Wagon '' and steals new student 's stuff ? Who would kidnap a monkey ? And where is the missing member of the board of trustees ? Unlike previous seasons , there are two bigger mysteries . The first involves the serial rapist on the Hearst campus . And the second one begins when college dean Cyrus O'Dell ( Ed Begley , Jr. ) is found dead in his office.And we ca n't leave out her personal life . Her on again off again relationship with Logan ( Jason Dohring ) creates problems , especially since friend Wallace 's ( Percy Daggs III ) new roommate Piz ( Chris Lowell ) is also interested in her . With all this going on , will she ever have time to study ? Unfortunately , this is the final season of a show I fell in love with right away . The mysteries were sharp , requiring concentration to follow every week . Yet the clues were there . Veronica has a sharp sense of humor that is wonderful for lightening the mood of the usually dark show . The relationship soap opera , while at times annoying , never got too bad . And all the acting was top notch.Having praised it , this is my least favorite season of the show . And it 's not because there were two shorter mysteries and a couple stand alone episodes . It was because the adult tone , definitely always present , became even more pronounced . Of course , that 's what you 'd expect with rape being a subject for half the season . Even the details of Veronica 's personal life made me uncomfortable at times.As a result , I do n't recommend this show for young kids . Older teens and adults will absolutely love this sly combination of wit and noir .	1
Love the characters ; the way it ends was traumatizing .	1
I love the Nancy Drew style of this show . A twist to most Private Eyes by having a teenager solving what seems to be real crime on a teenager level . Learning from her private eye dad.. and seemingly real life situations on a college campus .	1
I just wrapped up viewing the last of the Veronica Mars TV shows . Had to get through all three seasons before watching the new VM movie . Next to Firefly ( another too soon canceled TV show ) , Veronica Mars is the best thing I 've watched in a long time . Highly recommended . Great acting , superb writing , excellent & # 34 ; snarkiness & # 34 ; to keep things entertaining and moving along . I have to say that they actually did a pretty good job of wrapping up entire season with the last episode .	1
this season of veronica mars was thriling it always keept me on edge and always wonting to watch the next episode there is only one thing that i did not like and that was the the season ended and there is no season 4 to go on that is the only thing that i did not like .	1
I have been a big fan of veronica mars for a very long time ! I 'm not that old , but I have been watching since season 1 , and I think that after I 'm finished watching season 3 , I 'm going to watch it all over from the beginning ! I 've always been a big fan of detective shows . I also watch bones and CSI and so on . I would recommend this show to anyone who likes detective shows .	1
My husband and I love this show . Too bad it was only 3 seasons . But I hear there is a movie coming out .	1
This was interesting for the series to go from High School to college . Most of the cast remains and Veronica is on the case again . The sizzling romance with Logan is rekindled . The college scene is somewhat believable , but I thought needed a little bit more work . The last scene was a heartbreaker .	1
The shows writers are excellent . I like the whole cast of characters . It 's funand it has good contemporary stories .	1
I have Enjoyed all of her series very much good cast of characters and good show themes . writing is great	1
love the series . well written , well acted , and excellant all around . would like to see the series continued . thumbs up	1
This was a cool series 3 - Veronica Mars . I learned to like the characters after season 1 had ended and that 's when this series got good . I gave it 5 stars because the show came together so well . KRISTEN BELL is charming as a modern day Nancy Drew mistery solver .	1
I love this show . Wish there were more seasons . They left it open ended ! Very excited about the upcoming movie !	1
Loved it . loved it . loved it . Ca n't think of anything negative to say about this episode I purchased from Amazon .	1
I chose 4 stars because this is a really good television show but I am saving the 5 star rating for a knock your socks off show . I really enjoyed it and if I had the option I would give it 4 1/2 start .	1
Loved it from beginning to end . And the movie was the ending I was looking for . tough stories lines but told in a light mood .	1
You must watch all three seasons.A television show that actually deals with classism , racism and sexism.Smart , sarcastic and entertaining .	1
Season Three of `` Veronica Mars '' is often panned by critics and fans alike . I start my review on that note not because I plan to dispel claims of a decrease in quality ( creator Rob Thomas addresses these issues on the special features without dismissing them ) but to let the fans of `` Veronica Mars '' know that they have absolutely nothing to worry about . This is classic V. Mars.Veronica Mars , a show very centered on the high school setting , easily survives something that has killed countless shows : The shift to college . Hearst College is a great new location for the majority of the action of the series , giving us many new and interesting sets and a variety of new characters . Though the show may suffer from too much focus on said new characters ( namely Piz , a true tool ) instead of established favorites ( Wallace catches it the worst here ) , the lost points are gained back by the strength of the series . Kristen Bell consistently giving a stellar performance as the titular Veronica . Usually -- I know this is true for a lot of people -- the most captivating characters are the supporting ones . However , Veronica is simply the best character the series has to offer and that 's saying a lot , as the characterization in this series is almost always flawless . With characters like Logan , Keith Mars , Dick Casablancas , Wallace , and Weevil , one ca n't go wrong.Changes were made ( due to pressure from the Network ) , most notably the shift of the usual format of a season-long arc carried out through mostly standalone episodes to a very different kind of set up . The season is instead divided into three different mystery arcs . The first few episodes focus on a rapist on the Hearst campus , the next revolving around a classic whodunnit murder mystery , and the final five episodes ( the weakest of the series ) are essentially standalones . They function well enough as standalones , but the strength of the series has always been in it 's story arcs.Another plus about this season is the fact that Disc Six is packed with previews . We get the never-before-seen pitch for what Season Four of Veronica Mars would have been ( which never came to fruition , thanks to the idiocy of television executive Les Moonves ) and more extras than you will know what to do with . It is truly a shame that this intelligent series was cancelled , as it was easily one of the best shows I have ever seen.9/10	1
Veronica Mars is the new Nancy Drew 21st century style . Action packed and lots of fun too.Will wait for more .	1
This was one of the best series I 've ever watched . Loved Veronica with her kickass attitude . Wish the series had continued with her going into the FBI .	1
First off , start with season1 . It 'll mean more if you watch them in order . Season 2 was a little random for me , but I really liked the way they pushed it forward with Season 3 ( in college ) . We are all looking forward to the Veronica Mars Movie next year ! ( thanks to a GREAT Kickstarter campaign -- the fans have spoken and we want more ! ! )	1
This review comes from a 75 year old female . I HATED to see the shows end . All the actors were excellent . It was so different and could n't wait to see the next serial . They do n't make good shows any more , just murder and horror ones . What has happen to all the good writers ?	1
Good show . Wish there had been more seasons . It is definitely worth watching if you like detective shows . Also watch the other two seasons .	1
I enjoyed all three seasons of V. Mars.Sad to say : season three was the lastseason but the movie : Veronica Mars opens March 2014 .	1
Warning ! Spoilers littered throughout this review ! Note : I 'll rewrite the following paragraph soon ( pressing matters keeps me from doing more right now ) but we now know from reliable sources that Veronica is not going to be back in any way . She will not be back as a college student and she will not be back as an FBI agent in a reworked format . The only reason the CW has n't already made the announcement , according to Kristin of Eonline.com , is that they are afraid of the anger fans will heap on them . They will deserve that anger ! For me the CW will always be the network that made room for a mother-daughter beauty pageant , a second season of the Pussycat Doll show , and THE FARMER TAKES A WIFE . It had room for absolutely miserable excuses for shows like these , but could n't find room on its schedule for VERONICA MARS . That pretty much tells you all you need to know about the CW.I will revise this first paragraph as soon as we know for certain , but it is not true , as has been almost universally reported , that VERONICA MARS has been cancelled . As of today this is what we know for certain : it has not yet been placed on the fall schedule . The head of the CW , Dawn Ostroff , says that while the VERONICA MARS of the past three seasons is gone , she is working with Rob Thomas and Kristen Bell on a possible future project , which most believe means the widely reported successor series to VERONICA MARS , in which the plot would shoot to the future , to deal with Veronica Mars as a FBI agent . This would be accompanied with a completely new supporting cast and perhaps even a title change in the show . Numerous sources have reported and Dawn Ostroff herself has stated that she has until June 15 , 2007 to make a decision on whether to pick this new series up . To be honest , not many insiders are offering fans much hope that this series will be picked up . But as the old expression goes , `` The opera ai n't over until the fat lady sings . '' Well , she is n't singing yet , but she might be warming up . We 'll have to keep our fingers crossed that the next three weeks will bring some good news.Certainly we need not fear for the long term future of Kristen Bell . One of the most talented actresses on TV , she is not only lovely but a gifted actress , singer , and dancer all in one diminutive package . The question is not whether she will be involved in some project in the future , but which one . Most immediately it appears that she will be the narrator for GOSSIP GIRL ( this might not happen if she plays VERONICA MARS in some way , but even if she does , it might be possible for her to serve as narrator -- she did do the narration for the pilot that critics saw at the Upfront in New York ) .If VERONICA MARS is cancelled and we see no more of our pint-sized but large-spirited teen detective , we can , in a way , be grateful that we got three full seasons . I fell in love with this show immediately and watched it religiously through its entire run . When UPN inexplicably scheduled it opposite one of my other favorite shows , LOST , I recorded LOST and watched VERONICA MARS live . Veronica was when she debuted the latest in a string of strong female characters to have arisen in the wake of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER making TV safe for such creatures . She was , in fact , the heroine who most resembled Buffy . The first two seasons were simply glorious , two utterly perfect seasons that topped almost everything else on television . Season Three , unfortunately , represented something of a slip for the show . ( I refuse it give it less than five stars , however , simply because it was still better than most else on television . ) Many people have felt this and have speculated on why . My own belief is that VERONICA MARS suffered from network interference . Both Season One and Season Two were driven by deep emotional needs in Veronica to solve major mysteries . Season Three had no such deep mystery ( though there were two lesser ones ) and as a result lacked the emotional intensity of the previous seasons . No doubt a lot of this was the result of the network putting pressure on the show to make it accessible to new viewers . We 've seen this take place again and again over the years with various shows and the brute fact is : it does n't work . Mainly such an approach wins no new viewers and alienates many of the viewers the show already has . I spent all of Season Three with a mild feeling of disappointment , yearning for the intensity to return . Yet , sometimes it did . `` Spit and Eggs , '' which resolved the campus rape mystery , was as stressful and as wonderful as the best Season One and Two episodes , but it turned out to be the exception and the rules.My own thinking on the `` how to win new fans '' issue with series is that watering down the show never works . Instead , I think the way to go is to rely on online streaming and DVD to get potential fans caught up . I did n't , for instance , start watching FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS last fall when it debuted . But I was able to catch up by watching it on NBC.com . The CW put up a few episodes for streaming , but only a few . What they needed to do was place the entire season online for its shows , much like NBC does . Serial dramas like VERONICA MARS can attract and build up a fanatically devoted fanbase , but you keep that fanbase by continuing to produce a high quality serial drama , not by forcing it to become more and more episodic . The truth is that networks almost always complicate rather than improve a series through their meddling.Another perplexing problem with Season Three was the near disappearance of several supporting characters . At times I wondered if Wallace was still part of the show . And Weevil played less and less of a role as the season went along . My understanding is that Francis Capra , who plays Weevil , had some health problems during the season ( and that medication he was taking led to a rather startling weight gain early in the year with accompanying skin problems -- these seem to be on the way to clearing up by season end ) . Mac became an opening credits character , but she did n't seem to play any more important role than she had in the past.Still , some things remained really great about the show . Veronica and her father continued to have one of the most satisfying , if not the most satisfying , father-daughter relationship on TV . Veronica continued to impress and overwhelm all those disposed to doubt her . And as a huge BATTLESTAR GALACTICA fan she made the best frakkin ' BSG references on all TV ( though Dwight Schruette of THE OFFICE and Seth Cohen of THE O.C . gave her a run for her money ) , even helping one client find a woman she met at the BSG session at Comicon . But a lot of the passion of the previous years was gone . TV critics noticed . For its first two seasons , VERONICA MARS was probably one of the five most critically praised shows on TV . In Season Three it probably dropped out of the top ten to somewhere in the 10-15 spot . I blame this entirely on network interference.The most heartbreaking part of the season came with the finale , which left several plot lines unresolved . This was not entirely the network 's fault . Rob Thomas obstinately refused to do a `` just in case '' ending for the season . He apparently wanted to increase the pressure on the network to renew the show . That is one philosophy , but I prefer Joss Whedon 's when he was on BUFFY . His idea was that you never knew whether you would get cancelled ( fortunately BUFFY never did , though both ANGEL and FIREFLY would be ) , so you leave the end of each season in a place where it could both lead into something if you get renewed , but it would be satisfying to the fans if you do n't . EVERWOOD filmed two versions of its Season Three finale in case it did n't get renewed . It did n't , but thankfully a finale existed that wrapped up the show Now , unless the FBI Agent Veronica Mars series materializes , we are left with a dangling show . Moreover , it will dangle most likely regardless , since a time shift to several years in the future will take the show well past the subsequent events on the show . Networks should do a better job of ending serial drams with dedicated fanbases , but the executive producers need to take some responsibility as well . I can understand Rob Thomas 's reluctance to not go gentle into that good night , but I wish he had filmed an episode that did a better job of wrapping up the series . As it is , we are left wondering whether the homicidal nutjob Logan beat up got his revenge , whether Jake Kane was once again a part of the show 's story , and whether Vinnie Van Low was the new sheriff of Neptune.Television is going to miss this show . Although NBC debuts THE BIONIC WOMAN in the fall of 2007 ( with a crackerjack production staff , a strong cast , and some very good writers , making this look like a more like one of the more promising series of 2007-2008 ) , television is lacking somewhat right now in strong female characters . In fact , only BATTLESTAR GALACTICA with characters like Laura Roslin , Sharon Agathon , and Starbuck has much in the way of strong women . I 'm delighted that we got to see Kristen Bell portray Veronica for three wonderful years , but I 'm still going to miss her mightily .	1
I wish there was more . Loved the series.On a side note Amazon 's video quality seems to have improved from just a few months ago . They need to work on their app for the Roku 3 .	1
My household discovered this series about a month ago . We 'd never seen it when it was broadcast . We found the cast , actors , and story lines interesting and , considering the relative age of the series , not dated . Season 3 retained most of the original cast but added a few new ones . Veronica is now in college but attends few classes . She spends most of her time solving big and little problems for her friends . If you like this type of TV you 'll like Veronica Mars . A side note : Season 4 was planned , trailers produced , but never happened . Season 4 trailers can be found online .	1
Loved it ! Sad to see it go ! Love all the spins , performance by actors , and the storyline . Ca n't wait for the movie to be released !	1
Another great season of a great show . Too bad it did n't last longer . I ca n't wait for the movie . Free to watch for Prime members .	1
Crime and mystery in sunny California . Overall , the series is a great production ; characters are well realized and believable story line . I 've watched the episodes a couple of times and it holds up fairly well though Season 1 dates to Sep 2004 .	1
This series is a classic . It ca n't be duplicated . No matter what Kristen Bell does , she will never surpassthis series .	1
I loved all 3 seasons of Veronica . This one leaves you a bit hanging . Excited for the movie . Hoping it will wrap everything all up	1
The third season ended after 20 episodes . In Previous years there were 22 episodes.In the last episode ( 20 ) of season three there were to many story lines that needed to come to a conclusion.Does anyone know how the story lines ended up - Election of Sheriff Etc.Looking forward to the movie coming out in 2014 .	1
I never watched this show when it was broadcast and I 'm glad I did n't because I would n't have been able to handle the wait between weeks and seasons . Binge watching this show made it much more enjoyable and I ca n't wait for the movie because the way the show was cancelled in the middle of a season was a travesty . WATCH IT !	1
Is it possible ? I love this character ! Maybe because of my childhood fascination with Nancy Drew and this is her come to life in the modern age , maybe because this is the chic I wish I were with the feisty and the smarts and the always getting her man ( or lady criminal ) . I do n't know , all I can say is yes , thank you , more please ! Thrilled for the movie and I really hope we can get a new movie every couple of years , even made for TV . Keep Veronica Mars alive !	1
Turned in to marshmellow ! Love this show . Wish it had lasted more seasons . Hope that with the movies 's success they will restart the seasons	1
Veronica Mars was not my first option if something better is on , but nonetheless it was a good production and I enjoyed it when I wanted some escape - and my favorites were not on.The abrupt ending of the series was an `` oh no ! '' . I knew it was coming , but I still can not believe that the plug was pulled on this show . It had its charm and the plot was getting thick and then ... .and then ... .kapowie ! !	1
I 've watched all 3 seasons , this is one of the best series I 've seen lately . It 's to bad that it ended in 2007 . I 'm curious as to why it ended , somehow the networks always end a good series and replace it with something that flops in a few weeks.Enjoyed it and highly recommend it .	1
Lots to chew on and enjoy whether you were already familiar with these characters or not . Nice flow to the plotline . I enjoyed it very much . The writer made her mother 's addictive personality an unavoidable inheritance of Veronica 's . Will our heroine embrace this trait as a weakness that she will always fall prey to or will she find a way to make it a strength ? This was the consistent psychological thread that deepened the murder mystery and gave the audience a super meaningful connection to Veronica Mars . All of the characters from her childhood were grappling with a question : to what extent are we unable to throw off genetic proclivities and childhood traumas and other cultural influences in order to walk our own path in life ?	1
I am a grandmother . I really loved the TV series and watched it for the third time on Amazon to prepare for the movie . I was very pleased so many cast members returned to do the movie . I think they all liked the series also . Why did such a fine series disappear from view ? I do n't get it . What they have on now is a big marathon trying to say that all girls have sex by 14 ! Well bull to that . Watching Veronica Mars , it made virginity serious and precious . When she was raped at a party , what woman would not feel her loss . The relationship with her father is a rarity in American viewing . She was raised by a single Dad who loved the heck out of her and expected her to love herself . He supported her , but also guided her . Bring her back . We need this series . Thanks for the movie , but it only made me want more of the story .	1
I have to confess after the series opening presentation I never really watched the rest of the series.This was probably made to placate the devoted series watchers that found their programs cut off . Many different series ether just stop or have a pansy wrap up for the last episode . If we are lucky as with `` Veronica Mars '' we are treated to a full length movie that tries to incorporate the essence of the series . With Star Trek there was a series of movies . We can only hope so here.Veronica was a teenage private eye . Now older and supposedly wiser on the verge of getting a cushy law firm job , she is called back home to help pick a lawyer to defend an old boyfriend . He was accused of murdering one of her old classmates . Naturally as we would 've suspected she gets sucked into trying to track down the culprit ( s ) herself . Will she give up the cushy job and her new boyfriend and a new life just to save her old boyfriend and possibly cleanup the local law enforcement at the same time ? If you seen one of these `` let 's find culprit as the only way to vindicate the suspect '' stories that you see most of them . The worth in this particular movie is that it has the formula and the characters that we 've all come to identify with in the series . This film also gives hope that there might be a series of films .	1
My wife is a huge fan of this show and she really loved the movie . I was a casual fan and was able to enjoy the movie with her . Her biggest complaint was that Logan was so skinny and sickly looking . The team Logan roots run deep for her , haha .	1
This was a good story as follow up to the seasons of VM . I liked the story and was glad that many loose ends were tied up . I always follow a series and when it stops it is irritating that all the unanswered questions remain . Not so here . Love the character of Veronica Mars , just the right balance .	1
I have missed Veronica Mars so much . It was so sad to see it leave the airwaves after 3 seasons . Seeing this movie was as if it never left .	1
Good quality picture , no problems ... makes me wonder why I did not watch the series when it was on network tv	1
I am fairly certain that when Rob Thomas was developing Veronica Mars over 10 years ago that I was not the demographic he was shooting for . Well , call me Mr. Staypuff because I 'm a genuine `` marshmallow '' fan of this show . Growing up I was a big reader and quickly ran through all the Tom Swift and Hardy Boys books published . My next door neighbors were three sisters who had the entire Nancy Drew library which I also read and enjoyed . Maybe this is why I love this series- and now this movie . The characters reunited in another mystery was a lot of fun . I think the success of the Kickstarter campaign to fund this film starts with Kristin Bell , she totally sells this character and owns it . Pretty , smart , and sassy she 's very entertaining and compelling to watch . A contemporary , darker Nancy Drew strikes just the right note and is credible . The support cast of largely unknown actors work well together and the sprinkling of known actor guest stars are blended well into the stories . Of special mention is Enrico Colantoni as Veronica 's dad , P.I . and former sherriff Keith Mars . I only know him from his work on `` Just Shoot Me '' which was a comedic role but he 's perfect as Veronica 's father . My only frustration with the series was the seemingly endless poor relationship choices Veronica makes for such an intelligent young woman . That said I was never a team Piz fan and guess her serial boyfriend Logan works the best . I think this movie gives fans some closure since at the conclusion of season 3 Rob Thomas and company did not know if they 'd been renewed or not . For some critics of the updated presentation , and one who picks on Kristin Bell for essentially not being as `` hot '' as she was 10 years ago and looking like she just had a baby ( which she did ) all I have to say is do n't attend your high school reunion dude , you 're going to be disappointed ! Do I here sequel ?	1
I did not get in to the TV series until just recently and then only because it was a free show to watch due to me being part of PRIME . Well I got hooked . LOL the movie just increases the hooked that caught me . I am not sure how it is doing in the theaters and was not able to watch it at a theater ... .FOR SHAME ... ..but I did purchase the movie with Amazon before it was released ... ..see told ya I was hooked ... ..I will not spoil the fun for anyone who has et to view this movie ; but will say that if you miss it ... .whether or not you are a fan of Veronica Mar TV series , then you are missing a really great movie ... ... and no you do not have to watch the series in order to understand the movie and the past lives of the characters ; but hey after watching the movie you may want to delve in to the old series . Now then one item ... ... told ya I was hooked after watching a bit of the series ... ... another word for hooked is ADDICT ... ... .there is more than addiction to drugs ... .or to alcohol ... ..there can be various addictions and being addicted to fantastic story lines in TV series and movies is not truly a bad addiction ... ..LOL that is unless you are not able to receive regular feedings for that addiction and I am hoping that this will not be the first and only return of Veronica Mars , for that would mean that the producers and writers and directors and actors are NOT feeding us poor addicts to the ongoing adventures that the marshmallow Veronica Mars can delight in .	1
They did a good job recreating the show . I am glad to have just got in through Amazon since not sure what a movie screen would have done.. Obviously sets up a possible 2nd movie depending on how much it makes .	1
Loved the show . I missed a few episodes so I binge-watched the entire series before watching the movie.It was what I hoped-it did not disappoint . I am not as hypercritical about every detail . I just like the characters , miss them and was glad to see all ( missed one ) in the movie.If you even remotely enjoyed VM before , rewatch it all and rent this-it wil not disappoint ! ! ! !	1
Always love the series and this movie was great . Hope there is more coming . Kristen Bell is wonderful in this series .	1
From the trailers , I had very low expectations . This film far exceeded those . I had to get used to the style of this movie in that Veronica narrated it , her texts would appear almost as 'bubbles ' on the screen from time to time and there were a lot of characters I did not know from the tv series , which I have seen but a long time ago and did n't remember all of them . No matter . I quickly adapted to these and instead enjoyed the mystery.The film corrected one thing and this is a SPOILER . At the beginning of the film she is with a guy and they were an item but it was very clear to me they had no real chemistry . It was with Logan you instantly saw the chemistry . Well , enough said on that.Kristen Bell is outstanding in the lead and I liked everyone in this film.It is beautifully shot , too . I was very impressed with the overall look of the film . Someone called it 'low budget ' ? Do n't believe it . You wo n't find a ton of CGI shots but if that is your idea of low budget then you need to expand your horizons.Nice music , too.I am hoping they make more Veronica Mars films .	1
I am 50 and not in the majority demographic , but I have a teenager and I love watching Veronica mars . I envy her and her fathers relationship . I envy her father for having a teenager that is so together.Anyway , I loved the show , did not watch it while it was on . Binge watched on amazon , then watched this movie on amazon too . Great concept for delivering the film to fans.I think any casual or serious fan of the show would get their money 's worth with this . It gave me a warm fuzzy feeling . It was very loyal to the series .	1
Loved the movie ! I was willing to pay the higher rental fee simply because fan funding brought the movie to us . The script was well written , the acting was well executed , and I enjoyed seeing everyone back playing these roles .	1
This , to be frank , will not be a very critical post . To my shame , for I am a manly man , I am one of them , whatchamacallit , `` marshmallows , '' a devotee of the late , lamented series , Veronica Mars . This silver screen resurrection was such a damn longshot ... How the movie came about says something about the emergence of social media as a determining factor in the film industry . Freakin ' yay for the Kickstarter campaign and its 91,585 backers and the shattered records , including that it met its $ 2 million goal in the first day of the campaign and went on to triple the thing at $ 5.7 million . The behind-the-scenes story is so feel good . Veronica Mars , the movie , is essentially a love letter from the cast & crew to the fans.A long time ago , we used to be friendsBut I have n't thought of you lately at all ... It 's been roughly ten years since we last saw Veronica , back when she was a teenaged private eye poking her nose in everyone 's biz in Neptune , Cali . The movie 's opening sequence fills us in on what she 's been up to . Veronica is interviewing for a place in a prestigious New York law firm that especializes in dumping frivolous cases before they get to court . ( So much for what would 've been the 4th Season premise of her landing in the FBI . ) Veronica confides that she got out of Neptune when she was 19 , got herself a B.A . in psychology at Stanford , was near the top of her class in Columbia law . Interview over , Veronica hopes for the best.She claims that her amateur sleuthing days are in the rear view and her nosy disposition tamped down . And when her bad boy ex Logan Echolls ( Jason Dohring ) is implicated in murder and he calls her , pleading for her help , she assures her current beau that she 's only going to provide Logan with lawyery advise . So it 's back home for Veronica , a reunion with her ex with the baggage and a dive back into a posh but then scuzzy space redolent of leftover angst and reputations ruined and inner demons outed but never exorcised . That unknown murderer lurking in the midst - because it ca n't possibly be Logan , right ? - almost seems a footnote . Just another day in Neptune.The best bits about the television show get reincarnated . It 's still ultimately about the underdog , the perceived loser , putting one over the bullies . Very much intact is that marvelous father-daughter synergy between Kristen Bell and the fantastic Enrico Colantoni . Veronica and Logan 's relationship is still ... complicated . Veronica still cracks wise . She 's still incredibly dogged . There 's huge gratification in catching up with a host of familiar faces . Everyone came back ! Plus , there 's a surprise cameo or three . Okay , if you do n't know Veronica Mars from Bruno Mars , you wo n't get it . But this is n't about luring in the uninitiated . See , you 've caught me in mid-celebration . I 'm still gobsmacked that there 's a Veronica Mars movie , and I think we marshmallows suspected it was n't gon na make tons of money , but so what ? Maybe tomorrow I 'll watch this again and then I 'll notice flaws . But that 's tomorrow . This movie is a collaborative labor of love among the filmmakers , the cast , and the ardent , mobilized fans . For now , I 'm keeping it on the pedestal.The DVD 's bonus stuff : - `` By the Fans : The Making of the Veronica Mars Movie '' - a very cool documentary in which Rob thomas , Kristen Bell and the entire Veronica Mars cast take you from its record-breaking Kickstarter launch to pre-production to the first day on set and beyond ! Includes a segment from the backers ' perspectives as they show up as extras on the set ( 00:55:36 minutes long )	1
It 's been some time since the show ended , but the movie does a fine job of pretty much picking up right where the show left off . Many of the recurring characters from the television show have small appearances , but the focus of the movie rests squarely on Veronica and Logan . Like many of the episodes , the & # 34 ; mystery & # 34 ; is revealed in the closing moments in fairly quick order . The mystery , while important , is not the point of the story , the characters are . The mystery is simply the delivery vehicle.The pacing of the movie feels somewhat rushed , but that may simply be due to the number of acknowledgements of the original series that it tries to fit into a mere 100 minutes of movie time . These little glimpses of what has become of Veronica 's past life are not entirely necessary . They are there for the fans . But since this was a fan-funded project , it 's entirely understandable.One need not have any clue about Veronica Mars before seeing this film . It is capable of standing on its own . However , for those watching the film without first having watched the series , it may come across as a bit shallow as there simply is n't enough time to get invested into what happens with each character , leaving the mystery the sole reason for watching the film .	1
It was good to see all the characters grown up . Good story line and the movie sealed the TV series . Veronica and Logan end up together . I like happy endings and this did it for me .	1
I was soooooo very excited once I found out about this movie , because I was completely bummed when the series ended . The movie is awesome ! Again ... I found myself sad as the ending approached because I knew it would finally be over . Farewell Veronica Mars ... you will be missed .	1
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again ; Why did this show get canceled ? I was THRILLED when I found out there was going to be a movie , but now that I 've just watched it , I NEED MORE ! I am excited about the books coming out , but that 's just not going to cut it . This show needs to return . I loved seeing all the old characters and Veronica 's sass . Can not say enough good things about this show .	1
As good if not better than Covert Affairs or Person of Interest and Rizzoli & Iyles but with far more interesting characters and storylines . Strikes a nice balance between mystery and humor and the frustrations of love . The Networks are too busy with reality tv CW , Netflix , Amazon HULU make this happen . One refreshing note among many , how realistic to see Logan put his hand on the wall when they we r e going to kiss after he embraced her . Instead of the usual & # 34 ; slam her head against the wall & # 34 ; ( Arrow ) . Not being familiar with the show , I robowatched the 3 seasons on Amazon Prime and then opted to purchase the movie on Instant Video to watch at my leisure . It 's great to be able to buy a movie while it 's in the theater .	1
I was late to the Veronica Mars party , but was absolutely thrilled with the movie . I only wish there was more .	1
Glad I watched the movie , though I was never a fan of Veronica Mars TV series . I 'm a fan now , eager to see a second one.The acting is low-key but believable . I quickly forgot I was watching Kristen Bell . The detective action is believable , and has a high-octane finish .	1
I own the whole TV series from 10 years ago . I loved her character , a great female role model for the teenage/young adult set . She 's smart , resourceful and I love a good detective story because I 'm a super sleuth myself so I felt a kinship with her character . I could totally be a detective . While chicks were watching vacuous reality OC shows back in the day , I was more into watching the smart girl kick butt and solve mysteries . The movie was fun to watch for someone who obsessed over the TV series , but probably not for someone who did n't watch it 10 years or or who vaguely remembers the story lines . It was fun to see all the regulars again . The movie was a bit contrived and dorky but I loved it anyway . I would watch the next one if they made one so we can see Veronica and Logan be in love and live their lives together . Also , did Gia die ? That was n't clear .	1
If you were and still are a fan of this awesome series then the wait is over . Your fix for more Veronica Mars will be satisfied and having all of the actors reprise their roles give me chills and made be giddy . The fans spoke and acted by donating to Kickstarter to make this film a reality and to all of them I simply say ... THANK YOU ! ! ! I definitely want another movie ! ! ! !	1
I hope they continue to make more . The pace and acting is great , I also love the plot lines . They are n't the usual cookie cutter stories hollywood turns out , these actually have depth , the characters also have depth . Clearly the fans love it to put up the money to make it . Maybe now some smart producer/director/studio will see the wisdom of developing stories for Amazon . This is the first time I 've heard of a film being made to order for fans , and I hope it 's not the last .	1
This would have been a great TV Movie . My wife loved it . My Kids and grandkids all want to see it . The problem with that is there are 5 offensive words , some hand gestures and genital cartoons in the movie . Of course I believe all the kids see worse than this at school . I just do n't want to be the one to give it to them to watch . Leaves me in a bad position for a PG13 movie . Why did Veronica have to grow up and have such a mouth . I am in a bad spot because the movie was surprisingly good and had a fulfilling end to it . I really did n't see it all coming down like it did . Apologies to the director but I may edit it so I can show it to the kids .	1
As a die hard V. Mars fan , the movie was everything I had waited years for . The package arrived in a tmely manner , was in excellent shape and easy to open .	1
I am a big Veronica Mars fan and this movie with the extended characters from the TV show did not disappoint .	1
I loved the movie I think they did a really good job of tying up loose ends for those of us who were extremely sad the series ended .	1
I saw most , if not all , of the TV series when it was on . I loved the show , Veronica 's sass and the father-daughter relationship . Having said that , I was n't obsessed . A little sad when it departed but I can say that about a lot of shows that leave too early for my liking . Admittedly I was glad to get back together with the old crowd and I remembered most of the characters.Veronica ( Kristen Bell ) , now involved with good-guy Piz ( Chris Lowell ) has recently graduated from law school and is on the verge of accepting a job with a prestigious NYC law firm . But she 's drawn back to richy-bitchy Neptune , CA when one-time bad-boy paramour Logan Echolls ( Jason Dohring ) is arrested for murdering his pop singer girlfriend . Oh , and it 's her 10th year high school reunion . Against her better judgment , Veronica ca n't turn Logan down , presumably to help screen defense attorneys . But it goes further as she digs deeper and deeper into the crime.Thanks to some fine dialog written by Rob Thomas ( also directed ) and Diane Ruggiero , Veronica is as snappy as ever when it comes to retorts and one-liners . Logan , outside the murder charge , has redeemed himself and is now a Navy Lieutenant . His best friend Dick ( Ryan Hansen ) is still a goofball and a key to solving the murder . And I 'm always glad to see Enrico Colantoni as Keith Mars , Veronica 's moral compass . Those familiar with the characters will likely swoon over the movie . But even newcomers ( like my son ) should have a good time .	1
We watched the series and was bummed that it did n't continue . We heard they were making a movie and glad that it released on dvd at the same time as the theaters . The did a great job continuing the story and with a good ending .	1
I would watch it again . Funny moments that crack you up .	1
wish they would bring back the series . understand regretably all actors have gone onto better things . bjut , i 'm sure they could find someone to fill the spots . i liked them 5 stars	1
This movie is awesome ! ! Veronica and Logan and their & # 34 ; epic & # 34 ; love story continues ! I wish the show would come back on the air ! ! This great movie makes me hopeful for more : )	1
This is a great movie . I really wish the series would start up again . I LOVE all of these characters . The movie was interesting and kept me interested .	1
It 's not that we 're soft , like & # 34 ; marshmallows. & # 34 ; It 's more like we 're addicts for the soft , sweet , heated up , treats that The Veronica Mars show dished out . We 're more like raccoons . We ca n't get enough of that browned , white , semi burned , funky stuff . The movie delivered it . Dished it right up on a reminiscent platter on a brand new table . Yum ! Feels as good as ever . And if we got ta dish out more Kick Starter Cash to get Movie Two & # 8230 ; DO N'T BE SURPRISED . We raccoons have a tendency to get what we crave , one way or the other . You Dig ?	1
I could n't believe when they said they were going to crowd source the funding for this movie . But they actually did it and then some . my wife and I have always loved the series , and could n't believe that they stopped it like they did. , a la deadwood , pushing daisies , Fire Fly etc . anyway we loved the movie , we did n't see it in the movie theater , but we have Amazon prime and were able to rent it for 4 bucks ... .What a great deal . They left the ending so it almost looks like they could do another movie , which would be great !	1
After this movie was over , I immediately pre ordered the novel that comes out next week on Amazon . I ca n't wait to dive back into the world of Veronica Mars . I wish Kristen Bell was n't on House of Lies because this would be a perfect show for Amazon or Netflix to pick up .	1
If you were a fan of the Veronica Mars series , you will love the movie . I love the way it was funded by fans too ! I think the movie is even better than the series . It picks up Veronica 's life several years after the series ended . The mystery is complicated and hard to solve . The decisions Veronica has to make are difficult life changing decisions . The acting was solid , the characters complex , and it looks like a much more expensive movie than it is . I hope they do a sequel .	1
I loved the show and was continually surprised at the excellent writing . I thought this movie would be predictable , but even though there were some predictable parts , it still holds plenty of surprises . I was blown away , and I hope there will be more movies in the future . BIG kudos to the writers ! ! ! ! I wish the show had n't ended so soon .	1
I love this movie . We waited a long time for this to come out . My daughter and I watched it twice . It stayed true to the series and did not disappoint .	1
I loved the series when it was on and have rewatched it many times . I saw it at the theaters and could n't wait to own my own copy . I have already watched it many times and love it .	1
Veronica Mars has it all : suspense , drama , romance , comedy , and action . For us Marshmallows , it , seamlessly , took us to today 's VM ; and left us happy and anticipating a maybe-sequel - anything is possible , right ? Thoroughly enjoyed the movie and seeing my favorite characters again . Outstanding !	1
It 's been years since Veronica was in Neptune but her departure from New York as a recent law school graduate and promising law firm prospect was masterfully done . Veronica finds her way back to Neptune to help Logan and ends up not only finding herself in the midst of a case that could potentially clear Logan 's name for the murder of his high profile girlfriend but a mystery of the murder from the past . The movie lives up to the three seasons of the show that saw the series end to soon . One of the many casualties that resulted from the network changing from UPN to the WB to The CW network ( i , e . Star Trek : Enterprise ) . Both Veronica Mars and Enterprise series did n't die out because of a lack of viewership but the confusion of the changes of the networks . If you were a fan of the show then you will love the Veronica Mars movie and will make you want to go back and revisit the series ' three seasons . I	1
If you love the tv series , you 'll love this movie . The movie sticks to the light-hearted yet dark tone of the series and features the great character relationships and mysteries that made it so strong . Lots of bantering between Veronica and her dad especially . Do n't spoil yourself by reading about it - just get it . love love love . Now I want another few years of a tv series .	1
& # 34 ; It 's a one time deal , a farewell tour if you will. & # 34 ; After giving up her private eye life , Veronica ( Bell ) is on her way to becoming a lawyer . When she starts to celebrate after a great interview she notices that someone she went to high school with has been found dead and her ex- boyfriend Logan ( Dohring ) is accused . She decides to go to her high school reunion and help Logan clear his name , but her old life begins to take over and she forgot how exciting the life of an investigator can be . I will start this by saying that I have never seen the TV show so I was n't sure what to expect . After watching this I wish I had seen the show , for two reasons . One , so I had a little more back story for each character and two because I really enjoyed this and would really enjoy seeing more of it . Someone that has been a fan the entire time will probably really love this . People like me who have never seen one episode will also really enjoy this . Overall , funny , exciting and very fun to watch . I recommend it . I give this a B+ .	1
I had recently watched the series on Amazon and sound this movie did a wonderful job catching up on a series that was cancelled without time for an ending-with a few exceptions-you can only do so much in an hour and a half . It was like going to a reunion . Veronica 's dialogue was witty as usual . I had read a review that stated this movie ending could lead to another sequel or perhaps to brining the series back . I vote for brining the series back with a grown-up VM and friends.Rob Thomas proved that a movie can be made well with a smaller budget.James Franco , Justin Long and Dax Shepard all have cameos-James ' does a great job making fun of himself .	1
I know this was a true labor of love for everyone involved ! ! What an effort it must have taken to get so many of the original cast members back for a movie after all of this time . Great show and a GREAT MOVIE ! ! !	1
I love me some Veronica Mars ! No , the movie does not give you all the same joy , anticipation and frenzied excitement as the TV show but it was a well done story of people who have moved into the next stages of life with all the decisions , dramas and regrets that can come along for the ride . Throw in murder , intrigue , and a love affair for the ages ... and you have one heck of a movie . if you like film noir , suspense , and detective movies , check it out.Also , when you do , you support a movement . I believe that if we get a Veronica Mars movie every few years , they will just get better and better because the creator is committed to such excellence and has the vision . Let 's support it and keep the dream alive . This has been a PSA brought to you by this one fan of Veronica Mars .	1
I had mediocre expectations when I went to see this move , I just did n't want to get my hopes up for a fantastic movie and then have it be a let down . But I was extremely pleasantly surprised with the movie . It was well made , well filmed , gave us marshmallows the answers we 've been dying for , and had some great suspense scenes . I was so happy that I made the commitment to this movie that I did , and ca n't wait to own it so I can watch it again and again !	1
This movie is really only for fans of the series who need a fix . It is n't the best Veronica Mars storyline ever but if you 're a fan you 'll eat it up . Admit it , you know you want to watch it .	1
OK , sort of a spoiler . I had heard of Veronica Mars for years , but because I had a night job I was never able to see it . Then came Miss Mars to Amazon Prime . I binge watched , got caught up in the story and hated the fact there was no resolution , no ending to speak of . Did her promising career with the FBI pan out ? What about everyone else she was close to in Neptune ? Questions , speculations , then rumors of a movie to clear up those loose ends . Now here it is in all its glory . Some of it will make you angry , some parts will bring smiles and maybe some laughs . But it is raw Veronica , a little older , somewhat wiser , but still our girl/woman . I could see possibly a sequel , the door is open , new questions asked some resolutions maybe not as resolved as they could have been , but that is/was her life . Thoroughly enjoyed the movie . If you enjoyed the TV show , you 'll enjoy the movie as well . One thing , if you do n't already know Miss Mars , go watch the TV show first it helps .	1
Point one : this is a very good psychological thriller , full of clever plotting and well played intrigue.Point two : This is part of a huge lifetime opus of Sidney Lumet 's work that I am only beginning to savor and enjoy . Am I lucky or what ? And the main point : Why is n't Beau Bridges in every movie all the time.Yes you love his brother Jeff . We all love Jeff . But the secret is if the two decided to have a charisma-off , Beau would just stand there and smile and he would win , hands down.I could watch three hours of Brau Bridges chuckling and grinning and lounging around with Robert Preston as the affable Dobbs and feel like it was time well spent . I 'm transported back to a more civilized era.And the add James Mason casting shadows and angst everywhere and you 've got yourself a show.And if you ever want to see that magic in action , this movie should be the first place you go . Tha man does gymnastics for crying out loud , in slacks and a tie and without missing a beat ! Please enjoy !	1
A former student ( Beau Bridges ) returns to his old Catholic prep school after ten years , this time as the new Gym teacher , Mr. Reese . His free-spirited approach is in sharp contrast to the dire mood he finds , especially from the sour Latin teacher , Mr. Jerome ( James Mason- LOLITA , JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH ) . Reese quickly discovers a dark secret among the students . For some reason , simple pranks have escalated into dangerous acts of brutality . Just what has Reese stumbled into ? After allying himself w/ the kindly Mr. Dobbs ( Robert Preston ) , Reese tries to solve the mystery behind the almost ritualistic violence . Can they get to the truth before someone is killed ? Meanwhile , Jerome seems to mentally disintegrate before their eyes . CHILD 'S PLAY is a deceptively calm film full of macabre atmosphere and sacrilegious imagery . The fiendish finale is perfectly bleak and disturbing ...	1
Child 's Play ( Sidney Lumet , 1972 ) It is exactly thirty-eight minutes into Child 's Play where the movie stops being a fuzzy , slow-moving mess and becomes something that actually seems like a Sidney Lumet film . The scene takes place in the chapel of the boys ' school where the entire film is set . Robert Preston ( The Music Man ) , who plays Joe Dobbs , the headmaster of the eleventh-grade class , an English teacher much-beloved of the school 's pupils , is standing at the front of the chapel , facing the altar . In a pew a few rows behind him is Jerome Malley ( A Touch of Larceny 's James Mason ) , the headmaster of the senior class , who teaches Greek and Latin and , as a holdover from the days when corporal punishment was accepted in schools , still has the nickname `` Lash '' . Dobbs delivers a monologue that sets up the entire rest of the film , at least the bits that have n't already been set up . And I can almost imagine Lumet , at the end of that scene , smacking his fist into his other palm , pointing at Mason and Beau Bridges , the other main actor in this movie , then pointing to Preston and yelling , `` THAT is the quality of acting I want to see from you idiots ! `` He gets it for the rest of the film.Plot : We open with Paul Reis ( Bridges ) as a senior at the school , on his way to see the headmaster , Father Mozian ( They Might Be Giants ' Ron Weyand ) , for the very , very serious infraction of drawing some obscene pictures on Malley 's chalkboard . He 's being escorted by freshman teacher Dobbs , who cautions young Reis that , while such actions may be amusing , they 're not likely to get him anywhere in life . The camaraderie of the moment is shattered by one of the school 's jocks lobbing a basketball at Reis ' head -- it would seem that Reis is what Jean Shepherd calls `` one of the nameless rabble of victims '' in A Christmas Story . Dobbs defuses the situation and everyone gets on with their lives . Fast-forward nine years . Reis is now a phys.ed . teacher who 's sick of the public school system and has returned to his alma mater to take up a vacant position there . He and Dobbs pick up just where they left off , as great friends . Reis seems willing to bury the hatchet with Malley , but Malley is driven to distraction by his mother 's imminent death , which he believes is being hastened by a series of anonymous , harrassing phone calls , and assaults on his own character ( which include , but are not limited to , pornographic magazines being ordered in his name and sent to his home , as well as notes being passed by the students -- it is never explicitly stated , but made obvious nonetheless , that all of this is homosexual in nature ) . We find out soon enough that Malley was supposed to retire at the beginning of the year , but refuses to do so because he is adamant that Dobbs not take over his job as senior headmaster ; he considers the affable Dobbs not only unfit for the job , but in fact an agent of Satan himself ( he believes Dobbs to be behind all the magazines , notes , calls , etc. ) . Reis walks into the middle of this , and while he 's not explicitly tasked with choosing a side , his unexpected , and unlikely , ally Father Penny ( King of the Gypsies ' David Rounds in his first feature appearance ) , the oft-tipsy religion teacher , warns Reis that it 's going to happen eventually , no matter how neutral he tries to stay . While this is the main conflict , there 's also the ever-present bullying that , as we know , Reis is all too familiar with ... but this class are n't just bullies , they 're sadists ; in the first act of bullying to which Reis is witness , by the time he manages to pull the children off , their target has damage severe enough that the hospital believes he may lose an eye . A second victim is mock-crucified , at which point Father Mozian is forced into considering whether to expel the culprits -- which would , almost immediately , cause the school to shut down , as they comprise half the senior class ( and thus , half the senior class ' tuition ) . Assuming , of course , the authorities do n't shutter it first.There is a great deal going on here , and the late Lumet manages to herd these cats very nicely once the movie finds its rhythm ( which , admittedly , takes thirty-eight minutes ) . Mason , Preston , and Bridges , of course , were all known commodities by this time , and was there ever any question they were up to the material ? As a simple portrait of the nasty goings-on at a boys ' school , a generic slice-of-life drama , this would have been a damned good movie . But the final twenty minutes , which turn it into something very different indeed , take it from `` good '' to `` blow the lid off . '' In the hands of a lesser director , or performed by lesser actors ( and to be fair , there 's a time or two where it seems like Bridges is about to slip over the line ) , this could have come off cheesy , if not unintentionally hilarious . But it is meant to be horrific , and it succeeds . This is tragedy of Greek proportions , with the school 's gang of bullies functioning as the chorus of harridans , and had the first thirty-eight minutes been as taut and compelling as the final hour , this would be Lumet 's second five-star film in my library ( Dog Day Afternoon is the other ) . Even with that considered , this is another guaranteed slot in the top thousand for Mr. Lumet ; the brilliance of the last sixty-two minutes downright overwhelms the unfocused , muzzy quality of the first thirty-eight . ****	1
Many spooky moments ! Good storyline good acting ! James mason is excellent ! I would have bought it had it been available to do so ! Please put it up for sale soon amazon ! If you enjoy old horror you should watch this one !	1
This is an excellent movie . It is not the `` chucky '' horror flick , it is heavy duty drama which in its own way is a `` horror flick '' . The actors were excellent and the story good . It 's story that fringes on true horror . The evil intentions of one in authority manipulating the innocent towards the destruction of their own soul ; by committing atrocious vile acts against others . I gave this movie five stars for the extremely talented Actors , Director and Writer of this film . I had almost forgotten what a really good movie was ...	1
This is my favorite show . I find it to be inspirational and moving along with being very funny . Thank you for allowing me to watch it on your site .	1
There are good actors and good writing and a concept that does not get much air time- consequences for our actions .	1
The second season gets a little too far away from Earl 's list and onto some unrelated adventures but still a lot of fun .	1

I love My Name is Earl and all the kooky characters on this show . I thought I paid a great price for this season 2 of this funny show . I would recommend anyone in the world to get any season of this hilarious comedy show . I love this show ! : )	1
Earl and his crew are great . Love the Karma thing . Each season gets better . Great gift idea . Each show the characters develop farther . Guest stars are great .	1
I 've never been the type of person to get excited over television . I like my sitcoms because they 're easy to follow , even if you miss a week , and reruns barely ever get old ( I think I 've seen every episode of ` Friends ' twelve times over ) , but aside from that I really ca n't say that the idea of following a shows premise all season long interests me . It 's easy for me to miss a week and then find myself lost and wondering what is going on . There are really just a few shows I 've watched religiously ; ` The Sopranos ' being one , another being the early seasons of ` Nip/Tuck ' ( I lost faith after the disastrous third season ) .Well , you can add ` The Riches ' ( as well as ` Damages ' ) to that short list . As we head further into season two I feel compelled to write my review of the first season before too much blurs together.Like I said , following a show all season long seems like a daunting task for me . When that show sinks its claws into you and refuses to let go though , you find it much easier to plop down in front of the TV every Tuesday night . That 's how things went for me with ` The Riches ' . After deciding the ` Nip/Tuck ' was so behind me I needed to find something to fill that void . I happened to stumble onto a encore showing of the pilot for this new ` provocative ' show called ` The Riches ' and within the first few minutes I was hooked . Watching this cute little girl con someone then turn around and reveal that he was a cute little boy was enough for me ; I was in.The shows premise is that of a traveling family ( modern day gypsies ) , the Malloy 's . Dahlia has just been released from prison and her husband Wayne and three kids ( Di Di , Cael and Sam ) have come to bring her home . Dahlia has her own set of problems , most instigated from the time she 's just finished serving , but when Wayne decides that the life of a traveler is just not for them anymore the Malloy 's find themselves in a hole heap of trouble . Segregated from the rest of their traveling family , which includes Dahlia 's crazy cousin Dale , the Malloy 's find themselves on the run for their lives . When an unfortunate accident costs a young wealthy couple their lives Wayne and Dahlia see this as an opportunity to change the course of their lives . Taking on the identity of Doug and Charlene Rich , the Malloy 's are now living the ` American Dream ' , but is it really all they could have hoped for.The show at times may stretch the boundaries of reality , but that is what makes it so much fun . The writers are smart enough to make what on the outset may appear implausible seem completely doable . Looking at the situations Wayne and Dahlia find themselves and the ways they purpose to survive them is enthralling and exciting beyond belief . What 's so great about ` The Riches ' is that it asks the viewer to really examine what makes them happy . As Wayne tries to turn his families life around and create a more stable and ` normal ' environment for his children he ultimately finds himself sacrificing the morals he has already set for them , and while Dahlia tries to support her husband she finds that her life is becoming more and more miserable by being someone that she does n't want to be . The children also have to adjust and decide if they even want to pursue a ` normal ' life if it forces them to change who they are inside.The acting is superb here . Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver are phenomenal as Wayne and Dahlia Malloy . Izzard has impeccable control and becomes the stability in the show , while Minnie steals every scene with her acting range and emotional temperance . She conveys so much realism with her performance , it 's captivating and touching . All three actors who play the Malloy children are flawless . Noel Fisher captures Cael 's rebelliousness which is really nothing short of his outward display of disapproval with his parent 's new lifestyle . Aidan Mitchell is adorable as young Sam , the gender-bending son who ca n't seem to decide just who he really is . But it is Shannon Woodard who really shines brightest here as Di Di , the smart and yet torn daughter who battles herself with their new life , wondering if it 's perks outweigh it 's disadvantages.Each episode is littered with superb supporting performances by Gregg Henry who plays Wayne 's outlandish new boss as well as Margo Martindale who plays their nosey yet caring neighbor Nina.I ca n't think of a flaw here , at least not one large enough to deter anyone from enjoying the entire season . Season two has now officially begun and is building strong on its first season so I truly only see good things to come at this point . ` The Riches ' help make my Tuesday nights all that much more interesting and hopefully they can do the same for you . Leave it to FX to create something new and exciting and completely worthwhile . I may have just been conned out of my Tuesday evenings , but it was well , well worth it .	1
It was this show that made me realize that the best programs were rarely on broadcast TV anymore . FX has taken unique risks with their programming . ( Thanks forever , for giving Louie CK the room to do what he does best . Rescue Me had scenes so heartbreaking , I could barely stand it . ) The Riches is a great metaphor for looking at the American Dream through a cynical lens , unique in its kind of subtlety and suspense . Eddie Izzard did great work , as did Minnie Driver . What a culture clash -- Travelers vs. Settlers . Why did it end ? I 'm so happy for the chance to go have another look at programming I miss . With streaming video I can really say , there is no such thing as moaning , `` There is nothing on . '' Now , there really is , always something worth watching .	1
I 'm reviewing the season which I loved , Season One . This season was so fresh and new in premise that I hung onto each episode . It is great fun from first episode to last . The premise is that Travelers ( American gypsies or Roms ) substitute themselves for people who were killed in a car crash . They hid the bodies and then rolled into a moderate sized southern town as those people . Since no one in the town knew them , they were able to pull this off . The husband and father was a corporate lawyer and his wife was the perfectly tended 2nd wife . The dead people had no children but they add on their 3 children to the mix . These people have never lived in anything but an RV encampment and have lived on solely their wits for years . They are expert con men , even the children . Now they live in a gated community and must convince everyone in town that they belong . It is always a near thing because , of course , they do n't belong but they are excellent cons , both on a computer and off one . Wayne and Dahlia Malloy ( Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver ) are the husband and wife and parents of this bunch . Eddie Izzard is a very well known British comedian and thus he is perfect for playing a man who has to live by his wits and become someone he 's not on a moment 's notice . Although everyone else is very good , Izzard is outstanding and it is impossible to picture the show without him . Season Two just did not come together for me like Season One did but I kept watching because Izzard was still so good .	1
What a great concept for a series . Eddie and Minnie are marvelous together with true chemistry.The plot is well written and the story archs are delightful to watch unfold.Like the character traits themselves , you wo n't be able to watch just one at a time .	1
Of all the show that I 've watches lately , I must say that this is the best show today . I 'm glad that I 've own my own copy , so that I can always watch it over and over again .	1
When I was a young man running my first rig in the Oil Fields in Kern county California , was having trouble with doing jobs faster than the other crews I worked with . One day the man who trained me pulled me aside and said `` You do n't get it ... They do n't want good operators , they want good liars '' .In this wonderfully written and acted series , Minnie Driver and Eddie Izzard test that theory , in the world of the upper class , by `` stealing the American dream '' . This series brings the public to a mostly unknown hidden culture in America of the Travelers ( Irish Gypsies ) which is something cool in a TV show , going so far out of the box of regular TV writing it 's in another warehouse.If you want something very different , `` The Riches '' is a show for you .	1
I thought this show was great . The story was very original and entertaining . I was sad to find that there are only 2 seasons because I could watch much more of this show ! It 's got a little bit of everything - suspense , comedy , action and drama .	1
Wow , I love this show . There is suddenly a big influx of fun , original shows and this is one of them . It 's so cool and addictive and I 'm hooked now.Minnie Driver is fantastic as Dahlia Malloy who is part of a family of con artists . She is on parole from having served time in prison for petty robbery and larceny . Her and her husband Wayne are now on the move with their three kids . They 're travelling in an RV when they are witness to a car crash , and making a long story short , they end up assuming the identities of a wealthy family , the Riches , and move to an upscale neighborhood in Palm Beach Florida . Wayne needs to find work to support the family 's new lifestyle so his first scam begins when he tries for a job with his neighbor at his law firm.I ca n't tell you in words just how good this is . It 's such a cool show that you have to check out for yourself . It 's fun and enjoyable and Minnie Driver is brilliant in here . I love watching how these guys get away with all the things they do and it 's certainly addictive . Get yourself a copy and you 'll have a new favourite show for sure .	1
I loved the characters and concept . Always there was an intriguing cliff hanger that forced me to watch the next and then again , I was never bored . I just wish this never ended . Beware though - it 's addictive .	1
Love Eddie Izzard , good to see him straight acting , proves he can do it . Minnie Driver is great also. & supporting cast .	1
It was n't what I at first expected , and actually was better than I hoped for . It is entertaining to explore the concept of Travelers interacting with whatever they call everyone else ... Take it for entertainment value , not a lesson about society and you will enjoy this series .	1
This is not run of the mill comedy . It has sacrasim and wit . I can watch several in a row . That is a major test for any comedy . Half hour increments can seem entertaining . Watching several of the same show in a row is the major test . This one stands up.The actors are superb .	1
This show has a wonderful story line that gets your hooked . I recommend giving the show a try , I think that you will enjoy it .	1
The Riches is one of the most original series ever with characters who are complex and intriguing . Each episode holds you captive as Wayne ( Eddie Izzard ) and Dahlia Malloy ( Minnie Driver ) strive to impersonate the Rich family , an immense challenge with their lack of education and experience.This is a series where you never know what is going to happen next or how Wayne is going keep it all together but the love that Wayne and Dahlia have for each other and their children always help them to find a way.Izzard and Driver are simply eloquent . Noel Fisher ( Cael ) , Shannon Marie Woodwood ( DiDi ) and Aidan Mitchel ( Sam ) are genuine in their roles as the three Malloy children.I ca n't wait for this to come out on dvd !	1
As my review title goes , this was a great show . Originally I thought it would be a comedy , but it 's more of a drama with a lot of irony . Not your typical formula show , which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled ( can anyone say & # 34 ; Firefly & # 34 ; ? ) .	1
The Riches is the most recent TV show I 've been watching , and I have one question . How in the world could they cancel it ! ? More people watched the premier of The Riches than ever watched an episode of the Shield or Rescue Me . It 's also got to be one of the most creative shows I 've ever seen ! The show centers around the Molloy family , a family of modern day gypsies . Today is a big day for them as the matriarch of their family is being released from jail , after serving a two year sentence . A big party is thrown for her and all seems well in the Molloy family , but things are n't what they seem . The Molloy family is forced to leave their camp . Wayne ( Eddie Izzard ) is not going empty handed though . Before leaving he cracks the camp leaders safe and takes a substantial amount of money . Once on the road , they run into another family from camp , that had been oblivious to what was going on . It does n't take them long to realize something is n't right , but before they can confront them , the Molloy 's take off and a big highway RV chase begins . During the chase a passing motorist and his wife are killed . The man and woman are Doug and Shrine Rich , and they are on their way to a new home in Eden Falls . Doug was a savvy lawyer , who made a fortune at the expense of others . On this day he and his new wife were on the run also , moving away from everyone and everything they 've ever known to move to a new state and into a new house they bought on the internet . Thanks to paper work in the car , Wayne Molloy quickly realizes who these people were and where they were going . It is then that he decides it 's time to stop traveling the country and settle into a nice , normal , `` buffer '' , lifestyle . Living in Eden Falls as Doug and Shrine . Along with their 3 kids , the Molloy 's try to adapt from being a family of travelers to a family of wealth and stability . The show is amazing ! There are so many twist and turns , cons and jokes , ups and downs , It 's so well written , with an outrageous cast of characters , and most important of all , a storyline I promise you have never seen before ! The show was cancelled by FX in late 2008 , but both seasons are available , and according to Wikipedia , Eddie Izzard and the show 's creator are currently working on a full length feature film . If you want something different crossing comedy , drama , and action , then I 'd say The Riches are for you !	1
The group in question is the Travelers -- a band of con artists who have apparently been in the U.S. since the 19th century . This show offers a glimpse into their world , and how odd and sometimes difficult it is for them to try to live among the rest of us . Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver do some pretty decent American accents as the husband and wife posing as the Riches.Complications ensue as they attempt to fill the deceased Riches ' shoes , working , living , and going to school among the so-called Buffers ( non Travelers ) . Never a dull moment , as they say .	1
This seemed so ridiculous at first , but halfway through my husband and I were hooked even though we both agreed that intelligent people could not be fooled this long . Also , we would never have friends like these folks in our lives . They are too immoral .	1
With almost every season of South Park you always have the odd one or two episodes that were n't really that good . Season 1 it was Weight Gain 4000 , Season 2 it was Terrence & Phillip in not without my Anus and so on , as with all seasons although you have the bad episodes , you always have your personal favourites but Season 11 is in my personal view the strongest and most unique season to date . With episodes ranging from racial controversy to a trilogy of episodes setting the boys in Imaginationland and ended up with its own DVD releases.Episode 1 : With Apologies To Jesse Jackson : This is a Randy Marsh episode and shows the true no holds barred attitude that Matt Stone & Trey Parker have towards writing an episode . Randy is on an episode of Wheel of Fortune and accidentally uses the N word , which causes an uproar and singles Randy out as `` That N***er Guy . '' This episode is obviously a reflection on the American society in relation to the N word and satires the whole subject , extremely funny episode with some great one liners.Episode 2 : Cartman Sucks : Again this is another controversial episode but this one is entirely around Cartman , of a night Cartman has Butters stay over at his house and while Butters is asleep , Cartman plays pranks on Butters then takes pictures of it . One prank backfires on Cartman which he 's afraid will make people think he 's gay , he thinks Kyle has the picture and is ready to show it to the class so Cartman enters on a panicky mission to try and save his skin . Amazingly funny as we see Cartman show some vulnerability.Episode 3 : Lice Capades : One of the boys has head lice and Cartman leads a mission to try and find out who it is . Meanwhile in one of the boys heads one of the lice suspects that their environment will be aware of the affect the lice are having and may try to get rid of them . Now it 's a race against time to try and convince the Lice that the environment wants to get rid of them . A great parody episode that shows the evil side of Cartman as he goes on this manhunt simply to make fun of the person with lice.Episode 4 : The Snuke : One day while in class a young Muslim boy is introduced as the new student , Cartman becomes suspicious that he may be a terrorist and enlists Kyle to help him look into the background of this kid . In a 24 style episode Cartman unwittingly discovers a conspiracy to take down America and its government . This is possibly THE most controversial episode of them all as it made the news in England for the ending , the clear parody of Hilary Clinton is hysterical and makes this an enjoyable episode.Episode 5 : Fantastic Easter Special : Stan starts to question the point of Easter which brings him into a conspiracy that has been kept a secret for 2000 years . A great parody of the Da Vinci Code that sees the return of Jesus in one hell of a cool setting and Kyle being Jewish has the opportunity to kill Jesus , will he do it ? Enjoy this episode to find out.Episode 6 : D-Yikes : Mrs. Garrison is dumped again and she takes it out on the class , the boys get sick of the constant screaming and ranting by Mrs. Garrison and they employ someone to help them out . A classic Mr./Mrs . Garrison episode with one hysterical ending.Episode 7 : Night of the Living Homeless : Kyle is approached by a single Homeless man who 's looking for some change , after giving the homeless man change more homeless people show up in South Park until it becomes an infestation . Cartman creates a goal for himself to jump as many homeless people as he can on his skateboard , while Kyle and the rest of the gang are on a mission to solve the Homeless problem . This is a great parody episode of Night of the Living Dead which gives yet another great part to Randy and shows how stupid he can be.Episode 8 : Le Petit Tourette : One day whilst in a toy store , Cartman discovers something wonderful , something that he never believed that could be possible , he discovered Tourettes Syndrome . He sees a kid swearing and getting away with it and he decides that this would be a great excuse to insult those he hates to their faces and get away with it , little does he know however that him being Tourettes deliberately developes into something much worse which he did n't expect.Episode 9 : More Crap : Another great Randy Marsh episode , in which Randy endeavours on having the worlds biggest poo , He 's faced by some competition however , by the legendary number one at everything , Bono . I have to admit this is the weakest of all the episodes but it still has its classic moments , especially when Bono is in the picture.Episode 10,11,12 : Imaginationland : One day Cartman is out to prove to Kyle that Leprechauns exist , the boys made a deal that if Cartman can prove they exist then Kyle must suck his balls . Cartman does manage to capture a Leprechaun but it was on a mission to deliver a warning to Imaginationland of a pending terrorist attack on our imagination . The boys are picked up by an eccentric man who takes the boys to Imaginationland which while they 're there the terrorist attack takes place . Kyle , Stan & Butters enter on a mission to help fight the bad side of our Imagination and the terrorists , whilst Cartman sets out to prove that the Leprechaun was real so he can get Kyle to suck his Balls . An absolutely hysterical trilogy of episodes that show the genuine imagination of the South Park creators.Episode 13 : Guitar Queer-o : Stan and Kyle are the best players on the computer game Guitar Hero and they are signed by a record company who wants to display their skills by then gaining 100,000 points at a show in the arcade . Kyle gets manipulated by the record company and is convinced to get a new and better partner , Stan takes it badly and buys a new game called heroin hero in which he must chase the dragon . Again this is an incredibly funny episode that makes fun of those who take these games seriously and spend way too much time on them.Episode 14 : The List : The girls of South Park elementary create a list of who they think the cutest boy in the school is . Kyle is placed last on the list but ca n't believe that he was placed lower on the list than Cartman , this uncovers a conspiracy that the boys would have never expected . It 's a great episode that gives us a nostalgic look at some classic moments from previous episodes.As you can see from the descriptions this is a great set of episodes that everybody should own .	1
South Park is my favorite show and I watch the season DVDs over and over . Just when it seems SP has reached its peak , it keeps coming up with creative shows that cover the latest fads in our popular culture and sociopolitical consciousness . Although `` Make Love Not Warfare '' from season 10 is still my favorite episode , season 11 provides another solid crop of classics , from the openings of `` With Apologies to Jesse Jackson '' and `` D-Yikes '' to the conclusions of `` Imaginationland , Episode III '' and `` The Night of the Living Homeless . `` Disc 1 : '' With Apologies to Jesse Jackson '' -- Who can ever forget Randy Marsh 's faux pas on `` Wheel of Fortune , '' the way he apologized to Jesse `` the emperor of black people '' Jackson , and his fight to ban a hateful slur from society with the help of Michael Richards and Mark Fuhrman ? Meanwhile , a midget author who speaks at the school provides amusement for Cartman and an epiphany for Stan . Instant classic . `` Cartman Sucks '' -- There are several peculiar incidences in this season that put into question Cartman 's sexuality . This episode is one of them . Cartman takes a picture with a certain body part of a sleeping Butters in his mouth . When Cartman learns what such a photo means , he tries to take another photo with Butters to reverse it , but Butters 's dad walks in on them and sends his son to bi-curious camp . Of course , SP fans know Butters 's dad has some bi-curious issues of his own . Meanwhile , Cartman must make sure the offensive photos does not get out . `` Lice Capades '' -- It is revealed that someone in Mrs. Garrison 's class has head lice and the students turn vicious with suspicion . Of course , SP ca n't just scratch the surface ; if you will , it needs to dig deeper by covering a louse community destroyed by the shampoo treatment . A lot of movie references in this one . `` The Snuke '' -- A new student arrives in class who is a Muslim and immediately sparks Cartman 's suspicions . Turns out there is a terrorist attack planned , but not by Muslims -- and it involves Hillary Clinton 's unmentionable . Clinton 's voice makes her sound like a down home southern gal , not a Senator from New York . I like how so much information can be found on the Internet and the blinking 12:00 on the `` 24 '' clock after the power goes out . `` Fantastic Easter Special '' -- Stan questions what easter eggs and bunnies have to do with Christ 's resurrection and learns about the secret `` Hare Club For Men '' ( where do they come up with this stuff ? ) A Da Vinci Code style mystery is unveiled and Matt and Trey get back at the head of the American Catholic League who had been critical of SP and said some anti-Semitic things in the past . Hmmmm , the papal mitre does look like it belongs on a rabbit . `` Hippitus , hoppitus , '' indeed.Disc 2 : '' D-Yikes '' -- I love the opening to this one ! I remember when it was first aired I struggled to stop laughing after Mrs. Garrison storms into the classroom complaining about men . This episode is one of the funniest SPs ever . I like when Garrison announces she 's gay and Stan replies , `` Again ? '' And the name of the lesbian bar is great ! I 've never seen the movie `` 300 , '' but it 's a takeoff on that . `` The Night Of The Living Homeless '' -- SP is suddenly overrun with homeless people begging for change . When the boys learn to mystery behind the onslaught of beggars , can they , with the help of some old school NWA & The Posse 8-Ball `` City of Compton '' style rap , save the day ? Le Petit Tourette '' -- Cartman sees a kid cussing uncontrollably in a toy store and learns that the kid has Tourette 's Syndrome ( is this a subject right up SP 's alley , or what ? ! ) . Cartman is given an idea that makes him so happy he breaks out in song . Of course , his plan backfires when he starts blurting out things that , to him , are more damaging and offensive than `` % # @ & # $ ! ! * ( ) # % ! ( $ # @ @ & / . `` `` More Crap '' -- Randy Marsh passes a world record size BM . when his record is broken , his life 's quest is to get it back -- but Bono is bound ( if you will ) to stop him . I actually agree with the point they make about Bono , but this episode has a very nasty part -- and I 'm not talking about the BMs.Disc 3 : '' Imaginationland '' -- OK , the bet Cartman made with Kyle is hilarious . I laughed to tears when I first saw it on TV , but what does it say about Cartman 's sexuality ? Is that a prize a straight guy would want ? I mean , another guy performing the task ? What 's up with that ? Anyway , the boys go on a trip to a land of imaginary characters -- including my favorite , Pac-Man , though I do n't like that he 's sometimes given teeth -- and it 's hit with a terrorist attack . Yes , terrorists have now attacked our imaginations . Meanwhile , Cartman takes Kyle to court and Stan and Kyle are taken to the Pentagon for questioning . `` Imaginationland , Episode II '' -- That opening dream sequence is from Monty Python . The terrorists break down a wall and unleash the evil characters of our imagination and now imaginations are really running wild , especially when Cartman 's demented Christmas woodland critters show up . Stan and Kyle help the feds break through the portal to Imaginationland but , just before the troops charge in , Kyle may finally have to pay his debt to Cartman . `` Imaginationland , Episode III '' -- With the help of Butters , the good imaginary characters set out to battle the evil ones . Kyle has to stop the Pentagon from destroying Imaginationland before the good characters have a chance to win . Al Gore , however , might doom everyone when he sees the evil character from his imagination . Oh , and the Cartman/Kyle bet finally gets settled ... sort of . `` Guitar Queer-o '' -- Great ! In typical SP fashion , the importance of Guitar Hero is built up all out of proportion . This episode shows how Matt and Trey keep up with the fads of pop culture . I also like this episode because I 'm a Kansas fan . `` The List '' -- There 's a list the girls created ranking the boys in their class from cutest to ugliest and Kyle is ranked last . That ca n't be right ! Kyle is adorable ! Something must be wrong !	1
Even in it 's eleventh season , South Park manages to still be the funniest animated show on TV today . Proof of that statement can be seen in the opening episode , appropriately titled `` With Apologies to Jesse Jackson '' , in which Stan 's dad Randy goes on Wheel of Fortune , and gets the wrong idea . If you 've never seen this episode before and are easily offended , well , I suggest you do n't watch it . For the rest of us though , this episode is worth the price of admission alone . Not to mention the simply brilliant `` Imaginationland '' trilogy of episodes , as well as the very funny `` Cartman Sucks '' and `` Lice Capades '' ; which once again find creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker not only pushing limits , but obliterating them . Matt and Trey also have a fine time spoofing things as well , including 24 with `` The Snuke '' , zombies with `` Night of the Living Homeless '' , Bono 's work ( and their Emmy win ) with `` More Crap '' , 300 with `` D-Yikes ! `` , and the mega-popular Guitar Hero with `` Guitar Queer-o '' . The season really reaches one of it 's best moments with `` Le Petit Tourette '' , which finds Cartman faking having Tourette 's syndrome . While season closing episodes `` Guitar Queer-o '' and `` The List '' are n't anything too special , the season as a whole is still another winning and ungodly funny season of the long running show . All in all , South Park continues to raise the bar for hysterical offensiveness , and we should all definitely be glad that it does , and has n't become a stagnant shell of it 's former self like another long running prime time animated series that will remain nameless .	1
South Park season eleven is a great season of the show . It contains great episodes and the only time they were n't of classic status was in Lice Capades . The episodes included in this set are : With Apologies To Jesse Jackson- Randy solves the wheel of fortune puzzle with the N word as he comes to understand why being classified by a word is annoying when it reminds you of a past you want to forget . ( People who annoy you . ) Cartman Sucks- Cartman gets Butter 's sent to gay counselling camp as he tries to stop Kyle from showing the class provocative pictures of him . ( Eric Cartman 's mother called , she found the photo 's ) Lice Capades- A slower episode where the boys lice symbolize the annoyance we are as inhabitants to the planet . ( Smart idea , poor execution ) The Snuke- Hilary Clinton is under attack as Cartman plays the part of Jack Bauer in a 24 spoof . ( The Snuke is in her Sn*tch ) Fantastic Easter Special- Stan learns why we paint easter eggs in a Da Vinci Code Spoof . ( Peeps ! ) D-Yikes- Mrs. Garrison finds a club for others like her but when Persians want to take over it turns into a '300 ' standoff . ( Scissor me timbers ) .Night Of The Living Homeless- Great episode where homeless people play the part of zombies . ( Does anyone have any change ? ) Le Petite Tourette- Cartman pretends to have Tourette 's syndrome in an attempt to say whatever he wants . ( P*ss ! In your mouth ! ) More Crap- Randy breaks the world record for biggest crap until Bono steps in as the world 's biggest piece of crap . ( This show is emmy winning ) .Imaginationland I , II , III- The boys finally hit on the Iraq war in the most intelligent and entertaining thing they have done so far . Man Bear Pig , Al Gore and the Critterland Christmas Critter 's all make appearances as well as Alien , Santa , Luke Skywalker and Jason Voorhies . ( The terrorists are attacking our imaginations ! ) Guitar Queer-o- Stan and Kyle want to be rock stars but the life may be too difficult . ( The best use of in show product advertisment since Make Love , Not Warcraft ) The List- The girl 's ranking of the boys looks finds them all reacting different ways in a more low profile still entertaining episode . ( Burn it down , burn it down to the gwound . ) The set is the same as all the previous ones with well chosen art work and safe DVD storage with easy access and convenient episode listings/descriptions on the box foldouts . Other than previews the only special features that have been on South Park sets recently are Matt and Trey giving mini-commentaries which are the most honest and entertaining commentaries around despite being under five minutes each.I loved this season , I feel it is has reached a new plateau for the series and hit a new stride creatively . South Park as a concept is a series that is constantly not only changing itself but evolving to keep current . The first two seasons were one thing then season three started it in a new direction through the fourth and fifth seasons . Then season six was similar to season eleven in that for me it hit a new stride and was near perfect beginning to end . The trend of the sixth season grew through the seventh and season eight was another new height for the series . The ninth season started it on a new track through the award winning tenth season to season eleven which for me is another solid season beginning to end ( despite Lice Capades which had funny moments but did n't hold my attention , a few more moments of the boys might have fixed this ) .The recent South Park seasons have been better in the tail end or second run of episodes . I think since episodes are split up in runs from March to May and then September/October to December this is probably because they have more time over the summer to workout idea 's ahead of time and improve what they did n't like looking back on the first half.The twelth season is coming out on DVD/Blu-Ray soon and it 's not as great as season eleven overall but it is again the series moving in a new evolutionary direction and I look forward to seeing where it will be going next . If season eleven is a new highpoint then season twelve is a more than entertaining and satirical enough passtime until the show reaches it 's next creative plateau . Here 's hoping it wo n't fall like Simpsons and Family guy did .	1
And I mean that in every way ; ) . She looks so pure and innocent . As I said about & # 34 ; Strangers With Candy & # 34 ; I am not sure this series could be shown on TV these days because it is n't politically correct enough . Too many people have forgotten how to laugh at themselves any more.I have also heard that Sarah is kind of like she is in this series in real life in the sense that she is outspoken and sometimes people are offended by her honesty and political incorrectness . Lighten up America ( and others ) , humor and laughing at oneself is better medicine than anything a doctor could give you .	1
I did n't know anything about Sarah other then her famous Jimmy Kimmel song about `` Matt Damon '' & `` Ben Afflect '' , and a small interview in `` The Artistocrats '' which made me think she may actually be a hilarious female comic that does n't just do jokes about how much better a woman is over a man ... so seeing this show on DVD for a low price , I figured i would have a look and see if she could make me laugh ... and yes she did ! The show is like Seinfeld in the way it 's about nothing , but I never did like Seinfeld and never will , but the Sarah Silverman Program I will be watching for many years to come . It stars Sarah and her sister , they live in place , they have 2 gay neighbors , a dog , and coffee shop , people call her on the phone , she likes cookies and her parents are dead . That 's about all there is to it , the rest of it is just some funny little story of the week to go around it.I think Sarah 's got ta be the top female comic in the world today , and very underated , so check out her show if ya want , other wise , why are you reading this ? Go away then .	1
Liking this show depends on how much you like Sarah . I think she is a funny gal , so I like the show . The show is full of potty humor and she does have a very good `` off the wall '' supporting cast . Since there are only 6 episodes included in season 1 , I wo n't be buying this set unless it drops down in price a little . I ca n't wait to see season two !	1
I did n't know what to expect when I ordered this . Sarah Silverman is soo darn crazy funny . Season 1 is a must have !	1
Loved it on TV and I love having it here . I just wish the series has continued because there was much more to tell .	1
There is usually a & # 34 ; whats going to happen next & # 34 ; character to these episodes . Well acted , powerful relationships . A nice package .	1
Jericho is FAAAAAAAAAANTASTIC ! ! ! ! ! Ignore the naysayers , watch this series for some enjoyable television.Some GREAT young ( and even older ) actors and actresses in this series ; they do a great job balancing the serious and the comedic elements.Watch this show with an open mind . There 's a big element of & # 34 ; WHAT IF & # 34 ; in this series , and you have to roll with that for it to hold your interest . Accept that & # 34 ; what if & # 34 ; premise for what it is -- the opportunity to observe human reactions to extraordinarily stressing situations in a world gone seemingly mad -- and you 'll really enjoy this show.Obviously , any television show ( or even movie ) has practical limitations in how accurately it can depict & # 34 ; the end of the world as we know it. & # 34 ; Accept those limitations , do n't stress out on the over-simplifications.I kind of envy those who discover this series for the first time ... getting to meet and know the people of Jericho is a real treat.Enjoy !	1
The series is action packed and keeps you guessing who is the good and who is the bad guy . I have enjoyed the series a great deal compared to no acting on reality TV and various contests that make up network TV today .	1
Really makes you stop and think what if this really did happen in our world what would you do . Very interesting , has the since of community in it .	1
I could do without the romance stuff , but otherwise this series grew on me . wish they kept it going a wile	1
I like watching Jericho very much and look forward to viewing each new episode . It 's all about small town America pulling together in time of disaster with lots of twists and turns . Very entertaining . The editing of this TV series could be better . Lots of blank time in between where commercials were but not sure how that could be remedied .	1
My husband and I enjoy watching in the evening on Prime via the Roku . No commercials , only watch what we want to watch . This series is pretty entertaining . Nice to compare what we would do versus what the town has done .	1
About life after nuclear war . I recommend . It to all adults only . Amazon you need to buy the rest of the seasons .	1
Fun to watch folks being completely unprepared for disaster . Hollywood shows they dont understand farmers and country folk very well but the show and premise are still good entertainment .	1
It 's hard to watch how childish people are . How we humans get through a disaster , baffles me . 99 % of the sheeple just complain and steal and complain , no one rising to the occasion , everyone yelling my brother my father my sister my children , parochial.So I do n't wonder this series only lasted two seasons . The mirror , hurts.Most poignant in the first episode is the narrow-minded mother who accuses the mayor of not knowing what it 's like to have your kid 'out there ' , when in fact Jake is 'out there ' , and his dad the mayor , does n't know if he 's still alive . But he has no luxury to think about that , to cry , to worry.But oh , that mother thinks she 's supposed to yell at the mayor , to be a good mother . Instead , she 's not only a bad mother , but a bad human being , heedless of anyone but her own ego . She obviously does n't even care about her kids ; because if she did , she 'd be trying to help , not yelling.Hope someone will redo the series , for we need to see how hypocritical , parochial and ill-prepared we are , to assemble and think through a crisis , always expecting someone else to handle it ; always uninterested in the big picture , uninterested in doing something ourselves , always ready to blame someone else , never paying attention.It was always 'cool ' to pay little attention in school . Only the bad guys run things . To be disinterested in anything but one 's narrow circle , is supposed to be a virtue . Yeah , and this is what we get for such bad attitudes.So this series really focuses on WHY war occurs . Dark lesson never learned . Which you know , because the music is totally at odds with the theme of the series . Hence only four stars .	1
This show had me at the edge of my seat . It is realistic as to troubles faced during war or disaster . I was n't sure who was bad and who was good and I enjoyed it from episode one .	1
i enjoy the blend of tension with everyday life . this is a solid plot background for that kind of mix.just one question : wth happened with Heather ? ! Emily and Jake just seems so ... trope .	1
The first season was , in this reviewers opinion , the best television ever made . The second was virtually unwatchable.Pros : The show is like `` Picket Fences '' PilotmeetsThe Road Warrior . You get the small town dynamics of folks who have generations of family and a lifetime of history then just to keep the storylines from getting too girly you have the whole post apocalypse thing going on.Likewise , there are the moral decisions that people must make . What is the correct action to take ? What are the rewards and punishments for that action ? In the end , the answers are ambiguous , just like life , but the struggle for moral truth - with all the history and entanglements that folks in a small town have - is almost as compelling as the struggle for survival.While I 'm sure it was n't intended , the series is a powerful endorsement of Federalism . A strong city government maintains order while the federal and state governments collapse . The fact that the city government succeeds is in large part to the small town history of relationships.Cons : If history teaches us anything , human society is surprisingly resilient . While things like Katrina , the Great Chicago Fire , and/or the Great San Francisco earthquake have caused localized destruction of society for short periods , within a few weeks or month 's life reverts to normal . Social norms are resumed and law and order return . In WWII Germany and Japan , despite the general destruction of the nation and mass hunger , society more or less functioned.The U.S. is a country of 300,000,000 plus . It is geographically huge . I do n't think 10 or 20 atomic weapons would result in a complete destruction of society . The plot addresses this by saying that Jericho was in the middle of nuclear fall out zones but spared due to unique weather patterns . Still , I would suspect that what is left of the United States would mount a heroic rescue effort of these isolated pockets . It just might take a couple of months.The whole CIA/terrorist storyline really does n't add anything to the best parts of the show and actually distracts from it.Most of the corn in the U.S. is not edible by humans . It is grown to feed to livestock or to turn into corn syrup . I suspect that there would be a lot more hunger in Jericho.Realize that Kansas is tornado country , but found the number of people who had their own backup generators and stockpile of gas a bit unbelievable.Overall , if you can get past the parts that seem unrealistic , Jericho - especially the first season - is as good as network television gets .	1
I have now come to that stage of life where I have seen every standard TV plot so many times that I am now able to predict the denouement almost as soon as I see the setup and have declared a personal embargo on watching any more shows about doctors , lawyers or cops . While some of the current offerings ( House , Scrubs , etc ) are quite passable - there are other occupations , and other situations which in the hands of the creative , will offer sufficient interest to keep viewers returning on a regular basis . Shows like `` Lost '' and `` Ugly Betty '' are splendid examples of what can be done by stepping outside of the cop-lawyer-doc box , and `` Jericho - Season One '' is another . Take an intriguing and ( for television ) a semi-original situation , involve a large cast of interesting people reacting to it and voila - something that will bring back the audience , over and over . Especially when it is a situation that we might imagine happening to ourselves . After 9/11 , and Katrina ( which provided the genesis of `` Jericho '' to its creators ) it is all to easy to imagine what happens when the world we know suddenly ends , right in the middle of all our mundane plans for a perfectly ordinary day.Which is exactly what happens to the citizens of the small town of Jericho , Kansas , to the family of Johnston Green ( Gerald McRaney ) and their neighbors and friends . Jericho is a small , pleasant place , full of people going about their own business - farming , stocking the grocery store shelves , going through a mayoral election , planning a wedding and enduring an audit by a visiting IRS agent . The school children are off on a field trip and the Green 's black-sheep son Jake suddenly appears needing a great deal of money - the only ripple in the pleasant still pool of a modern American life . In one of the most quietly effective sequences , the camera follows two children , playing hide and seek in a back yard , while one climbs on the roof of a shed , and then onto the house roof . The boy suddenly freezes there , silhouetted against the clouds and the sky - and then we see what he has seen ; a mushroom cloud , coming up from a line of mountains on the distant horizon.And that is the exact point where the people of Jericho , and a handful of visitors who just happen to be there begin a long slow devolution from the twenty-first century into something that more resembles the frontier West ... and then to a condition that looks more like the warring city-states of Renaissance Italy , or classical Greece . First they struggle to figure out just has happened to the rest of the country - and then begins the fight to survive , ending in a cliff-hanger which promises a large audience for the second-season premiere . It makes for a more interesting television show than I had thought , when I first heard about it . The first season set of 22 episodes is neatly packaged on 6 discs . Commentary and deleted scenes are included for selected episodes on the same disc . I would have much rather that deleted scenes be edited into the episode where they belonged , to make a sort of `` director 's cut '' , rather than having them tacked on as an appendage . The omitted scenes would have done a lot for the overall story ; it 's clear that they were omitted to shorten each episode for broadcast.Other extra features included a rather interesting `` making of Jericho '' feature , which included some actor auditions , and a look at set construction , and a short about disaster preparedness , which included some unintentionally hilarious 1950s Civil Defense footage on how one should shelter under a desk or behind some furniture in the event of a nuclear holocaust .	1
Great writing , believable story line . Great characters , each developed and evolved . Great acting , each done well . An interesting look into a possible future .	1
This is a pretty realistic view of what would happen during a nuclear war . I do believe people would come together and help each other . That being said , communities would come together like they did in Jericho and would help each other , until the food ran out . After that it would be every person for themselves . Luckily we do n't have to see that . What we do see is what would happen after a nuclear exchange . Modern things stop working , food stops arriving and people that get common injuries and colds all of a sudden become life threatening events . I like the stories , I like the characters . Great show all around .	1
if this show had come on in the last year or so , i feel confident it would have lasted more than one-and-a-half seasons . it was an excellent show .	1
This was a very good series and the characters was great . The story line is great and their is plenty of action and suspend . You do not know who to trust and trying to keep order is a must . It is a sci fi and a thriller with plenty of action . You can see in this series who people may react to a nuclear attack . This is a present day civil war within the United States ,	1
Saw some episodes when it was on TV but missed the rest . Good build of characters . Great story line . Worth the watch .	1
Pretty good series . There 's not that many episodes so do n't get too attached.We liked it . Typical disaster plot . Enjoy .	1
I found this entire series worthy of a 5 . Entertaining , and with imagination , and I did not want it to end .	1
It started out a little slow but the actors and the camera work really pulled this together . After about the fifth episode I was hooked and looked forward to watching the next episode . It was well done except some of the flash backs were n't necessary but all in all I recommend it .	1
i 've had this one for a little while . I figured it was finally time to check out Jericho and see what the buzz was really all about . Even i 've seen a preview or two of the show . It didnt really do it justice at all . I watched the whole series in 3 days time and it left me wanting more 22 episodes packed with all kinds of intrigue , sub plots with the different characters throughtout the show . It goes without saying that this is one of the shows to look out for in 2008 . With tensions high between Jericho and the neighboring town of New Bern.Along with other things forming in this series it is evident that the show hasnt even begun to hit its stride . Great characters , well done stories and design make this something all should check sooner rather than later .	1
This is one of the best series I have seen in a long time . The story is compelling , makes you think about what could really be , and shows how easily we can turn on each other when the chips are down . Each episode left me looking forward to the next ... ... . and then I found out that there is no ending to the series . I could n't believe it . I searched the Internet from every angle ; only to confirm that the series ended with season 2 . I did discover that the story continues in what I thought was & # 34 ; book format & # 34 ; , so I eagerly ordered the 'book ' for my Kindle ; only to find out that it is a comic book , not a real book.So , if you can live with not seeing the series completed , I would highly recommend watching it .	1
This is a well-scripted , well-acted series . Every episode is suspenseful and believable . It 's a shame the series was never completed .	1
This show depicts events that could possibly happen although I pray it never , ever does . It is well acted and am wondering why it only lasted two seasons .	1
There were several places that could n't have possibly been true to what would really happen after a nuclear strike ; however , it did represent a small portion of what humanity would turn into in this country . I personally would have liked to have seen the storyline go a little more toward reality , but , I understand that our six-pack society , those who care more about the unreality of hollywood than current affairs , could not handle it . I really liked this show in spite and watched it on a marathon status .	1
Give current events this is an interesting story line ... .Gives you something serious to think about ... Survival in an unthinkable situation ... However ... I think the town is taking the situation way too calmly..but they do n't have anyother choice but to do so.Suitable for teenagers and up I THINK ..	1
Good series . Has everything . Some adventure , some sap , some mystery . Really pulled me in when learn past lives of characters before the bombs .	1
A well-developed series that will likely appeal to viewers who like books such as Stephen King 's & # 34 ; The Stand & # 34 ; and current television series like & # 34 ; Revolution. & # 34 ;	1
I know it , this is a friggin ' looong read . The short version : I like JERICHO , and I recommend it . Now , here 's the long version.SPOILERS , here and there , everywhere.Great , something nutty survivalists and I can agree on . So I really like JERICHO . It 's a strong show and addictive , with a tantalizing premise that should geek out almost any casual fan . Today , end-of-the-world stories have become even more fascinating and timely . JERICHO nicely slides into that space , dropping a tale of fear and struggle and of survival and hope . JERICHO tells of frightened townspeople pulling together under duress and facing down each daunting obstacle . As it turns out , JERICHO is also about nuts . There 's a memorable scene late in Season One regarding nuts , and even a real life , save-the-show campaign involving nuts.The story begins with residents of small town Jericho , Kansas glimpsing a shocking mushroom cloud blooming , off in the distance . Word rapidly gets out that Denver and Atlanta have become the targets of nuclear attacks , and who knows how many other cities were bombed ? Very shortly after , Jericho , population five thousand , finds itself alarmingly cut off , with minimal and dubious contact with the outside world . In the following days and weeks , the town finds itself contending with a plague of challenges , from radioactive fallout to widespread paranoia to roving marauders to the inevitable arrival of shellshocked refugees from affected neighboring towns and cities . All too soon , the town 's resources begin to peter out . Just how long can Jericho and its people hang on , before it all falls apart ? The collapse of civilization has a way of leaving deep psychological scars . When stripped of the underpinnings of society and government , it 's awfully hard not to become reduced to a caveman denominator . Jericho , influenced by its mayor and his sons , tries to cling to its pre-apocalyptic ideals . It makes for riveting viewing as Jericho 's tiny geopolitical dynamics are shaken up and a new , more aggressive social culture emerges . It 's a whole new world , a crappy , blighted one . The standard of living has devolved . Horses become a popular , fuel-saving alternative to automobiles . Windmills prove to be a seriously viable source of energy . Food is rationed , ammo is doled out , medicine is hoarded . Money loses value . Bartering is the new money . For Jericho , its salt mines provide an invaluable trading commodity . Meanwhile , the residents are still in the dark as to how widespread the destruction is , or if America still even exists as they know it.Despite the post-apocalyptic , sci-fi setting , JERICHO is fueled by human drama . The show does n't make the mistake of forsaking storytelling for flash . Oh , there are taut action sequences here and there ( `` Rogue River , '' `` Crossroads , '' & the final 4 episodes ) . And the ongoing suspense is there , even though the series commits itself to a slow burn , taking its sweet time in divulging answers ( which probably threw off some viewers ) . But , mostly , the focus is on the characters ' development and their personal story arcs , set in a world-gone-mad backdrop . Jericho is a tiny town , with its share of secrets and notoriety . Extramarital stuff goes on , and family conflict . Political wrangling goes on . A local crime lord lurks on the fringes . A secretive neighbor moves in . But Jericho is also a place where redemption can be earned , estranged families reunited , a sense of community galvanized , and a sweet but unlikely romance blossom between , say , a down-to-earth farmer and a prickly IRS auditor.The acting is very good , the performances , for the greater part , grow on one and impact in the emotional gut . It 's a pretty hefty ensemble cast , but JERICHO gravitates towards the Greens , Jericho 's first family and led by patriarch and town mayor Johnston Green ( a wonderfully understated Gerald McRaney ) , who also happens to be an ex-Army Ranger . It 's so nice to check in with McRaney again , as I have n't seen him since hisSimon & Simon - Season Onedays ( I dug it whenever Johnston put on his cowboy hat ) . I like that he and Pamela Reed achieve a certain believability as a longtime married couple . Props also to the hissable Michael Gaston , who plays Johnston 's scheming political rival Gray Anderson , a fella you ca n't help but throw middle fingers at . I 'm not sure how much acting chops it takes to make your character so detested , but Gaston pulls it off . It helps that Anderson is n't nasty all the time , and , in fact , fervently believes that he 's a guy doing the right thing , and , sometimes , he even does . Meanwhile , while Ashley Scott is a striking actress , I wish more screen time had also been given to the quietly vibrant Sprague Grayden , who plays schoolteacher/car mechanic/engineer/all-around cutie Heather Lisinski . I like her as much as Scott , with both gorgeous actresses flaunting a nice chemistry with lead actor Skeet Ulrich . On a minus , I was n't digging Dale , that taciturn kid who works at the grocery store . The earlier shows made him a sympathetic character , but , later on , he transforms into an unlikable opportunist.But the two most interesting - and enigmatic - characters happen to be Jake Green and Robert Hawkins . Jake , effectively played by Skeet Ulrich , is JERICHO 's stoic central hero and is the Green family 's troubled black sheep who returns to town after five mysterious years of absence . No one 's privy to what Jake 's been thru since he went away , but , there 's no doubt at all that his many newfound skills go quite a ways in keeping Jericho afloat in the trying times ahead . It does n't take long before the townspeople start looking to Jake as their go-to guy . Another intriguing character is the immensely capable , new-to-town Robert Hawkins ( British actor Lennis James , here sporting a Yankee accent ) , who passes himself off as a St. Louis cop ( he 's not ) . Lennis James does a great job of ambiguously toeing that line between good guy and bad guy , all the while exuding that dangerous vibe ; you 're just never quite sure which side he 's on ( I mean , even his family is wary of him ) . Regarding Jake and Hawkins , we do n't really get the backstory until the episodes `` The Day Before '' and `` A.K.A . `` There are n't a lot of weak episodes here , with each one integral to the ongoing story arc and several being of the heartwrenching sort ( `` Winter 's End , '' `` Why We Fight '' ) . Episode 17 ( `` One Man 's Terrorist '' ) I was n't too fond of , that one focusing on Emily 's amazingly bland fiance Roger . But then the ensuing five episodes frenetically bring it home . In the months ahead , it 'll turn out that Jericho , even with its assorted problems , had fared better than most other places . This makes the town a desirable target . This plays out in the last four episodes , culminating in the slam bang finale as Jericho is forced to go to war against an invading neighboring town . Season One 's final episode `` Why We Fight '' ends on a cliffhanger , at which point , CBS pulled the plug on the series . And , boy , did that tick people off . But , thanks to the concerted efforts of its fans , who delivered thousands of pounds of nuts to CBS , the network greenlit a second season in the form of seven new episodes . And thank goodness ! Seriously , a cliffhanger is NOT the way to go out ! Sidenote : Here 's a cool gimmick : Each episode features a different Morse code played over the title shot , which offers a hint of what 's going on in that particular episode . I 've got to learn Morse code.JERICHO - THE FIRST SEASON comes in a 6 disc package , and CBS does n't stint on the bonus features . `` Building Jericho '' is the interesting 24-minute-long Making Of documentary , which includes snippets of cast audition clips ( of Lennis James , Kenneth Mitchell , Pamela Reed , and Sprague Grayden ) . `` What If ? '' is a sobering 9-minute segment delving into the history of the atomic bomb and the terrifying possibility of a nuclear attack today . You want episode commentaries ? Or deleted scenes ? You got 'em ! Fifteen of the 22 episodes come with either an episode commentary or deleted scenes ( or , sometimes , both ) . The commentaries are mostly by the executive producers ( exec . producer/director Jon Turteltaub is actually kinda funny ) , although Skeet and Lennie James do pop in to drop their own words ( Skeet in `` Rogue River '' ; Lennie in `` Red Flag '' ; Skeet & Lennie in `` Vox Populi '' ) . Would 've been nice , though , to have commentary on the last episode `` Why We Fight . '' But , overall , not too shabby for extras.Now , if only the eyeball network can see fit to extend the second season beyond a mere seven episodes ...	1
This series is so intense and makes you think ! Never expected to have all seasons , but thanks to Amazon I now do ! Check it out .	1
You need to give it a chance , like about 5 episodes . The acting is good but the theme music grates on my nerves . It is harsh and has way too many horns between episodes , but the music in the episodes is right on and the characters are well cast and act their roles well . I do n't know how many seasons this show was on , but I 'm enjoying it .	1
Got my attention from the first episode to the last one in season two . Very time appropriate for our current time in history . Just the right amount of drama and action for my taste . Wish it could go on and on but know all good things must come to an end .	1
Really captivating series , and the characters well acted . I liked the ending , just as it should be if ever we face such events .	1
What would you do during a disaster scenario where information is scarce and everything is headed into a downward spiral ? Most likely , try to keep your head above water . That is the premise of Jericho , a smaller city outside of a location that experienced a major nuclear attack . It follows a town as they deal with the likely problems we as a society would face when things turn extremely rough . Sadly , it only lasted for two seasons , meaning at some point the story line will simply drop off , never to be continued . : (	1
I 'm really enjoying this series . I wish I found it sooner than now . It 's an interesting perspective on what would happen if life changed as we know it . Will we remain civil or go into anarchy ?	1
I thought Jericho was a great series . To bad that they seemed to have canceled it in the second season with only 7 episodes .	1
I enjoyed this series , a show about what happens after nuclear bombs go off in theUNITED states . Some unlikely heroes emerge and a town grapples with their new reality.The writing is good the character development is interesting . Characters with human flaws but stillAble to hold on to that which is good.I enjoyed the first season and now watching the second season .	1
first few episodes pretty interesting . but as the season moves forwardthe plots are not as interesting and dont develop as much as they could .	1
I 'm not big on spending a lot of time on fiction . BUT ... The wife LOVES drama . Add a dystopian view to it and she adores it . This was right up her alley and she would watch another three seasons had they made them .	1
This caught my attention from the first minutes I started watching . I could not wait to see what happens next . I recommend this series . I have watches both seasons and am hoping for a third .	1
I really really like this series . At least they got a chance to give closure to the story line , but I ca n't help imagining what they COULD have done with several seasons . Fantastic story , great character interaction , intense political intrigue . You will enjoy it and then probably wish it could have gone on for more than 2 seasons .	1
When I first watched the pilot , I saw too many pretty people with nice hair and though they suffered from a nuclear attack far away , no one suffered from soap and water much less styling goods . As time went on , people complained about lack of goods but it never really makes much of a dent . The lack of gasoline , etc . is discussed but in the end it really does n't affect the residents much . Besides these concerns , I became more involved in the show and the realism of the setting did n't bother me as much . Actors meld with their characters and they become more interesting and human . Jericho in Kansas is a place where the bombs were not supposed to go off and be a safety zone for the terrorists who have detonated the bombs . The residents do n't know what went on and only gets bits and pieces as the series moves on . The main characters are Jake Green , the son of the mayor who has been mysteriously absent for several years . He seems to have been in Iraq as a soldier . The other main character is Hawkins , an African-American man who mysteriously appears with his family for unknown reasons just before the bombing . As time goes on , Jake and Hawkins appear to be the heros who will save the day . The series becomes more and more detailed and exciting . I was impressed with the choice of great actors in the series including Gerald McRainey who plays the mayor , Pamela Reed as his wife and Lennie James as Robert Hawkins . One of the most impressive things in the series is allowing Lennie James , a British-African actor . to rise up to be a star . There are n't many black actors being allowed to act and participate in a show except as the buddy and Hawkins is a character who surpasses everyone else without argument . The series only lasted a year and a half but if very impressive . It began when the networks were attempting to challenge cable channels with higher quality series just as they did with Lost and Desperate Housewives . Those shows lasted longer and lost their impact so maybe it was luck that this show was short and still impressive .	1
Loved this show when it was on . Missed a lot of it at the end of reg . season when we went away on a long vacation so I was thrilled to be able to watch it . Loved the interaction of the characters , the threads of all the little side stories and especially loved the character Jake . A good mystery as well as you try to figure everything out , who is Hawkins & exactly what is he up to ? Who are the good guys & bad guys ?	1
As usual , there are some characters you will like and others who you will love to hate . So far , so good .	1
I loved Jericho ! Suspenseful and held my interest the whole time . The acting was well done and the actors were excellent in their roles . I appreciated that there was no filthy language and sex scenes ! ! ! It held to family values and a theme that is very possibly on the horizon for our country ! Good for is to be prepared ! ! !	1
The characters were awesome , riveting and exciting , just like our neighbors . So realistic . It makes it so real . Thanks to Amazon I was lucky enough to get a chance to watch the series . Six years after it was filmed I had an opportunity to watch it . I just wish it was still on . Thank God for Amazon !	1
Love this show . I found I had to keep watching and watching to see what would happen.Looking for the next season soon .	1
The tv series is enjoyable but not very believable . Disasters certainly bring out the stupid in people.It was nice to see a show that did n't have zombies .	1
Kind of low budget but an interesting premise . It was too bad it was canceled . That said this show suffers from what a lot of post-apocalyptic shows suffer from , there is no set end date for the show . It 's a great story but with no hard end date they just keep adding plot twists with no conclusion .	1
I was so sorry to find out that this show was not continued . It is wrapped up a bit . but it was really good with great character development and storyline . I enjoyed all of it.At first I thought it was going to be cheesy ... but it was n't . Yeah , there was some stuff that did n't make sense ... like that despite no electricity , the women all had perfect hair . Really silly ... oh and they all dressed great despite the fact that they had no access to the outside world and no way to wash or iron clothing . That was also silly . But I overlooked that because it was really a good show and fun and exciting .	1
I like futuristic films and was never able to watch this onT.V . as my husband does not and would n't watch it . Now I get to watch it on my Kindle .	1
Very realistic . Really makes you think about what would happen if someone did this kind of thing . How would America react ?	1
Very well put together drama . The characters were perfect for the stories being told . Some of them were new faces who I will look for on other movies and TV shows . Sometimes the music was too loud and took away from what was happening . I liked this series . The end left you to wonder how it all would turn out but it seemed pretty apparent the good ole USA would prevale .	1
As someone that grew up in small town America this well written story was fascinating . Nuclear war is an insane idea , but we live with the possibility every day . The possible tragedy is explored with what I felt were real people , good acting and reasonable human interaction . The story line is like one very long novel and being able to watch episode after episode at your leisure with Prime is the perfect way to get the most from this story . The novel celebrates those that strive to cling to positive moral values in the face of unimaginable hardships .	1
This a great show , fast moving , and exciting , had many surprise endings , which made jump right to the next eps .	1
Was skeptical at first , but this show just grew on me . Great ensemble of actors , good stories , action scenes are well done . Check it out ... ..you 'll like it .	1
This is a great show . I wished they would have continued on with it . Watching the whole season on Prime is great . No commercials and not having to wait until the next week or two to watch the next episode . Unfortunately , the plot line seems plausible ; But makes for a great TV show .	1
This is a wonderful show . I do n't understand why it was cancelled . Anyone that likes survival stories will love this program .	1
A good story line . The characters are believeable . Sad that there were only two seasons on Tv . However seasons three and four are available in comic novel form .	1
The first season of Jericho was as good as any sci fi show . Suspenseful great cast good story lines . Shoulda been a classic .	1
AWESOME SHOW ... ... ..I DID N'T GET TO SEE THE PILOT ... .NOW I HAVE & GET THE BACKGROUND OF THE SHOW LOT MORE	1
Generally a good production . Realistic depictions of nuclear weapons and radiation effects . Also pretty realistic depiction of EMP effects ( older vehicles without computerized electronic ignitions able to run etc ) .And then I just like some of the players in whatever role they play .	1
Very realistic situations ... no aliens or vampires . Makes you want to store up and makes you realize how quickly you can go from much to none .	1
Jericho will always be my favorite show , hands down . I 'm watching it for the 3rd time and have convinced most of my family to watch it as well .	1
The show was an interesting concept and took a while to figure out who did the dirty work . The acting was a bit over the top ...	1
Quick Overview : Jake returns to the town of Jericho to work out some money matters with his father . He makes a speedy exit that is halted abruptly when a ginormous explosion rocks Jericho . Now the whole population is cut off from everything . Secrets and such come out as these citizens ban together to survive.Great plot . Viewers learn a lot about all of the characters and their histories as they maneuver this big scale event . It did n't take me long to get into the swing on things . The cast does a remarkable job working together and delivering believable dialogue .	1
I did not watch it when it was on TV , so I wanted to see what is was like . I love it I am looking forward to finding out what happen to everyone .	1
I just started this series but so far , the acting is good , the story believable and the setting interesting so will be watching to see if it follows true to form . Thank you .	1
I actually really like this show and I remember thinking when it was being advertised that I should watch it , but never did . Now that it is no longer available , I am sad to know that I never helped with the ratings by watching it .	1
Kinda hokey at first , but better as it grew . Got to be pretty & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; I thought . Watch season two , do n't know why this ended so quickly.Good for a binge on rainy dull days !	1
This is a good show . I really enjoy it . It keeps you in suspense . I would recommend it to watch .	1
Started out as a skeptical viewer and can now say I 'm an addicted fan . While this show is fantasy , it has definitely caused me to ponder our vulnerability and the possibility of life without the power grid . Scary thought , but I enjoy seeing how the writers carried it out in each episode . Hope I never have to find out what it 's really like !	1
Every episode had excitement and suspense and character development . It has a fascinating storyline that makes you think & # 34 ; what if & # 34 ; and then you see how this town handles not knowing the why and what of the attack on America that they survived .	1
Cancelling Jericho was a serious error on the part of the network . Wonderful , believable characters , excellent acting and an intriguing story line . What more could you ask for in escapist television . The story kept me constantly asking how I would handle a given situation , what would my roll be ? This show is on the same entertainment level as Walking Dead , too bad there wo n't be anymore .	1
Wish they would have continued this series , but at least they brought it to a conclusion somewhat instead of just leaving you hanging .	1
Great writing , and compelling characters in a dramatic situation , are some of the reasons why Jericho is very compelling serial television . The story centers on the events in the fictitious town of Jericho , Kansas , after a nuclear attack . The immediate concern is survival , and then maintaining basic government structure , medical facilities , and utilities . As characters are defined , past lives and secrets are disclosed , and roles , old and new , are formed.Exactly what happened is a mystery , and while some things are revealed , it is evident to viewers that there are several hidden conspiracies . The situation gets more complex , as new characters appear , and a hazy picture of the new America slowly takes shape.The key figures in Jericho , are from the Green , Richmond , and Hawkins families . The ensemble cast is great overall , but Skeet Ulrich 's performance as wayward son come home , Jake Green is superlative , and the glue that holds much of story together . Gerald McRaney as Johnson Green , the mayor of Jericho , brings incredible toughness and leadership , to a situation that demands it . The wild card that separates Jericho from being just a post holocaust survival tale , is Robert Hawkins ( Lennie James ) , a newcomer in town engaged in something very , very , deep.The writing is often clever and suspenseful , with unexpected developments springing up . Although things begin slowly , the season finishes in a flurry , with the town on the verge of all out war . Quite sobering , for a network television series . The writers mix things up , using creative flashbacks , and bringing back characters , and even a tank , in later episodes . While there are inconsistencies and illogical events , and some things have to be toned down for television , the story builds to a riveting conclusion , leading to a second season , that almost never was . Family values , morals , and patriotism , are some of the values that led to the founding of America , and this series effectively touches back to them.Executive producers Jon Turteltaub and Carol Barbee provide commentary for a few episodes , and Skeet Ulrich and Lennie James , also contribute commentaries . 'Building Jericho ' is a 24 minute documentary feature , about how the town of Jericho was constructed , and some interesting background information . A series that will make you think , thrill you , make you cry , and remember what it means to be an American . Jericho is a remarkable program that should not be missed .	1
I missed this series when it was on network tv . It is nice to be able to watch it without commercials . Thank you for making it available .	1
With the world , and this country , in such upheaval , this series really hit home . Woudl I react as they did ? who knows . And I hope I never have to find out . Me or my children or grandchildren . As I watched the episodes one right after the other I thought that this series could/should be used as a teaching tool in high schools and colleges . What would you do , how would you do it , Is any of it possible ? Entertaining and frightening .	1
Great interplay between characters , Gerald McRainey is great as the leader of his people , Would like to see something new with Skeet Ulrich .	1
Well cast drama quite accurately depicted . Do n't believe , however , Jonathan Rhys Meyers would ever be mistaken as a double for the original Henry VIII ! Nor would any of the real wives and children be as glamorous as the ones Hollywood chose . But the action , the sets , the activities , the costumes , the political-religious arenas of the day were all so true to life that we must grant Hollywood some leeway . All in all , it was a marvelous portrayal of 15th-16th century England . More such dramas should be presented on TV .	1
Though artist liberties were taken with the series , I love it none the less , i have found the show to be very entertaining , and intriguing !	1
Great subject matter . Outstanding locations and filming.Good historic reference , and very graphic.Mature subject matter.One of the best series I have seen on TV .	1
Main actor , however is too predictable . He is too easily emotional and reacts that way . I know , it 's the script for effect .	1
I was fairly familiar with the history behind King Henry VIII ; this dramatization is really entertaining . I am in the middle of season 3 , and still enjoying it !	1
Out of all the reigning monarchs of England and elsewhere whose lives would have made a smashingly entertaining soap opera , that of Henry VIII is generally acknowledged to be at the top of anyone 's short list . The man certainly had a way with serial monogamy , and as such has kept writers like Philippa Gregory , movie-makers , playwrights and the BBC busy for decades . Make that centuries , for even Shakespeare had a go . One would think there is n't another blessed thing that could be said about the much-married monarch , and yet Showtime has managed it . And they have n't even gotten up to the point where he had finally and irrevocable divested himself of his first wife and married the second - in the process almost casually wrenching England out of the orbit of the Catholic Church . This season just sets the stage and establishes the personalities.In one way , this reminded me rather vividly of the movie `` Elizabeth '' , in that it combined psychological acuity with considerable historical inaccuracy . Yes , there are all sorts of inaccuracies , merged events , death of historical personages that did not occur for years after the events depicted here , deaths that did not in the least happen as represented here , and strikingly divergent visualizations of personalities - not least of which is Henry himself.This is not the usual Henry VIII , a heavy-set and peevish middle-aged man ; here he is vital , young and passionate ; a sort of rock-star king , as charming as he is - perhaps - a sociopath . He is the sun around which the whole of his court and government revolve . Jonathan Rhys Meyers looks nothing like the historical Henry . However , he conveys the arrogant attraction of the man and his single-minded pursuit of his desires , whether it was victory on the tilt-yard or in a diplomatic convocation ... or to be rid of a wife who could not bear him a son . One has the sense that yes , Henry VIII was probably very much like this ; charming , mercurial and dangerous to cross - and that his court was a snake pit of seething ambitions and relentless plotting to gain his ear and his favor.Eventually Henry would be also be rid of anyone around him who dared to tell him `` no '' , and that is what is the larger drama in this first season : the downfall and disgrace of his most trusted adviser and chancellor , Cardinal Wolsey ( Sam Neill ) and the setting aside of his proud and able wife , the Catholic Catherine of Aragon ( Maria Doyle Kennedy ) in favor of the younger and presumably fruitful ( and Protestant ) Anne Boleyn . This is the point which has been reached in the series finale , although for my money , the most noteworthy climax was that moment of quiet horror when Thomas More ( Jeremy Northam ) and another councilor seemed to realize that there was absolutely no one left at court who would be able to reason or coax Henry out of the disastrous course that he had set.Of the extra features included in this set , the most interesting is a look at series production and sets , and a tour of modern-day sites in London associated with Henry VIII 's court .	1
While not 100 percent historically accurate The Tudors does a good job at telling what life was like in the court of Henry VIII played brilliantly by Jonathan Rhys-Meyers.The story starts several years after Henry becomes King and goes through everything from the Field of Cloth and Gold , the various plots against the French and Spanish , the birth of Henry Fitzroy ( the Kings illegitimate son ) and much more.Most of the story centers on Henry 's marriage to Catherine of Aragon and his increasing love affair with Anne Boleyn and which led him to cast Catherine off and break with the Church of Rome to marry Anne.The cast is very good . And while it is not 100 percent accurate the acting , scenery , and costumes make up for it .	1
This wonderful production highlights the monster that Henry VIII was and the role of all parties from the gentry to the church in their respective grabs for power . This is a very entertaining show to watch and adds a dramatized human element to the horrible man , Henry VIII .	1
Love , the show , even watching it for the 2nd time again . Jon Rhees is a smoking hot HenryVlll , and the era costumes are awesome .	1
While its not very accurate as has been stated . It is good however to see the King be himself and the energy that he brings to the character . The customes and sites seem to have been well done also . I 'm however not a big fan of explicit disregard for his wife and daughter despite Henry 's `` caring '' about her . It might have be the thing to do at that time but it irritated me everytime . He was in a room with his wife , the Queen and the mistress Anne is there as well . He 's suddenly so in love and ca n't live without her . He wants to divorce his wife because the marriage was supposedly not legal.All of sudden after all the one nighters with women he probably ca n't even remember or name if put to the test . His focus should be more on running the country and all the other issues that the people are having around him , not chasing after a woman ( that has more skeletons in her closet than a cemetary ) . While i enjoyed Johnathan Rhys Meyers acting in in this for the most part and he 's very likeable guy . I ca n't help but hope that the story picks up for this series.It has some promise and i hope that the Tudors can deliver on that in the 2nd season . I 'd like to see more about the Queen , her background and other relevant issues that Henry went through during his time .	1
I had forgotten how well acted this entire series was . Watch the entire series from the beginning it will renew your faith in the acting community . This series is far better then most of the movies that are put out today .	1
This production has spared no expense on settings and costumes . It is a visual feast . However , beware that this show shows alot of skin/sex and is definitely not for children . I have seen 3 seasons and felt they were all good . While i do n't like all the violence , it does give me a feel for how brutal the times were and how easy it was to get your head chopped off .	1
Love this romantic show . Would recommend this to any women . The men in this show is sexy and you never know what is going to happen in each episode .	1
Amazing performances and beautiful settings ! Do not start watching this if you are not prepared to follow to the end . Highly Addictive ! A little thin on historical accuracy in places but the performances seem to make you forget that . Watching the performances of the actors in this series will make you want to watch other things they have done . Highly recommend .	1
I just finished viewing the first season and i have to admit its a great costume period drama . It does drag in some places and the acting can be a bit over the top . That being said its a solid B+ mini series .	1
Considering this particular period was so filled with change , twists of fate , rises , falls , and nearly every other device found in great dramas , I expected better than a seeming focus on the sexual antics of the characters . Otherwise , very well done and for those who do n't have good background in the period when Henry VIII was King of England , it should hold your attention .	1
This is a docudrama about Henry the Eighth . There is a lot of action and beautiful people to keep you watching.I would not recommend this for children.Dr George Tomes	1
This show takes an exciting look at a crucial time in history . If you can get past the sex scenes , the show does a great job showing this complex time in England .	1
It took a little while for me to warm up to the show - i liked it but did n't spend a whole night sleepless watching it until around episode 7 , at which point there was no turning back . As others mention already , the set designs , actors and screenplay are very well done.. but what intrigued me most was that the historical period of the story basically coincides with the division of the church , from the rule of Catholicism to the outbranches of `` protest '' -antism . And the show goes on to become a study almost ( and a very entertaining one at that ) of the way this came to be ( in England ) . The story does a pretty fair job of presenting both the integrity and corruption of the Catholicism of Europe at the time and it likewise shows how and what drove the king to accept `` reformist '' versions of Christianity . It 's a fascinating study of a subject I really knew very little about and I come away feeling more informed somehow , and entertained into the bargain . Even if religion is n't your thing , religion and politics were once quite married and intermixed with the state and it 's fascinating to see these things portrayed - and to compare them with where we are now . A fascinating historical story . It 's no wonder Shakespeare put it on the stage in his day . Showtime has just sexed it up a bit . And speaking of sex , if this show does n't convince you of the power that libido plays behind the scenes , nothing will !	1
Note : I just saw the first episode with XFinity On Demand.This immensely poular series is interesting . I like historical dramas . However , my problem is that there 's no historical summary prior to the series , as there is in The Borgias . A historical summary of past events leading up to what occurs in the series is most helpful , so I was somewhat lost as to who is who and who is doing what to who and why . That being said , this series is intriguing .	1
Acting is perfect ! Love history and almost perfectly accurate with history . I wish the tutors did not end with Henry VIII but continued with Henry 's son and then Mary and Elisabeth . After all common ?	1
If you want serious history , you should be reading a book . If you want entertainment with a historical base , television is a good choice . I am not in a position to pick out the errors of omission and commission in this series . How many there are is not important to me . This is not a history lesson and I wish to be entertained . As entertainment , The Tudors succeeds ! The acting is excellent , the settings realistic , the dialog intelligent and believable.Henry the VIII is young , active , good looking and powerful . He has two unfilled desirers , to have a son and to conquer France . Season 1 has him working on both . The King 's favor is all-important , the series captures this and shows us why . Without being boring , we are given enough background to understand the situation and see why Henry selects a course of action . Many of his reason are not the best but this gives us insight into a complex personality.While knowing the story , the telling is fresh and enjoyable . I rented the first DVD from Blockbuster for 99 cents . After the second episode , I ordered season 1 . This is on a par with Rome and Deadwood as enjoyable entertainment with some historical background .	1
I had read an article on Jeremy Irons who I guess stars as an older Richard and decided to start from the beginning . Glad I did .	1
My best friend and I are addicted . A riveting show that will certainly grab your attention ! For people who enjoy history and period time pieces , this is the perfect show for you . An amazing cast , an amazing attention to visual detail and a story line that just could n't be made up ! A small warning though ... . it is NOT suitable for children .	1
As I said with the other seasons I love it and the actores are greatI have watched it about 10 times	1
This series is enormous in scope and devilishly all consuming . The characterizations and plots are astoundingly good and prove to be historically accurate in every vein.The acting is superb as are the cinematography , editing and presentation . I suffer no guilt at addicting myself to catching up on this splendid offering . I can say that there has not been one boring minute during the 20 episodes I 've viewed .	1
I love this series - elegant historically accurate costumes and backgrounds with outstanding performances and a director who tells it like it really was - this is one of the very few films I will watch again .	1
While the series is very loosely based on the events of the life of Henry VIII the performances by JR Meyers , Sam Neill as Wolsey , and Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More really make the piece.Natalie Dormer is pitch perfect as Anne , even if we can see through her and her family and find her annoying ! Maria Doyle Kennedy as the Queen is superb . She is warm , human , dignified and we actually feel sorry for all the king is throwing away for a woman who ultimately proved to not be worth it . And how much he will destroy in England in the process.Henry as a 'sleeping lion ' is wonderfully portrayed . The series starts and ends looking like a 'bonkbuster ' but there is a LOT of interesting stuff that will pique your interest in the real history if you can get past the nudie bits.Squishing his 2 sisters into the one who marries his friend Charles Brandon was silly and pointless , and it is amazing they never once mention Scotland in the whole 10 hours ! Margaret Tudor married the king of scotland , Mary the old senior King of France , not Portugal , and he died 3 months later.The Thomas Tallis parts were just silly , and partly for shock value and more sex , but I think they were trying to show a bit about the 'common man'.The scenes between Henry and Anne light up the screen -- it is interesting to see the contrast with the second series , when they are barely in the same county , let alone room . ( GREAT acting in both ) .The costumes , settings and acting make this , while not perfect , certainly an excellent way to savor history and the period .	1
Amazon 's video-streaming is high-quality and the Tudors is no exception . My husband and I love this show and while it 's not 100 % historically accurate , I 've learned about English history a lot from watching .	1
Though the series has taken some liberties with historical events and omitted others , this is still an entertaining drama . Henry at times became quite annoying with his tantrums , and his habit of casting aside those who anger him or no longer hold his interest while historically accurate made me dislike him as well . That said , I do n't imagine we are supposed to like him over much . The side dealing of scheming and the power of the church back then made for good drama . All in all I enjoyed it though the sex scenes I could have lived without . I 'm not prudish in the least . My dis like is more in the form of boredom . Yawn , yet another sex scene when I 'm more interested in plot development . I love history , and while this shows a made for good television history instead of the more accurate events , it was fun to watch . One example is that Henry the 8th son did n't die as a small child at all , and it was n't the sweating sickness that killed him . Those who must see things as portrayed accurately will be disappointed .	1
its better than most shows on tv but that 's not saying much . its not very historically accurate from what i can tell but it 's interesting to watch	1
So fun to watch , keeps your interest all the way through . Incorporates many historical events . Great actors , beautiful costumes . Triggers a person 's interest in history , wish I had paid better attention in class all those years ago , but maybe I would have if history had come to life like it does on the Tudors screen .	1
There is probably nothing more that I like to watch than a costume drama , particularly one set at a time when men were swinging swords and showing off their legs in hose . A Man for All Seasons , Ben Hur , Elizabeth , Anne of a Thousand Days , Quo Vadis , Braveheart ... .I could go on and on , but you get the idea.The Tudors is a costume drama fan 's dream come true . Sword fights , beheadings , lusty men and women rolling in the hay and in other places ... beautiful actors , great music , all abound in The Tudors . While the history shown is not always accurate , it 's close enough to get the point across , and you 're just having so much fun watching the high drama , you really do n't care if it is n't exactly dead on point accurate . It 's right up there with Rome ( which to my great sorrow was only on for two seasons ) as a & # 34 ; go to & # 34 ; show to revisit when I want the thrill of seeing yesteryear as it probably never was.Sarah Bolger gives a fantastic performance as Princess Mary , Henry Cavill is great eye candy and does a nice job portraying Charles Brandon , and while Jonathan Rhys Meyers does n't look a thing like Henry VIII ( who was never that handsome ) , he captures the & # 34 ; over-the-top & # 34 ; behavior that Henry often displayed . But perhaps my favorite person throughout the entire series was Bishop Chapuys , played by Anthony Brophy . I wanted to cry when we received word in the show that he 'd died . I thought Mr. Brophy did an excellent job . Maria Doyle Kennedy also turns in a stellar performance as Queen Katherine.So I can highly recommend not just this Season , but the entire Series with great pleasure who anyone who likes to see men in codpieces and wearing velvet !	1
I 'm rewatching this for about the 15th time . It 's reaaally good . Can be disturbing , seeing the nasty ways people were slated to die - and for stupid reasons ; but alas , it 's all true . Recommended , for adults .	1
I have been watching The Tudors since it came on the air and it has grown on me every season . Yes , this is truly a fictional series based on truth but you wo n't care as you become engrossed in the series . A viewer can end up doing research and reading websites and books in search of the truth . The show is well acted , lush and a lot of fun , which it should be . Henry VIII went down in history due the creativity of his marriages and his religious beliefs . His daughter from Anne Boleyn turned out to be Britain 's greatest monarch so something came out of it . A fun show and a great entertainment . I 'm so surprised that Showtime did n't cancel it due to the cost .	1
I just finished watching the entire first season of `` The Tudors . '' When the show first premiered on Showtime , I watched the pilot episode and never bothered to watch it again . I thought the show was visually appealing , but way too melodramatic and historically inaccurate for my taste . However , I recently read a fascinating book about Henry VIII , and I needed something else to satisfy my Tudor fixation . I watched all the episodes of `` The Tudors '' On Demand in less than a week , and I really enjoyed them.In order to appreciate this program , you have to be willing to accept the show for what it is . Yes , the majority of the characters and plots in the show are based on real historical events , but this is a cable television series , and of course things are going to be changed to appeal to a larger commercial audience . As a result , all of the people in King Henry 's court are much more attractive than they probably were in real life , and there are some major alterations to historical timelines . Still , I 'm impressed that the producers actually did get so many things right with the show , and overall , it 's very engaging to watch . The pacing is exciting and fast ... perhaps a little too fast , in my opinion . For example , Elizabeth `` Bessie '' Blount gets knocked up with Henry 's illegitimate child in the very first episode , and by the second episode , she 's already giving birth . I wonder how long `` The Tudors '' can realistically continue to air with such a rushed chain of events.For the most part , I think the casting of the show is excellent . I 've never been a big fan of Jonathan Rhys Meyers until now , but his portrayal of Henry VIII is intense , dramatic , and exciting . Sam Neill is brilliant as the two-faced Cardinal Wolsey , and Natalie Dormer is perfect as the bewitching Anne Boleyn . As far as the characterizations of these famous characters goes , I think Henry VIII has been a bit one-sided in Season 1 . I 'll be interested to see how Meyers tackles the role when Henry finds himself betrayed by the woman he nearly sacrifices his kingdom for . It would be nice to see a more emotional side of Henry . Also , I think Anne has actually been pretty likable so far ... hopefully she 'll become a much darker character in Season 2.Overall , I enjoyed `` The Tudors '' much more than I thought I would . It 's entertaining , and people who enjoy learning about this period in history will definitely get a kick out of it . I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of Season 2 .	1
Modernized version , but well written and well acted . Lots of sex though , definitely not for kids to watch ! Once you start watching , you get hooked and wanting to keep watching and wanting more . Really good show , just keep in mind , it 's entertainment .	1
A really grasping tale of young king Henry VIII is a story based explicitly on lust and deception , lawlessness and arbitrariness still well inherited into valid law and order to date somewhere in the modern-looking world .	1
I chose the Tudors to view as I am interested in all things about Kings and Queen histories . The script seems to accurate . The costumes of the period were remarkable . I loved the entire series . This particular season is rated for the mature audience not for high school.Viewing Henry VIII was incredible , and the wives of the king with all the court secrecy and plots was awesome , and apparently , from history real .	1
Rome has clearly inspired Showtime to produce this miniseries in 10 one hour parts , portraying Henry VIII 's more youthful and vigorous days . The timespan is a small one , from his growing discontentment with Catherine of Aragon , to consummating his love for Anne Boleyn ... so we only get to wife number 2 - plenty of scope for sequels , but did leave me with a bit of frustration at times wanting to see a little more resolved.As it is , the key players here are Henry VIII , in his low 20 's , fighting fit and clearly horny ( there are some fairly explicit scenes towards the beginning of the season ) .. Cardinal Wolsey ( played with great presence by Sam Neill ) the corrupt but efficient First Minister , and Sir Thomas More , the fervent Catholic and conscientious humanist.The series thrives on a combination of terrific performances , well written screenplay and flawlessly depicted Tudor atmosphere of the Court.It falls short of Rome 's success by failing to have a counterpoint to the Royal drama - the scenes of ` Real ' England , the bars and backstreets , are only rarely seen , but could be considered vital to understanding the England of the times . Having some lowly characters in situations of poverty , may well have helped accentuate the drama.Having said that , and despite a few forgivable departures from history , this works well as a refresher on Tudor history , and is a first at seeing Henry VIII in his prime as a real human being.Kudos to Showtime , and I await the next series with bated breath..Extras are modest , but rewarding - a couple of 5 minute featurettes on costume and sets , and a lengthier one with a tour guide taking us round the real Tudor historic sights in London , all moderately interesting . A documentary depicting the real history may have also been a welcome addition , but is lacking.Also included are first episodes on some other Showtime series - a cunning plan , and a welcome one .	1
This series is MUST TV ! Worth it just for the history story , but much more entertaining than most series . The costumes are works of art and the actors are great ! I recommend the entire series !	1
What Showtime 's historical drama The Tudors lacks in historical accuracy , it more than makes up for with it 's wonderful production design and well chosen cast . Jonathan Rhys Meyers stars as King Henry VIII , whose sexual appetites are only matched by his desire for power and to ultimately get his way . The only person in his court that matches his desire for power is his closest advisor , Cardinal Wolsey ( Sam Neill ) , who Henry 's subordinates Brandon ( Henry Cavill ) , Norfolk ( Henry Czerny ) , and George Boleyn ( Nick Dunning ) seek to remove from power . Involved in their plans are Boleyn 's daughters , specifically Anne ( Natalie Dormer ) who catches Henry 's eye and becomes a thorn in the side of Henry 's wife Katherine ( Maria Doyle Kennedy ) . The performances are great , the production is grand , and as a whole , The Tudors is thoroughly entertaining and engrossing . It lacks the epic feel that say , HBO 's Rome , manages to weave ; but the potential here is high for the show to become something special indeed . All in all , if you 're looking for pure historical accuracy , you wo n't find it with The Tudors , but instead you will find an entertaining historical drama that delivers the goods .	1
Love , lust , betrayal , egocentric King ... .good times . This what the Tudors were all about . You know what they say , absolute power absolutly corpus	1
The Tudors great series. , a history lesson embellished with lots of mystery an sex a gore ! Costuming and scenes are amazing .ACTING SUPERB .	1
I wish I learned more about the English monarchy back in the day when I was in school . I may not have been interested back then but I am now . Learning more about these events and a possible storyline , fictional I 'm sure , does make it entertaining . What more can I ask from a TV series ?	1
As a fan of period movies , I could not miss the Season 1 of `` The Tudors '' . Henry VIII , King of England is known to most as a man who broke from the Catholic Church to become Head of the Church of England and marry six women . Such infamy secured him a place in history , but so was the fact that it was his daughter with Anne Boleyn - Queen Elizabeth I , who was one of the most benevolvent rules of her time . In any case , season 1 has four DVDs that will entertain you for almost 12 hours . Perfect time to watch it would be this holiday season . I was suprised that series had so much sex in it but also the twists and turns about historical background for Henry 's decision-making and his pick of the closest advisors on his court is something I wanted to understand better . Writers do get sloppy towards the end of the series and the language is not as sophisticated as one would expect it to be on the Court of one of the greatest kings of his time . I find Jonathan Rhys Meyers to be excellent in his role , but perhaps too young to play a king married for 20 years to Queen Catherine . Maria Kennedy who play Queen Catherine of Aragon , Queen of England is graceful and dignified . Unlike the actress Natalie Dormer portraying Anne Boleyn . Ms. Dormer is too coarse and unsophisticated in her role for a someone ( like Anne Boleyn ) who was witty enought to keep Henry 's interest for so long , speak fluent French after being at the French court for many years . This portrayal of Anne Boleyn is not befitting of a woman who was a mother of one of the most influential queens of the british royal history . Court politics , intrigues and the switch of loyalties will keep your attention . The lessons learned are the ones that apply event o today 's modern times and that is perhaps the one more reason for having this series so popular . I can not wait to see season 2 . Costumes and jewelry are breathtaking .	1
King Henry VIII was a pivotal figure in English and Western history . As the Protestant Reformation sweeps Europe , the great question is whether England will remain Catholic , under the Pope 's authority , or whether the King 's authority shall predominate in England . King Henry VIII settled this matter for all time , at a time when religious authority truly mattered to the conduct of national affairs in Europe.This series is dazzlingly presented , with fine acting and a gripping , if somewhat leisurely , storyline . Jonathan Rhys Meyers turns in a bravo performance as King Henry VIII -- his intensity in the role is vibrant and convincing . Sam Neill , as usual , is particularly fine as English Cardinal Wolsey , the King 's Chancellor and confidant . Along with Meyers he dominates Season One . All of other the key roles are splendidly cast , and the sets are lavish ; this is a beautiful production.Season 1 takes us from Henry 's ascension to the throne , during which he gains confidence in his role of King of England and head of state -- to his love of Anne Boleyn and his rejection of the queen . The viewer sees in action Machiavelli 's admonishment in The Prince that it is deadly to cross a Prince , and dangerous to be his friend.This series is eminently watchable and a great introduction to a critical period in European history . If it takes liberties with history , the discerning viewer will not mind . Highly recommended . RJB .	1
I am enjoying the Tudors very much . Some acting could be improved but overall the action is exciting . It is entertaining .	1
Great cast . Surprisingly substantive and high production quality . Showtime always felt like HBO-Lite to me and this series is a direct competitor to Game of Thrones without the dragons .	1
I did n't know what to expect . But this is hard to stop watching . It 's gripping . And they picked the right actor to play the psycho king . Worth watching .	1
`` The Tudors '' is unlike any television show ever broadcast . The series is wonderfully produced with a huge budget , the acting is worthy of Oscars , and the story , although told before , is presented here fresh and is excitingly original . This 10 episode series dramatizes the life of King Henry VIII of England and his attemmpts to have a male heir for his dynasty as well as the international problems that beset him . The first season details the King 's attempts to divorce his wife , Katherine of Aragon , and his lust for Anne Boleyn . The series is racy with many explicit sex scenes , but what makes `` The Tudors '' work are its strong scripts and the acting by its leads , most notably Jonathan Rhys Meyers who portrays Henry not only as a hungry sexual predator , but a man who loves his country and his people . The series won many Emmy nominations , most notably one for Meyers , for his soaring portrayal . `` The Tudors '' is beautifully produced , with amazing costumes and sets that add to the lustre of the series . In all four seasons worth of episodes will been made with seasons 2 and 3 available on DVD ( season 3 comes out on DVD in early 2010 ) .	1
King Henry VIII to me will always be remembered for having 6 wife 's and beheading two of them . And for being was a religious nut that forced others to think like him or be burned alive .	1
Great opening season into history of Henry VIII . First establishing key members of his court . Introduction of different historical players . Not sure hoe close if follows history but interesting .	1
Not English history , buy very enjoyable.Buy all the seasons -- you wo n't regret it .	1
This is the 6thseason in the shield series . 1st if you have never seen the shield , its a very gritty , raw and dark show . Its a story about a strike team in who pushes the laws beyond the legal limit . If you like cop shows you need ton see this .	1
I reviewed Season 5 in detail but I will tell you that if you like cop shows be prepared for some dirty cops in this one , even though they have a good side also . Vick and his crew go about catching the bad guys with no holds barred and there is no such thing as PC to them . They do , however get the job done where others would probably not . Absolutely the best cop show my wife and I have ever watched .	1
Vic Mackey is one of the most real characters in TV police work . I 'll be sad to see the end of this season and the last one end	1
The hardest part about watching these episodes is knowing that this is the next to the last Season in the series .	1
The Shield is one of the best tv show ever ! It is super intense . This show has a lot of violence , nudity and language so definitely for a mature audience .	1
Like so many series do after a few years , Season 6 starts feeling too much . Granted the whole series is extremely intense but now I 'm starting to be disillusioned with the many character and he episodes are becoming a bit choppy and sometimes meaningless . Still great acting and gritty drama , but it feels like a next to the last season for this series .	1
At the time this show took you by the throat and shook you like a rabid dog . Others have followed now , but this show got people pto pay attention to what the & # 34 ; real & # 34 ; world is like and moved away from cliched , saccharine sweet , happy ending , sycophantic melodrama and brought us , kicking and screaming , into a new age of TV drama.If you havent wanted the series ... . All I can say is batten down the hatches , fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride !	1
A really great show . One of the best cop dramas ever made . Way better than the Sopranoes . All seasons of this show were good . This one was very good . This is a show that always has you wanting more and it comes through . A must buy series !	1
In this season Vic is trying to be as good as he can and not pull his usual crooked methods . The writing is still very good for an adult show . while my wife does not like the show I am enjoying every episode ... ... ..when she is gone .	1
Great job by Michael Chiklis and Walton Goggins . This series was so good , I watched the first four seasons in a short period of time . I am savoring the seasons left and watching them once a week .	1
With Season 6 we find Shane in a conundrum over happenings from Season 5 . To make matters worse , Shane and Vic are at odds.The writing is still tight but the camaraderie between the Strike Team is very , VERY loose . In the end , Vic and Aceveda form an alliance that benefits each other -- for the time being.Even though at this point the series has run the gamut and is heading for an end , it is still 'must see ' viewing . Like a soap opera of life unfolding in front of your face , The Shield and Farmington Division are part of an effort for FX to provide very sharp work to the masses.Great job to those folks who were believers of the network before it had a chance to fold .	1
The Shield : Season Sixwas Shawn Ryan 's real farewell to his ne'er do well Strike Team : when Shane ( Walton Goggins ) puts a grenade in Curtis Lemansky 's ( Kenny Johnson ) lap out of fear he may be an informant , it 's all grisly cliffnotes from thereon out . The demented , righteous and corrupt Lt. Kavanaugh ( played uncomfortably well by Forrest Whitaker ) succeeds with the help of Acevada to put Lemansky in a position that is completely untenable : go to jail and possibly be killed by Antwon Mitchell ( Anthony Anderson ) or flee to Mexico and face the same fate as Vic 's semi mentor , Ben Gilroy.We see Vic 's psyche begin to defenstrate as he can find neither rhyme nor reason to Lemansky 's sudden Salvadoran gang style death , and boy , when Vic 's psyche begins to defenestrate , EVERYONE 'S in trouble . His ability to lie and delude himself to satisfy his own emotions -- in this case , revenge -- is demonstrated to such a terrifying pitch by Michael Chiklis that one can not help but wonder why Ronnie Gardocki ( David Rees Snell ) did n't become his own man in time.Lemansky was the glowing nucleus of the Strike Team , the man with ethics enough to keep Vic and Shane 's putrid souls alive with some measure of joy and balance them out a bit . What is worse than his grisly death , perhaps , is the discovery that another Strike Team member did it . Dutch begins to come into his own as the Team fades , and since it 's now only three people , Claudette gets more leverage.The introduction of Kevin Hiatt onto the team shows what *might have been* if Claudette herself was not corrupt -- since Vic is on the verge of losing his badge , she could have hired him as the head of the Strike Team , but she chooses Vic because of his animalistic street smarts . Never once was this show boring ; never once monotonous ; every episode blisters with meaning , commentaries on the human condition and everything else within a very short time frame , which is why I rank it as superior to the Sopranos and The Wire .	1
I own all seven seasons of the Shield . Season six has good episodes that helped build you up for the final season seven , but does n't give you any clue that things will end the way they do . The series stays fresh even after Season Five which could have ended the series ( which I think was the best besides the First season which got me hooked on this TV show ) I do n't think anyone should just purchase only one season of this series , even though all were good in different ways .	1
Keeps you wanting to see more and more I just finished season 7 was a great series wish there was more .	1
This season is good , but not great . That can be attributed to the fact that there are only 10 episodes for the season . It mostly deals with the fallout from Lem 's death at the end of season 5 . Because season five was also short , only 11 episodes , this season should just be considered a continuation of that.The first couple of episodes wrap up the Jon Kavanaugh storyline . There 's also a new leader for the Strike Team , Kevin Hiatt , the San Marcos Murders , Vic searching for Lem 's killer , Julian is promoted to the Strike Team , Dutch not meshing with Billings , Tina teaming up with Danny , Dutch trying to get with Tina , Shane cutting a deal with the Armenians , and a new bad guy behind the things going on in Farmington.This season was good , and probably would get a 5 , but compared to the first 4 seasons of the Shield , it just was n't in the same class .	1
I gave it this rating because of how this TV series was setup and how it keeps you involved into the series .	1
Caution : Spoilers ahead ( although I personally believe that most of the people who read the reviews on this series are fans , not newcomers ) .The Shield : Season Fivewas a shocker ... while Season One opened with the details of Vic Mackey killing Terry Crowley , there 's an unspoken ethic in this realm of Terry being a `` rat '' ... yes , Vic killed a fellow cop , `` but '' ... ... the same ca n't be said of Shane 's grenade toss and the death of Lem . It was a senseless death , uncalled for ... Lem spent most of the fifth season coughing up blood and drinking Pepto Bismol over the stress caused by his decision to `` take one for the team . `` But in the world of all great Shakespearean tragedies / Greek dramas , it was the necessary catalyst for Shane 's ultimate fate in the final season.In Season Six , we also get Vic 's Stike Team `` replacement , '' Kevin Hyatt . I think we pretty much know coming out of the gate that Hyatt is a weasel ( as is more than abundantly evident from his post-one-night-strand behavior with Paula Garces ' officer Tina Hanlon , but we also see it much earlier in the season ) . We also see the irony of Forest Whitaker 's `` Kavanaugh '' meeting his final downfall for becoming Vic in order to take down Vic , and Wyms ( CCH Pounder ) fall to the same behavior as she lies to Vic upon Hyatt 's entry in order to keep him on board in his final days , believing he has a chance at keeping his job ( he does n't ) . It 's the same behavior , but Kavanaugh falls and Wyms rationalizes her actions . In the final season , Vic has the last laugh ... sort of.In short , virtually every member of the cast makes an ill-conceived , fateful decision in this season , leading up to the Season Seven climax . A lesser show could be accused of manipulative scripting , but when it comes to The Shield ... with the benefit of hindsight ... these were all carefully considered , logical moves.A powerful season no matter how you look at it .	1
Vic is back , baby ! I 'm certainly an unapologetic fan of this show primarily because it 's a study of a well-written , character-driven offering.Avail yourself ( if have n't already ) to this bubbling cauldron of people being people - while not always pretty or flattering - that is fairly `` real . '' Sure , I like Law & Order but it 's a little too tidy and `` TV '' for me sometimes while The Shield is right on the cusp of non-premium Cable edginess . Any Shield fan or crime drama junky will not be disappointed .	1
Season 6 is very intense and full of suspense . This series has been excellent and season 6 is know exception . It gets pretty gruesome with murder and mayhem being the norm . This season is a real love/hate relationship between all the favorite actors in the series because the plot begins to change and becomes thick with evil doings and secrets found out with revenge being the name of the game .	1
I HAVE TO ASK MYSELF CONTINUALLY IS CHIKLIS JUST ABOUT THE BEST ACTOR I HAVE EVER SEEN ? HOW IS IT THAT HE CAN IMBUE A TRULY HEARTLESS CRIMINAL WITH JUST ENOUGH HUMAN QUALITIES TO MAKE ONE KEEP HOPING THINGS WILL GET BETTER FOR HIM ? ALL THE ACTORS ARE REALLY GOOD AND THE SCRIPT 'S TWISTS AND TURNS KEEP THE TENSION BOILING .	1
wow i loved this series it was jammed pack with action . i ca n't believe it is over hopefully they will have another great series like it	1
I have been watching this series for a while now . I always heard good things about it , it is amazing how much corruption is in the series . The end is near and the series goes out with a bang .	1
The Shield is one show with great stories , very good acting . This show is for adults.I recommend this show . The Shield contains violence and sex .	1
I gave this show 5 starts . It keeps you wanting to watch more . I finish watching all 7 seasons in a month . It is addicting .	1
Have enjoyed the unexpected turns that this series takes - very unexpected - which keeps my interest ! Have enjoyed watching it all in order !	1
Alex character in this show is good . I didnt like the lanaguage on the show . But did watch season 6 . Just a like to much violence for me that is why I only gave it 4 stars .	1
I have always marvelled at the writing staff on THE SHIELD.If you 've watched it from Season One til now , you 've had to be amazed at the explosive twists and turns of the ongoing plots swirling around Vic Mackey and his Strike Team . Somehow the writers have never written themselves into a corner -- and I was certain they had in the early seasons ! When this show began , I was in no mood for another cop show . The friend who pushed the Season One DVDs on me assured me that this show as worth checking out . I 've been a fan ever since.I saw Michael Chiklis on `` The O'Reilly Factor '' and Bill O'Reilly brought up the comparison of THE SHIELD with THE SOPRANOS . They 're both critically-acclaimed crime shows about seriously flawed men on different sides of the badge . As much as I 've loved the first three seasons of THE SOPRANOS , they just never got their groove back from Season Four on . People are still griping about that controversial `` cut to black '' finale.But THE SHIELD has hit the high marks every season.Love the cast , love the stories , love the show . ( Make sure you watch it from the beginning though : it 's worth the ride ) .	1
The Shield - wherein it is proven that nothing elevates a TV drama to a place above daytime soaps more than graphic violence , profanity and gore combined with corrupt cops , grotesque pimps , ho 's galore , violent mobsters of all ethnic varieties , rapes and pillage . Throw in a generous bunch of victims and perps , both repulsive and sympathetic , and you get an excellent drama that will satisfy all your voyeuristic needs . Good writing plus good acting plus good production values create a memorable series . If you can imagine Elmore Leonard and James Ellroy collaborating on The Wire and dropping it into the ethnic cauldron of Los Angeles , you 'd get The Shield .	1
I have submitted comments on previous seasons of 'The Shield ' and I continue to recommend this very entertaining and raw TV series ! W.J.Milton	1
It was a shame to see this series come to an end .	1
entertaining , it amazes me how the lie keeps on getting covered and uncovered.not many dull moments in this series and it is good to watch some of my favorite actors in earlier roles .	1
THIS IS A WONDERFUL BOB HOPE COLLECTION , MOVIES THAT ARE FUN.I 'D RECOMMEND FOR ANY AGE GROUP	1
Did women really wear their hair this way in 1966 . That sight alone on two of the lead females was worth the price of admission . The guys , too , while not quite matching the girls in quaintness to 2010 eyes , came in a close second with those shrunken fedoras they sport throughout.Starting with these laughs which were unplanned when the film was made , there are many more in this Bob Hope vehicle , which relies more on old-fashioned slapstick than on the typical Hope gags . While having little more to do than show her body , deliver a few accented lines , and be somewhat manhandled in closeups unsuitable to a stunt double , Elke Sommer still more than earned her pay by just being second banana to Hope . Phyllis Diller , a frequent support player to Hope in his various comedy venues in those years , does her particular thing well . True she was an acquired taste , as they say , but in this film , she does provide some fun . The remainder of the supporting cast do what is required of them to give the star his laughs . Hope , himself , nearing the end of his film career , has better material and , therefore , more laughs than some of the other films he made as it became only a marginal activity to being America 's favorite comic here and abroad . At this time , he had something like one-third of the twenty all time hit shows on TV with his specials devoted to his entertainment of the troops , most recently in Viet Nam , where a bitter struggle was rapidly escalating.So for many good laughs , no irony or wit , no character development , no symbolic meanings , a story line just strong enough to carry the sight and sound gags , I can , still laughing , recommend this as feather-light , totally escape , viewing .	1
This collection contains most of the Hope movies of the 1960s - some of which I saw when released in movie theaters . Unlike his earlier 'Road Shows ' these movies are all in color and some have his side-kick Phyllis Diller . Only a couple are ones I consider sort of funny ( I 'll take Sweden & Boy did I get the Wrong Number ) . I got this collection because my husband is a Bob Hope fan . But , he watches these shows a lot less often than he does his 'Road to -- wherever shows . In fact there are a couple of this collection he has not yet watched .	1
`` Boy , Did I Get a Wrong Number '' is my favorite Bob Hope film . I have loved this movie since I was a child , and now MY kids watch it over and over . Phyllis Diller on a motorcycle is a sight to see ! Just give it a chance ... .it 's a great lighthearted , fun movie that is n't the usual Hollywood `` dirty word and perversion '' fest . There is some mild innuendo going on , but it 's tame compared to what is on modern `` family '' shows these days .	1
I really enjoyed the series with a mix of detective and personal drama with some humor thrown in for a good mix .	1
& # 34 ; NO KA OI & # 34 ; in Hawaiian means & # 34 ; Is the BEST ! ! & # 34 ; Five stars to the writers and the cast .	1
I really love the cast of characters and how they interact . Good actors and interesting stories . Having humor mixed in is great .	1
THE writing on t his show is awesome , great care and skill to keep it authentic and the actors are extremely good.The story line always t interesting..	1
I love The Closer and this DVD set does not disappoint . Great show , great value !	1
Each season gets better and better while developing the characters and the characters ' relationships . Love the show and still enjoy watching it multiple times .	1
This show grows on you and will instantly become one of your favorites . This season is the best by far . The cast is amazing but of course the show is carried by the excellent performance of Kyra Sedgwick . Wow . To see Brenda lee Johnson working over a suspect to get a confession using her skill , creativity and intelligence is television at its best.This is the glue that holds the show together but this 3rd season also brought us more into Brenda 's personal relationship with Fritz and also with her parents . Both are very enjoyable , inventive aspects to add yet even more dimensions to the character that is Brenda Lee Johnson.The subjects are timely and very interesting . All I can say is I watch this show on the edge of my seat and find it to be of the highest caliber compared to other shows out there .	1
I was late to start watching the Closer on tv and no sooner did I find that it is a great show than it was in it 's last season . So I am so glad to be able to buy the season 's I missed . I go through Amazon on my Roku and the whole thing is just great . It 's a good show to watch and Amazon and Roku make it easy to obtain and watch . Before then I was buying dvd 's and they were over running my house .	1
We love & # 34 ; The Closer & # 34 ; . A terrific cast , excellent writing , engrossing procedural . Too bad they through in a little too much & # 34 ; fluff & # 34 ; towards the end of the series ( we do n't think Brenda 's mother and father added anything to the plots ) . But we watch the episodes over and over again .	1
I enjoyed watching this show . It is n't as good as a show like Law & Order : SUV . This show kept my attention . If you like police shows , you will probably enjoy this show .	1
The Closer is one of the best shows on tv . Keira Sedgwick is great , but the entire cast ensemble has wonderful chemistry .	1
Awesome show with great story telling and humor . Really enjoy seeing how each character develops from season to season and conflicts abound in each episode . It is a captivating show .	1
Really enjoyed the closer . Watched this from the start to the finish and enjoyed it completely . The things people get away with ! !	1
She is a hard hitting , get your man at al cost , swaggering female . I like her role and Kyra played it very well . I also liked how the man had to come to respect and revere her because she knew and did her job so well .	1
I very much enjoyed , season 3 and all of the seasons I have watched so far . It is a program worth watching .	1
Once you 've started , you 'll find it hard to stop . Watching these great videos is like a narcotic . You just want to be injected with another one , and another . Then when they are all done you have to go through a withdrawal phase of disappointment that there are n't another 100 to go.Great fun , edge of your seat humor and drama combined . Every actor fits the part perfectly and the bad guys are bad and the dead people are really dead . The star , Kyra Sedgwick , is outstanding and never lets you down .	1
Did n't start watching this show when it originally aired until the middle of Season # 5 . I started watching it from the beginning on Amazon Prime.What an awesome show . Kyra Sedgwick rocks . If you 've never seen it before , it 's worth paying the cost for Amazon Prime , Do n't miss it ! !	1
The series continues with the same format , a crime with a few dead ends and personal lives that continue to grow in different directions . Yet , the series grows on you . Each of the members of her elite homicide squad all detectives face life with laughter , tears , anger , and joy keep you hooked in the LA Police 's back-story - keeping you wanting more .	1
the characters are great , like the story lines , the southern & # 34 ; charm & # 34 ; can be a little much but that 's what it is ... ... ... ... ..	1
One of the best shows ever on tv . It 's not the same without Kyra . I bought all 7 seasons ! The Closer offers pretty much everything !	1
this series deserved all the accolades for it remains reviting season after season with excellent character developmentand many plot variations so one never tires of viewing . Kyra never stops being very much female while being an excellent leader with her team . A very enjoyable series .	1
This was one of my favorite TV shows to watch on TNT on Monday nights . What 's best about The Closer are the characters we all love starting with Brenda Lee Johnson with that Georgia drawl , her flirtatious affair with FBI Fritz Howard and as ever the priority crimes team led by wise cracking senior detectives Flynn and Provinza . ( I miss all those snappy one liners Provinza came up with on the Closer -- -the pair are more serious on the new Major Crimes ... it 's just not the same ) Lt. Tao who is computer savvy and loves all the high tech stuff , Buzz who does all the crime scene video taping and prisoner interrogation 's , Lt. Sanchez who always refers to his fellow officers as & # 34 ; sir & # 34 ; , and the rest of the crew . This was a top notch series , with great acting , well written snappy story lines , and was always very entertaining . I always loved the episodes when Brenda 's parents visited and they always fit in Christmas episodes during the holiday season . Watching the series on instant stream I get to enjoy all the wonderful episodes all over again . I recommend this series to everyone . This was a summer fill in on TNT that turned out to be so successful that I think it really helped TNT launch other high quality weekly TV series .	1
These series are well written with outstanding acting . I like the fact they have been able to hold the cast together , as well . I would recommend them to anyone that likes mystery , drama and police business .	1
I have loved this show from the start . With Prime I am able to go back and review all seasons in case I missed any . Really sorry there are no new seasons .	1
Just keep this series coming . We love it and did n't find it until after 3 were made and the fourth just about out . We fell in love hook line and sinker . Well acted , well written , well produced and ok the cat 's just so darn cute . Keep them funny or make more funny ones . Not as happy with the serious ones though it 's ok now and again just do n't go there too often . Secret they developed a cast that plays off each other as in real people relationships . Works for them and works for the fans . More more more . More kitty too ... .perhaps ... .meow ... .	1
Love this show . Love every character . These are seasons that will be great to watch over and over for fans of the show .	1
The premiss of this show is very close to that of Prime Suspect . I do n't really care because it is a good show . I like the actors and the chemistry between them , even the negative chemistry . Definitely worth watching .	1
I had never seen it from the beginning , so watching alll 7 seasons was a real treat ! ! ! Helped pass all the snowy winters we have in northern Micigan ... .thanks Prime Video	1
Fabulous ! ! Another great season . THe only negative would be that there is n't enough episodes ! ! By the time you are finished watching the last episode you have to wonder how the poor woman survived this season ! ! Ca n't wait until next season !	1
I own all 7 seasons of the Closer and watch and re-watch ( is that a word ? ) them all the time . I bitterly regret that the series only ran for 7 seasons . The Closer is brilliant .	1
I love they way she reels them in and lowers the hammer ! That , mixed with a love for chocolate and a southern acdent .	1
I 'enjoyed the entire series of this show , and thought it would be around ten series before it ended . ' but , I still have hopes that something great will develop when the show puts all the 'main players back into play , and hopefully will show a new vision for the series with even more powerful females in leadership roles .	1
This program illustrates humor in uniform . The interactions of the actors creates a synergy that just works . We certainly enjoy this pergram	1
Love the series and interaction between characters . Want to be entertained with a clean and thoughtful plot line ? Watch The Closer , all series .	1
Fantastic ensamble cast with a wonderful female lead . Stories are character lead which I like . This is a ca n't miss series	1
The Closer Season 3 is 5 stars . I recently found this show and I 'm hooked.. I am however sad the show is over . I love that fact there is comedy and drama . Thank you ... Thank You SO much.. lol	1
I have watched 1 and 2 and now working on 3 it is good and i watchen i want a quick cop show fix	1
I missed this series the first time around , watching one or two episodes.I 'm wading through all the episodes on my Kindle Fire and enjoy the dramatic and , sometimes , comedic plots of this interesting show . The characters are a pleasure to watch and the show was very well produced . And the commercials ... ... do n't miss those at all .	1
I 'm enjoying the series . wish the last two seasons were on & # 34 ; prime & # 34 ; as of now , I 'm watching all the seasons on & # 34 ; prime & # 34 ; for the second time .	1
It is so great to see a headstrong woman following her own personal convictions in order to get the criminal confessions needed to prosecute . I love the way she comes up with ways around things by finding & # 34 ; loop holes & # 34 ; when promising not to prosecute and then has the FBI prosecute instead thereby keeping helr word .	1
I did n't think the series could get any better but this season was better than the first 2 . So much more of the characters and the stories got even better .	1
The third season has a lot of change in store for Brenda Johnson ( Kyra Sedgwick ) . SPOILERSFritz proposes and Brenda has a mysterious ailment that makes her emotions go bananas for awhile . The Third season of `` The Closer '' is among the best to date particularly with the two two part episodes . `` Til Death Do Us Part '' is a complex mystery that does n't provide easy answers for Brenda and her crack Priority Homocide Division . Many of the characters in the show also face change including a possible forced retirement for Lt. Provenza.The set has a nice transfer with solid colors and an anamorphic widescreen transfer . The extras although not overwhelming great are solid but then you really are n't buying this for the extras are you ? We get a good featurette that talks about the art of interrogation where police officers discuss how they often get confessions and how they have to do the exact roleplaying that we see on the show . We also get deleted scenes for a number of episodes as well as a gag reel . Unfortunately there are n't any commentary tracks ( the strong two part episodes would have been perfect for commentary tracks since they are both the most complex and , in the case of `` Next of Kin '' , comedic ( Brenda , Fritz , Provenza and a suspect have to travel cross country to return to L.A. during the Holidays with Brenda 's amusing parents ) .I did run into a glitch with the second disc where the disc was either defective or there was a problem during the transfer where `` frames '' are skipped during an entire 10 minute segment ( although the dialog is fine ) .As with the previous seasons the writing , direction and acting are top notch better than a lot that we see on regular network TV . A great series continues to get better with the third season of `` The Closer '' .	1
I never watched it when it was on TV so I am really enjoying watching all of them now . I really like the main character and how Kyra Sedgwick portrays her .	1
ROOM FOR ONE MORE ( 1952 ) looks amazingly dopey and restrained , even by 1950s standards . Based on the autobiography of George ( Cary Grant ) and Anna Rose ( a dreadful Betsy Drake ) , the philanthropic foster parent poster-people , ROOM seems to drag a bit at 88 minutes ... but it is the children who truly make this film a delight . I 'd never seen this film before and that made it the more interesting to watch.George and Anna Rose fostered several children - though they did not adopt them , preferring to rely on the welfare of the day to help them raise the children . A lot of this film is an interesting but shallow look at the system as it was in the 1950s . One is struck by how seemingly cruel the whole country was back then.Jimmy John Wilson ( a spectacular Clifford Tatum , Jr. , who fell off the radar in 1956 ) , a boy in iron leg braces , steals the show as he recovers and struggles with having a family . The culmination is his shedding of the braces and joining the Boy Scouts . Of course gravel-voiced little Teenie ( the famous little George Winslow ) , a kind of slightly more vocal Buster Keaton type , really steals the scenes . He blurts out something he should n't ; when confronted with all the angry glares , he shrugs and says flatly , `` Shoot me . `` Also impressive was Ben ( a very talented Larry Olsen ) , a warm-hearted average kid with a dry , keen sense of humor . Somehow he manages to slip a hilarious , inoffensive gay joke in his dialogue - you 'll have to watch for it since I refuse to spoil.This an all-around 1950s classic of sorts , but do not look to the sets or even the director for that mark of excellence : it 's all in the kids . This film seems to have inspired lots of other films and TV shows , but I was deeply moved by the lessons it teaches . The orphaned children taken in by the Roses no doubt understood these lessons - and we should learn them since they are just as relevant today .	1
I bought this movie simply because I love old Cary Grant movies . I took a chance and I 'm glad that I did . What a great movie this was and it made me seriously consider becoming a foster parent .	1
This movie is a reminder of what kindness , love , and patience can do for a family and a community . On the surface , It may seem to present a way of solving today 's complex problems in simplistic terms . However , children who have been abandoned by the adults who were supposed to give them a sense of security and unconditional love need someone 's patience , kindness , and love , as well as a sense of fairness or justice , just as much today as when this film was made . Each of the foster parents in this film demonstrated the qualities I mentioned , and then some . Good for them ! And , watching the film reminded me that there is always more we can all do to help lift children above the harsh negatives of this world .	1
I am a huge Cary Grant fan , I thought I 'd seen all of his movies , and today , this gem came to my attention . I sure miss the values , the love and the care for one 's family and neighbors as depicted in this movie . I was born in the 60 's , so I remember scouting , and the morals and values that were taught . I remember friendly neighborhood children , riding bikes and going to the beach.I did n't expect to get choked up watching this , but I did , as well as laugh out loud at times . This story is about a family with a heart for children . They bring two children who are living in orphanages , into their homes . The transformation that love , discipline , and a home can cause on even the most devastated child . How I wish things could go back to the way they were . I know it was n't as idyllic as is shown in movies , but I definitely miss those days . I 'd give this 10 stars if I could !	1
Great show ! ! If you love science and mayhem on a weekly basis this is the show for you there is also a dose of comedy in it for ya as well .	1
I have enjoyed Eureka thoroughly . They have a great cast of characters , it is humorous at times , awesome at others . I think its well done , and I am not a big fan of syfy . You should watch it , you 'll enjoy it . Nice break from the usual TV fare ! !	1
Eureka is a great series that , since its in a area 51setting , anything can and does happen .	1
If you enjoy a good deal of comedy with your SciFi you will probably enjoy Eureka . There certainly are plenty of serious events , but with a regular mix of comedy to keep things from getting to dark . Kind of like the X-Files which had plenty of serious episodes but then were visited by unusual people including `` The Lone Gunmen '' to keep things in perspective . The second season is a must have for anyone that bought the first . This season continues the investigation of the alien artifact along with the further emersion of Sheriff Jack Carter and Zoe into Eureka 's community.Many of the budding relationships have now fizzled and new ones have began that may seem less odd or more depending on your perspective . This is not high brow SciFi for the most part although some of the ideas are based on conceivable research . Eureka is a town of Mensa types that have their own projects and inventions that they develop . It seems they are n't under the same rules as the rest the country so anything can happen when their experiaments go wrong . Good quality DVDs and excellent replayability , but I 'm still not crazy about cardboard fold up cover .	1
Totally enjoyed Season 2 . The DVD shipped fast however , one of the disks was loose and has signs of some rubbing during shipment . The DVD played fine with no glitches so all is good .	1
`` Eureka - Season Two '' picks up right where the first season left off , and the events of the previous season color the story and plot lines . The characters have also better settled into their parts in this season , making the interactions much more enjoyable . The acting , writing , and special effects are very good ( perhaps even better than the first season ) .This is a smart and funny series that we watch with the entire family . Highly Recommended !	1
This series was very well done on all levels . It was excellent escapism entertainment in that I could always depend on the story line to be happily resolved . Everyone of the characters were believable , and mostly likeable . There is no crime to having a formula that leaves the audience wanting more . The writers did a good job , the actors did a good job , the content was interesting , and the plot was fun .	1
It 's nice te see a series thats fun to watch some of the things re far fetched but that 's the fun parts	1
One of the best shows on cable . Not only was it funny but in a way educational as well . Too bad SYFY canceled it .	1
Eureka is a fun series and this is before everything gets complicated . Enjoy these early episodes and recognize the hints and subtle plot develop lines .	1
Apparently the little genius town of Eureka has n't quite run out of disasters yet , even with the destruction of the Artifact.In fact , Eureka 's problems get worse as the show 's writing becomes better , starting with the citizens bursting into flame . The second season of `` Eureka '' is more confident and well-balanced than the previous one , and it takes the characters , quirky humor and tight writing into brand-new territory . Including Carter walking around naked.The timeline has been restored , and Carter ( Colin Ferguson ) and Henry ( Joe Morton ) are trying to adjust to their past lives . Carter also is convinced that the future will unfold just as it did in the other timeline.But during a solar flare viewing , a guy violently combusts -- and soon other people start combusting . Carter searches for a link between the victims , and finds that someone near him may be next . Meanwhile , the Pentagon decides to remove Nathan Stark ( Ed Quinn ) from Global Dynamics ' big chair , and replace him with his estranged wife Allison ( Salli Richardson-Whitfield ) . My , that 's awkward.Other problems pop up over the season -- shared dreams , personal forcefields , `` ice funnels of death , '' falling debris clouds attracted to the GD headquarters , invisibility projects , Fargo 's frozen grandpa , Biblical plagues , Carter becoming unnaturally attractive to all women , and an attempt to recreate the Big Bang that apparently turns everyone ( except Carter ) into driveling idiots.But while the Artifact has been effectively destroyed , its presence is still felt -- Allison 's autistic son Kevin has formed a strange connection to it . And when a brilliant scientist creates a deadly alchemical bacterium -- which turns all iron into gold , then rust -- it may lead to a showdown over Kevin 's future ... .There 's a darker current running through the second season of `` Eureka '' -- Henry is more subdued and haunted , and a little boy 's life is in danger . But do n't worry , because thankfully the writers do n't switch too far into the dark zone -- the focus is always first and foremost on our Everyman Sheriff , and how he tries to deal with the Horrific Crisis of the day.In fact , the second season flows very easily , with a more relaxed pace and a colourful , diverse array of science-based problems -- including robot geese . There 's lots of great dialogue ( `` Jo made it seem like the sky is falling . '' `` That has n't happened since 2004 , and that was more of an igniting of the ionosphere '' ) and hilarious comedic moments , such as Carter 's naked public shower and the shared Zorro fantasy . But there are some sweet moments too , such as Fargo 's grandfather coming to terms with the life he missed out on.I was n't too impressed by Ferguson in `` Eureka 's '' debut season , but he really gets to blossom in this one -- he 's quirkier , cuter and has a knack for physical comedy . He fits in better with the Eurekans . And he brings a lot of life to Jack 's problems , whether it 's the weird stuff , or the more realistic threat of his ex-wife taking his daughter out of Eureka.Quinn and Richardson Whitfield also do well , as Allison and Nathan try to adjust to their new positions , as well as some renewed sparks . And the other characters get rounding out -- Jo gets in touch with her inner girly-girl , Zoe clashes with some genius `` mean girls , '' Taggart has a maternal experience , and Fargo gets in touch with some family members . Also has to deal with the possibility of dying.Of particular note : Morton brings a feeling of dark pathos into many of Henry 's appearances , reminding us what he 's lost and leaving us wondering what he 's planning . And it 's worth noting that a trio of `` Stargate SG-1 '' actors make some very solid guest appearances -- particularly Michael Shanks as an embittered , myth-obsessed scientist.The second season of `` Eureka '' sticks to the humorous sci-fi angle , but expands the characters -- as well as some of the darker subplots . Definitely a great little series , and promises to stay fun and suspenseful .	1
Although this season of Eureka did not have a particularly strong story arc that carried throughout ( the questions of `` the artifact '' are never answered in a satisfactory manner ) , it really does n't matter . The show is just so much fun to watch ! It 's the strength of the characters that makes it shine- Sheriff Carter , Deputy Lupo , Fargo , Zoe , Alison , Stark , and of course , Henry Deacon . It 's a delight to see the chemistry that occurs between all these well written characters , as they attempt to save the town of Eureka from a new crisis each episode . Sure , it 's pretty formulaic , but that 's part of what makes it so good ... it 's familiar , and comforting , and the formula just plain WORKS.Unfortunately , the resolution on this DVD is not very good ( it 's old technology , after all ) , and it 's not available on Blu-ray . But if you can stream it from Netflix in HD , it looks fantastic .	1
It took me a couple of shows to get interested in this series but I plan to watch more seasons . It is amusing at times with some sci-fi thrown in . Everything you think can go wrong in this town does but the Sheriff takes care of it , usually by the end of the show .	1
Eureka has outstanding actors cast perfectly in their roles , and what great roles . The situations the script has them in have me laughing out loud ! I find myself eagerly forwarding to the next act !	1
If you liked or did n't like & # 34 ; Eureka & # 34 ; , I 'm not going to review it , you already know what you liked about it . I enjoyed the whole series . I have a couple of favorite episodes from Season 2 . I like having the disks . Cable and internet service goes out from time to time , so it 's nice to pop in the dvds and watch on my Sony portable . I was glad they ditched the funky potato foam of the 1st season package . This one holds the dvds correctly in place . The box is not going to fill up the landfill , it 's going to remain with me for a long time to come , and then it will become a collectible , right ?	1
I like this show because it is entertaining without relying on large amounts of sex and violence . This season builds on the first with an expaninding multiple plot lines .	1
I had never heard of this show until I signed up for Amazon Prime and started watching it on Prime instant video . I fell in love with the show and the characters . I am really very sad that they have cancelled it . I could watch it for hours every day and never get tired of it . It seems like every show I ever find that is an interesting quality show they have to cancel I 'm sure there are a lot more sci-fi fans out there that are upset about this . Here 's wishing they would bring it back ! !	1
This season is a great follow up to season one . The show continues to be fun and engaging . I have been mini marathon viewing 2-3 episodes a day and have not gotten tired of it yet .	1
Although I would call myself a sci-fi buff I truly enjoy a show that challenges our mindset . Years ago ( probably 58 yrs . ) a comic strip had a detective-Dick Tracy- with a wrist watch that was also a camera and a communication device . I have lived long enough to see something similar to it come to life . Long before the first spaceship went into orbit Flash Gordon another comic hero was circling the distant planets in a spaceship . Sci-Fi for many is boring for me I enjoy seeing the imagination of men/women become reality .	1
My husband watches this he likes it . I am not into science fiction so I do n't really like it it 's fast moving	1
Eureka is the best show on television . I buy each season to have and watch whenever I like . The storylines and the actors are first rate .	1
Funny , different , find it ironic that the . O brain new sheriff is the hero in each episode . A little hokey , but fun	1
Eureka gets even better in it 's second season , we get more of the fargo character and the stark character is still around . He goes in the third season and his presence is missed by many . The show remained true to it 's premise and it still does , with lots of crazy science related disasters affecting people with usually sheriff Carter 's quick thinking to get them out of the mess in some form or another . Eureka is so engaging because it 's a great place , filled with great characters and it 's the kind of place that one would hope does exist somewhere in some form . The dvd 's have deleted scenes and other features too . The picture quality is excellent and the series comes in a good case as far as I can tell . This is a good family scifi show that can appeal to anyone who likes a great tv show . the only downside is that scy fy had n't yet figured out that they should make more than 13 eps a season with this one . ( wharehouse 13 too ) . If it 's your biggest hit then give us more of it ! which thankfully they do in season 3 and four of eureka ! But the show is endearing and fun and is worth watching with someone you like because they 'll like this show too .	1
You ca n't go wrong on this series . It is truly excellent . It has been a long time since a new Sci-fi as fantastic as this one and one which has not been dumbed down for a change . This is a technology buffs dream come true . Plus it is a clean , wholesome program for the entire family . It never fails to engage your attention and teach you something new using technologies so advanced , it is new to all of us . Every episode has been wonderful . The interaction between the cast members has been magic . Congrats to the person who selected the cast.It was a stroke of genius to start their new series in July each year . Eureka was the only game in town as far as new TV programs at that time of year . Seems none of the other Cable channels have caught onto the fact that we also watch TV in the summer.We are happy to see Henry back to normal . The writers had almost ruined his character between the dark moody scripts and changing hairdo 's . Henry is one of their main characters whether they like it or not . His many talents make him a multifaceted character which never fails to surprise us.Oddly , I thought I never liked the character of Stark until they killed him off last Tuesday in a real tear-jerker ending . Now the show seems empty without his egocentric abilities . A key necessity in such a lab of high tech covert projects . I liked it better with him in it . They need to bring him back ... perhaps by finding out that he was thrown into the future rather than deleted.I know shows will get rid of expensive actors and trade them for a couple lesser actors ... . but the trade-off of Stark for Thorne and the new sister of the Sheriff are not even close to the same caliper as Stark and neither adds anything to the series . The new additions are just excess baggage . It would be no loss if they both disappeared.As far as Thorne 's trimming of the employees role ... The gov't has never cared about how much tax money they waste..and they do n't usually lay off their black project scientists ... so her coming in and acting like it is a private corporation needing to be slimmed down makes no sense.Not to mention why the Sheriff 's sister would be allowed to be in a closed town filled with black project employees and scientists who use classified products out in the open.This looks like an early attempt to cut costs . In the corporate world , you 're allowed to show a loss on your taxes for 3 years . After that , they lose the tax breaks so most new companies will start trimming employees between year 2 & 3 and will usually pick their highest salaried employees to cut and try to replace them with someone cheaper ... unfortunately , they usually end up with someone who ca n't do the job ... which is why they are cheaper to hire.They need to let the viewers decide on major cast and plot changes ... not some pitbull exec in the network sales dept ... like the ones who canceled Star Trek and Outer Limits.Let 's hope some idiot in charge does n't cancel or ruin the spirit of Eureka like they have managed to do in the past to every decent show . Especially those programs which are over the heads of those cable network goons . They need to remember that most viewers are not on Nielson and they are not getting accurate ratings from them . They should also be careful about allowing a sponsor to ruin the program with too much interference ... and Degree is coming close to that point in just a few episodes this yearBut so far , Eureka is still a one-of-a-kind program which never fails to entertain and bring delight to the viewers .	1
Watched all 5 seasons in about a month or so ... whenever we were both home and able ... it was super fun , quirky and just a good time . SOOOO sad to have it end but there were a lot of time travel , worm hole situations so I can bet it was getting challenging to keep it fresh ! GREAT show !	1
Season 2 of Eureka was just as good as Season 1 . The writing was tighter , the acting was smooth . There were a lot more one off plot driven shows rather than multi-episode story arcs but very enjoyable . I highly recommend the entire run and Season two is a fine addition to both your collection and the show .	1
I enjoy the fanciful science and the character interactions . The actors are good and the stories are just plain fun . They are the kind of shows I like to watch more than once .	1
We watch Eureka over and over and over . One of the best shows for us to fall asleep to while watching on the iPad . Just enough comedy and science to make it funny and not all the heavy drama that most Sy-Fy shows want to include . Never understood how this show would be cancelled and Warehouse 13 'replaced ' it ... no comparison . Oh well..guess that 's enough words for now .	1
my husband and I really have been enjoying this show just found out about it from our grandkids and have had fun watching it	1
EACH STORY IS GOOD TO WATCH . IT WILL KEEP YOU LAUGHING . AS WELL AS TRYING TO FIGURE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT .	1
I love this show ! I ca n't wait to get to the next episode to see what they come up with next .	1
Love the writing for this show and the ideas they present . A must see ! ! Definitely add to your watch list now .	1
I liked the first season of EUREKA , but frankly found a lot of the stories a tad flat and not especially gripping . But the storytelling was much stronger in Season Two and the interrelations between the main characters much more involving . In just about every way , the show improved in its second season.I like also that some of the characters who were not especially important in Season One got fleshed out in Season Two . It was especially good to see Zoe finally get involved in the story in a way other than being just a pest or a pain , as she was in Season One . And late in the season Ever Carradine joined the cast as Sheriff Carter 's sister , a really nice addition to the cast . But none of this was as important as the greatly improved writing . Although the show continued to be a tad too episodic for me taste , many of the standalone episodes were more interesting than what you usually find in a show of this type . Several of the stories were pretty original and even the ones that were somewhat derivative managed some unique touches . In nearly every way the show managed to cohere in improve . Basically , it just got more and more entertaining .	1
A light-hearted look at a possible future with lots phony physics and graphic effects . Well , we knew that in season one and still look forward to each episode , playing one a night in our viewing program .	1
I like they way they introduce different technologies into the show . The characters are believable , although the script writing is weak sometimes . Overall , if you like science fiction based on cool technologies , you should enjoy this show . My teenagers and I like to watch it .	1
The unique story line continues in season 2 . Jack Carter keep things in perspective by layman standard as usual . A perfect straight man in town full of mad scientists ... I loved it .	1
I like this show , Sheriff Jack is super handsome . The story is cute . I wish there were more seasons of this show because it is super addicting . It is n't too stuffy like a lot of sci fi shows . It is set in our time I like that too .	1
I really like this series . everyone works well together . if you like comedy with some drama thrown in , you 'll love this .	1
Good characters but slim on story . I like the angelic presence , but wish the show was just a bit more broad in it 's spiritual references .	1
It took me a while to get into Saving Grace , but by the end of the 3rd Season , I was sorry to see it end . I watched it on Amazon Prime , and it was well worth my time and efford .	1
Life is complicated . This story line is clever and serves that truth well.I like the idea that Angels can be like ordinary , overworked people.The character Holly Hunter portrays is & # 34 ; Grace & # 34 ; itself . She is her own worst enemy , drinking and sleeping with various people , yet committing her precious time on earth to bringing justice to , and for those who have been wronged.In spite of her endless rotations of addiction to work , sex and alcoholic drink , she makes deep commitments to her detective team , so they may help serve justice to victims of life and circumstance.Then along comes an Ordinary Angel that attempts to open the window to Grace 's soul . The question becomes ; will Grace respond to the bumbling ways of the Angel and find a way to save herself ? Cool ideas !	1
Series Creator : `` Nancy Miller '' penned a nice semi-hard hitting TV version of a La Femme Nikita with severely rough edges Oaklahoma Police Dept . Detective that has fallen under the watchful graces of an Angel assigned to provide the Detective with a second chance at redemption for all of the dimwitted , narrow-minded , self destructive decisions she 's made.Nicely done , almost different and indifferent to the usual Playmate Bunny types depicted in commercial Television dramas , petite `` Holly Hunter '' manages to drive this series forward with a Napolean complex hellbent on rough-housing anything , and anyone that gets in her way . While the themes are adult oriented , the nature and style is more akin to the whimsy of teenage boys -- with enough preadulescent attraction for Tomboy girls -- to offset oncoming hormonal desires , which makes `` SAVING GRACE '' highly entertaining viewing for the youth of my soul ... GBJ	1
One of the best new series to come along , within the realm of & # 34 ; The X-Files & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; House & # 34 ; - and , unfortunately , this show ended all too soon .	1
Too bad it was cancelled ... it is raw in your face , sometimes brutal , dark but also funny ! Holly Hunter is a gas .	1
A REALLY FUN SHOW , EVERYONE SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY , CANT'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON	1
This is an enjoyable Psych episode that pretty much follows the show 's normal format of flashbacks and improbable coincidental occurrences , and it works well . We like Psych and tend to watch the older episodes on Netflix over theRoku 2 XS 1080p Streaming Player , but this episode would n't stream so we bought it on Amazon since it was the next in the series.No spoilers from me : This is a Christmas themed episode that has Gus and Shawn going to Christmas dinner at Gus ' parents house where Shawn tries to impress Mr. and Mrs. Guster , but things do n't go too well when a neighbor is found murdered.Sometimes the acting is a little over the top and often boarders on downright silly , but it is a very clever and fun show.Highly Recommended ! CFH	1
The item was just as described . Also , I really enjoyed watching the DVD 's -- I would recommend that everyone buy a copy of Psych Second Season !	1
Never get tired of Psych . I want all seasons .	1
Without a doubt , Shawn Spencer is the public 's favorite fake fictional psychic detective . Of course as far as I know , he 's also the only one.But that does n't stop the second season of `` Psych '' from being a rollicking good time , full of crazy schemes and baffling murder mysteries . James Roday and Dul & eacute ; Hill actually become even more entertaining , with less slapstick and more of a reliance on eccentric plot twists , pop culture references , and crimes that get ever weirder.Shawn ( Roday ) and Gus ( Hill ) get swamped by reality pop culture when American Duos comes to Santa Barbara . The cruel British judge Nigel St. Nigel ( Tim Curry ) hires them to protect him , because he thinks that someone is trying to kill him.A live wire and a poisoned sandwich later , Shawn agrees -- especially when a drugged-out female judge almost dies . But out of all the people who loathe Nigel , which one tried to kill him ? Then the police suspect that Shawn has lost his touch when he announces that someone was killed by a dinosaur , and is confronted by a sexy FTD psychic.But that is n't the last or least of Sean and Gus 's problems -- a chop shop with secrets , bounty hunters , Gus 's parents accused of Yuletide murder , jockey deaths and fixed races , nanny-related robberies , electrocutions on the catwalk , and going undercover at a telenovela , a school for the gifted , and a retirement community . They even have a run-in with a wealthy , crazy woman that Gus drunkenly married on spring break years ago ... and it turns out her new fiancee is a bit shady.Finally , Shawn and Gus are pursuing one of their weirdest cases ever . First a security guard is suspected of stealing a 3000-year-old mummy -- but then it appears that the mummy actually murdered the guard . Can Shawn figure out what is going on -- with the mummy murder , the police chief , and his oddly-behaving father ? Although it did n't break much new ground , the first season of `` Psych '' was very fresh and entertaining TV . Fortunately creator Steve Franks is sticking to the old adage : `` If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , '' and the second season does n't deviate from what works -- there 's still lots of comedy , spoofery , silly dialogue ( `` It 's spontaneous psychic krav maga ! '' ) and enjoyable mysteries.The first episode kicks things off a bit weakly , since the `` American Idol '' joke gets stretched out too far . Fortunately the mysteries after that get much more solid , deftly juggling even the funny-sounding plot twists ( strangulation by mummy bandage ? Refrigeration trucks ? ) . You even get an endless parade of pop culture references , from Michael Jackson to `` Shaun of the Dead , '' James Bond to wikipedia.com . Got ta love that.But the best aspect of `` Psych '' continues to be its kooky dialogue . Usually Shawn provides it ( `` I hunger for the meatballs the way a jackal salivates for an injured possum '' ) , but other characters get to as well ( `` Hola . Me llamo Inspector Carlton Lassiter . Me gusta queso '' ) .Shawn and Gus remain an entertaining pair of twentysomething everymen , with Roday continuing to be eccentric , lovably charming and kooky -- although Shawn gets quite a shock in the cliffhanger ending . And Hill gets more attention , with Gus pursuing models and faking psychic powers . We even discover a secret past involving sweater vests , spring break , and a drunken wedding -- lots of fun.And the supporting cast remains solid -- Corbin Bernsen gets to participate in a couple of the cases as Shawn 's hard-nosed dad , sometimes in loud tropical shirts . Timothy Omundson continues to be entertaining as harder-nosed cop Lassiter . And Maggie Lawson rounds off the cast as the `` enigma wrapped in a little blonde riddle '' who is Shawn 's love interest , as well as a counterpoint to Lassiter.The second season of `` Psych '' continues the eccentric crimes and equally odd crimesolvers , mingling comedy and mystery with only a couple weak spots . Sweet black licorice !	1
`` Psych '' is a hilarious show , and the second season improves upon the wonderful formula established in its first effort . Once again , this show is all about character , and the chemistry that exists between series stars Shawn and Gus is second to none , on any network or any show . It 's a delight to watch these lifelong friends engage in their wildly inappropriate adventures as they attempt to solve mysteries that they really have no business getting involved in ( not to mention the hilarious flashbacks to their childhood ) . Lassiter , O'Hara , and `` Dad '' all continue to shine , rounding out the wonderful cast of characters who each complement the show perfectly . Though every episode of these season is fun to watch , a couple of standouts for me were `` Gus ' Dad May Have Killed an Old Guy '' and `` 65 Million Years Off '' ( in which Shawn accuses a T-Rex of murder ! ) .	1
This season of Psych is great , the duo of Shawn and Gus are even funnier and have to solve even funnier cases . The character development between Shawn and Juliet is also furthered.I would definitely recommend this season to anyone looking for a good laugh .	1
The season starts out with possible the best of the Psych episodes - American Duos . Tim Curry is brilliant , of course . 65 Million Years off , Bounty Hunters ! ( Kevin Sorbo ! ) , Lights , Cameras ... Homicido and Shawn ( and Gus ) of the Dead.And There 's Something about Mira has the best line ever `` I should have been that goat ! `` The Chief takes on a larger role - and well played.Gus and Shawn continue to be their solid selves.My only minor complaints are Black and Tan : A Crime of Fashion '' - Shawn is n't good looking enough to be a model , but Gus is ? Really ? Also , the set up for the appearance of the mother . Could have lived without that	1
For the second season of this wonderful mystery/comedy show , the producers wisely left things pretty much alone . Shawn Spenser ( James Roday ) comes from a long line of cops . But he rebelled against his father 's ( Corbin Bernsen ) wishes and did n't become a cop . Instead , he pretends to be a psychic , using his finely honed observation skills to get the information for his `` visions . '' He 's even opened Psych , a psychic detective agency with best friend Burton `` Gus '' Guster ( Dule Hill ) . And he has an impressive track record , much to the dismay of Detective Lassiter ( Timothy Omundsun ) . Rounding out the cast are Santa Barbara Detective Juliet O'Hara ( Maggie Lawson ) and Interim Chief of Police Karen Vick ( Kirsten Nelson ) .And what a collection of cases they have this year , too . Shawn and Gus join the TV sensation American Duos to find out who is trying to kill the head judge ( played by Tim Curry ) . They become models to find out who killed both partners of a fashion house . Shawn must clear Gus ' parents of murdering the neighborhood crank . When Gus ' uncle ( guest star John Amos ) comes for a visit , Shawn and Gus have to switch places , without the police figuring out that both of them are faking it . Equally complicated is a case where a real psychic is brought in and Shawn must keep his secret from her . Shawn puts his credibility on the line by claiming one victim was killed by a dinosaur . And in the season finale , Shawn pins the crime on a mummy.This show has real come together and is firing on all pistons now . The mysteries are tight and confusing . I might piece things together a little before Shawn , but not by much . And it does n't matter because the entire fun is getting to the end . The over the top physical humor has been toned down this year ( and that 's a good thing ) , but there is still plenty of laughs . You 've got cultural references spewed in mile a minute dialogue by Shawn and Gus , comedy from the character 's relationships , comedy from the situations , and some physical humor . I ca n't stop myself from laughing out loud while I watch this show . And the cast does a great job holding it all together . They bring high energy to each episode , but they keep it real.If you have missed this show , you have definitely missed out . Do n't let another day go by without becoming a fan .	1
this is a fun intro to these two crazy guys . they are so silly and loveable . the characters are fun and well developed .	1
I had just finished seeing the episode of Monk when they had just gave the announcement that this show was coming up next , I had never seen the show before and decided to give it a try and now I am grateful to have made that choice . The two characters Shawn Spencer ( James Roday ) the thirty-something son of a police officer who while having a photographic memory was taught by his father to remember immaculate minute details , and Shawn 's best friend the more down-to-earth and responsible Burton 'Gus ' Guster ( Dul & eacute ; Hill ) decide after a misadventure with a crime and helping to solve it to open their own detective agency ( Actually more of Shawn 's idea ) . The main gimmick is that Shawn uses his incredible deductive abilities as a somewhat scam pretending to actually be a psychic solving cases . Whether or not the police believe him to be psychic his high solve rate lands him a position with the police department as their resident psychic . The series is vastly hilarious and seeing some of the scenes that the two main actors do is amazing , the most memorable for me from the first season is the season one episode finale Scary Sherry : Bianca 's Toast believe me you 'll laugh insanely seeing their antics on this episode . The show also has four other main cast to the show but of course you 'll most of the time will try and keep up with Shawn and Gus . The extras are also nice you have the gag reels , commentaries from the cast and producers , some deleted scenes , and see some adventures of Shawn and Gus when they were kids . The video is widescreen and for the most part clear and sharp there are a few scenes where there is some graininess but those are mostly scenic scenes and not when the actors are in the shots . So if you 're looking for a change of pace from shows like C.S.I or NCIS here 's a more comedic look at the crime solving efforts of are two favorite private psychic detectives ...	1
It is great . Over and over again , I can watch these and I do . It is always a fun time .	1
Monk was a very good show . I have enjoyed all of the seasons and this was just as good as the rest . Very well done .	1
It must be admitted that the fifth season of `` Monk '' had some rough patches , where Monk 's OCD was overwritten and the plots got a bit limp.But the obsessive compulsive detective is still going , and fortunately `` Monk '' is still one of the best shows on television . And the sixth season continues `` Monk 's '' grand tradition -- solidly-written mystifying stories , quirky detecting , and some excellent acting from Tony Shalhoub . Even better , the two-part finale really shows `` Monk '' off at its absolute best.As the season opens , Monk ( Tony Shalhoub ) finds that his obsessed groupie Marcy Maven ( Sarah Silverman ) needs to hire him , despite a restraining order . So she `` buys '' him at a bachelor auction and makes him work on a bizarre case -- her dog is being accused of killing someone , but the dog died before the murder took place . Needless to say , there 's more than meets the eye.Among the other cases the OCD detective has to deal with : a framed rapper , murder on a nudist beach , an investigation overlapping with Julie 's love life , stolen safety-deposit boxes , treasure maps , a daredevil who might be his archnemesis , insomnia , going undercover in a cult , a newfound painting hobby , and a shot Santa . He even has to investigate Stottlemeyer 's ( Ted Levine ) girlfriend.But the story takes a darker turn toward the end of the season . Monk finds a lead for the `` six-fingered man '' who killed Trudy , and confronts him ... and after a struggle , the six-fingered man is dead . A rural sheriff arrests Monk , but Monk insists that he 's innocent -- and he 's determined to find out who is framing him . But with the police after him and a conspiracy in motion , can he solve the murder before he 's caught ? `` Monk '' had a bit of a rough patch in the fifth season -- some of the episodes simply did n't gel , and Monk 's OCD was written strangely . Fortunately `` Monk - Season Six '' goes back to what makes the series more enjoyable -- a couple of episodes do n't work , like the rapper and the creepy little cult , but these are overshadowed by the better mysteries.Nope , most of the sixth season is a string of solid murder mysteries -- lots of baffling crimes , obscure clues , and new eccentricities for Monk . Despite all the murder and bittersweet moments , the episodes are peppered with some comedy as well , such as the slow demolition of Stottlemeyer 's brand-new car . And there 's still plenty of bittersweet ( `` I 'm going to be buried next to Trudy . I ca n't wait '' ) and/or hilarious dialogue ( `` She had the oldest profession . '' `` Stonemason , huh ? `` ) .And the last two episodes of the sixth season are among the best the series has ever produced . A seemingly straightforward crime story blossoms into a heartrending , suspenseful , dramatic , and genuinely unpredictable story , and gives us a few more clues about Trudy 's death.Tony Shalhoub is lovably oddballish as Adrian Monk , never turning his tragicomic character into a cartoon -- you just want to hug Monk and give him some perfectly symmetrical cookies . Traylor Howard does a solid job as Monk 's assistant , and Levine gets to show Stottlemeyer 's warmer , laid-back sides , while Jason Gray-Stanford is consistently fun as the puppy-eager Randy Disher -- even getting to sing a Johnny-Cash-style song about Monk 's apparent demise.The sixth season of `` Monk '' has a couple rough patches , but soars up to brilliant heights near the end . And the obsessive-compulsive detective still seems to have quite a bit of work ahead ...	1
This has been one of the funnier seasons I think . The stories are quite good , a notch up from Season 5 I felt . Overall the writing here feels as solid as Monk 's ever been . Some of the episodes are a little far-fetched ( Monk on the Lam ? ) , but what they may lack in beleivability , they surely make up for in creativity and comic value which serve as a nice added bonus to Monk 's tweaked out heroics . Some funny episodes , my favorites probably being `` Mr Monk and His Biggest Fan '' which starts the season off with a bang , `` Mr Monk and the Naked Man '' where Monk confronts his taboos about nudity at a nude beach ( this episode was almost deep ) , `` Mr Monk Joins a Cult '' ( kind of silly but I liked the bizarreness of the whole scenario ) , and `` Mr Monk Paints His Masterpiece '' in which Monk 's new hobby starts earning him good money ! I ca n't think of any episodes that I did n't much like . This was a good season .	1
Between Natalie 's driving skills , the special appearance by Norman Bates , and confusion and mayhem between the Julies at the end - Wow . HILARIOUS ! ! ! ! If you 're a fan of Adrian Monk and you 've never seen this episode and you want to laugh - this is THE episode to watch .	1
We see a lot of character development here as the series stretches and the story lines are still good . Quite worth your hard earned cash .	1
Why mess with success ? That seems to be the idea behind this season of Monk . And while it was n't as strong as some of the other seasons have been , it was certain still fun.The season opens with Sarah Silverman reprising her role as Monk 's biggest fan . She hires Monk ( Tony Shalhoub ) to find out who is framing her dog for murder . The catch ? The dog died before the murder took place.And there is more fun to be had . Monk suspects Captain Stottlemeyer 's ( Ted Levine ) new girlfriend of murder . Natalie 's ( Traylor Howard ) daughter Julie ( Emmy Clarke ) gets her first boyfriend and learns to drive . Monk takes a job as a security guard at his bank to catch a robber . And he must deal with the consequences of shooting Santa . And he falls under the spell of cult leader Howie Mandel.When I reviewed season five , I did mention that they were occasionally crossing the line from character to caricature . That seemed to be more of a problem here in my eyes . In fact , there were several in a row near the beginning that seemed to be forced for laughs . The episodes dealing with the nude beach and the rapper were painful instead of funny . And some of the others had a been there , done that feel to them.On the other hand , there are still so many good moments . This is especially true of the two part season finale which advances the Trudy storyline when Monk is accused of murdering the six fingered man.And I ca n't fault the acting . All four leads ( including Jason Gray-Stanford and Lt. Disher ) continue to do great jobs bringing their characters to life . I was disappointed that we only got to see Julie a couple times . And it is sad watching this knowing that we wo n't get to see the late Stanley Kamel any more as the excellent Dr. Kroger.Monk may be showing its age . But it is still fun and entertaining . Fans will welcome the newest season into their homes .	1
I have been a big fan of Monk since its first season . It just keeps getting better .	1
I 'm a monk-a-holic for sure . I watch episode after episods and I get sad when I 'm coming to the end of the season.I prefer Julie to the other assistant .	1
Monk 's 6th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons . Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders , with the help of his devoted Assistant , Natalie . Throughout this season , Monk must deal with his crazed fan , help a rapper , teaches Julie Teeger about love , hang out with his psychiatrist 's son , shoots Santa Claus , joins a cult , becomes a fugitive , and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy . I highly recommend MONK : SEASON SIX ! ! !	1
Season six was another good season for Monk . The two hour finale had me excited . Monk is hilarious and Natalie is still keep things together.This is a must-see season !	1
What happened was this ... ..spoilers ahead ... ... .Mr. Monk tore through the sixth season with stronger emotions , even beating up a guy who had something to do with Trudy 's death . Dale the Whale returned to try to torment Monk , who had to fake his own death for a while . Also , Julie Teeger got more screen time as she blossomed into a teenager , while Randy Disher was given more attention as well . The captain continues to maintain a strong presence on the show , and so does Natalie . Dr. Kroger holds his own.I missed Monk 's brother Ambrose , though .	1
Sherlock Holmes , Columbo , Hercule Poirot -- genius detectives are usually a bit quirky . But no other is as quirky as Adrian Monk , the obsessive-compulsive detective -- and `` Monk : Complete Series `` compiles every episode of this funny , likable little mystery series . Tony Shalhoub shines as title character , solving the case with his gift/curse and his willingness to go anywhere ... that does n't have germs.Adrian Monk 's wife Trudy was killed in a car-bombing , and the devastated detective fell apart completely . Years later , Monk ( Tony Shalhoub ) is partially recovered , but he still is obsessive-compulsive and has dozens of phobias . The only way he manages is with his assistant Sharona ( Bitty Schram ) -- and later her successor Natalie ( Traylor Howard ) -- babysitting him.Courtesy of his friend Captain Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine ) , Monk is called in for dozens of bizarre , baffling cases . His excellent memory and his OCD ( `` It 's a gift ... . and a curse '' ) allow him to see patterns and details where other people see nothing.Among Monk 's cases are going undercover at a prison , a killer dentist , a deadly Christmas gift , an elephant used as a lethal weapon , a billionaire mugger , saving Willie Nelson from a murder rap , trapping a black widow , the death of a 115-year-old man , the Mafia , garbage strikes , rock concerts , a cult , real estate , a murder on a sub , a voodoo curse , UFO sightings , martial-artists , murdered models , and a guy who leaped out of a plane -- and died by drowning.But as quirky and bizarre as the cases is , it never stops hitting the heartstrings . Monk becomes attached to a little boy and a murder victim 's dog , and it 's a credit to this show 's writers that the ending of those episodes are n't maudlin or sappy . And he is still passionately devoted to his dead wife , and his quest for her killer is a story that stretches across the whole series . `` Monk '' is the sort of show that usually gets cancelled after five episodes -- it 's well-written , amusing , and smart . So by TV standards , lasting eight seasons is nothing short of miraculous . Like any long-running show it has its duds ( `` Mr. Monk Takes His Medicine '' always makes me cringe ) , but overall it 's a brilliant series.There are gunfights and SWAT teams , like on any cop show , but the main focus here is on detecting . And the writers are skilled at coming up with all sorts of bizarre or unsolvable crimes , which only Monk could unravel . Not to mention the dialogue , which leans heavily on dry humour ( `` So you 're saying the opposite of a spider is a tall building ? `` ) But the series would n't be what it is without Tony Shalhoub . He played weird roles in movies like MIB and `` Galaxy Quest , '' and so he knows how to balance out Monk 's weirdness and genius without leaning too heavily on either . When told to sit on the ground , he says nervously , `` I ca n't . Animals do things on the ground . Terrible , terrible things . `` Schram and Howard are both good as his assistants , and they 're similar without being TOO alike -- one was a hardened New York gal , and the other is a rebel rich girl with a checkered employment past . And Levine and Jason Gray-Stanford round off the cast as genial cop Stottlemeyer and his earnest ( if slightly goofy ) sidekick Disher . `` Monk : The Complete Series '' shows us all of this excellent show , with its uniquely appealing hero . It 's a gift ... and a curse .	1
I 'm enjoying the Christmas marathon . I have been laughing at each episode since I 've started watching . Monk is quirky , obsessive compulsive , intelligent , yet relatable . All the characters are ( relatable ) - Randy is a hoot and Captain Stoddlemeyer is funny without meaning to be.Monk is educational . After watching this series for years ( I have n't seen all the episodes yet ) I 'm guessing how people died , cause of death , etc . by telltale clues . Does this mean I should quit my day job ? Probably not quite yet , but in the meantime I 'll visit the sites in the City as an homage to one of my favorite former , former , former police detective.PS - A good bonus is that this show is n't as gruesome as CSI ( another favorite , but I admit , I ca n't watch brains leaking out of someone 's skull without cringing ) .	1
I love this series he makes me feel like a normal person . This is fun series allowing you to enjoy the oddities of others with the ability to solve the crime .	1
monk was a smash hit on tv for all of it 's series . The show was followed by another hit 'psych ' on the same network . Which gave that cable channel two really competitive hits . Monk did n't end it 's run from bad ratings , instead fans were happy to see tony shaloub play this character for another 8 seasons . But he was tired of it so the show left the air with the central mystery finally solved . the early episodes featured bitty scram , she was a excellent aide and did a great job as monks nurse aide . She wanted more money and was fired after a few series . this is a common mistake that many actors make . Only it 's worse for women . roles for men are many . there 's FAR less for women and a actress on a hit show should n't bail unless she has another real offer . this happened to terry farrel on 'becker ' and she has n't worked much sense . tony was well known for 'wings ' , one of the best of the 1990 's sitcoms in the u.s. and a worldwide hit . You can see the show on reelz network in hd today . here he is the lead character and he creates a really sympathetic compulsive detective . ted levine is excellent as his friend capt stotelmyer . The second actress who plays the aide to monk also is engaging and did a fine job . The whole series is still well lvoed , just like wings is and hopefully a reunion show is in the works for sometime in the future .	1
Season 1- Monk is a hilarious and an incredibly entertaining series . Three years earlier , Adrian Monk 's wife , Trudy was murdered by a car bomb . He has extreme O.C.D . and relies on his Nurse/Assistant Sharona to help him while he solves murders with Captain Leland Stottlemeyer , and Lt. Randy Disher . Throughout the season Monk investigates an assassination attempt on a Mayoral Candidate , goes to an asylum , takes a vacation , deals with an earthquake , helps prove the innocence of Willie Nelson , and much more.Season 2- Monk 's 2nd is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous season , perhaps even better . Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders , with the help of his Assistant , Sharona . Throughout this season Monk investigates a murder at Trudy 's high school , goes to Mexico , help prove the innocence of Sharona 's sister during a stage play , figure out why a paperboy is killed for the newspaper , gets married , goes to jail , and finally gets a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 3- This is probably my favorite season . During the course of this season , we say good-bye to Sharona Fleming and hello to Natalie Teeger . Monk investigates Warrick Tennyson 's role in Trudy 's murder , gets fired , helps an organized crime family , becomes a contestant on a game show , gets stuck in traffic , goes to Las Vegas , adopts a kid , and much more.Season 4- Throughout this season Monk returns home on HALLOWEEN , stays in bed because he 's sick , gets drunk , goes to a fashion show , figure out who would want to poison Stottlemeyer at the Christmas party , gets amnesia , stop a killer astronaut , and figure out if Trudy Monk had faked her death.Season 5- Throughout this season Monk deals with a garbage strike , loses his eyesight , attends his college reunion , goes to a rock concert , finally meets his dad , goes on the air , and much more.Season 6- Throughout this season , Monk must deal with his crazed fan , help a rapper , teaches Julie Teeger about love , hang out with his psychiatrist 's son , shoots Santa Claus , joins a cult , becomes a fugitive , and finally has a new lead in the murder of Trudy.Season 7- Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died . Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player , helps a boxer , gets stuck on a submarine underwater , meets his other brother , fights City Hall , and much more.The Final Season- In the end , all the pieces will fit together . Throughout this season , Monk serves as a bodyguard for his favorite actress , investigate a UFO sighting , goes undercover as a Mafia boss , celebrates his Birthday , receives a surprising visit from Sharona Fleming , and finally solves the murder of his wife , Trudy . It all comes down to this . This season felt a little rushed , but is the perfect ending to the Monk saga . I highly recommend MONK : THE COMPLETE SERIES ! ! !	1
I had to grab this Amazon deal ! I started watching Monk during the ION Channel weekend marathons . The USA network has become known for it 's great character driven shows . Monk is another one of those characters that you immediate love and sometimes identify with . I love seeing how he develops through the show , coming to grips with his wife 's murder and eventually solving it .	1
MUST HAVE ! Doesn t get better than this ... ... .unfortunately they stopped after 8 years ! Maybe the most impressive acting in a long time ... ...	1
Just now catching up on this series . High end production values and very good story telling . As with all good sic-fi , it is about the human condition as much as it is about & # 34 ; aliens. & # 34 ;	1
I started watching this series because I saw a reference to it on & # 34 ; Big Bang Theory & # 34 ; . Now I am hooked . It 's surprisingly thoughtful and well-written . Watching this on Prime let 's me plow through the episodes quickly . I would highly recommend this series to any Sci-Fi fan .	1
When I saw the remake of Battlestar Galactica I had the memories of the original show casting heavy doubt on the story being worth the time to watch . After making it through the first two seasons on Prime Instant Video I can see that I should never judge a show by the quality of a previous one of the same name . Other than the names being the same in some cases this show carries over nothing from the original and sets itself apart from most shows and takes us to a place far more intriguing than most any do . I 'm not sure what to expect from the remainder of season 3 and 4 but the by the end of 2 and beginning of 3 the story lines that had been set in place went into hyper speed and had more action in 5 episodes than many shows do their entire run . The writers have no problem pushing the envelope of character development and change as circumstances move so fast it has left my head swimming and my interest peaked as for where they can go from here . But if the first 2 seasons are any indication then I 'll just have to hang on and enjoy the ride hoping the end is not a disappointment after a mind boggling first half . If you like Science Fiction that pushes the limits of human behavior then you do n't want to miss this show .	1
Still enjoy watching although season 2 is a little slower . It is great to watch without commercials . A lot different than Battlestar Galactica from the 1980s..	1
Being the stuff of awkward nerds and Dwight from The Office , Battlestar Galactica was the farthest show from my list . But now , I 'm hooked . Great character development , soundtrack and storyline . Love it .	1
Season 2 had episodes that are n't all related to each other . Each of these episodes is compelling in its own right . It is in this season that we learn how complicated the Cylons are and we see each side in the war having setbacks . The crew and human race is unable to follow their mythical script in a direct way , leading to a false start on New Caprica .	1
Good stars , good casting of characters , good writers . All the things I want in entertainment . I do believe that the TV series writers are turning out far better work than the full length movie writers .	1
Great story , excellent acting and character development . Great blend of drama and action , convincing effects . Of course no commercials on Amazon Prime .	1
BSG is always good TV . When in doubt , look to Tricia Helfer and Grace Park , two of the hottest women on TV . The show , built on the premise of a pretty lame show really developed the characters over the seasons.Tricia Helfer is particularly amazing in her role as an angel to Guyus Baltar , Park does a tremendous job in her multiple roles ... oh yea , the male cast members are pretty good . This show took the BSG concept way beyond it 's origins to a full blown series .	1
Awesome series so glad to have Amazon Prime so I can see those shows that I did n't have the time to watch .	1
This was unlike any other & # 34 ; space & # 34 ; drama show , past or present . It was a dramatic show that just happened to be set in space . All 4 seasons were awesome ( I 've watched the series from & # 34 ; end to end & # 34 ; many times and I never tire of it ) . Whether you like sci-fi or not , it 's worth every penny .	1
I like the characters and the plots are wonderful . It definitely keeps you interested in what is happening and going to happen .	1
The shows twist on life and religion to me is very interesting for people that like sci-fi shows & have not see this should give it a try .. So far in this season they are still trying to find the planet .. Which they never been too and they say , it 's the best planet of them all .. Lol earth ! ! One things for sure this season as a lot of things happening .. But overall a great season .. ( Season 2 )	1
One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire ' this is a complex , Dickensian study of human nature , not afraid of asking big questions , and meticulously plotted like agreat novel , so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire ' used the overly familiar clich & eacute ; ' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions , and 'BattlestarGalactica ' uses the sci-fi series , and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person 's sci fi , in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke , or Isaac Asimov . It 's about why we are how we are , what it means to bea human being , morality under constant pressure in times of war , fathers and sons , impossible loves , metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife , far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes , and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days . It 's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good , and some cast members areremarkable , creating characters full of depth , complexity andcontradiction . The writing is terrific , allowing the characters tochange and grow , but always in ways that make sense , creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums , only to find surprising , sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us . The special effects are generally very impressive for TV , even if they 're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I 've everseen , and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away . I was sad to get to the last episode , just as one is sad tofinish a great book.I have n't bought it in other forms , so I ca n't compare , but generallythe blu-ray set ( the non-Cylon box ) is quite complete , and well packaged.However , I have read accounts that quality control was a bit of a problemand I did n't escape the bugs . On a couple of my discs there wasa slight 'pulse ' to the image at times . At first I thought perhapsit was a strange , but intentional , lighting effect , but looking at it carefullyit seemed more a reproduction problem.This is n't just the intentionally added grain , a look I do n't love , but acceptas an artistic decision.Since then , I 've read similar comments from others , so I 'm not crazy ( or at least not in this case ! ) . So , if you do order this , you might wantto make sure it 's returnable , and try to do a quick quality check the bestyou can . Of course , if the problem is intermittent , and mostly in the laterdiscs , as was in my case , by the time I saw it it was way too lateto ask for an exchange.None-the-less , for me , the quality of the content way over-rode theoccasional image problems ( and I 'm a perfectionist - my wifenever noticed the pulsing until I pointed it out . ) .As far as getting the individual seasons on blu-ray , it looks as thoughyou can do better buying the box set , although prices fluctuatequickly here on Amazon and elsewhere , so I 'd advise you do the mathand figure out the most reasonable way to own the complete set.Also , Amazon UK currently has a complete region free blu-ray boxset for about $ 100 with shipping . It seems to have all the same extrasas the US box set . Well worth considering as long as the price holds up .	1
I 'm really enjoying this series , starting to watch multiple episodes at a time because I want to move the story forward . Always a good sign when you want to do that ! I 'm sick to death of Baltar , but that just means that James Callis is doing his job . Love Starbuck . Love Sharon . Love Number Six . Still happy to see Richard Hatch and think he 's great.Working my way through Season Three now .	1
Battlestar Galactica was a perfect series , and season two just exemplifies how great the story line progression is . As the drama increases and bonds of family and friendship are tested , with great twists and turns watching just one episode will never be an option .	1
If you thought the first season was gut wrenching and mind blowing , the second season one-ups the first . Sex , drugs and rock and roll sum up the scenes from this season .	1
Great cast , great concept , great long series you can immerse yourself in . Interesting how some of the actors do n't look nearly so good in other projects.Ending of series takes easy way out .	1
I am not a critic but have found this series very enjoyable . This is so much better than the original series that it is simply a step up in entertainment . A good way to fill in some winter and bad weather hours .	1
I watched the original Battlestar Galactica with Loren Green years ago but this one is so much better . Good si-fi and a great cast of characters and story lines to keep the series interesting . I was hooked after season one and looking forward to season three .	1
This is my second time watching season II of BSG ... I cried . After Sharon was saved by Tyrol and Aggethon and she pulled the blanket over her head and cried , I cried also . This show is unbelievable and sooooooooo good . When was Cdr Adama made an Admiral ! This show made me change my mind on interrogating prisoners , especially women . I know I will get slammed for this , but I do n't care . I 'm a woman first and foremost , and above all is . This show speaks to so much .	1
I have already reviewed the series in Season ! , and this season was a strong part of it . Worth watching for people who really crave deeplly human stories .	1
really good show , i love the way they dramatised there plight from the very first episode to the last episode the mini series was done great job .	1
I purchased the entire seasons ( 1 - 4 ) and have found them both entertaining and worth the cost . Over time , the re-watch high-lights the missing in-depth interactions of the characters , but also brings out details that might have been missed on the original broadcast . Again , I am biased becuase of being a fan of BSG .	1
Every time a episode ends I ca n't wait to start the next one . This show is awesome , if you like scifi you 'll really love this one .	1
In a way this Series seems to be about the ends days of our time , and hope after the battle is over . At least that 's the impression I get .	1
I was hooked on the first episode of season 1 . I love the characters . Even the music is great . Have you noticed the sounds of the ship and the size of the doors between rooms ? Just what one would expect if one were on an actual spaceship . The most annoying thing though is the voice of Gaius Baltor . Makes my throat hurt listening to him .	1
If you 've not seen the newer Battlestar Galactica , you really should . It is great Science Fiction . Heck , it is just a great story , period ! This is a series best watched in & # 34 ; binges ; & # 34 ; that is , watch an entire season in one week , preempting your normal TV viewing . When you do that , it is much more like watching a movie , or a serial movie , than it is a TV series . There 's action , adventure , romance , war , life-or-death situations and decision , emergencies , subterfuges , blackmail , treachery , even treason ! Not to mention some of the prettiest Cylon models this side of the Galaxy.One could nitpick this little thing or that minor nuance ... but hey , this is great television . Enjoy it.One caution : There are many scenes inappropriate for younger than 14 , and more probably up to 17 or 18 . Even as an adult , I find myself keeping the remote in my hand to be able to fast forward through some of the spicier scenes . That is the single negative critique I 'd have of this series , and it is not a trivial critique . The newer BG is NOT something to let your kids watch willy-nilly ; just because the old series was PG-rated.Again , a very good show ... just keep the remote handy .	1
Season 3 started with a Roar ... .just like a good movie ... .and that went on for afew episodes ... till drama got in the way ... .crying babies and more drama that wedid'nt really need ... . i dont mind knowing a bit of the crew 's relationships butthis season they waste a lot of episodes on this crap . And if you are smart youcan see where this serie is going and how it possibly gon na end.So ..yep lots of great single episodes that gives Science Fiction a big boost butwe known that drama and Religion will eventually take over.So ..at this point ... im only looking at the good episodes and i am fast fowardingthe social drama parts that are making me fall asleep.But by the end of this season ... .things once again are getting interesting ... very interesting ... and cant wait to watch season 4 .	1
Great series . Action packed . Would like to have seen more of the other crewmember 's stories and less of Gayas Baltar and his imaginary girlfriend .	1
I do n't have a ton to say except I love this series . Period . Watch it from the beginning and you will not regret it .	1
In this series , good characters are sometimes bad and show serious flaws and the worst characters demonstrate heroics . The exodus from New Caprica introduces a new dynamic to the series with the added complexity of character flaws in everybody . I did n't like some of it but was always captivated .	1
Season Three continues right where season 2 left off at . With the Cylon occupation in full force and the pressure being on for the colonists of New Caprica and the President Gaius Baltar . Fans of the show before wo n't be disappointed with plenty of action between the various characters and the Cylons ( them having their issues themselves ) .The Cylons attempt to make peace with the colonists by starting up a police force made up of colonists of New Caprica . It just insights the rebels as many view the new police as traitors conspiring with the Cylons.More background of the characters are revealed and the tensions are flaring over Baltar 's impending trial for crimes against the colonists that will seperate people and thrust them onto opposing sides with varying views on death being the penalty and others wanting the justice system to actually do what it should do . If anything Season 3 of BG continues to do what a lot of shows ca n't ... be consisent .	1
Ron Moore , one of the brains behind Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , took his darker view of sci-fi to the new Battlestar Galactica series with generally positive results . This is n't Star Trek by any stretch of the imagination . In fact , it 's tough to compare BSG to any other sci-fi show . It combines an in-depth story arc , top-notch acting , realistic special effects , and a pseudo-documentary cinematic style to create a unique experience.Unlike Star Trek , BSG tries to depict a gritty , realistic vision of humanity 's future . In the first few episodes , a race of evil robots called the Cylons attack 12 human colonies , leaving only a few tens of thousands of humans left in the galaxy . The humans band together in a convey of ships to search for Earth.Amongst the main characters , the acting ranges from good to excellent . In particular , Edward James Olmos as Admiral Adama is absolutely amazing at conveying the burdens of command . I first saw Olmos as Detective Gaff in Blade Runner and never could have imagined him as the star of a TV series , but he really shines . Mary McDonnell as Laura Roslin also wins plaudits as perhaps the most convincing female president ever portrayed on TV.I love some of the individual episodes from Season 3 . Starting off the season with much of the crew forced under Cylon occupation was brilliant . We get to see the characters really put through the ringer . And they change . There are some really compelling moments . One of my favorite episodes focuses on labor disputes in the fleet . It 's a small glimpse into life for the hoi polloi in BSG , but it really makes you ponder what life would be like under such circumsances.That said , Season 3 is the point at which BSG really started to jump the shark for me . While I liked the idea of beginning the series with part of the crew under Cylon occupation , the Cylons just do n't work as the main villains . I still have n't gotten over the idea that they 're perfect imitations of people . However , in Season 3 , the Cylons just leave any pretense of being machines . They act like people in all but name . They have petty jealousies , fall in love , and argue amongst each other . Worst of all , several of the episodes follow Gaius Baltar on a Cylon base ship and there 's a `` love bed '' on the ship ! A bed with bright red sheets and plushy mattress just for Baltar and his Cylon women . I definitely started getting sick of the Cylons by this point.Overall , I love individual episodes of BSG , but I do n't like where Season 3 is taking the larger story . Individual episodes can have great character moments or engage in deep moral questions . However , when character and morals take a backseat , the series flounders . Still , it 's definitely must-see television for sci-fi fans .	1
This show is much much better than I had ever hoped . It succeeds brilliantly on all aspects , from storytelling to acting , from direction to production , it is first rate . I had lost interest in the show during season two and had no real desire to watch season three but I saw the dvd and it was an impulse buy . I spent the last day watching the entire season and I was captivated . It is so rare for a science fiction show of this quality to be made anymore . It is truly one of the great seasons ever and , if the Emmys truly meant excellent in tv , the show would receive nominations all over the place.I should point out one person in particular , though I do not even know his name . The actor who plays Gaius Baltar is truly exceptional . It is worth watching just for his performance alone , but that is not to diminish all the other fine actors . There is not a weak performer in the whole season.An AMAZING season .	1
What can I really objectively say , I am a total BSG junky and this was a great season . The writers and actors really put a human face on a concept of a maybe not so distant future and then make the characters human in every sense . Fos BSG junkies this is a season of healing after a traumatic start to the season and it 's one of those seasons where you have to see it from beginning to end to really see this season unfold .	1
was new & all episodes played with out flaw . fast shipping . great series makes you want to see the next episode . great for science fiction fan .	1
Spoiler related wording ( basically going around the spoilers , relating to them but not specifically stating what they are ) : This episode was amazing . The two part judging of Gaius Baltar was really good to . The revealing of 4 more Cylons out of the final five was amazing ; especially when you find out who they are . It blew my mind to find out . Anyway , this episode , and the last one , have an intriguing element , the music , that is interesting and weird . I do n't really understand why music , but it probably has some meaning . The build up in this series has been really great . This series is now in my top 5 . I do n't know where to put it . It 's awesome . To anyone who has n't seen this episode or the last one yet , do n't skip these , these are very important and amazing episodes . You 'll be blown away at the end of this episode , of that I assure you . Really , I do have to wonder who the fifth Cylon is . That 's the question that will probably echo through the next season . Great season , awesome series so far , ca n't wait to watch the next season.Oh , final note , as I did n't list it before . You get to see a someone you did n't expect to see in this episode . Plus , that person has news , great news . It 's interesting to see that person again . It really adds to the excitement of the ending of this season . I had to wonder if Lee was hallucinating or not at the end . However , I 'm going to guess no , even though that is a really mind-boggling idea . The music at the end was a really big help as it really did add to what was going on ; a perfect element to add.This series is awesome . I 'm going to love seeing what happens next .	1
Although the plot at times lost the & # 34 ; find Earth & # 34 ; focus , the season maintains high levels of tension , drama , lightness , loss , and surprises .	1
Battlestar Galactica was ( and still is ) the best of its genre ever aired . All 4 seasons were fantastic , but season 3 was superior ( outside of the series finale ) . Even if you 're not a sci fi fan , if you have n't seen it you 're missing out ...	1
This is one of the best written scifi series ever . It is worth watching every episode . It will be enjoyed by any person who enjoys Star Trek type shows .	1
What 's going to happen next .. In this season after ( spoiler ) finding a planet which they can live on things happen that they have to leave it and keep on the search for earth.. There are many problems on season 3 that has you thinking of human life , based on the show and what flips are next to be shown on season 4.. Overall a great season .. So far this show has me hooked..	1
Already perched on the mountaintop of cinematic stories in the first two seasons , the third actually raises the level of excellence to new heights . Much of the characterization the initial seasons developed so well actually becomes still more integral in this , the third season . I became more invested in the safety and sanity of what I have now begun to view as colleagues - their varying motivations , whether well-considered or foolish , with pride , joy , fear , or disapproval . WIth so many human issues being addressed and so many characters involved in simply dealing with the hardships of their trying life , I 'm now feeling , as I watch , that I 'm living it with them . At this point I find myself wishing the series will never end !	1
One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire ' this is a complex , Dickensian study of human nature , not afraid of asking big questions , and meticulously plotted like agreat novel , so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire ' used the overly familiar clich & eacute ; ' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions , and 'BattlestarGalactica ' uses the sci-fi series , and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person 's sci fi , in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke , or Isaac Asimov . It 's about why we are how we are , what it means to bea human being , morality under constant pressure in times of war , fathers and sons , impossible loves , metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife , far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes , and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days . It 's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good , and some cast members areremarkable , creating characters full of depth , complexity andcontradiction . The writing is terrific , allowing the characters tochange and grow , but always in ways that make sense , creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums , only to find surprising , sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us . The special effects are generally very impressive for TV , even if they 're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I 've everseen , and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away . I was sad to get to the last episode , just as one is sad tofinish a great book.The third season represented a bit of a transition to something atouch more surreal , a little odder , which would pay off fullyin the last two seasons . There are moments where the show seemsto have lost it 's way a bit , but it comes back quickly , and somethings that have a 'what was that about ? ' feeling in season 3will be very important in what 's yet to come . Trust the show .	1
This show is a lot of fun to watch , and who knows , maybe you 'll get to see Kara Thrace become Ms. Marvel in an upcoming Avengers movie ; ) The struggles between a father and son , humans marrying & # 34 ; toasters & # 34 ; , and the race for be the first to find the long lost Planet Earth . This show has great depth , and is a lot of fun to watch : )	1
I continue to be amazed at how much I love `` Battlestar Galactica . '' I usually do n't enjoy science fiction , but this show is unlike any other sci-fi series I 've seen before . In fact , `` BSG '' just may be my favorite television show of all time , which says a lot ! Season Three of `` BSG '' picks up right where Season Two left off . The majority of people have been living on New Caprica for more than a year and are trying to build new lives for themselves . Unfortunately , the cylons eventually managed to track the humans down . After invading New Caprica , the cylons convinced President Gaius Baltar to cooperate with them . Now people live in constant fear of the cylon occupation . Resistance leaders including Chief Tyrol and Colonel Tigh continue to fight the cylons and attempt to come up with an escape plan , which is a very hard thing to do since both Adamas and their respective ships jumped away from New Caprica as soon as the cylons invaded . Obviously , the Adamas and their small crew ca n't just abandon the rest of humanity , and an elaborate rescue attempt is planned.I do n't want to reveal too many details about the season and spoil things for people who may not have seen it yet . However , there 's a lot that goes on in Season Three , especially where Tyrol , Tigh , Tory , Anders , and Starbuck are concerned . If you thought the Season Two finale was shocking , just wait until you see what happens at the end of Season Three ! There are a few small issues I have with this season . First of all , I think there are too many `` one-shot episodes '' that do n't really seem to advance the main plot of the show at all . Having a few episodes like that is fine , but I think there were an abundance of them this time around . Also , I 'm not sure how I feel about the way certain music served as a major revelation during the season finale . Hopefully Season Four will do a good job of explaining things.Overall , though , this was a great season . I 'm very sad that there 's only one more season left , but I ca n't wait for it to start up again in March .	1
I loved it was exciting , an funny It was worth Watching . I would see it again If you like Sci fi this is the one .	1
Another great season . Good stories , incredible acting , does Edward James Olmos ever do a bad take ? The entire run of this series seems to parallel current US politics and keeping with this theme , the President is starting to frack me off . What is her problem ? She is showing the same symptoms of fundamentalist elitism as `` W '' . I 'm expecting her to walk on the bridge of Galactica and announce that she 's the `` decider '' .Basic Jr. College Anthropology has shown that when 2 cultures come together the first thing that happens is a lot of hatred and fighting ( the humans vs. cylons ) . Next comes a blending where they begin to need each other and lastly is a merger where they share a manifest destiny and work together towards this goal.The series seems to be moving in this direction but I 'm sure the writers will pull the rug out from under us momentarily . Gosh , I love this series .	1
Even I have to admit that season 3 drags on some , but it is very insiteful as you learn quit a bit about the Cylons . And the season finally will leaving you with your heart stopped and your jaw completely on the floor .	1
I have to say , this season was one of my favorites , not knowing if Starbuck would comeback , Adama 's will to continue on the search for earth , Boltar 's relationship with the Cylons , The Cylon Athena ... .where do I start .	1
The 3rd season of Battlestar Galactica begins with the scene on New Caprica . Tight loses his wife , and Starbuck loses her emotional stability at the hands of the Cylon occupiers . The colonists on New Caprica are then rescued by a carefully orchestrated surprise mission by Pegasus and Galactica , and the series goes back to the search for Earth . In between , Starbuck is killed , and then comes back to life ; and Balter is imprisoned on a Cylon ship , then imprisoned on Galactica . We also have 4 of the 5 humanoid cyclons revealed , along with President Roslin 's re-acquintance with cancer . So overall , a very eventful season . Probably the high points are the dialogue , of which numerous scenes stand out . Some of the best include Apollo 's defense of Baltar at the latter 's trial , Six 's explanation of projection to Baltar while on a baseship , Ellen 's defense of herself to Tigh , Starbuck 's taunting of numerous other people , and Romo 's elaborations of justice and the legal system . The script itself has numerous holes . Probably the biggest holes are in the early episodes on New Caprica . The cylons clearly have the technology to monitor the entire range of electro-magnetic , thermal and acoustic radiation , yet they resort to tent-by-tent search and seizures of colonists . these glaring plot holes continue throughout the season and conclude with the trial of Baltar in the last 2 episodes ; Cross-Roads 1 and 2 . Neither the prosecution nor the defense calls Baltar to the stand , which is unheard of . And the show does not give any explanation as to why he is not called to testify . But overall , still a good show .	1
I love the stories . I especially love that all the characters are shown to have both good and bad points , just as real people do .	1
Firstly , I have never seen the show . I love science fiction but usually only in the movies because I find a lot of the sci-fi shows on tv to be low budget with poor scripting and acting.This show however looks fantastic , if you did n't tell me it was a tv series I 'd think it was a movie . Aside from looking great the story looks to be engaging , exciting and just plain entertaining . The whole point of this download is to get you into the show and to get you updated on what has happened so far , it does that well , I feel like I could just jump in and start watching the show . **A warning though , if you plan on buying/watching all of the old Battlestar Galactica episodes in the prior seasons I 'd hold of on watching this as it will spoil it for you . **I recommend taking a look . And while your at it take a look at the other free download , it 's good too . Here : SCI FI : Inside Battlestar Galactica	1
Very good serial video and has excellent visual and audio . The continuing story is fascinating and the plots are reasonable and the acting is great . Hard to downgrade any production of this quality .	1
Warning ! The following contains spoilers . If you have n't seen Season Three and want to remain spoiler free , do not read this review.Season Three of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was the most debated and controversial yet . Much of the controversy stemmed from the number of hot button political topics it addressed . What other show would take several major characters we know and love and have them execute another character we had known from the beginning of the series for collaborating with the enemy , demonstrating in the process the extreme danger to justice inherent in independent military tribunals ( disturbingly similar to the ones that the Bush administration has advocated ) ? What other show takes up the logic and ethics of suicide bombing by having `` us '' attack `` them '' by the death of another semi-recurring character in an effort to kill recruits for the local police force ? Many of the episodes outraged those on the political right , as the parallels with the situation in Iraq was , despite efforts to minimize the resemblance by references by creator Ron Moore in interviews to Vichy France , became increasingly blatant . To his credit Moore , a member of the left but a self-admitted Rush Limbaugh listener , has not had the show lean too heavily to the left for most of the show 's run , but in the season 's first several episodes that balance fell away . And in the most controversial episode of the season ( debated on Internet boards more passionately than I can ever remember any episode of any show ) the question of whether genocide against a murderous enemy is justified , pitting several of the major characters on the show against each other.On the other hand , Season Three had several surprisingly uninspired episodes . All of these were of the `` stand alone '' variety . All of the `` mythology '' episodes ( to use the X-FILES terminology that Ron Moore himself often uses ) were outstanding . In posts on boards , podcasts , and interviews Moore has said that most of these episodes are produced by the insistence of the network . The thinking is that having nothing but arc episodes intimidates potential viewers . But the brute fact is that at this point in the series it is a sheer impossibility for anyone to start watching at this point . This is the beauty of DVDs . Anyone who wants to watch BATTLESTAR GALACTICA can by buying the DVDs , borrowing them from a friend , downloading them from iTunes , or renting them from Netflix or their local DVD rental store . Bizarrely the networks do n't seem to have comprehended the ways that viewing patterns have changed.Season Three is structured around the Cylon occupation of New Caprica and the ongoing effects of that occupation following the rescue of the humans by Galactica . Many of the characters on the show never quite get over their experiences there , in particular Tigh and Kara . Interpersonal conflicts that were created on New Caprica , especially between Kara and Lee , take much of the season resolve , and the whole New Caprica experience does n't really come to an end until the close of the trial of Baltar in the season finale . In one way or another the experiences there color almost everything that happens during the season.Instead of summing up individual episodes or talking about the major story arcs , I would like to highlight my ten favorite moments of the entire season.1 . The Adama Maneuver : During the rescue on New Caprica Adama gets crucial Vipers into the fray by jumping into the upper atmosphere of the planet . Since Galactica can not fly in an atmosphere , they launch the Vipers as the ship plunges in a fiery ball towards the surface , jumping again just a couple of hundred feet before smashing into the earth . It is - and I say this with little fear of contradiction - the most extraordinary special effect in the history of TV . No one who has seen it has been able to forget it . It is inconceivable that the show wo n't win the Emmy this year for Best Special Effects ( but then , it is impossible to see how they lost to LOST and its black smoke effect last year ) and when it does , this is the special effect sequence they will show at the awards.2 . Leoben has imprisoned Kara in a living situation that parodies that of a married couple . As they dine Leoben stands beside her and tells her how beautiful she looks . She smiles and rams a pair of skewers through his neck , kicks him back and falls on his chest stabbing him repeatedly . She returns to the dining table , takes a bite , then daintily dabs at her mouth with a napkin , oblivious to the blood that covers one of her hands.3 . The death of Jammer : In `` Collaborators '' several characters we 've known and loved kill Jammer for being a collaborator during the Cylon occupation of New Caprica . We 've known Jammer since Season One when he , Cally , and Socino tried to make a still . But that does n't prevent him from being shot out an airlock . Nearly as good was the near execution of Gaeta later in the same episode.4 . Five great Sharon moments . This is a total cheat , but here are five great moments involving Sharon in Season Five . 1 ) The last time we saw Sharon in Season Two she was deeply distrusted from not having told Galactica about Cavil being a Cylon . She had told Helo that she wanted nothing to do with him or anyone on Galactica . Our first shot of her in Season Three , her cell door is open and we see it filled with comfortable furniture : a desk with books , an end table and coffee table , wall hangings and curtains , a comfy chair , and a large and extremely comfortable leather couch . Adama is sitting beside her drinking tea and he tells her that he feels all alone , except for her . Clearly in the previous year , somehow Sharon had become just about Adama 's closest friend . 2 ) Because of the new trust Adama has in Sharon , she becomes an officer in the colonial fleet . Through the rest of the season she repeatedly tells others - whether human or Cylon - that she has given the fleet her word and she intends to keep it . Though some doubt her , Adama 's faith in her is repaid repeatedly in the season . 3 ) Sharon enters the Cylon Detention Center on New Caprica to recover the launch keys that are crucial if the humans are to escape from New Caprica . She gets interrupted by D'Anna Biers , who tries to tempt her into coming back to the Cylons with the news that Hera is still alive . Sharon responds by putting a bullet into both her D'Anna 's knees . She walks away , saying `` Adama would n't lie to me '' ( and it turns out he did n't , since he did n't know that Laura stole Hera and faked her death ) . 4 ) Sharon and Boomer come face to face . One of the season highlights had to be the show 's two major Number Eight 's meeting . The irony is intense , since at the beginning of the series Sharon was completely on the side of the Cylons and Boomer was with the fleet , unaware that she was a Cylon sleeper agent . Now , however , Boomer like D'Anna before her tries to convince Sharon that she does n't belong with the humans . Her reply is to the point : `` I made my decision and I know where my loyalties lie . '' 5 ) Boomer does , however , tell Sharon that her daughter is still alive and is on the nearby Cylon basestar . After Adama confirms with Roslin that Boomer 's story is true , Sharon rescues Hera by talking her husband Helo into killing her so that she will resurrect on the Cylon resurrection ship . Only seconds after reaching Hera she plots her return to Galactica . The irony is that only a few minutes earlier Roslin was dressing down both Helo and Adama for their faith in Sharon . Knowing that Sharon is downloading into a new body she tells them , `` And now all of our lives are in the hands of Sharon Agathon . All we can do is hope that your wife is worthy of the unconditional trust you place in her , Captain . And you as well , Admiral . '' What is wonderful is that Laura states all this as if it is in doubt . But less than an hour later Sharon is back on Galatica with Hera . Oh , and Sharon is given her own handle : Athena , a nod to the original series in which Athena was Adama 's daughter . And in this one Sharon has become one of his surrogate daughters.5 . `` Exodus , Pt . 2 '' : I said I would n't summarize any episodes and I will resist doing that here . But this episode , which contained `` The Adama Maneuver '' I mentioned above , is easily one of the two or three most unforgettable episodes in all of BSG . At the end of 2006 the well-known Internet TV website The Futon Critic issued its annual list of the Top Fifty episodes of the year . With total justification they named `` Exodus , Pt . 2 '' the number one episode of 2006 , not just of BSG but of all television shows combined . It was that good . Four beats made it stand out . First , Saul Tigh 's killing of his wife Ellen for collaborating with the Cylons , second the Adam Maneuver , third , the rescue of Galactica by Pegasus and its destruction , and fourth , Kara learning that Leoben had lied to her by telling her that Kacey was her daughter.6 . The fight between Kara and Lee in `` Unfinished Business . '' In the Season Two finale we learned that somehow Lee and Kara had fallen out with each other so completely that they were barely able to talk to one another . In this episode we get that back story . Adama has called for a series of boxing matches to air out grievances that crew members feel towards one another . We see Lee and Kara 's story intercut with their pounding on each other in the boxing ring , learning of the night of passion that they spent with each other and their declaring their love for one another , and of Kara 's sneaking off and marrying Anders the next morning . As Kara and Lee ( who she is able to fight evenly partly because Helo beat up on him in an earlier fight and partly because Kara resorts to dirty fighting ) collapse into each other 's arms , their faces bloody messes , she tells him , `` I missed you . '' His mouth filled with blood , he is barely able to say , `` I missed you too . '' Her face buried in his shoulder , you can see her smile broadly as the episode ends . One of the best episodes in the show 's run.7 . In a stunning scene on a Cylon basestar , D'Anna Biers tortures Baltar while he manages to project to a beach where Six makes love to him to get him through the ordeal . As he tells Six `` I love you '' D'Anna hears the words as addressed to her and although torturing him feels deeply moved . It is a sequence that has to be seen to be believed.8 . Adama and Laura 's intimacy . Through Season Three Adama and Laura grow closer and closer , as intimate as two people can be while remaining completely Platonic . They still have conflicts . When Laura tries to justify stealing Hera and faking her death Adama walks away without even listening to her . And in the finale Roslin feels betrayed by his vote of Not Guilty in Baltar 's trial . But you get the sense that they have moved to a new level . That they have an intimacy that ca n't be affected by mere disagreement . The highpoint of their intimacy might be their smoking dope on New Caprica and cuddling while gazing up at the stars . It is so wonderful to see two people who have shouldered so much in order to save the remnants of humanity to get a few minutes of peace/9 . Lee Adama 's moment on the stand . During Baltar 's trial Romo Lampkin ( magnificently portrayed by Mark Shepard ) calls Lee onto the witness stand even though he is serving as co-counsel . Jamie Bamber 's performance is one of the season highlights and perhaps the best moment in a season finale stuffed to overflowing with truly great moments.10 . The last ten minutes of the season : In the final few minutes of the season we learn the identify of four of the Final Five : Tigh , Tyrol , Samuel T. Anders , and Tory ( the four T 's -- giving additional credence to the thought of some that Kara `` Starbuck '' Thrace is the fifth member ) by their response to a song that they keep hearing in their heads , which turns out , almost impossibly , to be Bob Dylan 's `` All Along the Watchtower '' ( leading some to refer to them as the Dylons ) . Then the Cylons attack . The four new Cylons ponder what to do before Tigh magnificently tells the other three : `` The ship is under attack , we do our jobs . . . . My name is Saul Tigh . I am an officer in the Colonial Fleet . Whatever else I am , whatever else it means , that 's the man I want to be . And if I die today , that 's the man I 'll be . But those lines are rivaled by the last of the season , as Lee pursues `` a bogie at my ten '' in his Viper and discovers none other than Kara Thrace , who had died spectacularly three episodes earlier . She looks at Lee , assures him that it really is her ( a fact confirmed by executive producer Ron Moore , who also confirmed that the four Cylons really are Cylons ) , and tells him , `` It 's gon na be okay . I 've been to Earth . I know where it is . And I 'm gon na take us there . '' The camera pulls up over their two Vipers and then rapidly pulls back through the colonial fleet , through the pursing Cylons , back through the nebula and an arm of the Milky Way , and then rushes across the galaxy to our solar system , focusing on earth as the season ends . It is an utterly breathtaking moment.This is absolutely essential television . If you care for great television , this is the kind of stuff you have to care about . The tragedy is that while every major television critics has passionately praised the show and while a host of major publications from TV Guide to Time to Rolling Stone have proclaimed it the best show on TV , it has struggled to find viewers . The irony is that many Sci-fi fans do n't watch it because it does n't resort to the clich & eacute ; s that dominate the genre and make it in most cases completely unchallenging television and many mainstream TV fans do n't watch it because they mistakenly think it will only appeal to Sci-fi fans . It is what it is : the best show on TV . You need to watch this .	1
I was never a fan of the earlier Battlestar Galactica of the seventies . I preferred to watch Star Trek . However , I am hooked on this remake . The acting is great and the plot captivating . The characters are believable , and the cinematography quite spectacular . There are many twists in the story : you will be eagerly awaiting the next episode . My favorite character : Kate ` Starbuck ' ! Though I did not like Battlestar Galactica Razor , and actually started Season 3 with low expectations because of it , I ended up loving Season 3.Season 2 ended with the Cylons discovering and invading New Caprica . Gaius Baltar , the President of the twelve colonies , surrenders to them , while Galactica and the rest of the fleet escape.Season 3 opens with the stranded Colonials struggling to survive under the Cylon rule . A terrorist group is formed to fight the Cylons , and sacrifices are made . We see humans strapping themselves with bombs , and blowing themselves up in the presence of Cylons and their human sympathizers.Can we stop for a second here ? Is n't this what the Palestinians are doing in Israel , and the Iraqis in Iraq ? What are the producers of this show trying to tell us ? Is it that whenever a nation takes over another all means at one 's disposal should be used to attack the invader , including using humans as bombs ? Furthermore , terrorism is shown to be in the eye of the beholder . To the colonials , the terrorists are freedom fighters . To the Cylons , they are simply terrorists . There are some provocative scenes , but after all , this is the kind of world we live in.We are shown Admiral Adama struggling with his crew to save the colonials , and to resume his quest to find Earth . The following is a spoiler so stop reading now if you have n't watched the show yet : Adama does come back to New Caprica and rescues the Colonials . The Season continues with trying to find Earth . New clues are discovered , and a planet is found where early Earth settlers lived.Season 3 focuses on the human element , survival , and punishment . Even after the Colonials are rescued by Adama , some crew members take the role of vigilante , ejecting betrayers into space out of an airlock . These ` victims ' are not judged by a jury of their peers , nor are they given legal representation . Again we are shown how people broken by war resort to unconventional and immoral actions that are fully justifiable by them alone . Again , depends through which eyes you are looking . Adama did not see such actions justifiable , and he put a stop to them . However , the perpetrators , or self-appointed jury , were never charged.I very much liked the episode where a chance is given to Adama to exterminate the Cylons . There is talk of genocide , and many in the fleet are against exterminating the Cylons . But wait a second . Cylons are machines . If today we decided to destroy all Windows based PCs in the world in favor for Apple , would this be genocide ? What if some of the Windows PC contained human DNA , would destroying them then qualify as genocide ? Meanwhile , though , the Cylons decide against exterminating the human race , resorting to living in harmony with them . Again , the writers manage to include provocative topics in this series . Is n't this what good TV is all about ? Another episode I liked was the trial of Gaius Baltar , bringing to mind scenes from John Grisham . Again , whether Baltar is a traitor or not depends on the eye of the beholder . We know he was forced to take certain actions by the Cylons , but we also know that he had his own motivations in certain actions as well . His trial brings up many provocative and controversial topics . I personally thought that episode was the best one . I like it when TV episodes make me think days on end.The Season ends with a huge revelation : some of the Galactica crew are actually Cylons . I wo n't tell you who , because I know some of you who have n't seen the show will read this review , and this revelation could spoil the whole season ! Just let 's say you will be utterly surprised . However , I think the writers took a big risk with such a revelation . We 'll have to wait for Season 4 to see what all of this means . Will the Cylons and human beings end up living in harmony ? Starbuck is also resurrected in the last episode . We saw her die three episodes earlier . She says to Lee , '' It 's gon na be okay . I 've been to Earth . I know where it is , and I 'm going to take us there . '' Is she a Cylon too ? Did Lee see another Starbuck copy ? I really enjoyed the bonus disk , `` The Story so far . '' This episode recaps all that happened from the beginning of Season 1 to this Season . There were many scenes I had forgotten , and this episode sort of brought everything together again.There is only one issue I have with this show : I think there are too many standalone episodes that do n't really seem to advance the main plot of the show . The major appeal of this show ( at least to me ) is its continuity : how each episode continues on the previous one . Seeing too many standalone episodes kind of destroys the flow of the storyline , and slows down the action.Battlestar Galactica is a great show for all sci-fi fans ! Like Razor , Season 3 is shot in HD ( High Definition ) .	1
I ca n't believe it took me so long to start watching this show . Season 1 is by far the best but the series as a whole is excellent . The show is filed with mystery and intrigue . Spoiler alert , it 's something good happens to these poor people be prepared because something worse is coming .	1
Do n't miss this series . Best scifi of its kind , actually fairly unique . Great characters and great story backed by wonderful fx and cinematography	1
I really liked seasons 1 and 2 , but it seems like life aboard the battlestar Galactica is becoming redundant . I guess there are only so many things you can do in space when finding new planets and interacting with new beings is n't your thing ... .	1
You really have to see seasons 1 and 2 to follow along with series , but each episode is interesting on its own . Admiration goes to the actors and series details , as each intertwines the past set of episodes into the newer ones , with added intrigue and drama as the race to Earth continues . Animation and science fiction detail add to the realism , although most of the scenes are more about societal changes and moral issues that make each episode build on the next .	1
Have loved this series from the first episode . The characters , the music , the sound effects , and the scenes of the ships in space . Going to hate for the series to end .	1
I did n't think it was possible to match or improve on the previous seasons of this fearless series , but then I watched season 3 on DVD.What 's best about this show is that the writers and producers are not afraid to take on the tough issues of our times and reflect them back to us through the characters and storylines on BSG.This time , we follow several characters on story arcs which alter their lives forever . There 's Lee Adama and wife Dee , whom he married mainly to try to get over Kara Thrace . Kara herself is revealed to be the daughter of a bitter , abusive mother . Lee 's complicated relationship with his father , William , is further strained to the breaking point during Baltar 's trial . In the meantime , Saul Tigh continues to drink himself into a stupor over having killed his beloved but traitorous wife , Ellen , and then discovers a horrifying truth about himself along with several colleagues . The heretofore likeable Felix Gaeta turns out to have been in league with Baltar , to a degree , and then perjures himself on the witness stand . And the Cylons themselves show us more faces , more personality , and more of a purpose than they ever have before . Lastly , Agathon and Athena must deal with the fact that she 's a Cylon and their baby daughter is a hybrid . I hope that more will be done with this in the last season .	1
As with all reviews this is about both the qualty of the set and the show . If you disagree post a review as these reviews are designed to help fans who have n't purchased or seen the show make a decision NOT whether you agree or disagree ( that 's what the comments section is about ) . Moving on ... Every season of every TV show has episodes that do n't stand up to the best that has come before and after.The show looks very good . The extras include podcasts , deleted scenes a terrific extended episode of one of Ronald Moore 's favorite episodes `` Unfinished Business '' . There are also 2 episode commentary tracks in addition to the podcasts ported over from the web from the original broadcast . David Eick 's video blogs are also included as well as the webisodes ( which I never got around to watching so it is kind of cool having it here ) . I would appreciate more behind-the-scenes type of specials but I like that sort of stuff . Fans who just want the episodes will be pretty well served by its presentation here.This is another really good set . I am disappointed that we do n't have a Blu-ray version ( yet ) and I find it unlikely that Universal will be releasing this on HD-DVD with the collapse of the HD-DVD consortium . The show looks better than the standard definition broadcasts but not quite as sharp as the high definition . I 'm looking forward to the fourth and final season of this terrific show . I 'm also looking forward to Moore 's future series ( I am a bit disappointed with `` BG '' producer David Eick 's update of `` The Bionic Woman '' which , while it has its moments ca n't even compare to `` BG '' ) .PLOT SUMMARY AND SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW : The third season has to my mind some of the best episodes of the series particularly during the episodes on New Caprica leading up to the deliverance from the Cylons . When we last saw the survivors of humanity they had settled on New Caprica . They were abandoned by the Galatica and Pegasus when multiple Cylon warships showed up in orbit because Adama ( Edward James Olmos ) and Lee ( Jamie Bamber ) felt that they were n't prepared to take them on . We get a healthy glimpse into the rigors and harshness of the Cylon occupation showing that , interestingly , they are n't any better or less flawed than their human captors.Saul ( Michael Hogan ) has started a resistence movement carrying out guerilla warfare against the Cylons to try and cause as much damage as possible in hopes of helping Adama on the ground when the Galatica returns to save them.From there the series deals with the fall out of settling on New Caprica in the first place , how humanity will deal with collaborators ( it 's one of the most riveting episodes of the season in my opinion ) , find out that the Galatica and the Cylons are on the right course for Earth and that there is a mysterious plague striking the Cylons . As with previous episodes the show deals with a number of ethical issues that other shows would n't ( and could n't ) touch . I know that there are those that were disappointed with the 3rd season feeling it ran too long or that many of the stand alone episodes were weak but I would disagre ; I felt that the quality was consistent with the first two seasons dealing with interesting and complex themes .	1
I 'm a newcomer to `` Battlestar Galactica '' and am only now watching the series on DVD . After a somewhat lackluster Season 2.5 , BSG got back on track with an action-packed Season 3 . The colonialists have settled on New Caprica , only to be invaded again by the Cylons , although the Cylons have a different intention this time . The season is full of action and intriguing plotlines , as the colonialists mount a resistance movement to escape from New Caprica , which reverberates throughout the entire season.Season 3 contains some extremely strong plotlines and episodes . I was particularly impressed with `` Collaborators '' in which the resistance deals with the colonialists who worked with the Cylons in various ways . The episode is powerful and reflects the kind of long-term implications of war ; creator Ronald Moore aptly compared this episode to the kinds of things seen in France after WWII , for example . I 'm always a sucker for the darker , more politically-tinged episodes of BSG , and this one really did it for me.The season contains several stand-alone episodes that do n't continue the main plotline of the search for Earth . Some of these episodes work well , especially `` Dirty Hands , '' which considers the blue-collar workers who are toiling in the fleet under nearly impossible conditions . Unfortunately , some of the stand-alones are less successful , particularly `` Hero '' and `` A Day in the Life . '' Overall , I was pleased with the directions in which they take the main characters , although I was disappointed that Duwalla 's part continues to shrink and be less satisfying . I also was not fond of the turn taken by Starbuck as she follows her `` destiny . '' I 've never been a Starbuck fan , and I found this entire plotline irritating . Hearing Ronald Moore give Katee Sackhoff constant tongue-baths on the dvd podcast commentaries just added to my irritation . The woman does all her acting by curling her lips , clearing her throat , and making weird snorting giggles . Please make her stop ! Ok , I feel better now.Fortunately , the season ends with some very exciting episodes . Foremost among them is the reveal of four of the final five Cylons . As is typical of BSG , the season ends with some great cliffhangers that promise to take the series in intriguing new directions . What I perhaps love most about BSG is its willingness to make changes rather than resting on its laurels . The story is constantly driving forward and taking us to new places , which is sometimes uncomfortable but always thrilling . For me , Season Three was better than Season 2.5 and about in par with Seasons 2.0 and 1 .	1
For two seasons , I watched Battlestar Galactica expecting a type of greatness that just never seemed to be realized . It had its epic moments , of course , but I always felt as the drama was held back just when it should have been accelerated . In this third season , however , the drama , character development , and overall plotlines are some of the most extraordinary hours ever produced for television.Because I am loathe to give out any spoilers , I wo n't discuss the contents of the episodes in this review . Suffice it to say , however , that viewers get a `` little bit of everything '' in this third go-'round , including ... -An insider 's point of view on the Cylons.-Some incredible emotional drama stemming from the New Caprica situation.-Not a single episode that is a `` dud '' -A finale that is so epic and surprising that it takes a while to fully even sink in.I started watching BSG because I was looking for another `` LOST '' ( what I consider to be the greatest TV show of all-time ) . Though I do n't think ( as a whole ) BSG lives up to that lofty mantra , I will say that it 's third season is as compelling of drama as anything LOST ever produced.Thus , I do not understand the many people who consider this to be the `` weakest '' season of the show , as for me it was the season where everything finally came together in the big-time payoff . I ca n't wait to see what the final season has in store for these characters I now have so much emotional attachment to !	1
I found this season to be the worst of the lot ( so far ) and am entering the home stretch of the show with a bit of trepidation . Overall though the season is littered with some good moments and the seasons ends in such a way that I still look forward to the concluding seasons . Recommended if you want to watch the entire series .	1
After watching the first three seasons of 'Rescue Me ' this season may disappoint some fans , it 's still an excellent TV show , but they seemed to steer away from the firehouse banter that we 've all become addicted to . The show is laced with wit , action and drama of the best kind . The cast is colorful with layers of deep emotion . After a long break I eagerly await season five ! The show is filmed in widescreen and it looks great on a big screen . This season includes commentary and some interesting extras .	1
Haunted firefighter Tommy Gavin ( Denis Leary ) knows about tragedy all too well . He does n't quite remember what happened at the beach-house at the end of the previous season of FX 's Rescue Me , but all he does know is that he is under investigation , while Sheila ( Callie Thorne ) picks up the pieces . To make things more hectic , Tommy and his estranged wife Janet ( Andrea Roth ) are taking care of the new baby , that may be Tommy 's or may be his late brother 's ( Dean Winters ) . Tommy 's concerns over the baby 's safety come into question as well , which leads to a decision that could forever destroy any repairs made to his marriage with Janet . In the meantime , Chief Reilly ( Jack McGee ) gets worse news ; Sean ( Steven Pasquale ) starts to grow a pair in regards to his new marriage to Maggie ( Tatum O'Neal ) and learns a big secret about Probie Mike ( Michael Lombardi ) in one of the series ' funniest and shocking moments ; Kenny 's ( John Scurti ) relationship with an ex-nun takes a downward turn ; Franco ( Daniel Sunjata ) has a big decision to make while trying to get back his daughter from Alicia ( Susan Sarandon ) ; Tommy 's daughter Colleen ( Natalie Distler ) starts to rebel in a big way ; and a new recruit ( Larenz Tate ) makes an impact on the group . While the drama and character development was high in the fourth season of Rescue Me , there was just something about this season that did n't feel all that compelling compared to what has been done on the series before . Also , there was a bit of an uneven feel with a number of already established characters ( particularly Probie Mike ) , but despite the flaws , the fourth season of Rescue Me is still a more than solid season of the series . The season concludes on a bit of a down note , but seeds have been planted for some big time developments to come . All in all , Rescue Me continues to entertain and even impress , and here 's hoping that there 's more drama to come from Leary and company .	1
Have n't received it yet ... ... Planning on taking it with me on Vacation , wo n't return till Feb 15th	1
This was free on Amazon Prime . After watching for three and one half seasons , suddenly they want $ 2 plus meaning about $ 100 . Feel like this is a bait and switch . Amazon Prime offered me $ 5 and told me to complain to the studio . Feels like reading half a book and losing it .	1
There 's definitely some oomph missing from this season , with Tommy being weak and helpless much of the time . Colleen has become completely stupid and annoying . And I miss Jack McGee.However , the Jewish fire chief is wonderful , Tommy 's soliloquy about Connor , given while sitting on the edge of a tall building , is excellent ; and there are still interesting stories and subplots -- enough of them to make it worth watching the show.May I just add that the cover art of Leary on the DVD box set is freaky ?	1
The superb acting by Glen Close makes this a great series ! Never get enough of watching the multiple plots and surprises .	1
this is a great series that I wish could go on and on . I watched end of previous season for a refresher before new one started to keep up with all the twists and turns .	1
What an incredble series ! Very well written . Never knew what would happen next . Extremely intense and you will be `` hooked '' after the 1st episode . Anxiously awaiting season 2 ! !	1
I watched the first four Seasons of Damages on Amazon Prime , but could not find the 5th Season anywhere . This was a few months back , and suddenly , I saw Season 5 offered on Prime , so I watched it . I enjoyed it , but the & # 34 ; 3 weeks later , & # 34 ; 2 months earlier nonsense made me want to go back and watch Season 1 again ( probably will watch all again with little time in between ) to see if I remembered what happened correctly . I love the plot and the actors ; I do not like the crazy skipping in time sequence , and I do n't see the point in trying so hard to confuse the viewer . I 'm watching again to try to see if I get it all correctly , but it should not be this hard . I probably would not have bought any seasons after the first , if it had not been offered on Prime , for this very reason . I do think I 'll watch the other seasons again ; the twists in the plot and the crazy time sequence makes viewing again interesting -- just for one to make sure one got it right ! Damages would clearly be a five star show if it were not for the time sequencing . Whoever thought that up needs to think again !	1
The two things that make for engaging TV watching . The plot is razor sharp and the players are as good as it gets . One of the best dramas in recent years .	1
This griping premiere season has a good story , actors/actresses to carry the main plot ( principle case ) to its suspenseful conclusion , and film direction that continue to compel my interest in every season . Glen Close is a ruthless and stalwart prosecuting attorney that is & # 34 ; everyman 's & # 34 ; advocate . Her co-star , Rose Byrnes , does a splendid job of being her & # 34 ; assistant & # 34 ; . However , good people are hurt in the & # 34 ; process & # 34 ; ; the ends just may justify her methods .	1
Once you figure out the central gimmick in this FX series , you 'll untie the complexities of its plotting and character development . It 's really simple . No one is actually who they appear to be , right down to the minor players and even those who appear less than briefly . It 's brilliant , really . They have hidden agendas , hidden relationships and hidden skeletons . The other gimmick is the constant time shifting : scenes play out `` Three Months Later '' etc etc constantly throughout , but you only get a tease of what 's really going on . The writing here is top-notch , and old Glenn Close really outdoes herself as the Machiavellian lawyer who bends every ethics rule that ever existed on her way to trying to win damages cases . Unrealistic ? Well , yes . This is a TV show . Ted Danson is great as a corporate villain , by the way , as are other name actors in later seasons . If you like court dramas , this one is miles above most .	1
I took a while to git in the swing of the story . When me got into it we liked it good enough to order the rest of the seasons . The acting is very good , the writing is good also but it jumps around a lot .	1
Clearly a great program , just a little odd , and it jumps around from past to present , then present to past . Glenn Close is an absolute evil ( you figure out the rest ) , and scary in this series . There are so many unexpected twist and turns that I spent the weekend watching season 2 , do n't leave the room put the streaming on hold . Fatal Attraction was just a prelude to this actress ' ablilty to play a role .	1
Loved Season one , a must see . Once you get through season 1 you 'll want to continue watching just to find out what 's Patty Hewes ' next move .	1
to your sleeping time . The show is very addictive and intriguing as it keeps you into it throughout every episode . Of course we have Glenn Close playing as a top notch , take no prisoners and ruthless attorney defending people that were swindled out of their pensions and savings from the corrupt boss played by Ted Danson . Who also does a wonderful job is his role . As does the new attorney played by Rose Byrne who starts out as a wide eyed , the world is wonderful person . But by season end so many things will happen to her that will change not only her views . But her very way of life as well.An excellent show and an well written and directed first season . There are so many other characters in the show that do their thing acting as well . Well worth your buying but rent a couple episodes first to make sure this show is your cup of tea . Really looking forward to the next season of Damages without a doubt .	1
This show is full of villains and good guys and always keeps you guessing . Each night , we look forward to watching what next twist will be thrown at us !	1
This series was phenomenal ! ! ! ! ! Glenn Close was awesome ! I ended up watching all the seasons , and was so disappointed that the show ended !	1
Boy was this a great series . I sincerely hated that it ended . Glenn Close is fantastic as well as the rest of the cast .	1
Crazy scarey characters the plot twists and turns .Evil series with thiroughly despicable people but addictive and I ca n't stop watching it but sort of like a mosquito bite you just ca n't stop scraping	1
I was told by a friend that this was a good series and it is . I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good & # 34 ; Who Done It ? & # 34 ; So many twist and turns that you do n't see coming . WARNING : ... ..it 's like a book you ca n't put down until it 's finished .	1
..done with style and grace . Wow , this started off as interesting but was full-blown riveting by mid-season . The characters develop with the story and it 's amazing how well-acted and nicely written the first season is . Ellen ( Rose Byrne ) started off ok for me but became fascinating as the story thickened . As tension boils over her character seems only to grow more and more subdued in expression , if not with a touch of melancholy , yet with power underlying an understated performance . G. Close is excellent , as usual , having mastered the art of Queen b*tch , and Danson puts in a fantastic performance - wow , it 's been so long since I 've seen him in action . His character is simultaneously sympathetic and corrupt - a likable bad guy , though for all his corruption he still does n't generate the contempt that Patty Hughes does ( Close ) . He has n't shined like this since Cheers , and it 's great to see him step back into such a convincing and full-bodied role even this late in his career . Danson 's charm still works to great effect here . His lawyer Ray Fiske , is multi-faceted and excellent , as are nearly all the other supporting actors in the series . What 's not to like ? ! Did n't I catch somewhere that Soprano writers or producers were at work here ? Would n't be surprising . This first season is of similar caliber .	1
This show does for the courtroom TV genre what `` The Shield '' did for cop shows . That is , it knocks you off balance , jumbles things around in a soup of moral ambiguity , and just really pumps new life into a tired genre . You wo n't be sure who ( or if there is one ) the protagonist is throughout the whole season . Glenn Close is her usual intimidating self , Zeljko Ivanek plays a star litigator , Tate Donovan his counterpart , and of course TED DANSON is amazing as the alternately shocking and hilarious Arthur Frobisher . At 19.99 , this is a steal , consdering people used to line up to pay 100 bucks for 12 episodes of shows like the Sopranos ...	1
Good acting -- well cast . But some of the Machevilian manipulation was a little too clever by half and that it worked out so flawlessly strained credibility .	1
& # 34 ; Damages & # 34 ; is what riveting television is all about . The characters are rich and deep , their motivations mutli-faceted , their loyalties complex , ever-changing , or just non-existent . Glenn Close is brilliant as Patty Hewes , portraying nuanced emotions with a deftness rarely seen on television.Season 1 focuses on a lawsuit against a & # 34 ; pump and dump & # 34 ; business owner named Arthur Frobisher ( played surprisingly well by Ted Danson ) who convinced his employees to empty their pensions and retirement plans into the company 's stock before selling every last share he owned . Acquitted in a criminal hearing , it 's up to Patty Hewes and her firm ( including the incomparable Rose Byrne as new associate Ellen Parsons ) to make things right with the employees who 've been left with nothing.It sounds very court-centric on the surface , but it is n't . There 's mystery , double-crosses , schemes , DIRTY LAWYERING ! , and even murder . The story is told creatively . We see flashes of the present , but the majority of the narrative takes place in the past . We see the case unfold and the events that led up to the harrowing opening scene . As the present plays out slowly over the season , the past eventually catches up . When the two meet , it 's sheer brilliance . All those threads finally connect and weave a tapestry of pure entertainment .	1
You will not regret buying this series . Glen Close is outstanding . All of the performances are amazing . You wo n't be able to stop watching . Many twists and turns . The entire writing staff should get an Emmy . I hope they get the other seasons in blu ray fast ! Ca n't wait .	1
Viewer be warned , for a legal drama there is really not much in the way of courtroom scenes . It has more to do with the legal process ( deposition , finding witnesses , filing motions , etc . ) .I 've been watching this on Netflix instant and was hooked from the first episode . It starts out as a CSI `` Who Dunnit '' approach , showing someone who was murdered followed by a random woman roaming the streets covered in blood . Each episode reveals a piece of the puzzle , until everything makes sense with the final episode and brings you up to speed . By the time you catch up , the season is over and you 're amazed they were able to draw you in for so many episodes . And , you want more ! The cast is amazing with some heavy hitters . Ted Danson stars as Mr. Frobisher , a multimillionaire businessman who will stop at nothing to keep his money safe . Glenn Close plays Pattie Hughes , a rough and tumble lawyer who has many , many sides to her . Trying to figure her out is darn near impossible . She adapts to anything thrown at her and seems to be one step ahead at almost all times . The second season features Mario Peebles , Timothy Olyphant , William Hurt , and Marcia Gray Harden . There are others I 'm sure , I simply do not recognize them.All in all , great series that keeps you captivated and entertained . Watch an episode and see for yourself !	1
One of the biggest treats of the 2007 television season was `` Damages , '' a wicked and wonderful legal thriller from FX . Headlined by Glenn Close , I expected to enjoy this show -- but I was n't prepared for the level of sophistication , complexity , and intelligence it offered up from its first twisty , and twisted , moments . Made for adults , this drama demands attention and may not be for the casual viewer . With its intricate plotting and structure , the story is told from different time periods interwoven throughout each episode . Essentially , snippets of the story are presented in each time frame , so the audience is left to speculate about the full truth in any given instance . However , as the season progresses , the pieces start to connect in unexpected ways that can both surprise and frustrate . I 'd compare the narrative flow of `` Damages '' to that of a fine novel -- telling you just enough so that you are tantalized to stick around for the next chapter.The plot of `` Damages '' is a knotty web that is difficult to describe briefly . Ostensibly , the show revolves around a naive young lawyer played by Rose Byrne . The opening scenes show a bedraggled and bloodied Byrne stumbling down the streets of New York -- apparently the victim ( or perhaps the perpetrator ) of an act of violence . Cut to six months earlier and a proper introduction is made . Byrne is seduced and recruited by a major law firm run by Glenn Close . Close seems to have a hidden agenda , but Byrne is quickly overcome by the trappings of success and acceptance . The firm is handling an enormous class action lawsuit against one of the town 's most prominent businessmen , played by Ted Danson , and Byrne ends up squarely in the midst of much legal intrigue . What follows includes lying , blackmail , corruption , and even murder -- no one in this story remains an innocent.While I actually think the plot is the real star of `` Damages '' ( I do n't think I 've ever said that about a TV show before ) -- it certainly does n't hurt that the cast is uniformly excellent . Do n't be surprised if you see Close front and center come awards time . Her thinly veiled menace and cutting remarks make for classic villainy , but Close pulls it off in a way that you ca n't help but love ! Byrne and all the key supporting players are solid and believable . I particularly liked Zeljko Ivanek and Peter Facinelli , but the real revelation to me was Ted Danson . Honestly , I 've followed Danson since he was a bit player in `` Body Heat '' and I think this is by far his best role . Mixing equal parts charm and bile , this is a great actor in a beautifully written role.Again , I do n't recommend `` Damages '' to everyone -- I only wish I could ! If , however , you love sophisticated drama -- give this a shot . The DVD format is the perfect way to watch this show at your own pace and enjoy all its subtleties , surprises , and delights . But , be reminded , if you sit down to watch this show -- WATCH IT ! Otherwise , you might not appreciate how intricately put together `` Damages '' really is . KGHarris , 12/07 .	1
I ca n't get enough of this show ! I just finished watching 3 episodes and would be watching a 4th if it were n't almost midnight . Great acting and suspenseful story .	1
I had no idea what I was getting into with this show , and it continues to grab me and yet shock me every episode . If you had always agreed with the expression & # 34 ; kill all the lawyers & # 34 ; , this show will give you reasons . It is filled with outstanding acting ... Glen Close is breathtaking in her evil . One thing about it ... .trust no one . It is not an easy show to watch but you ca n't help coming back for more .	1
just about when you think you have figured out where the plotis headed somebody betrays somebody and it is going in a differentdirecrion .	1
Even though I usually to choose programs that are less graphic , this show is gripping & I 'm now almost through the second season . The actors are quite good at making me detest their characters !	1
Had heard great things about this series and sampled 5 shows last night . Very addictive series with great suspense.Love the diverse characters and smart dialogue . Lots of plot twists . Brilliant acting by Glenn Close and Ted Danson . What a great find ! Looking forward to more nights of viewing .	1
The cast is great and perfectly cast . I watched the entire 1st season in a week and the second season the following week .	1
One of the great things that the explosion in DVDs has given us is a chance to revisit television shows that we might not have had a chance to watch . It also gives us the chance to watch TV shows that are serial like and that we abandoned when we missed that all important episode . Such is the case with DAMAGES.This FX series follows a young beginning attorney named Ellen Parsons ( Rose Byrne ) who has just been hired by the most notable attorney around , Patty Hewes ( Glenn Close ) . Patty is a no nonsense player who lives to win and will do nearly anything to make that happen . When Patty takes a case , more than likely her client will be the winner.At the moment , Hewes & Associates are involved in their biggest case yet , a class action suit against an unscrupulous CEO named Arthur Frobisher ( Ted Danson ) who sold out his stocks and left the employees of the company with nothing . While the government was unable to prove any wrongdoing , Patty and company are dead set on recouping the losses these people incurred for them.But all is not fair in love and war and this case is nothing less than a war between giants . While Patty uses everything at her disposal to try and bring Frobisher to justice , he and his lawyer do everything they can to block her or to make sure that no one talks , even possibly resorting to murder.But that 's the thing about this show . As it progresses the fine line between who is wearing the white hat and who is wearing the black becomes clouded . Attacks on witnesses , payoffs , dog killings all seem like the work of the defendant . But then again , could they be the tactics of the plaintiff trying to make someone uncomfortable enough to make a wrong move ? Add to that the fact that young Ellen has connections to the case that may have resulted in her being employed to begin with and we end up with a subplot that ties into the main.The twists and turns of the legal world , in and out of the courtroom ( more often out ) make for dynamic viewing that holds you in its grip from the opening scenes of Ellen leaving an apartment covered in blood until the last episode . The acting is better than can be expected on most TV shows and the direction shows a storytelling technique that moves the plot along while holding your interest from week to week or in this case from disc to disc.Keep in mind while this is a solid piece of drama for viewers , it is not a piece that is recommended for children as it is filled with adult content . But for adults who are looking for drama , this is one that I would recommend .	1
Great show well done keeps you in suspense throughout . The quality on the free amazon prime is great do n't pay for hd	1
Riveting tale that tells us too much about the dark side of human nature . Redeeming value of story : the only benefit of lifestyles portrayed is & # 34 ; stuff & # 34 ; . The pseudo quest for power , respect , justice is doomed as we try to manipulate others and our circumstances . We lose everything that matters at the levels this story spirals down to . So who would aspire to be these kind of people ?	1
Damages is the best of manipulation , murder , and overall mayhem . If you are into shows that provoke your thoughts with the possibilities of actuality , watch this .	1
`` Damages '' is that kind of show that has you on the edge of your seat completely confused as to what is going to happen next and in utter surprise when you discover each piece of the truth . It was one of the best shows of last season without a doubt . The show centered around Ellen ( Byrne ) , who begins to work in the lawfirm of Patty Hewes ( Glenn Close ) who is a ruthless , self-serving and completely unpredictable lawyer . She focuses her work on a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher ( amazingly played by Danson ) for insider trading . The first scene of the first episode shows Ellen running half naked in a raicoat covered in blood in the streets of New York . In each episode we discover a new piece of the puzzle and the events that led to that first scene . The past/present technique is masterfully used making each viewer very involved in solving the mystery . The performance of actors is excellent and the show is amazing . Damages is truly a great show .	1
I loved the first season . My only issue is that I got impatient and wanted to know who did it after the first episode .	1
The first season of the show Damages with Glenn Close starts out with a cat and mouse game and the stakes just get higher and higher the more shows you watch . Cutthroat is n't even the word with this show ... it goes above and beyond . Not only that , during much of my watching , I was n't sure if I was watching a cat or a mouse at any given time ! I came back too , to watch seasons two and three.Great acting and incredibly fast changing story line . Enjoy !	1
This is a really great TV series and I really enjoyed the many twists that kept me guessing throughout the episodes -- and guessing wrong most of the time . I 've always wanted to be a lawyer , among many other professions , and I immediately picked up this series upon seeing it at the Duty Free shop at Heathrow International Airport.This series exposes the world of litigations , and how they operate . The whole season is about a class action lawsuit targeting one of the wealthiest CEOs ( Chief Executive Officer ) . When lawyers try to win at all cost , lives and fortunes are lost . Is it worth it all ? Are lawyers angels or demons in disguise ? How far would we go for money ? Is money worth destroying the lives of others ? Are secrets worth killing for ? Would we kill for money ? How much money is enough ? What is the price of betrayal , and when is betrayal ethical ? These are just a few of the questions you will be asking yourself as you go through this series.The way the series is structured is that it shifts between past events and future ones . I did find this system to be confusing at times , but it does have its merits.This is a fast paced series . The acting is superb and the episodes are very well written and believable . The ending is spectacular , and unanticipated . I ca n't wait for season two .	1
Glenn Close and Rose Byrne do a brillant job in this drama series . It will keep you riveted . Awesome show !	1
This is a great series . I already bought season 2 and 3 . I have never been a huge Glenn Close fan but after seeing the first season I have completely changed my mind about her acting . Every second of this show kept my attention . A definite must see ...	1
Everything about the first season of Damages was superb , the writing , the acting , the story line . It was interesting to see Ellen 's character slowly begin to change from the innocent , trusting young lawyer , to the suspicious character portrayed by Glen Close . The show really is all about trust . The key line that sums up the entire season is spoken by Close 's character Patty Hewes , & # 34 ; Trust no one. & # 34 ; Not exactly a great message to instill in people , but it works well in a TV drama about lawyers . Other than Ellen and her boyfriend David there really are n't many characters in this show worth admiring . Everyone is lying to everyone , which makes it difficult at times to figure out what is really going on , but as the old saying goes , & # 34 ; The truth has a way of rising to the surface , & # 34 ; and all lies are revealed . All in all , great show . Highly recommended .	1
I love how cleverly this show moves . The mindless sex is a serious detraction . I ca n't enjoy this otherwise wonderful show with my 14 year old . I know people have sex ... I do n't need to watch their version of fulfillment .	1
I just finished Season 5 and loved how everything came full circle . This show is not to be missed . Patty and Ellen forever ! ! !	1
There are n't any eccentric characters that make you laugh like Denny Crane on `` Boston Legal '' nor are there any cases neatly tied up at the conclusion of each episode with a bow on them . `` Damages '' follows a single case and the follow out from that case from its beginning until its bitter end . `` Damages '' begins with Ellen Parsons ( Rose Byrne from `` 28 Weeks Later '' and `` Sunshine '' ) bloodied and battered walking the streets of New York until she is discovered by the police . From there the series takes a trip back in time six months earlier a case that Ellen worked on as a new attorney at Patricia Hewes ( Glenn Close ) & Associates . It 's a civil case where Hewes is suing multi-billionaire Arthur Frobisher ( Ted Danson ) for hollowing out his company and robbing 5000 employees of his company of their pension plans in the process . Having escaped the prosecution of the U.S. Attorney 's Office , Frosbisher now must defend himself from claims that he benefited by selling his stocks before his company collapsing and getting away scot-free . Frobisher of course insists that he is innocent and was as much a victim losing the company he cared for as the employees . We see the entire case unfold before our eyes , the double dealings , double crosses and underhanded attempts by both the Hewes and Frobisher 's attorney to gain the upper hand in this litigation . `` Damages '' is compelling , fascinating and well written featuring a wide variety of characters with their own agendas . No one truly is an angel here although the nave Ellen comes mighty close as she finds herself dragged into Hewes ' world and manipulated as much by her boss as she is by the opposition in the case . A personal connection between Ellen and the case is uncovered which also makes Ellen suspect that the only reason she got the job was so that she could be used to gain the upper hand in the case . In the process Ellen sees her ambitions and dreams pull further and further away from her reach just as she thinks she is climbing the corporate ladder of success . Hewes tells Ellen at one point , `` trust no one '' and the same could be applied to everyone involved in the case.Academy Award nominee/Emmy winner Close , Emmy Award winner Danson , Bryne , Tate Donovan , Peter Riegert , Michael Nouri and a host of film/TV/Broadway veterans bring these characters to life with a vibrancy rare in series television . If the story sounds like it was ripped from the headlines , the Enron , Worldcom and other scandals where corporate CEO 's betrayed the public trust and manipulated the market inspired the series but it 's the compelling characters and drama that will make you stick around to the conclusion of this 13 episode FX series.The opening had me scratching my head in puzzlement -- it looked like crappy low-rez video . It 's a faade like everything else here as it is simply a sequence showing us the raw reality that Ellen finds himself trapped in . As the show jumps back six months in time to the beginning of the case , we get a beautifully rendered high definition video image . There are a couple of problems with video noise that occur . It is n't a perfect presentation on Blu-ray but it looks extremely good.Audio sounds marvelous with a TrueHD 5.1 mix that uses the format quite well . It is n't compressed and has terrific dynamic range . The 5.1 format is nicely used given that this is primarily a dialogue driven show with nice ambient effects captured in the surround channels.I was surprised that we only get two audio commentaries on this set as I had hoped for more but both are effective and insightful . Glenn Close , writers/producers Todd Kessler & Glenn Kessler , Daniel Zelman and director Allen Coulter appear on the pilot episode discussing issues they ran into shooting on location in New York during a nasty winter , issues they ran into with trying to bring the series in on budget but without messing with the quality of the show . Close is a bit quiet during the commentary it would be fun to hear her let loose on one by herself or with a moderator . I would have loved to hear Close and her co-stars on a separate audio commentary track discuss the craft of acting , their approach to the material and some of their thoughts during their performances but what we do get is quite good.The second audio commentary features actor Zeljko Ivanek front and center dominating the discussion with the Kesslers and Zelman joining in with technical tidbits from time-to-time . Ivanek has long been one of my favorite character actors and he has largely been underused in many TV shows and movies so its nice to see him get a character as juicy as defense attorney Ray Fiske to sink his teeth into southern drawl and all . `` Willful Acts '' is a half hour behind-the-scenes documentary on the making of the series . `` Understanding Class Action '' is designed with an interfact that gives viewers a background on how class action lawsuits work and a definition of the various phrases thrown around in the series . `` Trust No One '' clocks in under fifteen minutes and focuses more on the characters in the series . We also get a variety of deleted scenes . The really cool feature of this set is that the disc is enabled so that the player can remember which episodes you 've watched and jump right back to the one you had next in rotation if you choose the `` play all '' feature . `` Damages '' is a terrific , compelling legal drama . All 13 episodes of the series plus the extras are on three Blu-ray discs and you also get an insert that gives you the title of each episode , a brief synopsis and credits for each one as well .	1
Really great first season . Full of twist and unexpected turns . I ca n't wait to watch season 2 ! It can only get better !	1
Where is Calvin Klein tween 's EMMY for her performance . It is so great that David Carradine 's daughter ( echo ! ) gives an even better performance than her dad on Criminal Minds . I 've taped the last scene on my dvr a few times when the episode has reaired because her performance is SO satisfying but rewatching her earlier scenes is important to understand how devastating her character is . She does crazy things with her face in her scene with VDO who is wearing one of his BEST suits and of course , John Glover is wonderful from his first scene when it is obvious what a burden his daughter 's existence is to him but never more so than when he silently rubs his eyes in the interrogation room with the speaker is turned off - in one room , not the other . There is a HINT of his character 's resentment of his former protege that will be given the spotlight in his reappearance in a later season . FUN .	1
Vincent D'Onofrio is the best . I miss this show so much . I can watch over and over and never get tired of this show !	1
L & O ; Criminal Intent is one of my favorite Cop ShowsI 'd put it in my top 5 without a Doubt ! This season was a tad differentMostly due to NBC 's lack of Passion for this Great Cop/Crime Dramascenes look different , it has this very different looking Neon Color patternMusic starts every episode ( It very much tries to look and feel like CSI ) But , it 's still CIThank God I do n't understand CSI at all ( it 's a super Lazy Cop show ) yes it 's a insane ratings machinesBut , in my defense so is A & E ; 's Duck DynastyEven though it tries to borrow tacky gimmicks made famous by CSI ( It still has great writing and acting ) This season is without a doubt a re-boot in a wayThe events of Season 5 changed lots of NYPD 's Major Case SquadCaptain DeakinsCaptain Deakins was forced out due to trying to protect Detective LoganA.D.A . CarverSeason 5 is so good if you are gona start on this show start with Season 5also Annabella Sciorra as Detective Carolyn Barek are all written out ( which is a shame I really liked her ) I do n't like the fact there was no explanation why Both Carver & Barek are gone ? ? Eric Bogosian & Julianne Nicholson join the castBoth do add plenty to the show ... Big fan of Eric Bogosian but , he 's really not likeable in this season due to the fact his Character is by the book and do n't understand or support his two best DetectivesThis season is Detective Mike Logan 's season he is in 70 % of this seasonThis is Chris Noth 's best performance imoGoren & Eames are not featured like usualBut , every episode they are in are very smart and well writtenThe episode & # 34 ; Endgame & # 34 ; with the late Roy Scheider is brilliant and as crazy as it sounds this episode should be a Huge reason why you buy this season it 's that strong in every possible waybut , that is not the only great episode this season has some really great onesCriminal Intent IMO is the best Law & Order ; if it was n't for CI there would be no Elementary i 'm sure of that9.2/10	1
I just recently discovered this show . I have seen several past episodes on daytime TV . So , I decided to start acquiring seasons when I came across them at a reasonable price - new or used . I found this Sixth Season at a great NEW price . So a good addition to my DVD TV Library . I 've found a few others 'on sale ' . This way I can see the early episodes/seasons and how the characters have grown through the years . Cool	1
I have not been able to view this packet yet but it appears to be new as ordered.thank you very much	1
I do n't like this season as much , because D'Onofrio is less hot , but the writing is better . However , Vince letting himself go just makes me feel a little sad inside . & # 34 ; Seasons change ... people change ... & # 34 ; If only he had valued his hotness . : /Anyway , Eames continues to be awesome , but this is the season where Vince had a breakdown and they had to bring in some other cops . DUN DUN ! I really do n't like the episodes with Chris Noth and his little freckle-boy-woman . Whatever . Chris Noth is okay , but he 's no Vincent D'Onofrio . Chasing his & # 34 ; white whale , ' Nicole Wallace , comes to a sickening conclusion .	1
Criminal Intent is by far the best of all the Law and Order shows on TV ... .Season 6 is no exception . Especially the Goran episodes are really good.I can ` t wait for them to release season 7	1
I am a big Law & Order Fan , loved the connection of Bobby * Emmes , and the other role players that followed . Jeff Goldblum , a few Captain changes but the strong writing and Dick Wolf who is still going strong with a new series based on real DA 's . I was sad to see the CI series end , SVU still in production with major role changes and lets not forget the original 20 seasons of Law & Order which is my next purchase . Great to have in your library . You can watch them over and over a catch something you missed . Well Done great that Amazon has them available .	1
Law & Order : Special Victims Unit - The Eighth Year is another entertaining season of my fave show . Some of the standout episodes include : Choreographed , Burned , Haystack , Florida , and Annihilated . Christoper Meloni and Mariska Hargitay are talented actors and so is Ice-T . I highly recommend this top-notch show , enjoy !	1
Great season as always . Actors are great . Story line is great . What more can be said ?	1
I like this tv show because there is a great story line in each episode . They find and catch the perp and prosecute them . I have all the seasons .	1
Law & Order : SVU is definitely one of my favorite shows on TV . I only discovered it about a year and a half ago and have since become completely addicted . I purchased the first seven seasons and noticed that the eighth season was not on DVD yet . That did n't make much sense to me because this season aired in 2006-2007.At any rate , I 'm so happy that they are releasing season eight now ! I only hope that season nine follows soon after . And after this season is finished , I hope they do n't wait too long to put it on DVD as well.If you like Law & Order , chances are you 'll like this show too .	1
I now own 9 seasons of this video , I have always loved the Law & Order series , all of them and hope to own them all .	1
`` Law & Order '' stars Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni in 22 Season 8 episodes heavy on drama . The scripts deal with sex crimes , their perpetrators and victims with often frank language and disturbing , emotionally provocative scenarios . Guest stars in the eighth season include Marcia Gay Harden , Tim Daly , Blair Underwood , Bernadette Peters , Kim Delaney , and Kal Penn .	1
This show is incredible . Finally a well-written storyline that hooks you immediately ! ! Damian Lewis does a phenominal job . I liked him instantly and have consistently watched as his character grows . Life has excellent script writing . I really enjoy this show and hope it continues . Life requires viewers to actually have a brain as it stimulates deep thought ! ! WONDERFUL ! Keep it coming ! ! ! !	1
Life is my favorite show of the season.It is well acted , well written , with a fascinating and original premise.The show is full of philosophy , i.e . mans search for meaning and justice.Add to that a couple of beautiful actresses thrown into the mix , and `` Life '' is a thinking man 's perfect show ! 03/01/08I just rewatched all the pre stike episodes this week ... And again , I think this is the best drama of the year and one of the best ever on TV . If you have n't seen this show yet , do yourself a favor and start at the beggining and get addicted like me .	1
Prison changes a man , and it certainly changed former LAPD police officer Charlie Crews . From 1995 to 2007 he served hard time for murders he did n't commit . When DNA evidence surfaces proving his innocence , Crews is released and reinstated in the force ( he also lands some serious settlement money ) . Now Detective Crews finds himself working with a new partner even as he covertly seeks answers to what the hell happened.LIFE looks to be a very promising cop detective show , and not because the mysteries themselves are dynamite stuff or anything . No , the viewing addiction lies in watching the lead actor work his craft . Britisher Damian Lewis is simply fabulous as the wounded , brooding protagonist , trying to piece his life back together . It 's fun watching Crews apply his askewed perspective on his cases . I 'm normally not a fan of folks who sling zen about , but Lewis makes it an integral part of his character . And if it 's a loose cannon with an agenda slinging that zen , all the better . After all , zen helped Crews survive the penitentiary . I also like the little touches which remind us that Crews is still coping with his new found freedom , whether it 's his habit of munching on fresh fruit ( they never have fresh fruit in prison ) or his preference for light and open air or the fact that he still does n't have furniture in his home.Lewis 's supporting cast is so-so . I do enjoy Sarah Shahi , who 's a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader . She plays the no-nonsense Dani Reese , Crews ' new partner and not ecstatic about it . It 's true that her character tends to fall in the generic character-saddled-with-demons category , so , yeah , nothing new from that angle . But I think she has very good chemistry with Damian Lewis , and I just love her bemused or irritated reactions to Crews ' barrage of philosophical quirk . Two other actors who nicely play off Lewis are sexy Brooke Langton as Crews ' smitten attorney and Adam Arkin as Crews ' former inmate and current best friend and financial adviser.I like the show 's use of interview clips . They reveal certain insights and usher several sub-plots into the light . We learn , for instance , that Crews ' former partner did n't stand up for him and that Crews ' beautiful wife had divorced him while he was serving out his time . We even get a teeny whiff of the conspiracy surrounding Crews ' frame-up . More layers and foreshadowings , thanks to these clips.SPOILERS now.With the steady influx of crime drama on TV , I was n't planning on tuning in to this show . Then the pilot changed my mind . Other standouts ? `` Powerless '' is the powerful sixth episode , focusing on Dani as she pursues a rapist who 'd been haunting her AA meetings . `` Farthingale '' ( episode 8 ) is a fun one , an intriguing mystery which begins with a man having been half blown off by an exploding stove . Then there 's the intense two-part story arc ( episodes 10 & 11 : `` Dig A Hole '' & `` Fill It Up '' ) as Crews finally tracks down the man who committed the murders for which he was incarcerated . In `` Dig A Hole '' we also get to see a showdown of sorts between Crews ' new and former partners.SPOILERS end.I ca n't stress enough how good Damian Lewis is on this show . I remember him from HBO 's great wartime mini-series , Band of Brothers , and he made an impact back then , too , and was even nominated for a Golden Globe ( although he did n't win ) . Damian Lewis , with his complex performance here , elevates LIFE from a humdrum procedural into a riveting police drama . And the latest from the grapevine ( I think it was TV Guide ) indicates that NBC 's picked up this show for the rest of the season . So LIFE is good .	1
interesting from the start . i am not typcially a fan of any sort of cop show , but this one was so good i can not wait for the next episode . bought the season pass before it was even half over.the writing here is particularly good for network tv . this show could easily have been on hbo . i just hope nbc doesnt drop the ball on this one . judging from the rest of the slate available so far , this is the only one that isnt insulting and stupid . indeed its grand , nuanced and wonderful . and as i said , very very smert .	1
Despite the Monk-like , strange habits exhibited by the Cop-turned-Prisoner-turned-Detective , Charlie , the story provided an excellent synopsis for a cop trying to recapture what he had and then some , while secretly solving his past . I 'll give a few more episodes before making any solid commentments , but LIFE is so far , so good .	1
Chuck Bartowski works for a huge electronics store in Los Angeles , Buy More , but is still annoyed at being framed for a misdemeanour he did n't commit which led to him getting thrown out of Stanford University several years earlier . Bryce Larkin , Chuck 's former best friend and the guy who framed him , sends Chuck a mysterious email which causes him to pass out . When he wakes up , he discovers that he has downloaded the Intersect - the entire American secret database on international criminals , terrorists and other restricted subjects - into his brain . With the Intersect itself destroyed and Larkin dead , this means that the CIA and NSA need Chuck to help them defend American interests . Thus , he is forced into a double life of maintaining his working life at the Buy More whilst also helping CIA agent Sarah Walker and NSA agent John Casey fight international crime using his subliminal knowledge.Right from the start , Chuck puts its colours on the mast : this is going to be a show where the idea is to watch it and enjoy yourself , with even the vaguest hint of realism thrown out of the door . In an age where American network shows are being ignored in favour of 'edgy ' cable series , it 's a relief to find a show that is just so much damn fun.Chuck works on a number of levels . The casting is excellent , with Zachary Levi making for an appealing protagonist , balancing geekiness with likability and a growing ability to cope with the crazy situations he 's been thrown into . The ridiculously attractive Yvonne Strahovski makes for a great straight-woman as Sarah , who pulls off the 'coldly professional CIA agent ' character well but then develops the role to become more conflicted in her loyalties as the season progresses . The mighty Adam Baldwin - Jayne from Firefly - is also great as Casey , whose first instinct in any situation is extreme violence . The supporting cast , notably Chuck 's family and his fellow workers at the Buy More , are also well-cast and entertaining.The show also has a great deal of geek-cred . One episode hinges on Chuck and his best friend Morgan ( Joshua Gomez ) being able to carry off their Halloween trick of dressing up as a sandworm from the Dune books , whilst in another Chuck reminisces on bonding with an ex-girlfriend over playing EverQuest . Another episode uses ( classic 1980s text adventure ) Zork references as a plot point . References range from the pretty obvious to the fairly obscure , and catching them is fun in itself.The series follows the now-traditional structure of having a season-spanning arc mixed up with lots of stand-alone episodes . The arc is actually fairly slight ( there are hints that the NSA are building the Intersect 2.0 and indicating that once it is ready , Chuck will be expendable ) but there are some ongoing character arcs and developments from episode to episode that work quite well . One character point - that Morgan has a huge crush on Chuck 's sister - is actually a bit stalker-ish in the first couple of episodes due to the writers overegging it , but they sensibly pull it back and then dispose of it after giving Morgan another girlfriend later on , resolving the issue before it becomes too much of a problem.The individual episode storylines are mostly enjoyable , particularly the season finale in which the entire Buy More is cleared out after listening devices are discovered and the characters have to discover the fate of the store manager 's stuffed fish . Something that is slightly problematic is that the somewhat mundane storylines at the Buy More or involving Chuck 's family are often more enjoyable than the spy stuff , which is often formulaic ( though always watchable ) . There are problems that ideas are reused a few too many times ( particularly with Casey getting into trouble with a beautiful female agent which goes a bit wrong , which happens twice within a few episodes ) , but overall the series carries its stories off with aplomb . The show may actually have been helped by the first season being cut short by the 2007-08 Writer 's Strike , allowing the producers to end the season early before too many more story points were revisited and prepare themselves for the second season.The first season of Chuck ( **** ) is very entertaining , amusing and nicely geeky , with genuine wit and charm overcoming its more formulaic and cliched elements . The show balances humour and drama quite well , and the overall package is highly enjoyable . The season is available now on DVD in the UK and USA .	1
Great Show ! Nerds and Spooks . It 's the perfect partnership . Chuck , a Stanford drop out , working at the Buy More , gets an email from his sort of best friend . The email contains current and past U.S. intelligence . The email imprints all this data into Chuck 's memory . Soon after , Chuck meets Sara and falls head over heals for her . It turns out , she is his handler , and charged with keeping him safe , and the information intact . This is the story of how Chuck grows out of being just a Nerd Herder , to a real spy with the help of friends , family , the CIA , and Sara . It 's a story of nerds , love , action , and comedy . We love it .	1
What do you get when you combine a bumbling geek with hard hitting spies ? A truly entertaining comedy/action/adventure , sure to satisfy most geeks and non-geeks alike . Will the geek get the girl ? Find out ...	1
Based on the promos , this show did n't appeal to me at all . But I downloaded the free pilot figuring I could always just delete it if it was n't my cup of tea . But I found that I liked the main character and although the premise is unlikely , so are most TV shows , if you think about it.Its really more of a drama that has humor , rather than a comedy with drama ( if that makes any sense ) .I will watch this one .	1
`` Chuck '' was one of the outstanding new shows of the 2007-2008 TV season . It is a nicely balanced combination of action , spy spoof , and romantic comedy , featuring an outstanding cast and some sharp writing . `` Chuck : The Complete First Season '' contains all thirteen episodes from a strike-shortened season , and some nice extra features.The premise : Chuck Bartkowski ( Zachary Levi ) is a twenty-something computer geek working for the BuyMore , a big-box electronics store in L.A . He shares an apartment with his loving older sister Ellie ( Sarah Lancaster ) and her hunky doctor boyfriend . His life has been stuck in neutral since being kicked out of Stanford , framed for cheating by a roommate who also stole his girlfriend . One day , Chuck gets an email from his old roommate , which mysteriously implants a secret intelligence database known as the Intersect inside his head.Suddenly , Chuck must lead a double-life , By day , he labors in the BuyMore with his offbeat co-workers , including his slacker best buddy Morgan Grimes ( Joshua Gomez ) . By night , and sometimes by day , he is a CIA asset . He is `` handled '' by CIA agent Sarah Walker ( attractive Australian actress Yvonne Strahovski ) and hardnosed NSA assassin Major John Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) .The Intersect causes Chuck to `` flash '' on various passing clues , prompting a weeky mission to foil some villian and his or her dastardly plot . Invariably , the untrained and inept Chuck is told to `` wait in the car '' while Sarah and Casey pursue the bad guys . Also invariably , Chuck ventures from the car and either needs rescuing or bumbles his way into rescuing his handlers . Even though played tongue in cheek , the action sequences can get quite tense.At the heart of the series is the slowly evolving relationship between Chuck and Sarah , who as cover for her role as bodyguard , poses as his girlfriend . For the totally smitten Chuck , this pseudo relationship is `` complicated . '' The highly professional Sarah is not quite able to avoid developing feelings for the good hearted , decent and loyal Chuck . Their efforts to pass off their relationship in front of Chuck 's family and co-workers are the source of endless comedy and some genuinely touching moments . `` Chuck : The Complete First Season '' is very highly recommended as outstanding entertainment , just a little reminiscent of the old `` Get Smart '' series in an updated way . Chuck has been renewed for a full second season of 22 episodes ; the action and the romantic comedy continue .	1
NBC 's CHUCK is such a welcome surprise and one of the best and funniest TV shows I 've seen in a while , something which normally is an omen for immediate cancellation ( but , thankfully , NBC picked it up for the full season ) . CHUCK achieves that heady mix of humor , action , espionage , and even a dash of romance ( or pining , to be more exact ) . And it 'll have you rooting for the nerd hero Chuck Bartowski , the physically hapless but nonetheless invaluable new member of the U.S. secret agent fraternity . Whereas , before , Chuck was someone who for thrills lived life vicariously thru video games and films , he 's all of a sudden forced to cope with experiencing the very intense real thing.Several SPOILERS follow.The 411 on the premise and plot : A rogue CIA agent , just before being killed , downloads a wealth of top secret government files into the brain of his old college roommate Chuck Bartowski , a seemingly disastrous choice at first blush . Chuck is a social misfit , a computer geek who toils at the Nerd Herd electronics department of the Buy More supermarket . His support system consists of his best bud Morgan , who 's even more of a loser than Chuck , and Chuck 's lovely , protective sister Ellie ( Sarah Lancaster ) , who is perpetually concerned for him and his lack of a social life . That Chuck lives with Ellie and her laid back boyfriend , Captain Awesome , does n't exactly win him points with the cool set . But , for Chuck , things are about to change.Chuck meets Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski ) , who seems to really like him . But Sarah is really a CIA agent sent to wrest the stolen intel from him . Finding out that the top secret data is imbedded in his noggin , she is then assigned to keep tabs on him . To do so , Sarah works at Wienerlicious and poses as Chuck 's chica . Meanwhile , the NSA trots out its top operative , the no-nonsense John Casey ( the awesome Adam Baldwin ) , who as cover hires on as a Buy More sales clerk.Nowadays , danger and intrigue lurk at every corner for Chuck Bartowski , who finds himself leading a double life and is now sometimes referred to as the Intersect ( mostly by Casey ) . He speedily proves his value when the data in his brain enables him to put two and two together and uncover an assassination attempt . Soon , he 's tangling with ninjas , shadowy agents , terrorists , and bombs - and that 's just in the first episode . Further shows would unveil even greater peril and more mystery . Seeds of distrust are sown as Chuck also struggles with the constant hedging and fabrication brought on by his CIA and NSA minders . More importantly , despite obstacles put up by his nemesis , the evil Asian dude Harold Tang ( okay , he 's not really evil ... but he 's bald ) , Chuck 's trying out for the assistant manager gig at the Buy More . Good luck , Chuck.End SPOILERS.CHUCK is a consistently funny , funny show doubling as a straight-up spy thriller . There are plenty of slick , potent action sequences , but the heart of the series is the comic fish-out-of-water premise of the geek caught in serious cloak-and-dagger environs . The show provides a steady dosage of nerd/slacker humor which always has me smiling for the duration of the episodes . And , instead of Chuck suddenly developing kung fu skills , the series makes sure that Chuck remains inept and a bit cowardly ( Chuck would prefer to refer to it as being `` prudent '' ) . Zachary Levi as Chuck is wonderfully straight-faced yet has that comic timing down pat . He 's very sympathetic as a guy whose big heart is shyly on his sleeve.Which leads us to another focal point of the show : Chuck 's tentative relationship with the beautiful Sarah , who as a spy is forever on her guard and who 's still grieving over her recent past with a fellow agent . But there 's a connection between her and our favorite Nerd Herder , as Sarah realizes that Chuck really is a most decent dude . But only time will tell if it pans out . Australian Yvonne Strahovski is well cast as the lethal and accomplished secret agent , who can kick enemy agent heinie even a she dances sensuously with a clueless partner ( yes , that would be Chuck ) . Yet Strahovski , when called for , can lend a torn , vulnerable air to her calculating superspy ( check out `` Chuck versus the Nemesis '' to see just how conflicted she becomes ) . And , holy ministrone , she 's hot ! On the other hand , I do n't think the looming Adam Baldwin is hot , but he 's one of my favorite dudes to watch on TV . Fans of Joss Whedon will remember Baldwin from his memorable recurring roles in ANGEL and FIREFLY . Here , he makes for an intimidating sales clerk and government spy.I am currently in solid geek heaven with CHUCK . Here 's hoping NBC continues to support this show for a busload of seasons . Here 's to Chuck ( and friends ) waging war against irate Buy More patrons , staving off calculating co-workers , and also fending off some of the most diabolical enemies of America , mom , and apple pie . And all that while shouldering the stigma of a dead-end job . Way to go , Chuck !	1
New original shows like Chuck , Reaper and Pushing Daisies made tv worth watching last season despite the writer 's strike . Despite bad movies in 2007 having Chuck in the title `` Good Luck Chuck , Chuck and Larry '' , a tv show named Chuck was a success . It 's about a normal guy named Chuck ( Zachary Levi ) who works at a Best Buy type store called Buy More . His life changes when he inadvertently downloads critical government secrets into his brain . Two agents get assigned to protect him . One is a sexy woman who he instantly has a big crush on named Sarah ( Yvonne Strahovski ) . As his luck would have it , she also gets assigned to pose as his g/f . While pretending though , he 's not even allowed to date anyone else . She 's who he wants anyway but he ca n't really date her either.While the under-rated and always cool tough guy Adam Baldwin plays the other agent assigned to protect Chuck . Levi , Strahovski and Baldwin all work well together . It 's Joshua Gomez though who sometimes steals the show as Chuck 's best friend Morgan and who 's also a co-worker of his . Chuck has a hard time hiding from his family and friends that he 's working with the CIA.The show always has many twists and turns while often being very funny as well . It 's probably one of the best comedy/spy shows to ever hit television . Probably the only bad thing about this season is that it ended early due to writer 's strike and does n't have a season finale . If you missed it when it was on , I recommend getting the first season .	1
This is one of the better series to have appeared lately . Chuck is one of the Nerd Herd at Buy More who gets the complete memory of a supercomputer downloaded into his brain . He ends up being chased and protected by some secret agents , one who of course is a pretty blonde . You see the thing . But while this might have been a complete failure , the creators of the series have managed to come up with one of the successes of TV of lately .	1
Chuck Bartowski 's ( Zachary Levi ) life was going no where fast . True , he is head of the Nerd Herd at his local Buy More . But he lives with his sister Ellie ( Sarah Lancaster ) and her boyfriend Devon ( aka Captain Awesome , played by Ryan McPartlin ) . His best friend is Morgan ( Joshua Gomez ) , a fellow nerd who also works at Buy More.But things change drastically when Chuck gets an e-mail from former friend Bryce Larkin . The e-mail contains all the files of the intersect , the complete intelligence files of both the CIA and the NSA . And , to make things more exciting , Bryce has destroyed the original files.All the information gets downloaded into Chuck 's brain , making him a highly valuable government secret . So valuable that he has two bodyguards , Sarah Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski ) , a CIA agent who pretends to be Chuck 's girlfriend , and John Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) , a NSA who moves in next door to Chuck and takes a job at Buy More.Whenever Chuck sees something from the intersect , he flashes on more information . Unfortunately , these flashes are at random and uncontrollable . And Los Angeles seems to be a hot bed of activity . Even with two agents guarding him , Chuck finds himself in over his head with his new life as a spy . Can he survive and keep his secret ? Yeah , yeah , I know what you 're thinking . The premise sounds unbelievable . And if you stop and think about it , it is . Fortunately , the show never gives you time to think . They cram everything into these episodes . There 's action and intrigue , developing storylines involving the intersect and Chuck 's past , romance with Sarah that she is not willing to admit is there , and plenty of laughs . Many of the laughs come from the sub-plots focused on the Buy More . But we also get laughs from Chuck 's reaction to his new world.But in case this all sounds disjointed , let me assure you it works beautifully . Everything is balanced and blended so that it seamlessly flows from one event to the next . And the characters are outstanding . Honestly , that is what holds all of this together . Even gruff Casey is fun when it comes down to it.If , by some chance , you missed this show when it premiered last fall , correct that now . You 'll be hooked by the time the second episode is over and watching them as fast as you can . Personally , I can hardly wait for season 2 to start .	1
I really enjoy Chuck . He is Everyman , caught up in situations beyond his sphere of experience . But Chuck rises to every occasion -- often with fear and trembling -- and somehow survives . The cast , many of whom were new to me , is great .	1
The first season of Chuck is something you do n't see on TV everyday . They have combined humor and action in a way that keeps everything fresh . It 's the right balance , and they have the right actors to keep the material exciting . Zachary Levi is the only person I can see in the lead role now . I had never heard of the guy before watching Chuck , but without him the show would n't be half as good . Having Adam Baldwin of Firefly and Serenity fame is a nice bonus , not to mention Yvonne Strahovski ( try saying that one ) as Chuck 's super spy partner . The stories are a bit silly at times , but this show is just a blast to watch . For pure entertainment value , this one ranks high on my TV shows I do n't miss list .	1
If you want an awesomely funny everyman show , pop this one in the DVD player , sit back and just enjoy the absurdity , emotion and action .	1
... but I ca n't think of anything to add that has n't already been said . It 's a wonderful show , a clever blend of humor , romance , and action . Great acting , great characters , etc . I 'm writing this mostly because I 've been re-reading Cerebus and I just had to give 5 stars to a show I bet Dave Sim does n't like . Hehehe .	1
The show is great . It 's geeky but not too geeky , it 's funny but serious and action packed too . I like the casting , Chuck is great.This episode sets up the premise for the entire series well and I ca n't wait to see what the rest of the season holds . I 'll be setting up a season pass for this one !	1
Charles `` Chuck '' Bartowski is an average guy working in the electronics department of the local BuyMore - average job , average friends , average life . He lives with his sister Ellie and her boyfriend Devon , and though both are lovely and supportive , the fact that they 're both doctors ( and that Devon is aptly-nicknamed `` Captain Awesome '' ) means that they 're a constant reminder of Chuck 's inability to get his life together . He 's still hung-up over getting kicked out of university after his best friend Bryce Larkin framed him for cheating on an exam - and stole his girlfriend along the way.But then one day , completely out of the blue , Chuck gets an e-mail from Bryce . He opens it , and unwittingly has an entire database of government secrets downloaded into his head . Turns out that Bryce was a rogue spy for the CIA , and the last thing he managed to do before his death was send the stolen file to Chuck 's computer.Now whenever he sees someone or something that 's connected to international espionage , he has `` flashes '' that warn him of various criminals , terrorists and assassins in his midst ( of which there seems to be a surprising amount in his neighbourhood ) . Enter Sarah Walker and John Casey . The former is a CIA agent that 's been sent to find the missing data by feigning romantic interest in him , only to release that it 's hidden within Chuck 's brain . The latter is an intimidating NSA operative ( and the man who shot Bryce ) who is incredulous at the thought a man like Chuck could have a super-computer implanted in his brain.The two of them are relegated to monitoring Chuck ( Casey as a BuyMore sales clerk , Sarah in the Wienerlicious across the road ) , occasionally drawing him into operations when they 're in need of the specialized information stored inside his head . Just to add a little intrigue to the proceedings , Sarah poses as Chuck 's girlfriend - given that she 's stunning , all of Chuck 's family and co-workers think he 's hit the jackpot.Needless to say , you 'll need to suspend your disbelief if you 're going to enjoy `` Chuck '' . MoreGet SmartthanSpooks , moreJames BondthanThe Bourne Identity , this show plays around with the spy genre , infusing it with comedy , action-sequences , pratfalls , wisecracks and romantic complications . Most of the premise is based on Chuck 's fish-out-of-water experiences in the world of espionage , and thankfully the writers do n't feel the need to turn him into an expert any time soon . Armed with only his technological know-how and sheer dumb luck , Chuck occasionally gets to save the day , though the heroics are usually left to the professionals.It 's only in the relationships that things are taken a bit more seriously . Chuck pines for Sarah , but she has a dark history of her own that 's gradually revealed over the course of the thirteen-episode first season . Comic relief characters such as Morgan Grimes ( Chuck 's best friend ) and Captain Awesome are given moments of pathos and three-dimensionality . Chuck 's relationship with his beloved sister is strained when his double-life starts interfering with hers . And eventually it transpires that there was more to Chuck 's expulsion from university than he first realized . `` Chuck '' managed to survive the Writer 's Strike and went on to run for five seasons , bourn up by the breezy writing and the versatile acting . Australian Yvonne Strahovski is a real beauty , but manages to combine the lethal efficiency of her character with a real warmth and vulnerability , whilst Adam Baldwin was a shoe-in for the role of John Casey ( he 's basically slightly-less psychotic version of Jayne fromFirefly ) . Sarah Lancaster is a joy as Chuck 's older sister , and Joshua Gomez manages to make Morgan 's obsession with Chuck 's life not quite as creepy as it sounds . But it 's really Zachary Levi that carries the show as the sweet-natured , in-over-his-head Chuck , who is simultaneously delighted and terrified by the new direction his life has taken.It 's all tailor-made escapism for your average twenty-something nerd , in which a shy and self-effacing everyman is treated to wild adventures and a gorgeous love interest , but with an overarching plot that plasters over some of the more one-off silliness .	1
Warning ! Spoilers ! CHUCK VERSUS THE NEMESIS is the latest in a string of very nice episodes . I 've not been charmed by everything in this series . There are fans of the show who love Morgan and those who utterly detest him . I 'm of the latter camp . And early in the season I almost gave up on the show due to the series initial emphasis on standalone episodes couples with more Morgan than I could tolerate . But there has been slightly less Morgan ( a little of him goes a very , very , very long way ) and far more in the way of a serial structure to the show . As a result , my interest has gone up sharply.This episode picks up from the previous one , in which Sarah kissed Chuck , only to discover that her former lover/CIA partner Bryce was still alive . Obviously , this complicates everything . I 'll keep the spoilers light except to add that the episode ends with Sarah being forced to choose between staying on her assignment with Chuck or going off with Bryce . Given that she has a longterm contract on the show , there is n't a great deal of tension . The question obviously is n't whether Sarah will end up staying , but under what conditions.I 'm coming to like this show more and more as the ongoing story continues . I 'm really delighted that it has not persisted in offering nothing but standalone episodes . I 've mentioned in many reviews that the one massive advantage TV has over the movies is the serial format . A TV series can develop a narrative and provide character development that no movie ever made can even remotely hope to match . Shows that turn their backs on that natural superiority of TV to movies do not receive my respect .	1
I enjoyed the first episode ( pilot ) of Chuck when it first aired on NBC . I became a fan and watched it until the show ended . Season one was one of the best seasons and I am glad I own it .	1
There 's everything in the world to love about this series - great plotline , excellent character development , witty dialogue , great soundtrack , and incredibly inventive premise . All of the actors from the primary players to the support cast does an excellent job.Chuck - the leader of the Nerd Herders at the Buy More gets an email from his former college roommate . The email downloads a super computer into Chuck 's brain . Suddenly Chuck ( a likable but aimless college dropout ) becomes one of the CIA 's most important assets . To protect Chuck the CIA and NSA bring in two specialists - Sarah and John Casey . The entire series becomes what happens to a normal old , every day guy when something really extraordinary drops into his life . Throw in a little spy danger , some romance , and some crazy family and friends and you 've got Chuck .	1
This show at first looked a bit laughable to me , but I assure you this is a well conceived series . All the actors have been chosen with great care , and they interact with one another as though they had been working with eachother their entire lives . They have great chemistry in every scene , it 's like they 're best friends in real life . The show has alot of comedy which is only broken up by action and dramatic story telling . What I love about the show is it 's many references to movies , television , and video games . Chuck is not James Bond , not even close in fact . It is hilarious watching him try to fit into the world of espionage . He does have two bodyguards Sarah and Casey to protect him . Sarah is a beautiful blonde agent that is sent to be his girlfriend ( lucky guy ) , and Casey is the heavy artillery side of the team . It 's really fun to see Chucks and Sarah 's relationship grow throughout the season . They clearly have great chemistry and that leads to some romantic moments . It 's sorta like on LOST with Jack and Kate you know they want to be with each other but the plot dictates otherwise just teasing you here and there . Chuck also has a best friend Morgan who is responsible for most of the laughs as we watch his pathetic life , and the way he clings to Chuck 's every move . Chuck and his family really keep the show grounded and really relatable to the every day guy . This show began well and only got better in season 2.The picture quality is another thing all together . It has grain in almost every frame . The picture is just filled with noise almost the entire time . It really is distracting and is quite disappointing . Chuck surpasses the picture quality with it 's amazing characters and stories . The extras are decent with some deleted scenes , a gag reel , and audition footage . The series is a mix of Alias , Mission Impossible , and Get Smart . It is the ultimate comedy hour mixed with great action .	1
Yes , my inner-geek rejoiced minutes into the first episode of Chuck : S1 , with the reference to Prince 's `` Batdance '' song . Constant pop-culture references are just one of the things that makes Chuck about the best show on TV and probably too smart to last very long.The cast is fantastic : from Chuck himself to Big Mike , Captain Awesome , Morgan , and even the cameo roles , everyone is well written with depth . Adam Baldwin is one of the most underappreciated comedic actors in Hollywood . Its a damn funny show , but more than that , it includes a little bit of everything , from suprisingly solid action to a dab of romance.My main worry is how long they can sustain the show 's formula , from Chuck 's memory flashes/missions to the tension between he and Yvonne Strahovski . But I will be there for the whole ride .	1
The premise is not something I remember being done before now . It has been brought to life with consumate skill by Damian Lewis and Sarah Sahi as well as Adam Arkin.Watch it and decide for yourself .	1
It is a catchy plot line similar to The Finder . I enjoy the mind games Crews comes up with . The plots were good and kept me interested .	1
Riding the Band of Brothers wave of Fame Damian Lewis is great . This was a great show . Loved the cast . Fun to watch the actors work together . This show , like many , was not given a chance when it was on NBC . From what I heard many did not care for Crews ' flakiness but that was part of what made the show unique from all the other cop shows . Well worth the watch .	1
Often you have to give new shows a while to warm up , and episode 4 or 5 is much better than the pilot . But Life really knocks it out of the park from the first episode and it does n't go downhill at all . I 'm so sorry that this series did n't really make it , because I loved it . Charlie Crews is a fascinating character , complex , striving . I loved the 'Zen ' theme . The series as a whole has 2 streams - the overarching who set up Charlie and killed his friends , and the week to week cases and both are excellent.Watch it , you 'll want to watch the rest .	1
good premise for plot . the actors are believable in their roles . action is high paced and keeps me interested in remaining connected .	1
Great casting.Fascinating lead character and gripping plots as well as an interesting background story unfolding..I ca n't wait for the next episode .	1
This is a good series with Damien Lewis , of & # 34 ; Homeland & # 34 ; fame , playing a former LAPD police officer , who returns to the force after having been wrongly imprisoned for twelve years . He 's received millions of dollars for his false imprisonment , but rejoins the force to track down those who set him up . It appears that there are only two seasons , but we are enjoying it .	1
Unique show . Ca n't wait to see how season 1 ends .	1
Life Season 1 has great characters , excellent acting , and a plot that keeps you wanting to go on to the next episode . Season 2 is every bit as fascinating .	1
However , its uncanny and somewhat bizarre cases in Southern California become a bit much on a regular basis . Nevertheless , the theme of a law enforcement officer 's return after having spent twelve years in prison for a crime he was later cleared of , is entertaining . I rate it four stars .	1
A lighthearted detective series with well played characters . Even though it concerns murders the show is full of lighthearted dialog.and the characters work work together .	1
My wife and I watched all of Seasons 1 and 2 , and found them to be entertaining , funny , and very enjoyable . I particularly liked the fact that the show represented two people , acting as partners , who found each other interesting , but not sexually irresistable . I was very sorry to learn that there was nothing after Season 2 . Surprising . I would have thought that finding sponsors for this show would have been easy . Maybe too many Christians afraid of Zen .	1
This show is a little dark - the premise being a cop spends 12 years in jail for a crime he did not commit . Although he is awarded big bucks when he is freed , he goes back on the job . He is not welcomed back . I think this is probably true to life . The acting is good . I do not care for the female head honcho ... I think she had something to do with the original setup .	1
I will be so shocked if NBC does n't do a season 3 , this is such a fantastic show . This is a quality show . I adore a quirky , unique charachter ( but not in a Monk way , ugh ) . This show is fantastic , wonderful actors and superb writting . I 've seen every episode and will be buying the DVDs for my collection .	1
Who was Damian Lewis anyhow ? W O W what a dynamic character as Detective Charlie Crews in the TV series & # 34 ; Live. & # 34 ; NBC really dropped the ball by letting this series go with only two seasons . NBC blames the 2007-2008 Writers Guild strike by cutting the first season to only 11 episodes . NBC started the second season on Monday then flipped it to Friday , back to Monday , then back to Friday and eventually to Wednesdays I think . I loved it but I could n't find it most of the time . There are 21 episodes for the second and sadly last season of & # 34 ; LIFE. & # 34 ; Regardless , we have an albeit short first season but it is a block buster . LIFE is a show that should have been a multi-season series . NBC was harassed by idiot reviewers who could n't see through their thick glassed windows having been scratched by watching too much TV for their prior reviews . LIFE is and will always be a classic . Damian Lewis and Sarah Shahi has a 'pop your eyes out ' magnetic on screen performances . The best recurring actor was Garret Dillahunt as Roman Nevikov . Roman is the greatest hope for a TV nemesis ever . Introduced in the first season , you will find him back in full force in season two . They did wrap up the series successfully in season two . When the final episode & # 34 ; One & # 34 ; aired April 8 , 2009 , the music was remarkable . Thankfully , I had the episode recorded so I could identify the songs . Soon , I learned that the DVDs and all future airings of the last episode would never have the original songs . Today , when you watch the last episode & # 34 ; One & # 34 ; you will find the ending flat due to the ridiculous faux pas of NBCs license for the songs . None-the-less , LIFE is a spectacular & # 34 ; 32-episode & # 34 ; series that will always be in the hearts of viewers who worked hard to find it .	1
This is a good show and the only thing I do n't like is there are so few episodes . The character is very Zen but he wields a lot of power . He is played well by the actor . Sorry , I am very poor at remembering names but the show is very good .	1
Charlie Crews trough Damian Lewis approaches detective work through a combination of intelligence , in zen . Wrongfully imprisoned the shows always has a great lead case and solving his own is advanced . It is the greatest shame this show was not picked up ongoing . I & # 8217 ; ve watched it 3 times since it was cancelled .	1
Discovered this quite by accident and watched the entire season in one weekend . Love the interaction between Crewes and Reese and the mystery within a mystery concept .	1
Life has a good pace , is clever and ironic , with likable characters . It is not the nasty bloodbath you see in so many shows these days .	1
Compelling , funny moments , great characters , excellent casting & performances . Really good writing ! Just finished my second run through this season . I do n't often replay episodics , but this one is THAT GOOD !	1
I have n't watched TV in years-got fed up with the high cost-low return from the various cable/satellite companies available . I do watch some of the shows available online offered by the different networks on their sites . Amazon happened to offer the first episode of Life free . Free is a good thing and also a great way to gain viewers like myself . I am hooked . `` Life '' is not your run of the mill cop show . Charlie is not your run of the mill cop . I own season 1 on DVD and have already pre-ordered season 2 ( have to love Amazon 's price guarantee ) and season 2 is a must see and in my case must own . If you have n't seen Life you have n't lived .	1
Quirky , clever , and very satisfying , Life is an excellent police procedural that takes place in Los Angeles . LAPD detective partners Crews and Reese are perfect foils , seeming opposites that play off each other 's best and worst personality traits in such a way that the viewer ends up liking both characters , a difficult feat . Actors Lewis and Shahi do an excellent job . Lewis ' American accent is spot on , and Shahi ( a very beautiful woman ) does the tough-cop , no-nonsense , recovering addict role just right . Other characters/actors are also great . Although I wanted the series to go on and on ( it was cancelled ) , please do n't be hesitant to watch the 2 seasons that are available . The underlying mystery , developed a little at a time through each episode , is satisfyingly ( if perhaps not completely ) resolved at the end . I watched the last episode last night , and I 'm a little sad now . I will miss Crews and Reese .	1
A story that lets you follow without complications or convoluted stories . Easy to get hooked . a different anti-hero but very entertaining .	1
This is definitely one of the most interesting and intriguing crime dramas I have seen in a long time.Too bad it only lasted two seasons . I love the main character with his Zen philosophy , which made for some very nice creative lines from the writers .	1
I never saw this promoted on TV and I wish it had been more popular so there were additional seasons . It 's unique and funny . It is an unusual , almost unbelievable storyline but it unfolds in such a way that - if you stay with it - you become hooked . At least I did . I want to know more about why this cop ended up in prison , what 's with him and his lawyer , his partner , his exwife and just about everyone else he knew and meets up with . Damien Lewis ' character is definitely a contradiction . One of the things I do n't like is the repetitive interviews with people about what they think of the cop going to jail . It 's seldom new , they keep playing the same stuff over and over . That is a bit annoying . But the series and the actors are great . Adam Arkin has a quirky part , very similar to the character he played on Northern Exposure and equally effective .	1
Loved it on TV but missed some episodes . Was nice to be able to watch the whole thing . Do n't know why they did n't keep it going .	1
I like how off the wall the show was . It was very entertaining . I have shared this show with several friends .	1
So far I enjoyed watching , very funny sometimes.12 more words required , this is why I don ; t review more often , what is wrong with my first line .	1
This is a wry and dry entertainment that is quite good and enjoyable to watch . The only quarrel I have with it is that 43 minutes ( give or take ) is too little to tell a story that does n't rely entirely on bang-bang with guns or words . The star , Damian Lewis , is just right for the part , ( or the part was written to be just right for him ) , carrying off the role of the police officer who served a wrongful dozen years in prison , with a proper mix of the fey and the aggressive in pursuit of the real killer in that case , as well as the cases now assigned to him . As his new partner on the police force , Sarah Shahi , nicely fills the role of the more aggressive of the two , without descending into the current curse for policewomen ( and other females in authority positions ) on television : over aggressiveness , arrogance , a constant in your face attitude and superwoman command of every means of physical aggression . They are tiresome ; her trimmed down version makes a good counterpart to the completely laid back Lewis . Adam Arkin , makes and excellent but not obtrusive ex-con buddy fo Lewis . He hits the special demands of that buddy role , present but never over-shadowing the star , just right.So , season one , a good start for what could be a long lasting show .	1
unlike anything else you 've ever seen anywhere.ahead of it 's time.funny and deep at the same time.season 1 was short because of the WGA strike and the show never found it 's audience . for a show this different , one and a half seasons was n't enough .	1
`` Life : Season One '' is something completely different in a police procedural . Charlie Crews is an L.A. cop who spent 12 years in prison for a mass murder for which he was framed . Sprung from prison by a crusading attorney , Crews is back on the police force with a promotion to detective and a multi-million dollar legal settlement.The show operates on several levels . Charlie Crews must readjust to life on the outside , where there is sunshine , fresh fruit , unfamiliar technology , and a large empty mansion to live in . His wife and his former life are gone , although not entirely . He approaches his new job from a unique angle , shaped by the Zen philosophy he adopted to survive inside.The police force has decidedly mixed feelings about his return ; his new partner , Dani Reese , is a recovering substance abuser under pressure from their chain of command to find a excuse to get rid of him . She is also the daughter of a retired policeman who may have been responsible for Charlie 's frame-up.The cases in each episodes would be fairly ordinary but for Charlie 's Zen angle , which allows him both insight and compassion . In one heartwrenching confrontation , Charlie is forced to shoot an armed and dangerous suspect , then comforts the dying man by convincing him he is only having a bad dream.Charlie 's secret crusade to unravel the conspiracy that put him in jail gives him ruthless enemies who seem uncannily aware of his every move . Each episode teeters on the knife-edge tension that Charlie can be sent back to jail or even killed if he gets too close to the truth . Charlie gets help from his former cellmate , a white collar criminal ; his attorney , who dangerously mixes a professional and a personal relationship with Charlie ; and his ex-wife , who has considerable guilt over divorcing Charlie in prison . `` Life : Season One '' is very highly recommended as a different kind of police procedural . British actor Damian Lewis carries off Charlie Crews with a grounded , offbeat charm . The early episodes are a little jarring , counterpointing Charlie 's new life with the one he lost . However , the series settles into a good rythmn , building to a hard-hitting season finale .	1
i liked the flow of the show , loved the way that Diann , and Charlie were together ... Did n't like the parting of the two ... .Why did they not have a season 3 ... .on the last show of season 2 , you are left hanging ... .Not good ... .	1
A little too quirky sometimes for us experienced TV detective show watchers -- still enjoyable , just outside the realm of realistic . The female partner is , disappointingly , a weak link .	1
A different kind of a movie . The story unfolds a little more with each episode . I will watch season two .	1
One season is not enough . Great concept of a wrongfully convicted man being released back into his old life . I loved how he used what he learned in prison to better live in the free world . Great cop show .	1
We really enjoyed every minute of this show ! ! The acting was great and the story line sure keeps you interested . We are looking forward to watching Season 2 .	1
This is another man 's search for himself in which the hero , Crews , goes to great lengths to eradicate the evil that harmed him . The series is too long . It should have been a mini-series .	1
I just sort of stumbled onto this show , was pretty hooked after the pilot , each episode got better and better . I really enjoyed the multi-plot format , wittiness , twists & turns , and for the most part , I was surprised . Kept watching episode after episode , 3 am , time for bed ! LOL Too bad there were n't more than 2 seasons .	1
I found this show very interesting ... only seen 3 episodes so far but I 've enjoyed the storylines . I would recommend it	1
This program was excellent in both character development and plot . The interlocking quest of the main character throughout all episodes and the obvious faults of all three chief role players kept one 's interest right through to the end of season two and leaves one hoping for more . Why such a superior show as Life should discontinue production after two seasons while meaningless senselessness goes on season after season after season is an intellectual puzzlement .	1
Prison changes a man , and it certainly changed former LAPD police officer Charlie Crews . From 1995 to 2007 he served hard time for murders he did n't commit . When DNA evidence surfaces proving his innocence , Crews is released and reinstated in the force ( he also lands some serious settlement money ) . Now Detective Crews finds himself working with a new partner even as he covertly seeks answers to what the hell happened.LIFE looks to be a very promising cop detective show , and not because the mysteries themselves are dynamite stuff or anything . No , the viewing addiction lies in watching the lead actor work his craft . Britisher Damian Lewis is simply fabulous as the wounded , brooding protagonist , trying to piece his life back together . It 's fun watching Crews apply his askewed perspective on his cases . I 'm normally not a fan of folks who sling zen about , but Lewis makes it such a quirky and integral part of his character . And if it 's a loose cannon with an agenda slinging that zen , all the better . After all , zen helped Crews survive the penitentiary . I also like the little touches which remind us that Crews is still coping with his new found freedom , whether it 's his habit of munching on fresh fruit ( they never have fresh fruit in prison ) or his preference for light and open air or the fact that he still does n't have furniture in his home.Lewis 's supporting cast is so-so . I do enjoy Sarah Shahi , who 's a former Dallas Cowboy cheerleader . She plays the no-nonsense Dani Reese , Crews ' new partner and not ecstatic about it . It 's true that her character tends to fall in the generic character-saddled-with-demons category , so , yeah , nothing new from that angle . But I think she has very good chemistry with Damian Lewis , and I just love her bemused or irritated reactions to Crews ' barrage of philosophical quirk . Two other actors who nicely play off Lewis are sexy Brooke Langton as Crews ' smitten attorney and Adam Arkin as Crews ' former inmate and current best friend and financial adviser.I like the show 's use of interview clips . They reveal certain insights and usher several sub-plots into the light . We learn , for instance , that Crews ' former partner did n't stand up for him and that Crews ' beautiful wife had divorced him while he was serving out his time . We even get a teeny whiff of the conspiracy surrounding Crews ' frame-up . More layers and foreshadowings , thanks to these interview clips.SPOILERS now.With the steady influx of crime drama on TV , I was n't planning on tuning in to this show . Then the pilot changed my mind . Other standout episodes ? `` Powerless '' is the powerful sixth episode , focusing on Dani as she pursues a rapist who 'd been haunting her AA meetings . `` Farthingale '' ( episode 8 ) is a fun one , an intriguing mystery which begins with a man having been half blown off by an exploding stove . Then there 's the intense two-part , season closing story arc ( episodes 10 & 11 : `` Dig A Hole '' & `` Fill It Up '' ) as Crews finally tracks down the man who committed the murders for which he was incarcerated . In `` Dig A Hole '' we also get to see a showdown of sorts between Crews ' new and former partners.SPOILERS end.I ca n't stress enough how good Damian Lewis is on this show . I remember him from HBO 's great wartime mini-series , Band of Brothers , and he made big noise back then , too , and was even nominated for a Golden Globe ( although he did n't win ) . Damian Lewis , with his complex performance here , elevates LIFE from a humdrum procedural into a riveting police drama . And since NBC has already indicated that this wonderful drama series will be picked up for a second season , well , LIFE is good .	1
Once again , a unique show , with great writing and acting , is killed off before it has a chance to build an audience . I somehow missed this show completely when it originally aired back in '07-'08 . This indicates to me how little this show had to have been promoted when it initially aired . I discovered it only recently on streaming Netflix and I believe the second evening I began watching it I got so hooked I sat up watching episodes until nine o'clock the following morning . I could not believe a network show this good only lasted two seasons and got such low ratings . Damien Lewis and Sarah Shahi made for a great detective duo and each episode was incredibly well written with unique plot lines . I had never seen a show with so many great guest stars that I never seen anywhere else before . All facets of this show just screamed QUALITY and ORIGINALITY , but not surprisingly this meant a death knell for LIFE . A similar type show with a similar fate was last years PRIME SUSPECT with Maria Bello . It did n't even last a full season , I do n't think . So if you want to guarantee a brief tenure for your new show , simply hire quality actors and writers and it 'll be gone before you know it . Congrats again to you network execs ! And you wonder why your audiences have been decreasing year after year . In the word ( s ) of Homer Simpson ( AS WELL AS NETWORK PROGRAMMING EXPERTS ) ... ... ... DOH ! ! ! !	1
... .trust me . Is it perfect ? No . But at 19.99 its a steal considering what is being charged for other formulaic cop shows of much lesser value .	1
LIFE the tv series was only on two seasons , 2007-2009 . I missed it then and am soh so glad I found it now . Just finished season one and will order season two . So very well done . Rand Ravich gets my kudos for a job well done . LIFE is a cop show , centering on Det . Charlie Crews . who is just released from a twelve year prison term , as new evidence clears him His settlement , great wealth and be a cop again . We follow week to week stories and Charlies quest to find out who set him up . Very good supporting cast with Sarah Shabi as his partner and Adam Arkin , as friend and financial advisor , oh , a fellow con . Try this series . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED .	1
I never heard of this show . I watched the first episode . there was something different about it , not sure I liked it . I had to watch a few more to see if I really cared about the show and the people in it . I began to care about what was going to happen next -- so I liked Life . Lots of positive messages as well as you never know what is going to happen at any given moment . Live your LIFE everyday-ON PURPOSE !	1
this series was a pleasant surprise - every segment we are reminded that this man spent over a decade behind bars and he craves light , fresh fruit and other small comforts we take for granted . Totally likeable , believable character in a harsh world of reality .	1
A cop that spent 12 years in a hardcore prison who is then acquitted . He returns to work as a detective that has received a multi million lawsuit reward.Damian Lewis ( of Homefront fame ) , Sashi Shahi ( of Fairly Legal ) , and Adam Arkin give good performances in this all too short series set in LA . Good story lines throughout ! !	1
This is a fantastic , compelling , thrilling show ... ..all the actors are seared onto the screen ... ..there are so many layers and plots , twists and turns ... ... the prison/police work tension ... .it just all works very well !	1
I liked this show and wish it were still being produced . The lead character is a smart former policeman ( detective ) who was wrongfully convicted of a crime and served , what , 12 years in the pen until he was exonerated and released . He wins a wrongful conviction suit and becomes rich but goes back to being a policeman . He got through the time in the pen by learning and practicing zen and by being smart . Now he brings that smartness and zen quality to the job of detective . As he goes about his detective duties he is also trying to figure out who set him up for the conviction . It is quirky and unusual - a rich detective , who as a very different outlook on life , is smart , and brings a very unusual philosophy of life to his work . Highly entertaining lead character .	1
Loved it and bought Season 2 but slightly disappointed in the turn of events regarding the character inter-actions on Season 2 .	1
He was not the best choice for the part I do not think . Not the type to draw a lot of women to the show . It is like the heat of the night . They never figured out that all the women where tuning in to see Bubba not the star . lol My pop came in and said you gals watching Carol O conner and my mom and I both said at the same time No Bubba . and grinned at each other . And we had never said to each other that . lol	1
keeps my interest . Pleased not to see a whole lot of fighting and car chases . So far not recurring methdology being played out .	1
Damian Lewis plays a good part.. I enjoyed most of the story lines not to heavy , and no bad language..such a nice feature .	1
a little offbeat gets better as it moves along , not totally realistic butsome interesting plots . will be interesting to see what happens .	1
A little quirky at times . The lead character is definitely quirky but in a good way . The homicides can be a little quirky and weird but it makes for an interesting show . The characters are strong and the actors are good . Sad to see only 2 seasons to watch and nearly done with Season 2 but I 've enjoyed it .	1
Touching , transcendent , witty , snappy , thoughtful fun . The female cop character is too mean , closed-minded , and coddled by all the males around her but Sarah Shahi performance is serviceable , and she is extremely pretty . The Adam Arkin character is a total winner.The 2nd season 's plot lines go off the rails , then the series was cancelled , but the first season of 'Life ' is procedural perfection .	1
I like the concept , actors are well cast and production values good . Too bad there are only two seasons . I ca n't wait to watch the next episode . There is a new crime to solve plus the ongoing mystery of who is really guilty of the murders Mark ( lead character , forgot his name ) was sent to prison for . I also like the bits of philosophy interjected throughout the show .	1
Have only watched Season 1 so far , and I love this show ! Damien Lewis is fantastic . I would loved to have been able to just sit and watch this show straight thru because it is that good , but I had to settle for watching it over about 2 weeks time . Ca n't wait to watch season 2 !	1
The pile of manure being the innumerable other cop shows out there that do the same exact thing . How on earth do all of them have viewership 's ? They do n't deserve them . They are fairly unoriginal.Not so with Life . It is delightful . The style and such of the cinematography is sleek but unique , a hard combination to come by.The writing is so much fun . One minute deadly serious . One minute laugh out loud funny . And always sharp no matter what.Acting is incredible in every way . Story is fun.Watch this instead of those other shows that are simply boring and tired .	1
My wife and I had never heard of this series , but found it on Amazon Prime . The male lead is recognizable from the hit cable series & # 34 ; Homeland. & # 34 ; Yes , it 's another cop detective drama and there 's always a murder to solve . But there are enough other quirky plot twists and the murders also have twists . You find out right away that the male lead detective was himself framed and spent 12 years in prison for a murder he did not commit . So these various parallel plots and plot twists keep it very interesting . The acting is good and there is also an element of humor . So all in all , it is a very entertaining series that makes you want to keep watching it .	1
This appeals to me because of the story inside the stories . While the main character is working to clear his name he is also working to clear new cases . And through it all can not see that he is being ripped off by his accountant/manager . This is a 'Do I laugh or cry ' show . Justice is Blind but some people just keep banging their head against the steel door until it one or the other gives way .	1
It started out very new and really different . It just got better . Like the & # 34 ; people & # 34 ; and also the & # 34 ; police & # 34 ; work was still brought into the storyline . Do like to have more of that - and less of the personal & # 34 ; stuff & # 34 ; - not watching a & # 34 ; soap & # 34 ; . Too bad the show apparently did notstay on long .	1
I had watched part of the first episode a while back but decided against it for one reason or another and then I forgot about it . Recently I saw it come up again and decided to give it a second chance . Am I ever glad I did . I love this show ! I really like the format of it - the way the characters ' actions and dialogue are set up . Adding Alan Arkin to the cast was an excellent choice . He 's such a good actor as is the main character Charlie , played by Damian Lewis , who plays this insightful man who is so grateful for the simple things in life having been in prison for many years for a crime he did not commit . Very refreshing !	1
Plots for individual episodes are average . Dynamics between the regular characters are high octane entertainment . Recurring theme of season is riveting -- - who REALLY killed the people our hero was framed for . And how will they be brought to justice . And how will our hero survive all the conspiracy surrounding him in his quest to make things right ? Stayed tuned keep watching . I will	1
I loved this show ! I watched the first season in sequence and then followed it w/ season 2 . This is another fine tv show that falls victim to corporate poor choices in not finding an audience to keep it on the air for more than 2 season . Highly recommend .	1
I was remarkably sorry to only see 2 seasons of this show . I enjoyed watching so much . I made a marathon and viewed both seasons over about 2 days . Fantastic and full of engaging acting . Lots of talent .	1
Loved this series . Interesting , different , wonderful performances and very well directed . Could n't ask for more . Look forward very much to season 2 !	1
This show was a real & # 34 ; sleeper & # 34 ; . The main characters were excellent and played off each other very well . It 's to bad the series ended after 2 seasons .	1
Stories on multiple levels , good characters and good timing . Peel an onion , Russian dolls , take your pick for how each episode advances multiple story lines . The cars add some metallic spice .	1
The network that had & # 34 ; Life & # 34 ; must have kept it more secret and covered up than the Benghazi fiasco , which is why , without yet watching season 2 , that they cancelled it prematurely . I & # 34 ; found & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Life & # 34 ; backtracking from & # 34 ; Fairly Legal & # 34 ; , another secret show , staring Sarah Shahi ... and what a surprise to find Damian Lewis was the actual star which interested me because of his staring work on & # 34 ; Homeland & # 34 ; . So , seriously , I backtracked into Life from more current shows . I ran into Fairly Legal on & # 34 ; Cloo & # 34 ; channel . They had a & # 34 ; marathon & # 34 ; of Fairly Legal and I was n't really paying attention at first and became more and more involved until I just loved that show . I searched for it only to discover ... as always , a wonderful little show had been tossed out just when it was really hitting its stride . I 've given up on & # 34 ; networks & # 34 ; being bright enough to keep quality shows so these days I skulk in the back roads of the internet searching for entertainment jewels ... . LIFE ! Life is based on Damian Lewis 's character Charlie Crews who was framed for murder as a cop and spent 12 years in prison . He 's later freed by discovered DNA evidence and FREEDOM + giant financial settlement + back to work as a detective as a settlement . You 'd think , & # 34 ; all about revenge & # 34 ; but that , so far , appears to be a background , almost silent thread . Sarah Shahi 's talents , acting skills , and drop dead gorgeous looks are largely wasted but she adds some great dramatic tension as & # 34 ; Crews & # 34 ; new partner , Dani Reese.So far ( Amazon is nagging me to review before I 've completed the 1st season ) Crews and Reese go about each show solving murders . Crews pulls off an apparently complete Zen-new-age-self-help slightly demented from horrible prison experience , nice guy and Damian manages to pull off a stormy but silent darkness under the zen appearance . Reese ( Shahi ) has apparently been assigned as Crews 's senior partner as some kind of unknown punishment and her sub plot appears to be to find a way to bounce Crews out of the police force but instead , very gradually through the season grows to believe he 's sincerely a nice guy and a good cop . There are plenty of plot curves for nearly all the characters that keeps the viewer 'coming back ' . I 'm fortunate , I waited until it was cancelled so I 'm already prepared for a fantastic 2nd season that flies off a cliff believing the & # 34 ; next & # 34 ; season that never happened would be even better still.Do n't put a lot of stock in the idea that the show may not be worth watching because it is just another terrific show mangled by some money grubbers who did n't know they were about to hit the lottery . Great characters , great actors being great characters , enough sub plots going on to always leave you curious for the next episode and nearly always an unexpected surprise . Maybe Cloo will pick up a season of & # 34 ; Life & # 34 ; to marathon on some weekend like they did with & # 34 ; Fairly Legal & # 34 ; and folks will have a enough taste to find an alternate source , from networks , to enjoy & # 34 ; Life & # 34 ; ... . a good TV series with at least two up and coming entertainment stars .	1
Life is one of those dramas that leaves you thinking about what you would do if you were in a similar situation . While the series was intended to go more than the two seasons available , it comes to a somewhat satisfactory close at the end of the season , but definitely wanting more . Damian Lewis is outstanding as Detective & # 34 ; New Money & # 34 ; working his way through cases facing the LAPD . Strongly recommended ( both seasons ) .	1
We have watched about half of the episodes via Prime Streaming Video and have enjoyed them . The lead character adds that edginess that adds dry comedy and drama . We will continue to watch !	1
It appears that this program only lasted two seasons..I like Damian Lewis very much , the premise of the show is interesting and I enjoy the relationship he ( Lewis ) has with his new partner , Reese . Adam Arkin also plays an interesting character..	1
It had everything , great chemistry , mystery and spirituality . The one show that makes you want to listen to buddhist meditation tapes .	1
Season one was great , surprises without being super strange , decent characters , nice story progression while keeping each episode interesting.Season two is what killed this show though , bringing in the new character as a love interest for the partner was a joke , not that they brought someone in , but who and how . Other than that the second season is worth watching too .	1
Too bad it only lasted 2 seasons . However , they did wrap everything up nicely in the 2nd season for it .	1
Love this show . Wish it had continued	1
It 's funny , serious , and well done . If your looking for great entertainment you need to watch this series . Season 2 is just as good .	1
Another Damien Lewis triumph . I 've been impressed with this guy since he did the two mini-series The Forsyth Saga and Band of Brothers . Band of Brothers was a stand-out performance since he was a Brit playing an American officer of the 101st Airborne . Nicely done by him and he is a coming actor . Just needs the right launch pad . Life is a good choice . It has a great hook and the right quirkyness to make it really interesting and not like the usual drivel on American telly . . . the rest of the cast is good as well and with the continued good writing this show has a chance to succeed where most shows fail if they do n't have CSI or Law and Order as part of their title . So , if you want to watch something different and not the usual display of bullets entering a human body and puncturing various organs close-up this is a good one . Life is good .	1
Quick Overview : Detective Crews was sentenced and served years in prison for a crime he is now exonerated for . He received a hefty settlement but decided to return to his work where he got a new partner . Together they solve murders . When he is alone , he is tries to solve the murder he was put away for.Love the Life television series . I do n't know how I missed it when it was airing . Damian Lewis is great . His character , Crews , is eccentric but smart . He often looks like he is about to board the crazy train and then suddenly it all makes sense . Then he does it again ! He is a little crazy and a little genius . Pretty obnoxious sometimes too .	1
Life is one of the freshest new shows on TV right now . I love the main character , I love Adam Arkin 's character , I just can not recommend this series highly enough.The zen take on everything really makes this an offbeat yet engaging cop series .	1
I was not sure of this show so I took a chance and watched the first episode , it was a fresh look at crime drama . A cop , wrongly accused ( not so surprising a plot -- -- are n't they always ? ? ? ) but still I continued watching . The interesting hook was that he not only took the references huge settlement but had negotiated to keep his old job as a detective in the same place that accused , arrested , prosecuted and jailed him . Hmmmmm , different . The humor is a sideline to a jaundiced look at the new/former workplace and although I think the female partner 's role is a bit over the top , the cases are interesting and the tracking of who actually committed the crime he went to prison for is well thought out and executed . Thank you. & # 8203 ;	1
An excellent ensemble cast . Damien Lewis is magnificent . When this became available through Amazon Prime , I rabidly devoured an episode ... and then another ... and then all of a sudden , Season 1 was over and I wondered at how deeply engrossed I became in Charlie 's story and how much I had grown to care about him and his partner , Danni . So now I was craving to know even more of Charlie Crews , et al . An excellent ensemble cast . Damien Lewis is magnificent . Now it on to season two .	1
I enjoyed LIFE season 1 so much , that I also watched season 2 . The writers did n't leave the viewers hanging as to who the real killer was , but there was enough mystery left to make us look forward to season 2 . I like the chemistry and rapport between partners Crews and Reese . I 'm glad to see that both actors ( Lewis and Shahi ) have found other projects . Adam Arkin was good as Crews ' financial advisor .	1
great police show . the show is based on a policemen wrongfully sent to prison . Upon his release he rejoins the department . As he does his daily job he tries to find out who framed him	1
This was a great series , too bad it 's gone . Sarah Shahi and Damien Lewis were perfect in their roles . Great off center cop show . The crime scenes were always interesting and reminded me of the openings to another great series `` dead like me '' .	1
The actor in the lead role is convincing in his character . All the episodes are fast paced and keep you wondering what will happen .	1
I loved this story and hope they were able to close up the questions in Season2 . It 's a very unique story of police corruption .	1
I love detective/police based shows . I found this to be one that caused me to stay up nights watching until I got to the end . I am now absorbed in Season 2 . Sadly , apparently this show ended after only two seasons . I recommend it to everyone who enjoys this type of show .	1
Every once in a while , you stumble across a really fresh , well-written , well-directed , well-acted TV series . This is it ! Fully engaging ... watched the entire series in 3 days ... and went looking for more . Found & # 34 ; Season 2 & # 34 ; ! Yahoo !	1
Truly a finders delight ... .well done ... humorous ... realistic ... charisma and interaction between characters fascinating . Premise seemed far fetched but well played out in Season 2 .	1
Love the writing , love the characters , and am sorry to find out they only made two seasons . Wish I had watched this when it was on the air . Bring it back for a season three !	1
Simply one of the best most well written TV series . I am not going to go into the allegories it is comedy and suspense with a past and a ( you would think ) a future . Sadly it was dropped by the networks even though I understand it had very good numbers . In all probability it was dropped by some 30 year old noodle-head the top brass thought had brains . Life : good acting great plot watch the whole two year life of the show .	1
Although shows about the LAPD have been done to death , this one comes with a twist . He was a cop and was framed for a murder and sentenced to life . He served for 12 years then DNA cleared him . He was given a multi-million dollar settlement , so money is no problem for him and neither is getting some nice female companionship . But he takes his old job back anyway , while he continues to collect clues on how and who set him up and put him in prison , As a cop , he is another Monk , who sees and thinks things most people do not , plus he acts a little odd like Monk always did . He always drives a cool car and still has feelings for his ex , who did not believe him about the murders , divorced him and remarried . He lives in a big empty house with his friend , who he met in prison ( white collar crime ) and he handles all his financials and is also a good friend . He is very likeable but also a bit odd in a humorous way.Give it a watch and see what you think . Of course I did n't mention that his partner is also very hot , of course . What cop show would be complete without a hot woman cop ?	1
This is one of the best series I 've seen . It 's great to watch the streaming so I can watch episodes when I want . The premise is different from all the usual cop shows . The acting is good . I like the characters . Each episode has a complete case plus something is added to the backstory .	1
I have greatly enjoyed watching this show and in fact have watched both seasons twice - yes , it 's that good in my opinion . The Charlie Crews character , played by Damion Lewis was brilliantly acted and his partner , Detective Reese ( Sarah Shahi ) , is equally as good . They are remarkably good together once they get passed all the & # 34 ; issues & # 34 ; each of them brings to the partnership . Adam Arkin adds humor as Ted Early , a white collar criminal , to the show as Charlie 's old prison mate , whom he protected while they were in prison and invited to live with him and manage the huge settlement Charlie received for wrongful conviction . Charlie 's old partner , Officer Bobby Stark , played by the ever fascinating Brent Sexton , rounds out the odd main character cast . Watching Charlie readjust to life outside prison , working with a new partner and solve cases has proved irresistible . Excellent acting by all in developing characters that , to me , are just too irresistible and engaging . That this show was cancelled after only 2 seasons , while absolutely dreadful shows were allowed to continue , demonstrated that NBC lost their touch for gauging the difference between what constitutes good writing in TV land and what does not . Season 1 and 2 are both terrifically written and acted . Kudos to Lewis , Shahi , Arkin , and Sexton for a job well done if greatly unappreciated .	1
I am so sad that this series was cancelled ... it could have gone on and on as far as I am concerned . Very good story premise , wonderful scripts and the chemistry with all the actors was superb especially Crews and Reese !	1
The twist here is that detective Charlie Crews was put in jail for 12 years for a crime that he did not commit . Imagine going through all of that and then going back into the police force . His wife has remarried , and some people still will not admit that he is innocent . Add to this a partner who does not want to be with him , and you 've got a man with some issues . But he tries to handle them with Zen philosophy . He also has a constant hankering for fresh fruit , since he never got any in prison.Damian Lewis is sympathetic and likeable as Crews , while Adam Arkin is in solid form as his roommate and former inmate-pal . He helps to handle Crews ' enormous settlement.A nice show with interesting characters . Fans of Deadwood will enjoy Robin Weigert in the role of the commander of the police officers .	1
I 'm on the second season now and highly enjoy the show . Shame they took it off . Had a lot going for it .	1
After viewing Season One of Life , I immediately went back out on Amazon and purchased Season Two . Great intelligent entertainment - sometimes dark , sometimes funny , sometimes darkly funny . Damian Lewis is the perfect Charlie . And I 've been an Adam Arkin fan since first seeing him on West Wing , so it was good to see him in a meatier role , one which gave room to show more of his fine talent.I 'm stingy with stars , so four stars is very good , per my rating system . A bit more edge would have earned five stars from me .	1
Always trying to find something decent to watch on Amazon Prime and came across Life . I was not familiar with Damien Lewis before this show . I liked the characters and story ( even though at the end some things did n't seem to make sense ) . In some ways it would have been nice for the show to go longer than two seasons , but on the other hand , the storyline did wrap up quite nicely on the last show .	1
In the pilot , the look and feel of this show does for the Bionic Woman , what they did for Battlestar on the Sci-Fi channel ( if not quite as gritty ) . Where as the original was just silly , this seems ( so far ) as a well thought out story , with people that we may come to care about for ( good or ill ) .The subplots , of Jamie 's reletionships with her sister , and evil crazy counterpart , for me ( at least so far ) make for good drama.They 've got my interest , I just hope the show lives up to the pilot .	1
I was a huge fan of The Bionic Woman and The Six Million Dollar Man ... sooooI was excited and skeptical about this show being made . However , I purchased the DVD set and then read the reviews . I agree with some of the reviewers about the problem this series faced . The comparison to the original , the lack of continuity , etc . However , I feel this show is being way to harshyl judged . While I can see the problems of this show , I feel that in time the kinks would have been worked out ... .there were only 8 episodes from what I can tell and find out and the chemistry between all the characters was spot on right out of the gate . I feel it would have only got better . The show was still finding its legs when the strike happened . How long could this show have gone ? That is anyone 's guess , but if the strike had not happened , I certainly think it would have continued for several years . I personally enjoy seeing Sarah , she , to me , is much more colorful and 3 dimensional than the other characters ... .I just have to say , over all , I am glad that I bought this set , I would have continued watching the show based on what I have seen and watched objectively , I do n't think anyone could disagree with this .	1
This was really well done , the writers strike probably cost this series it 's sophomore season , Michelle Ryan wad lovely and likable , what a great American accent . The producers of Battlestar loaded this revival with lots of subplots and Galactica cast members ... Especially Katee Sackhoff ( Starbuck ) who steals scenes as the bionic prototype gone bad . Ryan 's older sister cliches are improved by the secret life angle , over all a fun series .	1
One of the best things about DVDs , notably the release of TV series on DVD , is the fact that you actually get a chance to watch some of the best shows on TV that you may have missed the first time around . Such is the case with BIONIC WOMAN.This remake of the hit 70s show that starred Lindsey Wagner ( that was a spin off of THE SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN ) updates the original , keeping only what 's necessary . Jamie Sommers is young , in love and pregnant . After breaking the news to her boyfriend Will ( Chris Bowers ) , the pair are broadsided on the way home.Damaged to the extent that she might die , Jamie is saved by Will as his true occupation is revealed . The man she thought was a simply college professor actually is a brilliant surgeon who works for a secret government agency . And rather than lose Jamie , Will takes her to their facility and enhances her.While her legs , one arm , one ear and one eye were completely obliterated , this facility replaces them with bionic parts , mechanical computerized parts as well as nano technology that boost her healing . Horrified at first , Jamie begins to accept the new her . When Will is killed by the last candidate for bionics , Sarah Corvus ( Katee Sackhoff ) , Jamie joins the agency that rebuilt her.That 's the simple set up for the series . Super strength , eyesight , hearing and more . Working for a government agency . And with a revenge motive strong enough to fill any number of stories . But the series does n't stop there . As well as her new found life , Jamie has a kid sister to raise . Troublesome and a handful , the teen was dropped at her doorstep by her father and was the reason Jamie stayed where she is . A combination of love and loss revolve between the two.The series takes a natural progression , from Jamie being talked into her new career path to how she deals with Sarah . The series shows her progression , her training and her learning to deal with her abilities . But what makes this series work best is that it 's not a straight out remake . Instead , it takes those bones from the original and makes the story it 's own.Michelle Ryan stars as Jamie and does a fantastic job , showing a young woman who takes what life throws at her and survives . Miguel Ferrer does his smarmy best as the cold hearted bureaucrat who 's in charge . Sackhoff is equally casts as the killer who wants to change but has technology that was n't perfected within her.Cost of living what it is , there is no way Jamie can have been made for a mere $ 6 million . Times have changed and so has this show . But that 's a good thing . While the original seems silly to look back on now , science fiction fans can find much to enjoy in this one . Look for it on your shelves or add it to your own . It 's a series worth having .	1
The show was great . It was entertaining and action packed throughout.I 'll have to watch a few more before I really decide how much I like it . Part of that will depend on the main character , I 'm not sure about the casting for her yet , something feels off but maybe she will grow on me .	1
This episode shows the kind of potential that THE BIONIC WOMAN has and is easily the best so far . The widely reported rumor is that there has been disarray on the set of the show . The good news is that NBC seems to be a big believer in the show and has taken every possible effort to make it a success . The other bit of good news is that the show is already quite good , even if in disarray . Now , it is also perfectly possible that things were confused on the set , but that many of the difficulties were solved by excellent editing . But if one did n't know from other sources that the production is supposed to be a bit of a mess , you would n't be able to tell by the finished episode . After a few episodes show runner Glen Morgan left the show . Jason Katims , who is the executive producer of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS , has been taken on as a consulting producer . I 've read also that a number of FNL writers have gotten involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN . NBC clearly thinks this show could be a hit for several years.Clearly , NBC 's reaction to THE BIONIC WOMAN shows the beginning of a trend in responding to productions that have some onset confusion . The prototype was last year 's BROTHERS AND SISTERS , which by all accounts was simply a god awful mess . The initial show runner quit over creative differences ( she is now the show runner , ironically , for the show that runs opposite THE BIONIC WOMAN , ABC 's PRIVATE PRACTICE ) and NBC was forced to put together a new production team . The result was a completely rejuvenated program , one that by the end of the year was enjoying both respect by critics and dedication by fans ( of which , I must confess , I am not one ) .All of which excites me . If THE BIONIC WOMAN is this good while the production team was not a smooth running machine , what will it be like once it is tuned up ? This episode lays out what will clearly be a major story arc on the show , the strained but unbreakable connection between Jaime Sommers and Sarah Corvus . Some people have complained about Michelle Ryan 's performance as Jaime , but I think she has been fine and that she will get even better as her character is allowed to develop more confidence . I think the problem is not Michelle Ryan , but that Katee Sackhoff 's performance as Sarah Corvus is just so spectacularly good that she makes everyone around her look bad in comparison . Sarah Corvus dominates every scene she is in , much the way that on BUFFY Faith and Spike tended to take over when they put in an appearance.My one concern with the series at this point is how good it is going to be when we get less Sarah Corvus . THE BIONIC WOMAN started filming before BATTLESTAR GALACTICA did , so that Katee Sackhoff , who plays Starbuck on the latter , was available for early episodes . At some point we will inevitably see less Sarah . My understanding is that Sackhoff 's boss , David Eick , is working with her to keep her involved with THE BIONIC WOMAN as much as possible while BSG wraps up and having both shows film in Vancouver certainly helps . Still , at least for a while Sarah will have to play a diminished role . But one thing seems certain : no performer on television will play such a crucial role on two series this year as Katee Sackhoff.All in all , I think this episode was a big improvement over the second one . I liked the pilot , but the second episode was a tad flat . Hopefully this episode is a sign of things to come .	1
I liked this ones I watched . I guess I have outgrown this particular type of program . It was ok but slow	1
I found myself becoming more interested as the plot lines evolved . The new show has brought in more technology than the original series , while keeping the theme similar . This version is darker and has more edge than the first series . The younger sister started out slightly shallow , but the need of having her watched by older adults was addressed early on in the series Now I think that both `` sisters '' are developing their sibling roles nicely . The actors that support Michelle Ryan have developed into a fine ensemble of people . I would like to see more of Mark Sheppard in future episodes . There are also danglers of plot in each episode . I hope the show continues . It has turned out to be a show I look forward to watching on my PC .	1
Chuck is the best show ever ! ! The nerd gets the superpowers and the girl . What more could you want ? Ok Zack Levi is also really cute and has the personality to match . This is one of my favorite shows - the nerd is the hero . What more could you want ? Do n't miss out on this series !	1
Chuck Bartowski no longer possesses the Intersect , but has still matured into a confident and capable secret agent . As he mentors the new Intersect , he also has to deal with the fact he and his team are now independent contractors with bills to pay and rival companies to compete with . When , yet again , a dangerous agent comes after the Intersect , Chuck has to call upon his resources and training to stop them.Chuck has always been a curious show , a geek comedy with dramatic and romantic overtones whose tone has often spun on a dime . The show has always done a good job of managing these different tones and styles , keeping everything grounded though Zachary Levi 's earnest-but-sympathetic performance as the title character . In the fifth season , the show experiences several additional such tonal shifts , as Chuck is betrayed by his best friend ( but it turns out not to be his fault ) and , most surprisingly , has his life almost ruined in the final few episodes of the series . For a show that 's always been quite warm-hearted and entertainingly cheesy , the surprisingly bleak tone of the final few episodes comes as a bit of a shock.The season - renewed purely to be wrapped up - only consists of thirteen episodes and it appears there may have been budgetary restrictions in place : our previous season villains were played by well-known actors such as Chevy Chase and Timothy Dalton . This year we get Angus Macfadyen , a very solid Scottish actor best-known for his supporting role in Braveheart ( as Robert the Bruce ) . He does a good job , but lacks the geek-cred his predecessors brought with them . Even more problematic is the fact that he only appears in the last few episodes of the season with little build-up and his character is never really explored in much depth ( in contrast to Dalton 's hammy-but-complex Volkoff ) .The truncated run causes issues throughout the season . Storylines that would have been given whole episodes to develop in the second through fourth seasons are here disposed off way too quickly . An entertaining on-going subplot involving Carrie-Ann Moss as a rival contractor ( and potential romantic interest for Casey ) has enormous potential , but kind of peters out with no real climax or pay-off . Most frustratingly , there is relatively very little action in the Buy More . Big Mike , Lester and Jeff barely get any lines in some episodes , although a late-season subplot that sees Lester and a reformed and sober Jeff finally discovering what 's going under their feet does help reduce this problem a little.Most surprising is a divisive late-season storyline involving amnesia . Given the tone of the show , I was confidently expecting some last-minute solution or cure would be found . Instead , we get a highly inconclusive ending . It 's not quite The Sopranos , but the series ending without ever answering the central question poised by the last couple of episodes is an unexpected and possibly even brave choice . Whether it 's the right choice is one that fans will be arguing about for years to come ( or unless the much-rumoured Chuck movie gets off the ground ) . For myself , Chuck has always been first and foremost an escapist and fun show , not a gritty drama like the new BSG or something from HBO . Ending the show in this manner feels out of character for the series , and a little bit of pointless torture for our main characters who really deserved more of a happy ending.That aside , the final season of Chuck ( *** ) is entertaining , well-acted and often quite funny . The shortened episode order means some storylines are n't developed very well , and the ending will be divisive , but certainly the season is worth watching for established fans . In particular , the way Chuck 's character develops across the five seasons , going from nerd to an intelligent , resourceful agent ( exemplified by the shots of Chuck on the DVD spines , which cleverly show this development ) does pay off very well here .	1
What can I say , the combination between the goofy but martial arts skilled Chuck , his super hot superspy wife Sarah Walker , and the cast of characters such as Casey and Morgan make it a great show ! Highly recommend buying all seasons if you did not think you would like it when it was on TV , I think you 'd be surprised !	1
such a big fan of the show . it and the characters actually GREW rather than just got stuck in the non-ending situation syndrome . this final season was a great send-off . worth every penny to me	1
After watching the first 4 seasons of Chuck , I just HAD to get the last season as well - and it was money well spent . It was a little sad knowing the series end was coming , but the writers did a good job of keeping the action flowing right up to the end . All of the characters seemed to get their special moments during this season - the only character I missed was Anna from the early seasons.I do n't want to spoil anyone 's surprise , but we get a few visits and flashbacks to old characters , as well as a few new ones along the way . Most of the Chuck fans should be happy with the ending as well . Boy , it is ahrd to talk about this season without giving something away , so I will just summarize : If you watched the first four seasons , this season falls nicely in-line , but with a wrap-up in the final show instead of a cliff-hanger season ender .	1
For the final season of `` Chuck '' , producers Josh Schwartz and Chris Fedak faced a daunting dramatic challenge : how to generate new drama , comedy and romance for a great show . After all , at the end of season four , nice guy CIA agent Chuck Bartkowski ( Zachary Levy ) finally married his lovely CIA partner Sara Walker ( Yvonne Strahovski ) , after protecting the birth of niece Clara to sister Ellie and brother-in-law Captain Awesome . Operation Bartkowski was officially ended , leaving Chuck , Sara , gruff NSA agent John Casey ( Adam Baldwin ) , and Chuck 's best friend Morgan ( Joshua Gomez ) without a mission . The solution : reshuffle the deck.Using money from Alexei Volkov , last season 's leading villain , Chuck , Sara , Casey , and Morgan go into the private spy business , only to discover the competition can be quite fierce . Carrie-Anne Moss ( Matrix ) has a recurring role as the cutthroat leader of a rival firm , and as someone with a history , and maybe a future , with Casey . Morgan , who ended up last season with the Intersect in his head , discovers the hard way the challenges of having super spy skills , and in the process damages his relationship with Casey 's daughter Alex . Chuck , reduced to basic nice guy computer nerd , goes through his own period of painful adjustment , before having to face his greatest opponent one more time . Sara Walker 's long-missing mother will make an appearance at a vital moment , while fans will be treated to additional fun with the BuyMore gang , and to additional Bartkowski family comedy ( and drama over Chuck and Sara 's future ) .Team Bartkowski will face a series of threats from rogue CIA agents , including one who sets up the team for the crime of the century , leaving the team with a choice of jail or life on the run . In a tense multi-episode conclusion , Chuck and Sara will battle one last ruthless opponent for control of the Intersect and everything they have built together . The suspense will be good to the last drop . `` Chuck : The Complete Fifth Season '' has the last 13 episodes of the show and is highly recommended to its dedicated fans . The DVD set includes the usual blooper reel , deleted scenes , and a few farewell features .	1
I loved this series . I hated to see all the problems with keeping this series on the air . I will miss this show .	1
This show I really enjoyed ( except the `` evil american agencies '' bit is wearing very thin to me ) a funny show without a laugh track is always a plus to me . I do n't know if they will find enough material to write to keep me engaged , but the pilot was pretty entertaing , ( the action sequence in the biggining was pretty exciting , and the rest pretty funny.I hope they can keep it up.Update November 27 , 2007This show has pleasingly gotten better each week . The Characters are more developed and sympathetic . And while this may not go down in TV history as one of the greatest shows of all time , it continues to be a thoroughly enjoyable way to spend an hour .	1
Except there 's only so much a Subway sandwich can accomplish . And , for such an underdog show like CHUCK , really , a five year run is pretty amazing . I 'm already missing this show bad . But at least EUREKA is still around for a few more seasons ... wait , what 's that about EUREKA ? In the course of four years , Chuck Bartowski 's evolution has been an eye-opener , Chuck having gone from hapless Nerd Herder to accomplished spy . This fifth and final season finds him coping without the crutch of the Intersect and proving that , just on his own merit and innate skills and savvy , he 's still got the goods to kick bu++ in the cloak and dagger community . As noted in last season 's finale , thanks to Volkoff 's largesse , Chuck and Sarah are now stinking rich . They now own the Burbank Buy More store , still the cover for Castle , their underground espionage lair . With the CIA giving them the stink eye , Chuck and Sarah have struck out on their own and established their own independent security firm . But maybe the biggest `` What the -- ? ! '' moment in last season 's finale is that Morgan Grimes has become the inadvertent host of the Intersect . It 's a fun twist , initially . But I think we were all laying odds that this sitch would n't last.Foremost , I love the show 's heart . We eyeball the shadowy conspiracies and the neat spy gadgets and the skullduggery and the wicked kung fu bits , but these elements rapidly become rote when you do n't give a what about the characters . It 's always been about Sarah and Chuck . They anchor things . It 's sappy to say , but despite the geektastic pyrotechnics , it 's Sarah and Chuck 's romantic arc that we track and feed off from the most . Sarah Walker , who once was this lonely little girl , unwilling to trust , weapons always hot . Chuck Bartowski , hapless geek , heart ever on his sleeve . Their winding love story is pretty friggin ' sweet . And , to squeaze out that last drip of dramatic conflict and tension , even in ( especially in ) the eleventh hour , the showrunners are all too willing to jeopardize Sarah and Chuck 's happiness . Yeah , okay , it hooked me in yet again . From jump I cared about these characters . That even eventually applied to the aggravating sidekick Morgan Grimes.Season 5 's first major arc deals with Morgan as the new walking CIA database and touches on Chuck 's trying hard not to feel too envious or useless . And , somewhere on the periphery , never quite going away , skulks yet another dark cabal out to destroy Chuck . There 's a rogue CIA operative targeting our nerd . And Chuck and Sarah 's newfound wealth ... well , this show 's writers just love erecting obstacles for our protagonists.Our spy team for hire has trouble staying solvent . Does n't help that Chuck and company are in direct competition with the flashier Verbanski Corps , of which boss , Gertrude Verbanski , seems to harbor a personal agenda against Colonel Casey . CHUCK has always had a knack for attracting guest actors steeped in nerd pop culture . This season 's guest star bounty includes Mark Hamill , the reprising Linda Hamilton , Rebecca Romijn , Stan Lee ( as himself ) , Bo Derek ( as herself ) , two cast members from COMMUNITY , as well as a welcome recurring run for Carrie-Anne Moss who plays the steely Gertrude Verbanski.With only 13 episodes , this season focuses less on silly shenanigans at the Buy More . Still , fans of Jeffster should n't fret . Jeffrey gets a pretty gratifying story arc , and there 's a very nice payoff regarding Jeffster in the final episode.My pick of the season : `` Chuck vs. the Zoom , '' for demonstrating Chuck 's improvisational tactical skills , and this without the Intersect ; `` Chuck vs. the Curse , '' because of Ellie and Captain Awesome 's fun and unexpectedly perilous date night ; `` Chuck vs. the Baby , '' for shedding more light on Sarah 's past ; `` Chuck vs. Bo , '' because friggin ' Bo Derek 's in it ; and `` Chuck vs. the Goodbye , '' for all the callbacks and because it 's a fine send-off , never mind that we have to infer the happy ending.I dunno , maybe this is a good time for CHUCK to bow out , before it starts flirting with becoming too stale . And maybe I 'm getting fed up with buying them Subway sandwiches . But , man , I will miss this show something fierce . But at least WONDERFALLS is still on the air ... wait ... what 's that ? ! CHUCK - THE COMPLETE FIFTH AND FINAL SEASON comes with 3 discs and offers the following bonus material : - `` Sandwiches and Superfans : The Saving of a Show '' - cast & crew , most of 'em teary-eyed , pay tribute to the show 's passionate fan base ( 00:10:20 minutes ) - `` Scoring the World of CHUCK '' - spotlight on composer Tim Jones , the mind behind the music ( 00:06:08 minutes ) - `` Chuck Versus the Final Episode '' - an emotional visit behind the scenes ( 00:14:25 minutes ) - `` CHUCK : The Beginnings '' - the Flash that launched a hit show ; cast & crew reminisce about how it all started ( 00:05:24 minutes ) - `` CHUCK : Through the years '' - charting the evolution of the show 's characters ( 00:11:14 minutes ) - `` Goodbye , Buy More '' - Time-lapse teardown of the set ( 00:02:18 minutes ) - 2 Exclusive Buy More commercials ( featuring Big Mike & Captain Awesome ) - Extended version of Series Finale `` Chuck vs. the Goodbye '' ( 00:52:59 minutes ) - `` CHUCK : the Future '' - cast & producers ' predictions about the show 's characters ( 00:04:19 minutes ) - Audio Commentaries on `` Chuck vs. Sarah '' and `` Chuck vs. the Goodbye '' ( both eps with actors Zachary Levi , Joshua Gomez , and co-creators/co-writers Chris Fedak and Josh Schwartz ) - 10 Declassified Scenes ( or Deleted/Extended Scenes , for those not down with the cloak & dagger jargon ) - Gag Reel ( 00:03:34 minutes ) And there 's also an episode guide pamphlet .	1
I was really hoping this show would make another season but alas it was not to be . I am still buying subs and hoping though.Wendy Farrington is the reason this show ran as long as it did . She came up with the Save Chuck subway campaign.Wendy thank you for your efforts .	1
The last season of Chuck is almost as fun to watch as the previous seasons . Almost because you know it 's going to end . There are only 13 episodes , but there 's a lot going on ! I enjoyed it and can highly recommend the final season on CHUCK .	1
The dvd arrived promptly and in perfect shape . NOTE : SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! ! I was very disppointed that Sara would lose her memory and she and Chuck would bascially have to start their relationship all over again . The writers could n't have made it a happy ending for the two of them-come on ...	1
This is a great new show . The show has excellent oddball humor and great lines . The characters are hilarious and they have made great scene sequences ( e.g . Casey getting the cutomer service tutorial ) and Chuck just draws you in into his predicament . I especially enjoy when he talks to Sarah about their fake relatiosnhip , if that relationship were in fact real , they would go on a date . Chuck is just a great show , a must watch . The show has refenreces to video games that are fun to figure out . The cast is very amusing and entertaining . The only people that seem out of place are Chuck 's sister and her boyfriend or husband , Captain Awesome.UPDATE 11/19/2007 : This show is still great . I ca n't wait for Monday nights to watch this show . The relationships between Chuck and Sarah is so exciting . Every episode , every new development and every character adds even more excitement and fun to this show . And Rachel Bilson 's character is great . This show has everything going for it : great and funny dialogue , great performances , amazing chemistry among the characters and great and unbelievable storylines .	1
Season 5 of Chuck . Wow . I am sad it is over . The production values were high until the end . Still kept the same humor and action mix . I shall miss it .	1
This show started strong and we enjoyed it for several years but not so much in the last two years . The last season was Ok but with the intersect getting into so many people it lost it 's appeal . I was also disappointed with the ending .	1
Since we have the other seasons on DVD I bought this on DVD not Blue-Ray . We loved this show but I do think they were smart in ending it when they did . Overall , I 'm glad we have this just to have the complete series . I liked season 4 better but did enjoy this season as well .	1
We the fans were lucky to get this final season . The writers and actors knew this as well and pulled out all the stops for the end of this saga . I thought season four was good but a little lacking when compared to the previous seasons . This season however was excellent . The guest stars were impressive as always with Carrie Anne Moss , Mark Hammil , Bo Derek , and many others that made for a pop culture flashback . This season centered on Carmichael industries and how Chuck , Sarah , and Casey were on there own . Oh and also Morgan has the Intersect and Chuck does not . I was a little worried about how this would play out but the writers did an excellent job giving the storyline meaning and depth . I wo n't go into detail but it was an interesting ride with Morgan Grimes having the Intersect.Also Chuck and Sarah shared a lot of post marriage problems like starting a family and finding a house . It was cool to see these two try to figure out married life while shooting some bad guys . Casey gets a love interest in Carrie Anne Moss which was a nice touch for the gruff Colonel , and would n't you know it there was a Matrix reference added for her . The ending while a little controversial was excellent in my opinion . Anyone about to watch the finale should watch the pilot right before it . There are a lot of references to Chuck 's first mission . There will also be an extended version of the finale along with audio commentary for the episode ( It 's about time ) . Even if you did n't like the finale at least the writers got to end the show on their terms.I 'm rating this in advance of buying it because I think we all know it is n't going to look great on Blu Ray . It never has been the standard for high definition . I doubt things will change now . This will be however is the best it is going to look for a while so I will gladly add it to my collection next to the previous four seasons.The final season of Chuck was a wild ride until the final smash to black . It brought back a lot of favorite characters including a previous villain , new characters were seamlessly added to the mix , and the focus never shifted too far from the main cast . Which did an excellent job once again . Zachary Levi deserves an Emmy for his performance in the finale . I said the same for Matthew Fox for LOST and he was robbed . I hope Chuck at least gets a nomination . The final episode will be debated for a long time , but you owe it to yourself to experience the final season of Chuck . In the Pilot Chuck said he was working on his five year plan . Well Chuck your five years on television were some of the most memorable in recent memories and your final missions were just as enjoyable as your first .	1
K. Watlet ( another reviewer ) is crazy ! This was an excellent story ! I really do n't see how it will remain interesting as a series but it would have made an excellent miniseries or movie . The acting was real , the camera angles were good , the shifting back and forth through time was done very well and there were times I did n't know which time he was in . The only reason I watched it is because it was free and I am so glad that I did !	1
From what I can tell , Journeyman has gone the way of a lot of promising shows before it with low ratings . It 's too bad as this show was starting to hit its stride , and had shaken my initial perception as a Quantum Leap ripoff . To the credit of the producers , the final filmed episode , `` Perfidia , '' offers a neat enough closure to the series that fans wo n't feel cheated . Hopefully , the Sci Fi channel or some other cable outlet will pick up the show -- it deserves another chance .	1
Journeyman looks to be another series with promise . I watched the Unbox download of the Pilot episode , and ... If you do n't just hate the idea of a show with time traveling involved , this should be a good series for thinking people.The premise seems to be somewhere in a mix of `` Quantum Leap '' ( at least the part of fixing what is screwed up with the timeline ) but more `` The Time Traveler 's Wife , and Ken Grimwood 's `` Replay '' .Mid ~Season Update November 27 , 2007Journeyman is meeting all my expectations for the shows development . I remain hooked ! The make or break for this show will be do the real world characters generate enough empathy to hook you on the show , and will the `` fix it '' parts of the plot be interesting.I think there is a good chance they can make this work . I hope I am right .	1
Journeyman is , without a shadow of a doubt , one of the BEST television shows ever produced . The concept of Journeyman is brilliant , the marketing was abysmal , the ratings were satisfactory for a freshman show , the over-all quality of Journeyman is superb . But do n't think Journeyman is just a show about time travel . It 's so much more . Journeyman is a show about a heroes . Dan Vasser is the hero who goes back in time to help right wrongs . Livia is his hero partner who helps him . Katie Vasser is his hero wife who , through no fault of her own , finds herself married to a time-traveling man who , coincidently is time traveling with his ex-girlfriend . This show could have taken so many low roads with this issue . But never once did it slip into the little nasty things other shows use to pull people in - illicit sex , bad language , drug addiction . Journeyman was one of the few shows in many years that showed humanity at its best . We need MORE shows like this , not less . Why NBC canceled Journeyman is a mystery to many , many fans who continue to proliferate all over the internet , months after this show was canceled . I say to NBC : remember Star Trek ? Now , FOX owns the rights to this show . We can hope that Fox does a better job and has more respect for this diamond of a show that got coal treatment . For the fans of Journeyman , WE were the ones who lost . But NBC ? They deserve to be in fourth place amongst the networks . They are the real losers here . Thank YOU FOX and UNBOX for offering us the sale of the thirteen episodes of this fine show . Now ... as for the DVD ... ?	1
Good thing I have a DVR b/c a lot of time was spent rewinding to rewatch the parts I did n't get the first time around .	1
Althought it started out slow , the story picked up enough to capture my attention and hold it through to the end . I like how he was able to prove his story to at least one person important in his life to give him the chance for a `` home '' that does n't turn out to be an insane asylum . The character development was basic , but adequate enough to show hints of other , less obvious relationships that I 'm sure will be cleared up , inlater episodes . Overall a very good possibility for my interests , so I 'll be watching .	1
The show started off as intriguing and has developed into a very solid drama . It has potential to really excel and become one of the best new dramas , but needs more time to develop . Unfortunately , the writers ' strike may have a negative effect on the show 's future . I am truly impressed with the fairly accurate representation of the Bay Area both historical and present day . There are always a few minor things that get fudged , but , for the most part , it is true to this region . Give it a chance and have fun .	1
When I was watching the pilot episode I wasnt sure if I was going to like the show . Then everything fell together at the end of the pilot and I have been hook on the show ever since . The acting is great and the time jumping gives you the blast from the past feeling .	1
This show first developed the backgrounds of the characters really well and added the sci-fi elements as a spice to the series . The creaters of the show have selected `` family members '' of the main characters `` Dan & Katie '' who manage to be very similar in features to the two main characters . I think the show has done a superb job of recreating the past of San Francisco and the cultural elements of the years that the main character , Dan , travels too . The stories flow together creating a nice arc of the family interactions and current cultural dynamics mixed with good sci-fi based on quantium theory that the viewer can actually believe . There is a balance between the good that Dan does and the sinister aspect of being watched by the government in recent story lines . While each show can be a stand alone episode , I enjoy watching this show and learning more about the characters ' challenges with the concepts of Sci-fi that influence the show each week . It 's also nice to see a family demonstrating love and support of each other for a change .	1
This is a great first season , so fresh and fun ! the characters are sometimes ridiculous but you root for them because they are still lovable . Great cast dynamic ! Excellent !	1
I 1st got turned on to this show by my wife . I 'm glad in did . This show is pure genius . Once you start watching it , you will be sucked in . This show is very well done and since you are hooked , you will need more . If you are a fan of comedy go get some .	1
At first I thought this might be way tooo nerdy but honestly after a few episodes I 'm really enjoying the series . It 's light yet portrays an Aspie really well .	1
Very funny sitcom about a group of friends who do n't fit in with mass culture . I liked how each character is very similiar yet different from eachother . Sheldon has been my favorite since the sperm bank when he explains about producing a child who does n't know if he should use an intergral or differential to find the area between curves .	1
I am really happy with this show , the first season is pretty good and the show just gets better over the season 's . If you have n't seen this yet I would recommend it for anyone . It 's just a really funny show .	1
`` Frasier '' , arguably the greatest sitcom of all time and known widely as the most intelligent , sadly came to an end in 2004 . Dedicated fans of the sitcom were sat wondering what to do next . Myself alike , we simply did n't know what to do with ourselves , we searched frantically for an equally intelligent sitcom alternative which simply did n't exist . Some of us suffered withdrawal symptoms and eventually got over them , while others simply withered away and died whilst huddling in a corner rocking back and forth waiting for `` Frasier '' to come back . He never did.Three years later and Chuck Lorre finally came to the rescue and brought us the utterly fantastic `` Big Bang Theory . '' No , not the theory of the beginning of the universe and everything in it , but rather the most fantastically amusing and intelligent situational comedy to grace our screens since the equally fantastic `` Frasier . '' It 's a show much like Frasier that does n't seek to just pop out one gag at a time , much like a stand up comedy performance , more rather it will create a genuinely hysterical situation from the simplest of things . It is made this amusing thanks to the fantastic writing , acting and non-patronising tone of the whole thing.The show is primarily based around four super intelligent stereotypical nerds and their blonde bimbo neighbour played by the wonderful Kaley Cuoco . The four nerds are the closest of friends and comprise of Sheldon played by Jim Parsons , Leonard played by Johnny Galecki , Howard played by Simon Helberg and Rajesh played by Kunal Nayyar . Each character has their own fantastic quirks that makes them individually a quality addition to the whole ensemble . Specifically Sheldon who is the genuine super genius of the group that contains not an ounce of modesty about his intelligence or his work . Parsons presents an almost seemless character that exhibits the general unease in modern society that you would expect from someone of such an academic nature , yet amongst his peers exhumes a confidence that portrays an obvious annoyance amongst his room mate and closest friends.Looking at the general synopsis of the show you would be forgiven for thinking that it 's a simple `` boy meets girl , boy likes girl , but girl is too good for boy , but boy does n't realise it so keeps chasing her . '' Throughout a lot of the first season this is definitely portrayed , but it done in such a subtle way that it avoids the annoyance that would no doubt make it a cliche . This is more about the intelligent banter between the two main friends of the four , Sheldon and Leonard . Leonard is the more down to Earth character , and although a bit of an outcast in his own right , feels the embarassment that such heightened levels of intelligence and geekyness that he possesses which Sheldon seems to look past.Much like `` Frasier '' , this presents an extremely intelligent cast and some genuinely good acting along with presenting the prolongued fish out of water idea rather than weekly random situation that would create a string of gags . The acting within is superb and although the characters may seem quite transparent , there 's the potential to have much more depth revealed from within . Kaley Cuoco is the unlikely candidate for this as although the last time I personally saw her was playing generally the same type of character in `` 8 Simple Rules '' , she expresses genuine potential of a great actress and she displayed her great acting skills in the scenes of `` 8 Simple Rules '' following the untimely death of the legend John Ritter . Although that may have been fueled by genuine emotion , she delivered her lines with the same confidence and prowess we had become used to whilst playing to the Daughter who lost her Father story.If we get some emotional scenes , then I expect her to be on the front lines of acting within them . Other than the want of some genuine emotion , there 's nothing negative I can say about this show . Throughout it uses a genuinely intelligent script that does n't patronise the viewer by trying to explain everything they 're talking about , or presenting a `` moral of the story is ... '' angle to each episode . It gets a strong recommendation and I have to ask that if you have n't seen it already , then the question has to be asked . What the hell have you been doing with yourself ?	1
Leonard Hofstadter and Sheldon Cooper are very smart scientist living together in an apartment in New York City . They are not very popular and their only friends are fellow scientist Rajnesh ( Raj ) Koothrappali and Howard Wolowitz who often come over to play games.Then Penny moves in across the way and Leonard has a massive crush on her . The show details how their lives collide each learning from the other , often with very funny consequences .	1
This is a great show that just keeps getting better and better . The writing is very clever and characters are a riot . I ca n't get enough of this show , and get a laugh out of it every time I see it , even the reruns . One of the most original and funny shows to come around in a long long time.I 'm happy to see this out on DVD and hope the show continues . If you have n't seen the show watch a few episodes . I think you 'll like it .	1
I really enjoyed this show . It gets 5 stars from me because I lost count of how many times I laughed out loud . This show has definite potential ! I will definitely watch this one .	1
I do n't think I have busted a gut watching a comedy series until watching `` The Big Bang Theory '' . What a wonderful and hilarious series coming from the minds of Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady.The series is about two physicists Leonard ( Johnny Galecki ) and Sheldon ( Jim Parsons ) who live in an apartment together . One day , they get a new neighbor with Penny , a blonde and beautiful woman from Nebraska who has come to California for a better life but after a bad breakup , finds friendship with Leonard and his friends.Joining Leonard and Sheldon are their two best friends Howard ( Simon Helberg ) , a perverted and horny brainiac and Rajesh ( Kunal Nayyar ) , another brainiac but has a problem with his inability to speak with beautiful girls.What makes this comedy work so well are the character dynamics and each of their quirks . Especially the character of Sheldon who is just the most anal geek among the three but Parson 's Sheldon just is incredible . Included in this season 1 box set are a total of 17 episodes.1 . Pilot - Penny moves into the building and Leonard who is smitten by her agrees to get back her TV from her muscle-bound ex.2 . The Big Bran Hypothesis - Leonard is addicted to cleanliness and organization and ca n't stand Penny 's messy room , so he sneaks into her room during the early morning to organize her room.3 . The Fuzzy Boots Corollary - Leonard has a date with Penny but she does n't know it 's a date.4 . The Luminous Fish Effect - Sheldon gets fired from work and decides to stay at home , concocting experiments and annoying everyone.5 . The Hamburger Postulate - Leonard 's not sure if he 'll ever become Penny 's boyfriend , so he and a fellow co-worker decide to have sex , while Sheldon does n't know what to do when his roommate is having sex in their apartment.6 . The Middle Earth Paradigm - Penny 's having a Halloween party and all the guys are invited including her ex who picks on Leonard.7 . The Dumpling Paradox - What happens when Howard gets lucky with Penny 's friend ? 8 . The Grasshopper Experiment - Rajesh finds a way to get over his inability to speak to a woman but what happens when his parents plan an arranged marriage and he has to meet with this woman.9 .

The Nerdvana Ahhihilation - What happens when Leonard orders a ( very large ) time machine from a film.15 . The Pork Chop Indeterminacy - Sheldon 's twin arrives and the guys fall for her.16 . The Peanut Reaction - It 's Leonard 's birthday but what happens when he and Wolowitz get an allergic reaction from eating peanuts.17 . The Tangerine Factor - Leonard and Penny go on their first date.AUDIO AND VIDEO : The audio is stereo and nothing major since the show is primarily all dialogue . As for the video , the earlier episodes has a bit of graininess to it . I thought maybe playing the disc on a Blu-ray player maybe showing a lot of noise but I checked the disc on another player and it seems that the first few episodes just had a bit of it . But fortunately , not all of it are like that . If anything , you see it moreso on the pilot.SPECIAL FEATURES : The DVD box set unfortunately does n't have too many special features . Included is a featurette titled `` Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory : A Behind-the-Scenes Look Into Geek Chic '' . The 20-minutes featurette features interviews with the creators Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady and also the cast.What I found interesting about the featurette was learning how the show was created , how the actors were selected and the use of science in the show.I 've always wondered what would happen on television with a lot of the sitcoms now nearly all gone from television except on syndication . But I have to admit that Monday nights on CBS has become my favorite night thanks to `` The Big Bang Theory '' and `` How I Met Your Mother '' .I have to admit that `` The Big Bang Theory '' is just so enjoyable to me because of my enjoyment of super heroes , comic books , technology , video games , science , etc . Although these guys are more on the extremeness of geekiness , I ca n't help but love the show . It 's absolutely one of the best sitcoms right now and for a comedy series , I do n't think I have laughed so much since `` Seinfeld '' .You can find this season 1 set for a great price and I definitely recommend this TV series ! Give it a try , you 'll love it !	1
When this series came out I watched the pilot episodes and laughed so hard that my housemate thought that there was something wrong with me . I could completely identify with every character in this sitcom and found a very synchronous connection between the characters , the living spaces and work environment and what I had experienced in my life in a former job . Sheldon 's overt Asperger 's Syndrome adds an element of humor that allows us to laugh at `` smart '' people without feeling uncomfortable and out of line . The timing , writing and character development is done very well on this show and it just continues to blossom from one season to the next.If you are looking for a new , quirky sitcom that turns science on it 's head at times ... . you may find yourself enjoying `` The Big Bang Theory '' the way I did those first episodes . I remember laughing so hard I thought I was going to break a rib . The newness and very succinct humor really got me good . If you work in a science background and among scientists ... you will find humor in this great show.I love it !	1
This season movie I thought was great . I love all of The Big Bang Theory shows and watch them over and over whenever I want a great laugh ! Sheldon and Penny make the show but they all are really great acting nerds !	1
Wow ! Who knew this show would be such a hit ? It is a mainstay in out TV line up . Good laughs and fun .	1
I never get tired of this show . I think it will go down in history with a following like Seinfeld !	1
This sitcom is bad ass ! Its funny as hell ! I will be getting all seasons ! Plus it came extra quick and came in excellent condition !	1
I bought this as a gift for my step-mother who had been wanting to watch the show . She was hesitant to catch re-runs on tv starting in the middle , so I surprised her with the first season . This season , more than the others , does take a warming up period . But , that can be said for any new show . Funny as all get out ! You wo n't be disappointed with Big Bang !	1
This show is hilarious ! I highly recommend to any and all who enjoy a good laugh and do n't mind a sexual innuendo here and there .	1
Love the Big Bang Theory ! So handy to have a couple of episodes downloaded on my kindle for when I travel	1
Our whole family loves this hilarious ensemble comedy show.Sheldon is an eccentric physicist with Nobel Prize potential and limited social skills . His roommate , Leonard , is a run-of-the-mill genius by comparison ; also brilliant , but self-aware enough to know there is more to life than physics research . Their social group is rounded out by Raj , another physicist who is to shy to talk when women are present ( unless he has had a few drinks ) and Howard , the mere engineer of the group . These four friends are fairly content to watch science fiction films , collect action figures , and chase girls unsuccessfully . . . until they meet the girl next door ( literally ) , Penny , the aspiring actress and `` dumb blonde '' who can teach these four brilliant scientists a thing or two about enjoying life.The characters are all likeable and relatable in their own ways and mostly nice to one another.You might think these characters are over the top , but I have met enough geeks to know that people like this really do exist . . . and really are entertaining.Fun for the whole family ; we have n't yet seen an episode that did n't make us laugh out loud !	1
Big Bang Theory in My Favorites library now can be streamed any time . Wish I had read the fine print and saw it was n't HD . But it is a great series .	1
When you meet this group of genius nerds , you will be hooked on The Big Bang Theory ! Dr. Sheldon Cooper is played BRILLIANTLY ( excuse the pun ) by Jim Parsons and has more quirks than a hedgehog has spikes ( but he 's not crazy , `` his mom had him tested ! '' ) Penny ( their `` normal '' neighbor ) is adorable and charming and has the patience of a saint while putting up with her very strange group of friends . This is an intelligently written sit-com . I highly recommend this series !	1
Sure , we have the creators of this show that came up with the concept and , to be sure , there are the characters that bring the show to life ... but who really have the brains overall ? Believe it or not , even though they 're total brainiacs , it 's not Sheldon or his totally egotistic roommate Sheldon ( who has issues galore ) , I do believe it 's their blonde neighbor , Penny , who definitely knows how to portray common sense effectively . And in each episode , where misadventures fire up all the time , I could n't help but laugh my jaw off at each antic , especially the failed tactics of the live person counterpart of Pepy Lepew- Howard Horowitz . Almost felt like I needed a death certificate for laughing so hard each time.As for Sheldon 's attitude and cold , distant , nonpersonal way ... I laughed real hard at what happens to him at the Physics Bowl ( who would 've guessed a janitor could actually be smart ? ) . Not to mention Rajesh finding a way to actually talk to women ( make that two , though I do n't think the side effects will be wanted ) , oh , and ca n't forget Leslie Winkler and her forward , somewhat off-putting , yet very well-done character as the female version of the guys . And the chemistry between Leonard and Penny may be obvious , but it also works , very , very well . It 's not blaring , it works equally with all the nerdish humor- his intelligence and awkwardness with her charm and ditziness . And if this is just the start-up , then let the bigger laughs begin when I get to season 2 .	1
I love this show -- -the characters are so three dimensional and believable . kudos to the writers -- -it 's an exceptional show ! I tried to write and tell them that Sheldon would never say , `` smarter than me '' which he does in the Dennis Kim episode when he 's talking to Howard . It 's `` smarter than I '' and Sheldon knows that . If anyone knows how to reach the writers , pass it along .	1
Started by watching reruns - never even considered it before ... what was I thinking ? This is the 1st TV show ever , ever , ever that makes me Laugh Out Loud ! ( I Never laugh out loud ) I 'm now addicted & watch every chance I can . Love each , but the `` Soft Kitty '' scenes w/Sheldon & Penny ...	1
My real pleasure in this sitcom is watching the interplay between the chief geeks : Leonard , who wants to be normal , and Sheldon , who disdains normality . Perhaps that 's why this show has such a following : many brainy types find themselves torn between wanting to fit into the human race , and having little interest in being ordinary . I teach at the university level , so I see this basic pattern play out among my colleagues every working day.Leonard has fallen for Penny , the pretty aspiring actress living across the hall . Sheldon has a very narrow range of interests , in which he continually tries to improve himself , but little concern for anything outside his comfort zone . Leonard would love to shut off the ideas constantly whizzing around his brain . Sheldon would love to shut off the world and retreat into those ideas for the rest of his life . Neither one can have what he wants.These brainiacs attract a huge audience , I contend , because real-life brainy types have both these paradigms at play simultaneously . I 'd love , like Sheldon , to care nothing for sex or approval , and just do what fulfills me . But I 'd also love , like Leonard , to reach outside myself and join the human race as an equal . Sadly , I can do neither . So I , and studious geeks worldwide , will sit back and watch these nerds fight that battle for me .	1
Utterly hilariously funny . And wonder of wonders just as funny the 3rd time around . My girl-friend , who has no comics or SF interests , got hooked on it two and we 've just finished the 2nd viewing of it - at her insistence . No wonder this show consistently pulls in over 14 million viewers every week .	1
Leonard , Penny , Raj , Howard , Sheldon make this the best show on TV . No swearing , somewhat educational , geeks rule is a great message . Will buy every season ever made .	1
This is a great series and It is different from anything that is on TV these days and i like that about this series !	1
We purchased the first season used and it arrived quickly and in great shape and with the correct number and of discs and the correct season one discs included . We just became interested in the show and wanted to catch up by watching previous seasons so we 've purchased each season and enjoy watching and rewatching them .	1
After several seasons of this show I finally started watching it and I 'm not sure why I waited as long as I did . All the elements of this show hit every nail on the head for me . A funny show that mixes elevated humor with more crude humor and actually has a developing story line . Who would have thought this would be a good idea ? Oh yeah , the guy behind Two and a Half Men , the show that present humor to the lowest common denominator of humanity , whoda thunk it ? This is an amazingly well thought out show in the respect of the characters , while presenting certain character archetypes , which I 'm sure will be mined for comedy gold in later seasons , we are n't left with mere empty shells of characters . Instead we actually get to love each character individually by the writers presenting the negative side to each characters oddity . Whether it be Sheldon 's staunchness in his character and inability to easily adapt to new situations to Rajesh 's inability to communicate with those of the female gender , we 're presented with characters who are extremely intelligent but also deeply flawed , creating a situation that is hard to parallel and also hard to make a strong comparison to within this genre . While granted the show does still present itself within the sitcom genre and many of it 's tropes , it manages to elevate itself above that with some intelligent writing and some brilliantly acted characters . Sadly the main female lead found in Penny is strongly lacking for me in many regards ( let 's see if they develop that later on ) she is somewhat counter balanced by minor side characters like Leslie Winkle , is this enough to alleviate the bimboness that is Penny at times , obviously not but the end of the first season does lead toward some character develop in that regard . I 'm excited that I 've finally started to watch this show because I 've long felt that with a handful of exceptions ( Modern Family , the first few seasons of Raising Hope , 30 Rock - who now that I think about it have much stronger female characters ) the sitcom genre is dying a painful death in front of our eyes . With these shows revitalizing our perception and expectation of not only the genre but also what is and is not funny , I have some hope for this uniquely American creation .	1
So , okay , I love the concept and execution of the set . It 's a simple set with a single Blu-Ray format case housing first the Blu discs , then the DVDs , and coming with a single UV redemption code for the whole season in high def.It comes with a couple bonus features on both the Blu / DVD discs ( last disc , I think ? ) ... Overall , I like the execution . I think this is how things should generally be released going forward . Kudos on that , WB ! Blu for high def , DVD for low-def or for sharing with friends who have n't yet upgraded and UV for online streaming or downloadable personal digital copy . Kind of like future-proofing . Makes sense to me.However , I 'll note that , for whatever reason , the 'high def ' video quality does n't seem all that great . Especially watching on UV via VUDU ( have n't tried yet via CinemaNow to see if the same problems persist via a different UV ecosystem provider ) . It 's especially apparent on the pilot episode , but seems endemic . While it 's high def there seem to be lots of compression artifacts abounding making he picture look pretty poor quality , especially noticeable on my 60 '' TV when you get right up close . It looks pretty bad ... So , I put in the Blu-Ray just to compare . It looks *a bit better* on Blu-Ray proper , but there 's still quite a bit of graininess . So , I 'm a bit disappointed . I do n't know if it 's 'cause the original was shot at lower def and upgraded , or whether the transfer just was n't done cleanly from film or whatever.I have n't yet looked closely at season 2 Blu 's yet to see if the problems persist with the transfer . I 'll take a look more closely at some point and find out.Overall , though , I love the set and the show itself . And since one sits the better part of 8-10 feet away from the screen the artifacts are n't terribly noticeable at that distance . Right up close it 's VERY noticeable , especially streaming , probably due to compression algorithms being somewhat 'lossy ? ' But I can forgive it sin ethe overall set is great.Ca n't wait for Seasons 3-4 to update to the Blu+DVD+UV format , since it looks like they were originally released in Blu-only format ( no DVD or UV ) . Once you ship 'em that way ( combo pack ) , I 'll pick 'em up , very few questions asked . As long as they 're done as well as these are . I 'm all for it ! And the combo-ness is a good thing , sinec my friend who loves the show has n't yet upgraded to a Blu-ray player and he LOVES the show too , so with the combo pack , we can still enjoy them over at his place and laugh our butts off for hours on end . Thanks ! That 's all !	1
This quirky little show is a little to close to reality for me to appreciate the humor . While everyone else in the room is roaring - I 'm twitching with unease because I think I dated Sheldon . Not the star but a real character who , in my reality , was actually named `` Sheldon '' ! I thought brainiacs were sexy - NO - they are just guys who 's brains have outgrown their heads . The funniest part in this show is the overt discomfort that is evident in these guys when they find themselves in everyday situations surrounded by dumb folk like you and me . My favorite episode was when Sheldon got the flu and became the center of the universe ( unto himself ) and the great effort his friends went to in order to avoid him during his illness . I think this was the show when I mixed up the TV Sheldon with my Sheldon , another whiney hypocondriac . Oh lord - I 'm so confused.Bottom line - this is a funny funny show and well worth the price ... bg	1
Brilliant show and the writing is very good . ( I 'm not related to the writers ) Somebody must have been a geek in highschool .	1
I got the first season of The Big Bang Theory for Christmas and I have to say that I have n't laughed this hard at a television show in a long time . I heard good things about it , but I could never fit it into my DVR 's schedule without getting rid of some other shows that I like . The cast of four nerds and a hot blonde is perfect and the writers have to be just as smart as the main characters to come up with such intricate and funny dialogue . This show is enjoyable even if you do n't get all the tech geek talk , but if you understand why one of the characters playing Halo 3 gets pissed off and killed because he got a Needler weapon , then this show will blow your mind .	1
Sheldon : Okay , who 's on lithium ? Leonard : Huh ? Sheldon : Look at our logo . Three electrons orbiting the nucleus . If you look at the CGI atom that appears between scene changes , the nucleus consists of six spheres , 3 neutrons and 3 protons , although why one of them is pink and another one is gold is beyond me-Penny : I think the pink one is supposed to be me.Sheldon : That would almost make sense , but then why 6 spheres ? There are only 5 of us . In any event , this is clearly a lithium atom.Howard : Actually , as a matter of fact , I used to be on lithium . Now I 'm on Prozac.Leonard : It 's not supposed to represent lithium , it 's just supposed to represent ... atoms , and..stuff.Sheldon : `` Atoms and stuff ? '' Then it 's meaningless . It 's gaudy and comical . If we are to have a logo , it should be something we can respect.Leonard : Thank you , Dr. Manhattan.Sheldon : I 'm serious ! We need to get this logo changed to something actually relevant to the big bang theory.Raj ( whispers to Howard , smiling . ) Howard : Well , maybe , but how would you turn that into a logo ? Raj ( whispers some more ) Howard : Hmm ... Nah , I do n't think she 'd go for itPenny : No . She wouldn't.Sheldon : You all are talking about coitus , are n't you ? If you think any of the above is remotely humorous , get this series . It 's even better .	1
I recently moved to Thailand to teach and there is little to watch in English on t.v . I overheard some co-workers discussing how funny the show is , so I bought the first season DVD . It is so funny I finally had to stop eating while watching to avoid choking , so I bought the other two seasons . Right now I 'm trying to figure out how to download season 4 to my PC . I 've watched all three seasons several times and it still makes me choke on food , but I suppose eventually I 'll get tired of it and stop laughing . Has n't happened yet , though .	1
Being geeks and sci-fi/fantasy fans , the wife and I enjoy the humor of the Big Bang Theory and a lot of the & # 34 ; in & # 34 ; jokes , spoofs , cameos , and general chemistry among all the actors and the situations they get themselves into .	1
When this series first aired I thought it would be a typical clone series of Friends or Joey or the like but to my surprise and happiness I found it actually has a talented and entertaining cast who keep the series more enjoyable as each season comes out . I like how it plays on the seemingly stereotypical lifestyles of the vastly intelligent but socially awkward and socially talented but slight less intelligent academically and not always in the same group as you would think . Many people have wondered if the series has a laugh track like some of the early 80 's to mid 90 's shows , while you do hear laughter it 's actually from an audience rather then a mechanical laugh track.Still if you find it annoying to hear laughter in some of the scenes then this series is one you might want to pass over , while it does n't distract you from what 's going on in the scenes more then half the episodes will have for obvious reasons laughing in them . If you 're still unsure of the series I 'd say get the first season especially for the price it 's going for and see whether or not you will become a fan as I highly suspect or this is a series you 'll want to pass over either way I still say the series is worth a try .	1
Finally a comedy that provides food for thought ! This DVD also has a few extras at the end . Should be a big hit for college grads & faculty .	1
What can I add about this very clever and hilarious TV series , which I just discovered even though it 's in its sixth season , when there are already 441 reviews posted here ? Probably not much but I 'll try.Though the Complete First Season has been released before , a new `` Combo Pack '' is now out ( as of July 10th ) with both Blu-ray AND DVD versions plus the new Ultra Violet concept - all in one package . ( So you will never be without a chance to watch these episodes again and again. ) . For those folks who complained that the only `` bonus '' in the original First Season set was the `` Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory '' featurette , you 'll be happy to know that they added a gag reel this time . I 'm not sure that is enough to replace your earlier set but it 's a nice bonus for those - like me - just discovering it.There 's no reason to go into the plot of the show - again , it 's covered in other reviews - but I did notice that after the first for or five episodes ( which at 22 minutes - no commercials - are like potato chips : you ca n't stop with just one ) the characters changes in odd ways . Leonard seems less nerdy and Penny less overtly sexy ( plus she must have lost her job at The Cheesecake Factory because by the fourth episode or so she is serving the `` guys '' at a local hamburger place in a non-TCCF uniform.The ONLY thing I found a bit of a downer - and I do n't see it mentioned in other reviews - is that the series uses a `` laugh track '' which was very popular in the 1960s before TV comedies started being recorded in front of live audiences . It is really annoying because it sounds phony and you will hear the same laughter over and over , sometimes even before the punch line . It bothered me a lot during the first three episodes but I guess I got used to it a little as time went on . It 's just too bad that they felt need to use these.So , I 'm jumping on the bandwagon for this series and in the process of `` catching up '' . If you 've read this review before the others , I hope I 've encouraged you to scroll down and read some more . Better yet , just sample an episode and , like me , I 'm sure you will get hooked ! I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.Steve Ramm '' Anything Phonographic ''	1
This show has more laughs than clowns at a circus . Great adult humor . Now my wife and I are both hooked .	1
My wife caught on to this first and had me start to watch it . Coming from the geek culture of comic books and sci fi myself it 's not a surprise that I find it often funny and you root for these dorks , these geeks , these persons who hold our future in their hands . The main relationships revolve around roommates Sheldon Cooper ( played smashingly by Jim Parsons with holier-than-thou grandiosity and pomposity ) and Leonard Hofstadter ( played understatedly by Johnny Galecki , the put-upon outside-the-window-looking-in dreamer ) , two of the comic book loving , sci-fi eschewing braniacs who get entangled with new neighbor Penny ( played ditzilly by Kaley Cuoco , all broke dreams and big heart ) . Leonard has a hankering for her while Sheldon does n't phenomenologically understand what a hankering is and Penny ? Well , she 's a sleep-around lush truth to tell so you know she 's fair game for the usually out-of-everyone's-league Leonard . Rounding out the cast for this first season are the bromance brothers , Howard Wolowitz ( played by Simon Helberg who out-horndogs just about everyone , including Wilt Chamberlain ) and Raj Koothrappalli ( played by Kunal Nayyar playing up the smart guy from India with the Indian accent angle and who , unlike Howard , freezes up in the presence of pretty women and ca n't talk to them ; the problem with Howard is that he can talk ... about how much he would like to introduce each and every one of them to his little Wolowitz ) , two fellow scientists who have nothinig better to do than play Xbox deathmatches and visit the local comic shop with Leonard and Sheldon.The clever thing about this series is its mining of both geek and intellectual culture on collision with a more common , popular consumer culture . The four guys are given their idiosyncracies and ( unfortunately ) Penny less so , she 's more of a hot mess really , but perhaps she develops some in future seasons . We 'll see .	1
Great show . Saw it on tv about half way thru season . Top show . Funny . Something just about everyone likes . Good quality disc .	1
Focusing on the lives of physicists , and geeky ones at that , does make for an atypical television series , but a great cast , original characters , and high quality writing , combine to produce a modern comedic gem . Created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady , it understandably took a little while for the creative team to develop the personalities of the characters . But once the basic parameters were set , The Big Bang Theory began to boldly go where no comedy has gone before.With characters that always seem to be evolving , the series explores some unusual topics , and frequently heads into uncharted territory , usually making it impossible to predict what may happen . This is one of the main reasons why this unique , goofy , show is so hilarious and captivating . The creative team taps into facets of pop culture that may be associated with geeks and nerds ( and teenage boys in general ) , and find ways to weave them into their stories , often in an exaggerated way . Science fiction , comic books , superheroes , video games , television , action figures , paint ball fights , Star Wars , and the Star Trek universe , are just a few of the subjects that are featured.The cast is marvelous , with Johnny Galecki as Leonard Hofstadter , the shy guy enchanted by his new neighbor . Jim Parsons is Sheldon Cooper . If you look up the word neurotic , Sheldon 's photo just might be there . Simon Helberg is Howard Wolowitz , the delusional sleaze , who does still have his good points . Kunal Nayyar is Rajesh Koothrappali , who ca n't speak to a beautiful woman unless he is under the influence of alcohol . Kaley Cuoco is Penny , the girl from Omaha who moved next door , works at the Cheesecake Factory . . . . and changed their universe.Since Sheldon is off the scale when it comes to weirdness ( what Penny would later come to describe as ` whackadoodle ' ) , and Wolowitz and Raj are arguably more ` abnormal ' , Leonard seems the most sensible of the bunch . Sheldon is totally unique , so bizarre in his beliefs , behavior and speech , that he seems at times to be from another planet . Jim Parsons is a amazing comic talent , with a bright , bright future.Penny has a multi-faceted role . One is as the primary female character , another is that she usually represents as close to a 'normal ' persons ' point of view as we will get . As a link to reality , she is often the reference that shows just how wacked out the guys really are . The times when she joins them in their world ( such as when she fragged Sheldon on Halo night ) , are often some of the program 's funniest moments . By the end of the season , everything about the show is clearly peaking . In ` The Pancake Batter Anomaly ' , Sheldon gets sick , and Penny gets stuck taking care of him , rubbing Vaporub on his chest , and singing ` Soft Kitty ' . In ` The Bat Jar Conjecture ' , it 's Sheldon 's team versus the rest of the gang and Leslie Winkle ( Sara Gilbert ) , in the Physics Bowl . Sheldon 's knockout of a twin sister arrives and makes waves , in ` The Pork Chop Indeterminacy ' . Sheldon gets a look in the mirror , in ` The Jerusalem Duality ' when a young genius arrives on campus . In ` The Nerduana Annihilation ' , when Leonard buys the time machine used in the classic 60 's film ` The Time Machine ' on eBay , Penny 's astute description is that ` It looks like something that Elton John would drive through the Everglades ' . In the season finale , there 's a glimmer of hope for romance for Leonard , in ` The Tangerine Factor ' when Penny agrees to go out with him.The Big Bang Theory is simply one of the most engaging comedies to come along in years . Each episode seems to fly by , and leave you wanting more . Some commentary tracks would have been cool , but the only bonus is the ` Quantum Mechanics of The Big Bang Theory ' a look at the creators , cast , and genesis of the show . There are only seventeen episodes in the First Season due to the writers ' strike.Things only get better in the second season , as the show 's creative team continue to develop the characters , and introduce new elements to the mix , keeping things fresh and extremely funny . As Sheldon Cooper might say , it is a foregone conclusion that the third season will be characterized by the same outstanding writing , and brilliantly quirky humor found in the first two seasons , continuing to keep The Big Bang Theory , at the cutting edge of contemporary comedy .	1
When this show first came out , I paid only casual attention to it . I was n't hooked until I saw the episode in which Sheldon and Leslie Winkle ( Leonard 's girlfriend at the moment ) engage in an argument over the relative merits of String Theory and Quantum Gravity . I had been involved in a discussion with one of my fellow scientists regarding this very same topic only days before viewing this episode -- and the points that we addressed were almost the same as those articulated by the characters . I had never seen a TV show where the characters actually talked about the same things that we real scientists do -- and actually in an intelligent manner ! That said , not all statements voiced by the characters regarding physics are sensible or realistic.Of course , this is a TV comedy -- not a documentary ! Unlike Sheldon , Leonard , and the rest of the crew , Physicists and other Ph.D.-bearing scientists and engineers who reside in the real world have little interest in comic books and superheroes . In fact , of the thousands of scientists who I have known , only one ever expressed a great interest in comic books or superheroes . Although people with such graduate degrees have generally seen movies and TV shows featuring such staples as Star Trek , Star Wars , and Lord of the Rings , I am not sure that they view them more often than the general public . Most scientists I know are more interested in the sports teams of their hometowns , music ( both popular and classical ) , politics , and literature . It is probably true , however , that scientists read more science fiction novels than the general public.Like Leonard , most scientists would indeed count themselves lucky to have a charming girlfriend like his lovely neighbor Penny played by Kaley Cuoco -- and her often insightful character provides an important counterpoint to the book-smart but socially awkward scientists across the hall . Her character is also admirable for her many clever and humorous remarks . She is even able to eventually appreciate the somewhat obscure in-jokes of her scientist neighbors ! I should also observe that some scientists and engineers do have to ability to surround themselves with attractive women -- and it is such smooth operators who become department heads at universities or government research labs ! It has also come to my attention that this TV show was nearly the biggest topic of conversation for physicists attending the 2012 March Meeting of the American Physical Society ! Apparently many of the attendees had all of the episodes memorized , and spent much of their time at the APS meeting debating the significance and theme of each episode !	1
Sitcoms are coming back in full force ! CBS is running the show with hits like Two and A Half Men and How I Met Your Mother . This year a new one was added to the bunch . The Big Bang Theory is the story of two supergenius roomates Sheldon and Leonard whose lives revolve around numbers , chemical equations and a lot of Science Fiction pop culture . Suddenly there world is turned upside down when the beautiful blonde Penny moves in next door . Now two worlds hystericaly clash as the boys learn how to live life and Penny learns to tolerate them.I was part of a focus group watching the pilot and I was laughing from begining to end . I think it may be hard for the average TV watcher to get some of the jokes and references , but I also feel to really appreciate this show you have have people like this in your life ! My own younger brother is a former jock watches sports all the time and would never touch the subjets touched upon on this show . Still , he had me for an older brother so he gets a large portion of the references and therefore he thinks it 's one of the best shows on TV . I have to admit I am somewhat classified in the geek category . I love Sci-fi/ fantasy movies , I 'm an cartoon watcher , love working on computers and all that stuff . But I have a few of friends that are way over the top than I am . They go to cons , playing rpgs , dress up to movie premeres and know all the details that make this planet tick . So really you may not get this show unless you live it ! ! !	1
After resisting the urge to make big changes in season three , season four changed everything , especially the team that works with House , which took a bit longer than it really needed , but which led to a two-part ending that 's among the best episodes the show ever produced . The DVDs look and sound excellent , and the extras are a step up from the previous release , though they are missing a few of the more popular elements from previous sets . Unlike last season , this is a fine opportunity for new fans to jump on board , with a season that 's practically self-contained , yet a wonderful continuation on the show 's storylines .	1
House is always the man with me . He can siolve any medical mystery , and smart as you know what . Like this show a lot ...	1
At the end of season 3 we were given the shocking conclusion of losing the team we have loved for three years . Foreman quit because he did n't want to become House , Cameron quit because it was time for a change and Chase was fired . I know a lot of dedicated fans felt this was a big mistake , as these were characters that we had fallen in love with and did n't want to say goodbye to . Season 3 left us with a message that it was time for a change . Let me tell you that this change was awesome . Starting with episode 1 of season 4 , House is alone in his office and has n't worked since he lost his team . Determined to get House to hire new staff , Cuddy sets him a challenge . Cure his patient alone and he does n't have to hire a team , otherwise if he ca n't figure out what 's wrong on his own , he must hire a team . House loses the bet and episode one ends with House in a room of 40 doctors hoping to be on the team.Season 3 , in a way was one of the more emotional seasons when testing his friendship with Wilson and testing his previous teams loyalty . Season 4 was more of a relief from that drama , with which some people may not like , but I truly loved . The first few episodes became a reality TV type show in which House would test his 40 possible employees and fire the ones that failed . Over this time we started to become aware of who the team would eventually be and what their quirks and personalities were.With the comic relief of the first few episodes , the finale presents us with a real tear jerker and possibly the most emotional episodes we have ever seen from the show . Wilson falls in love with one of House 's former possible employees , but the finale tests their love as his girlfriend is taken critically ill. Robert Sean Leonard really shines in the finale and next to the sensible man we 've come to know and love , he gives us a real emotional side . The two part finale is something brilliantly made that no fan will be disappointed with . I find that even with the writers strike , we were still given the most triumphant season finale from the entire show.Along with that I ca n't help but think that they had plans to have the old team re-unite at the end of season four . Unfortunately we would n't get to see that at the end of season four . I hope we really do get to see this situation arise in season five , although the team are n't completely gone . Cameron is in E.R. , Chase is now a surgeon and Foreman is back and working for House already . In this season we were given a further development between the relationship of Cuddy and House . I 'm hoping that in season 5 we are given a definitive answer on where this relationship is going . This season , as usual was filled with the classic lines that it 's famous for and below are some of my favourites.From Episode 4 : Guardian Angels : House : `` I ca n't ask the black guy or one of the chicks to do it ; it 'd be insensitive . `` From Episode 10 : It 's A Wonderful Life : House : `` You talk to your kid about sex so she 'll think you 're open about everything . Keeps her from asking questions about the things you do n't wan na talk about . `` From Episode 13 : No More Mr. Nice Guy : House : `` Run him for everything you can think of : lepto , schisto , hemo and the fourth Marx Brother nobody ever heard of. ``	1
I 've loved HOUSE since its inception for the most obvious reason : Hugh Laurie . This season decided to sidestep a little and really take some time to highlight the supporting characters . The moments of the series that give me the most consistent pleasure are the moments with Laurie interacting with Robert Sean Leonard and Lisa Edelstein . Those scenes are attacked with gusto and a great deal of humor . The `` medical mysteries '' are slightly more edgy than your usual doctor drama , but do n't really add to what makes the show great as often as they could . I will close this review by saying that the season finale is one of the most tragic episodes of television ever . I was sobbing like a little girl who skins her knee while finding out her puppy just ran away from home at the same time she found out that Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny do n't exist . I found it very difficult to stop crying for several minutes AFTER the show was over !	1
You try and you try to hate this buy but somehow never pull it off . He always redeems himself at the last moment .	1
To me , this series can be pretty darn good ... I hope they keep it running and not saddle it with idiots and break it as they have done with so many decent tv series that get chopped and cut by studios and then rehashed into dung heap reruns ... this series is a pretty good one which I can personally relate to as a medical professional . Enjoy the show , it is pretty decent ... This season was a bit weird not having the old staffers with House but they did some rather odd things and came out ok . Some of the plot ideas I think could have used some rethinking but they did the student stuff ok overall . I will be interested to see what happens with the old staffers in the next season .	1
House is my favorite show , combining the drama , tension and intelligence of a amazing medical series with believability , quirkiness , oddities , subtle humor , endearing charm and wonderful casting .	1
Funny , funny , funny , so very funny ! I enjoyed seasons 1 & 2 of `` It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia '' on DVD , a friend at work was big on the show and constantly quoted lines from it and described the scenes to me . Long story short , he bought Sea . 1 + 2 and I borrowed it blindly , having never seen a episode . I liked it , it took a while and several episodes , but I liked it.Then came ... Season 3 , wow , easily the funniest single season of any show I have seen so far . I laughed and laughed at Charlie , Dee and the gang . I 've always liked Danny DeVito , who does n't , but his character ( Frank ) is really good and very funny ! I also think the opening of the show is one of the best I 've seen in awhile ! Green Man is iconic and then there are , well , the McPoyles ! My favorite episodes where : Sweet Dee 's Dating a Retarded PersonThe Aluminum Monster and Fatty McGooThe Gang Dances Their Asses OffThe Gang Gets Taken HostageHilarious , looking forward to Sea . 4 on DVD soon~	1
This is the greatest show on television today . I own every season now and watch at least one show every day . It never disappoints in making me laugh historically .	1
Awesome series ! Will continue watching . The cast seem to be fused as one - of course some have relations outside this series so maybe that is why they act so well together . Looking forward to future seasons .	1
This is one of the best shows on TV right now . I love how improv it is and funny .	1
Season 3 is a bit better than 2 . The story lines are n't as focused on the Danny Devito character ( Frank Reynolds ) . Funny and very enjoyable .	1
Gets more and more crazy each season . I 'm watching this with someone else and I 'm not always laughing when they are . It can cause you to be squeamish if you are not into people choosing to do things that are not actually 'by the book ' .	1
While I really loved the two first seasons of It 's Allways sunny , the third season is not as excellent . There are many reasons : to seom degree they push irreverence somewhat too far even for me . Some episodes like the double `` The gang gets whacked '' are simply not that great , in that episode the sophomoric drug humour is somewhat tiring . The themes are : the gang finds a dumpster baby ( which is an OK episode ) and overall the first half of the season is rather good but it tnds to spiral downwards after the second disc : themes are : teh agng sells out , frank sets sweet dee on fire , sweet dee is dating a retarded person , mac is a serial killer ... oh boy . And this stuff is not really that funny . One point is that even in the first two seasons , adding Danny DeVito was not such a great idea , since his character tends to be more over the top and mroe gross than the rest to are really silly and funny . Anyway as I sa , the first disc is very good and those episodes stand up with wtaht we had seen before .	1
I love & # 34 ; Sunny. & # 34 ; Frank is like the funniest father figure on the planet . I could never have a gloomy day watching these guys . This is a must have !	1
Love this show ! ! ! I think season three is when the show starts taking off and being more awesome ! When Frank enters the mix , then the fun really begins . I used to hate this show , but now it 's my favorite . I bought this used and works great . No complaints at all ! Buy it if you like stuff that does n't suck .	1
Law and Order 16 Still Rocks ! Unique ideas , excellent characters , top-notch acting . Law and Order 16 Still Rocks ! Two thumbs up !	1
I love the show , and how it depicts what can happen if the prosecutor is dead set on sending someone to prison , whether or not the crime was a justified homicide . One episode recently showed a woman who killed her son because he was so mentally ill and violent that she knew he would kill someone if she did n't stop him . The wheels of justice were not weighed in her favor and the jury sent her to jail . Why ? Because the prosecutor showed that she did it , not only to save humanity , but to save her marriage to the young man 's stepfather and their two children . So , because there was a & # 34 ; selfish & # 34 ; reason , she lost the sympathy of the jurors . I wonder whether the verdict would have been the same if the Lanza kid from Sandy Hook had been shot by his mother before he killed all the childrent at that school . Probably so .	1
This is a good series . This is the granddaddy of all police series . I recommend this series to anybody seeking good entertainment in this type of entertainment .	1
Law and order season sixteen is a okay show to watch , if you like the changing of cast and characters .	1
This series shows imagination in the types of cases it comes up with . I 've seen lower ratings posted for the later episodes of the series , but I think the whole series was consistently good from beginning to end , personally . I think you should wait a little longer to ask for a rating of an entire season after its purchase , because no one is going to watch the entire season in 3 days .	1
Prison break continues to be a great `` seat of the pants '' show ... Prison Break Season 3 lives up to the first two seasons . I highly recommend the entire series .	1
This is a series that I hardly ever miss and then ca n't wait for it to come out on DVD !	1
i enjoy watching all the seasons of prison break , it is a very interesting shown , and its very different.the charactors in this show are extremly smart and different .	1
To start , I 'd like to mention that this season is only 13 episodes , due to the writers ' strike . That being said , I actually think it 's still on par with the previous two seasons . Some say it seemed a little rushed but I actually think it may have been a bit too much to have an entire 22 or 23 episode season of breaking out of a prison in Panama that only has guards on the outside . They do a great job once again of keeping you on the edge of your seat with this one.A lot more is revealed about `` The Company '' and the massive conspiracy , and of course , Burrows and Scofield find themselves neck deep in it . Some old faces and new alike with Scofield continuing to outsmart pretty much everyone makes this another satisfying and addictive season of Prison Break .	1
While i was excited as anything for Season 3 of Prison Break . I couldnt help but be a little disappointed this time around . It just didnt seem to have that spark that the first two seasons had to them . There were moments that made me smile and others that kept me into the show ( especially the final 2 or 3 episodes ) season ender . I believe will help ramp Season 4 of the show right back up the top of the ratings with all the interesting characters and side agendas going on . I feel it bounce back , my major gripe with the third season was the length of the show.It was only 13 episodes and while a couple of the new characters were ok for the most part . They didnt keep my interest . I did like the interaction between the various people in one prison ( Sona ) . Which i would never want to be anywhere close to ever . Also the power struggle for control of the inmates and all else that flowed through it . I 'm still watching the show regardless and this one was still worth the purchase , but just keep in mind its a bit on the short side as far as episodes go.But watch for Season 4 , i feel it will take it back to the roots for the series on the whole .	1
At first I kinda felt the 3rd season of Prison Break started off a little stale . Then by the third episode I was hooked as usual . You got Scofield dumped in the most horrific prison known to man . You got Bellick walking around half-naked lookin ' like something the cat dragged in , after it threw it up . Mahone is going through some serious withdrawal issues . And Linc on the outside pretty much clueless . My boy Sucre is still hangin ' around dedicated to Michael for all he 's done . T-Bag continues his menacing wrath . Newcomers , Whistler and Lechero and the vicious Gretchen a.k.a Susan B. make for some very interesting storylines . I agree that that daggone writer 's strike did make this season seems rushed . It 's all worth it though to see Wentworth Miller all hot and sweaty between a rock and a hard place .	1
The 3rd season brings more thrills and adventures that leave you on the edge of your seat anticipating what will happen next	1
Another example of Michaels brain over brawnEven as individuals unravel they stay true to their charactersThe series is n't as believable in this season but it does n't have to be as the emotional attachment to the characters has already been formedThey keep the series exciting with more implied violence than actual blood and gore which I think is more intelligent	1
As the third season of Prison Break begins , Michael Scofield ( Wentworth Miller ) finds himself back in prison , only this time it 's a down and dirty prison in Panama ruled by the tyrannical Lechero ( The Wire 's Robert Wisdom ) . Also sharing space with Michael are T-Bag ( Robert Knepper ) , Bellick ( Wade Williams ) , and Mahone ( William Fichtner ) ; while Linc ( Dominic Purcell ) works on the outside to get his brother free at any cost , with the assistance of a mysterious associate ( Jodi Lyn O'Keefe ) who has her own agenda . The third season of Prison Break manages to provide pretty much the same kinds of action , suspense , drama , and twists that fans of the series would come to expect by now ; which adds up to this season being a success . However , falling victim to the writer 's strike , the third season of Prison Break ends up feeling rushed and somewhat incomplete . At only 13 episodes , this is something to be expected , but it still comes off as noticeable nonetheless . Flaws aside , this is still great TV to be seen , and everyone in it is in fine form as well . All in all , the third season of Prison Break while flawed , is still enjoyable , and sets the stage for even bigger developments to follow .	1
I passed this series up more than one time thinking it was just another reality show . When I finally did give it a shot , I was hooked ! Having watched the first season on Netflix , I knew I had to buy the rest to find out what enterprising shenanigans Michael could come up with next . I really really do n't like the way the last season ended . I think it was a rip off to & # 34 ; set aside & # 34 ; a very big part of this series in a two hour dvd that is n't part of the original seasons .	1
YOU FALL IN LOVE AND GET DEEPLY ENGROSSED WITH THE CHARACTERS AND YEARN FOR THEIR HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS . VERY ADDICTIVE . CA N'T STOP WATCHING THIS SHOW .	1
I enjoyed this third season more than the previous seasons . I found the acting and storyline much superior than previously . I like all the twists throughout the episodes , keeping one at the edge of his seat . Outguessing the plot can be difficult . This season is also action packed , with every episode offering non-stop action . The way all the characters come together is also fascinating and remarkable , and their motives are unknown . Even the temporary break between Michael and Lincoln over the death of ****** ( removed as not to spoil the story ) was unexpected.The inmates inside Sona , the Panamanian prison from where Michael Scofield must escape , were very believable . His escape attempts were well conceived and believable as well . The Panamanian landscape offered an exotic touch to the storyline , different from the maximum-security prison at Fox River.I really recommend this season , and ca n't wait for season four .	1
SPOILERS ! Many of the episodes in this season seemed to drag on and on with many foiled plans , rain delays , and other obvious procrastination devices . It made Michael 's breakout plan for Sona take a lot longer than it should have.That said , there are still many suspenseful moments in this season , mostly involving the hostages and of course including the various prisoners and their would-be helpers on the outside . Former guard Bellick had a very rough time of it , while the cunning Teabag found ways to work the system from the inside . Scofield and Link put their collective heads together to formulate constantly-changing maneuvers , while Luchero made things tough for those inside Sona . And then there was the mysterious Whistler , a prisoner who was so valuable to a certain company that they would stop at nothing to get him out alive.And did Sarah really die ? Link thinks so , but what was really in that box ? LJ says he heard her die , but he never saw it . This , of course , leaves Michael to go on a mission of his own at the end of the season , trying to get revenge or find out what really happened .	1
Volume two is still more of the same original show without getting too far out . Although I was a big fan of the series when it came out , I still enjoy it . Very graphic gory , tho .	1
i wish that nbc has never taken this show off of the air . it is one of them shows that you have to see from season 1 and on to under stand the show . the best .	1
There are only 11 episodes on four discs due to the writer 's strike if you remember what happened more than five years ago.As usual , this complete season comes with bonus features : deleted scenes , audio commentaries with cast and crew and an alternate ending.I understand the frustrations from the fans.There is a lot of catching up to do , characters going back in time and to the future that it 's confusing to stay connected to what is going on in the present.The medieval Japanese storyline is kinda lost on me.What does it have to do with the heroes besides Adam Monroe being Kenzie.I love Hiro , do n't mind me not to mention Ando.They add a comedic flair to the show.Hiro has the heart of a hero.He believes his destiny is to save the world.You would think this season will explain what happened in Season 1 but you wo n't find it here.You have to watch Season 3 to find that out.Like one comment said , S2 seems like a whole different season.Nevertheless , I am curious to see how it ends .	1
I was a little disappointed in the 2nd season of Heroes . Not because of the acting , but because it was so short . Turns out this was filmed during the writers ' strike , so they had to cut the season down to eleven episodes.This meant that the story-lines were n't as fully explored as they could have been , and there was a lot less content.All of that detracted from an otherwise entertaining show.Moving on to Season 3 ... .	1
Excellent fantasy ! This has a continuing story line and the more you get to know the characters and their lives prior and after the events , you will be hooked . I am only sorry that they were cancelled . I did not like the ending .	1
A local station started reruns of Heroes . I never watch the beginning of the series when it was on TV . I got hooked on the reruns and decided I needed to watch it from the beginning . I got Season one and decided I needed Season Two . I now have 3 & 4 . I will get 5 & 6 at a later date .	1
This is the best season of a show that could have been great ! Great start and the story was hot . The development of the players was well done . TAfter this season the show went downhill and became trash . A must buy for people who like super heroes and villians . This is the only season oof the show that you should watch or buy .	1
What if we all had powers but everyone 's was different ? would you use it for good or evil ? Would you help others ?	1
I am on ep 9 , and the good hero 's are still going strong and some good characters are ..leaving , but being replaced with more great characters and twist . I am enjoying second season as much as I have enjoyed the first season so far . and hope the rest of the season 's are as good . Kristen bell is in this season , and the guy from the past ( Japan 1871 ) appears to be a great addition . I love to watch some of the old characters learning more about their past / families , and some characters are not sure what side they are on any more . Who is the good team , and who is the bad team . Everyone seems to have their idea on how a hero can save the future . Someone learns that they have more powers than they thought they had , and are becoming more like their parent with the new found powers . Think I am addicted . : (	1
Heroes season 2 I think was pretty good considering that they cut it down due to that uselesss writer 's strike . I mean the strike was useless , not the writers themselves . It left us with nothing but crappy reality shows through-out most of the year . Heroes season 2 told as good of a story as it could 've due to the short time . It does start out a bit better than it ends though . Hiro Nakamura ( Masi Oka ) still steals the show . Him in the past where he meets his childhood hero Takezo Kensei ( an excellent David Anders of Alias ) led to some of the more engaging stuff of the season . Parkman ( Greg Grunberg ) finding out that his father is infact Molly 's nightmareman was a little disappointing I admit . However the nightmare scenes were done well enough that I did n't care after awhile . I just wish that their was more of him since he was one of the fresher things about this season . He also was a little creepy.Speaking of creepy , Sylar ( Zachary Quinto ) is back but powerless . He shows that he 's dangerous even without his powers though . He meets a woman with a dangerous power that kills everyone around her when her eyes turn black and bleed . She 's a good person but her powers kill people and only her brother 's power can control her power if that makes sense . Sylar gets in her head and makes her think that he 's a good person that wants to help her . When he 's really just fascinated by her power and wants it for himself . Well when he gets his back that is and he thinks Mohinder ( Sendhil Ramamurthy ) can help him get them back.While Peter ( Milo Ventimiglia ) mysteriously lost his memory and does n't remember his brother Nathan or even having powers . He falls for a women who 's brother says he can help him remmember . He wants him to use his powers for bad though before he 'll help him . While Noah Bennet ( Jack Coleman ) moves his daughter Claire ( Hayden Panettiere ) somewhere to protect her from the company . He tells her to stay low . That 's easier said than done when a kid there sees that she has powers . It 's ok with him though since he can ... fly.I was entertained by the season . It has many twists and turns . Does it all lead up to something great though in the end ? No , I ca n't really say that . Instead of NY being threatened by a bomb it 's now threatened by a virus . While instead of Hiro seeing the future and seeing that NY is doomed , Peter does instead . So they could 've been more original , it was too familiar to what we already seen in season 1 . While Ali Larter has shown she can act as Nikki , she 's wasted in this season with little to do.It also bugged me that some new heroes have powers that we have already seen . Such as , one can fly `` like Nathan '' , while another can heal `` like Claire '' . However those were probably my only problems with the season . Other than that they did what they could due to the strike and it could have been worse .	1
I suspect this season might have been even more exciting and engaging than the first had the writers ' strike not cut it short . Since it does n't have to introduce the characters , premise , or plot , the creative team could tell a straight-ahead story that never stops accelerating right up through its final moments . But as the `` alternate ending '' demonstrates , they drew up short just as they hit a new creative flowering.Last season 's survivors struggle to gather their lives and move forward -- no small task when you 've saved the world but ca n't take the credit . Scattered from Japan to Ireland and from the present to the medieval past , they orbit each other , struggling to unknot the conspiracy that binds them together . But when old secrets come back to the fore , the heroes must face a new enemy : their own collective guilt.If I had to find fault with this season , it 's the needless introduction of new characters who complicate the narrative arc . This season has so many characters that some of them disappear for two or three episodes , and we sometimes do n't notice . Like the X-Men comics of the 1990s , when Xavier 's mansion housed a strange , expanding army , it becomes difficult for the audience to keep all the angles in mind.But for all that , it remains a tightly structured and propulsive story . It makes good use of popular science fictional standards in a new and inventive way , and it plays interesting characters with complex needs off each other faster than the speed of light . I wish they 'd had the chance to explore the bold options they wrote for themselves , but it stands as a worthy successor to the first season .	1
after season one i could n't wait to get more of these guys . what a thrill ride , perfect way to unwind	1
Season two of this hit show picks up four months after season one ended . The Bennett family has relocated to California were Noah has a new job at a paper company , a real one this time . Daughter Claire is supposed to be staying below the radar so The Company ca n't find them . But with a new boyfriend with a special power of his own , that 's harder than it appears.Meanwhile , Matt Parkman and Mohinder Suresh are living in New York City were they take care of Molly , who is having visions of a very bad man . Mohinder has gone to work for The Company , but he is working with Noah to try to take it down from the inside.Hiro has stayed in feudal Japan as he attempts to help his childhood idol Takezo become the hero of legend.The Petrelli family is going through a dark time as older brother Nathan blames himself for what he thinks happened to Peter . Unknown to him , however , Peter is alive and well and living in Ireland . The only problem is , he 's lost his memory.Then there are siblings Maya and Alejandro are heading to the US hiding a terrible secret . But when their paths cross with Sylar , things take a dangerous turn ... .This season will forever be known as the season affected by the strike . Instead of the regular full season , we only got 11 episodes . That made some fans happy , however , since they complained bitterly about the show . Frankly , I was just as hooked on the unfolding story as I was during the first season . And acting and special effects continued to be great.The main complaints most people had centered on the fact that the characters were spread out all over the country again . Yeah , it would have been nice if they were together . But the different storylines were a draw of season one . I bet if we had been given a full season , we would have seen everyone come together . These complaints were leveled even more against the new characters , especially Maya and Alejandro . Yes , I found their storyline bazaar . But with Sylar involved , I was certainly hooked on it . I did get very tired of Hiro 's trip back in time , however . That should n't have lasted nearly as long as it did.The creator himself as acknowledged many of the problems with this season . Hopefully , that means we 'll get a stronger season three . While not as strong overall as the first season , I was certainly entertained . And you will need the background to understand season three.So if you want to join the phenomenon this fall , get this set to catch up on the previous story today .	1
The second season was pretty good . More background on the main characters and the conspiracy , more creepy moments and some good writing in the episodes .	1
love being able to watch all these episodes . watching them anytime that I want to . really love watching this show	1
First , my four-star rating is a tad generous . I rounded it up from the three and a half that it deserves.A host of fans and ex-fans and critics have thoroughly thrashed HEROES so far this season . I doubt if this episode and the incredibly disappointing use of Kristen Bell will turn things around . The reason the show has gone south is easy to locate : the writing is simply below par . This comes out in a host of ways . Let me enumerate just a few.First , after a fun Season One in which we were all waiting for the various heroes to come together , they were all immediately dispersed in the first episode of Season Two . Structurally , everything that happened in Season One screamed for some unification of the characters . But nothing like this occurred . Instead , the series feels like it has been restarted . Not good.Second , instead of focusing on the already large cast of characters , they decided to introduce a large number of new characters . I think the fury of many fans against the Central American sister and brother making their way north is more than anything anger that time is being spent on characters other than those already established . And while I really like Dana Davis and think she is the cutest thing this side of sliced toast , her power seems too similar to Peter 's . Anything she sees others do , she can do as well . Anyone with a power , Peter can acquire by being in close proximity.Third , the stories simply are n't very interesting so far . It is possible that the foundation for an interesting story later on is being laid , but not much so far has actually been very compelling.The introduction of Kristen Bell is a prime example of what has gone wrong with the show . I 've avoided spoilers so I was n't sure what her power was going to be ( though had I seen the teaser that Amazon 's Unbox uses to introduce it I might have ) . They reveal her power almost immediately and in such a mundane way ! Wasted opportunity guys ! It should have been teased out a bit . And after she finds out where Peter Petrelli is she is called away from Ireland to another part of the world . Why ? The only interesting thing about her debut was the revelation that she works for her father . But here again I 'm afraid that HEROES is going to disappoint . Usually when we get info like that in a well written show we imagine that we do n't know who the father is , only to learn later that we do . My fear is that we have n't met her father but that he will be an entirely new character.I enjoyed HEROES in Season One , but I always thought it was somewhat overrated by many fans . I was astonished that anyone considered this better than LOST , let alone vastly superior shows like BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS . And PUSHING DAISIES can be added to that list . But this year so far at least 15 or 20 shows have been better . I gave Season One a five-star review and I do feel that it deserved it . But overall so far I would give Season Two a three . But I tend to be an optimist . I both hope and believe it will get better.One last word . I wonder what the departure of Bryan Fuller as Consulting Producer has meant for the show . He wrote what was far and away the best episode of HEROES so far , the absolutely splendid ( and Emmy nominated ) `` Company Man . '' I do n't know how much he brought to the show . But I do know this : so far HEROES has been a disappointment , while Bryan Fuller 's new show PUSHING DAISIES has debuted with three absolutely astonishing episodes . I hope the title of Fuller 's new show does n't eventually apply to his old one .	1
I just love the series Heroes and have all of their seasons , it a great TV Show which I highly recommendpeople to see it ! But to Understand it , you will have to start out watching the Seasons in order i.e . do notwatch season 2 without watching season 1 First , or you will have problems figuring out who 's the good guysand who 's the bad guys !	1
First couple of seasons were great liked the action stories the most . I had missed a few episodes so was good to wsatch view them .	1
I thought this was a great show and ca n't wait to watch the rest of the series , They keep you interested thru the whole show and keep coming back to see what happens next '	1
Last year the entertainment world hit a major road block . Movies were put on hold and television shows were asked to cut their seasons short . Many dissapointed fans were very upset and of course what do they do they point their fingers are the wrong people.One of the shows that unfortunatly went down hard in the writters strike was Heroes . After an incredible first season we were left with an extremly short second season with a sub-par plot . Blame the big heads of entertainment , blame writters , heck blame all the people that destoryed our economy , but do n't take it out on the people we tune into every monday night to see their adventures . I have to give Tim Kring and company an A for effort as they managed to fit an entire story into a span of 12 episodes , that 's as long as an entire season on HBO people ! I loved the new characters that they brought into the show like Maya and Elle . Of course I will watch Kristen Bell even if it was her on a cheesy reality show . I loved how they brought us inside the Company and showed us the origins of how and why it was formed . I think the only downside for me was Peter 's story in the whole second season . I do beleive if they had entire 22 episode season there would have been much more to his story . Now as we are about so enter Season 3 dubed 'Villians ' I feel that Heroes will be back in it 's groove and redeem the show bringing it back to it 's awesome glory .	1
This unassuming little show about a small Texas town and it 's football team was a great ride , all the way through to the final season . The show features well-rounded characters with realistic problems and believable flaws . And , that 's refreshing , compared to some of today 's reality shows ( where the filthy rich drum up pseudo-problems to complain about ) .Maybe the fictional town of Dillon , Texas reminded me nostalgically of my own hometown , where the whole town populace came out on Friday nights to cheer on the football team of the only high school in town . Or maybe the fictional characters just remind me of my own classmates , teachers , and coaches . But , whatever the reason , this is one great show , well-acted and under-recognized .	1
This is what television should be all about . Refreshing series about life , family , responsibility and football ! I love it and ca n't stop watching it .	1
Love the show no violence just a real life show with kids playing foitball and a coach with his family	1
Really loved this show , was so sad to see it end , it was a great one for the whole family to watch together	1
I 'm obsessed with this show . I ca n't get enough . I watch it until my Kindle runs out of battery and stand watching while it is charging . My hubby just laughs	1
The best complient an actor can get is that his or her character is memorable , and you care about them . The best compliment a writer can get is that the stories are beleivable and unpredictable . This show is compliment rich . I 'm not a fan of the big hair , y'all crowd but these are real people in real situations that are not overly dramatized . Each season does get better and as you know some characters are leaving the show , their exits are done realistically and without detachment . We started watching out of boredom and are now hooked . A great series !	1
Although through the first few episodes FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS remained one of the most compelling shows on TV , it had suffered a bit from some structural problems in its narrative . On the one hand , Coach Taylor was off at Texas Methodist University , making his ongoing involvement in the narrative a challenge . On the other hand , there was the unnecessarily melodramatic killing by Landry of Tyra Collette 's Season One stalker/attempted rapist . The latter has been a problem because what made Season One so outstanding was how it felt like an encapsulation of real lives . The killing simply did n't feel real.In my opinion the show always managed to overcome these missteps to remain a fascinating and engrossing show . But it did generate the sense that the season in some ways had n't really begun . In this episode , however , Coach Taylor is back in Dillon , back in his old job , and returned to his family . And his return already seems to have helped several individuals . His wife Tami already seems less stressed . His daughter , who had been sorely tempted by the older bad boy known as The Swede , seems to have recovered her relationship with her mother , who gave her advice that may have helped Julie realize just how lame The Swede truly was . And he seems to have helped Buddy Garrity just as much . In the first three episodes Buddy seemed unsure of himself , rattled by the loss of his family as well as his status within the booster club . Here he is as confident as ever.The delicious part about this episode , as with the series as a whole , was the sheer number of things that took place in it . The show in many ways breaks with much traditional TV writing . A typical episode will have an A plot and a B plot , though after HILL STREET BLUES in the early eighties , many shows would have multiple threads in an episode . But some episodes of FNL have 7 or 8 or 9 threads going at once . Yet , it does n't come across as at all incoherent or muddled . I 'd love to see how they organize their various arcs . I assume they have some sort of ongoing storyboard.After being a major part of the first three episodes , the Tyra-Landry romance/murder ordeal played a somewhat smaller role in terms of time . Tyra does come to Landry 's house for dinner , a nice touch . Though she has been increasingly attached to Landry , she has been somewhat unwilling to make their relationship obvious in public , let alone to her or his family . So this represents a big step , especially combined with her explanation in the previous episode to Landry 's father why she likes Landry ( a great scene because it was almost as if verbalizing to someone THAT and WHY she liked Landry caused her to realize just how much she had come to feel for him ) . While at dinner , however , Landry and Tyra overhear what they had been anticipating : the discovery of her assailant 's body . I have no inside knowledge of what is going to happen on the show , but I think it is pretty clear that Landry is going to confess to what he did.So , despite a couple of things that seems atypical for this remarkable show , FNL seems entirely back on track . These remain a collection of many of the best characters on television and the acting in this show can stand comparison with any other show . I 'm still not too excited about it being scheduled on Friday , but it remains , along with PUSHING DAISIES ( easily the best new show of the season ) the one show I most look forward to each week .	1
This is one of the best series I 've watched in a loooong time . The characters are loveable , unforgettable and endearing . I recommend this to all my TV-watching friends .	1
I still ca n't beleive how much I 'm going to miss this watching Friday Night Lights ... ... : ( 5 seasons was just not enough !	1
All seasons were fabulous ! Great casting , great characters , and good lines . However , the kids look like they should be out of college , not still in high school . This is closer to real life stories than most !	1
The fall TV schedule of 2007 was a mess due to the Writer 's Strike that saw all of the script-writers withhold their services . The effects of such a shake-up can be seen in two crucial ways during the course of this season : 1 . The pacing of the early episodes ; & 2 . The abrupt ending when there should have been more episodes to round out the plotlines.Coming off an incredibly strong first season , this second installment of `` Friday Night Lights '' is , at least at first , markedly different from the original slate of episodes . There is less of a focus on football and much more on just character drama in general . For a few examples ... the effect on the Taylor family of Eric 's TMU job , the strange blossoming of the Landry/Tyra relationship , the struggles of Matt Ceracen , and the tumultuous Jason/Lyla/Tim triangle of friendship/love/stupidity.In fact , for the first six or so episodes of the season , very little football is seen whatsoever . Unfortunately , this was caused by the `` wait and see '' approach because of the writers strike and thus the subplots became paramount while the show creators were biding their time . While the show is still okay in this format , it lacks that `` football punch '' that gave it such heart in the first season.As the second season winds down , though , the episodes really start to pick up in all areas . The somewhat cheesy and overly dramatic plotlines of the early season ( Jason to Mexico , a murderer body , etc . ) fade into the background and that nice football/life mix takes center stage once again . In fact , just when you 'll think things are truly back on track ... the season abruptly ends in mid-stride ( again , the strike ) . The first episode of Season Three will go on to fill in the gaps , but that is most certainly not the prescribed way to run a dramatic series such as this one.Overall , then , while I can not give this season a full five starts due to behind-the-scenes issues and a straying from the powerful football scenes , it is still a solid effort that succeeds in pushing storylines forward and creating some great ensemble drama . For the first time this year , you just have to wade through a bit of unbelievability to get it .	1
I was n't much of an Office fan until somewhat recently , and I 'm not quite sure why that is , but now I ca n't seem to get enough of it as I rewatch the seasons I currently own . I 've now seen all of the episodes through season six , the second-to-last year of Michael Scott , and season four may very well be the best one , but it 's a tough call because 3 and 5 are pretty darn good too.A few highlights include : Ryan is now at corporate , a funny and strange new variable ; Andy starts dating Angela , with Dwight not entirely out of the picture ; the Scanton branch creates a local advertisement ; and Holly makes her debut in the finale , with Jan returning to get in the way of things.I of course recommend this to any fan of the Office . With that in mind ; however , I would advise either purchasing or at least watching the previous season in its entirety first , for continuity purposes . Although some episodes in this season are better than others , I think every one of them are good and quite re-watchable . Either way , sit back and enjoy the hilarity that will ensue .	1
I know everyone is whining around about the price for a shortened season , but let 's face the facts , Season 4 was excellent even against tough expectations . The humor was still buoyant and creative , and the storylines still had energy as the twists and turns stayed fresh . Storylines were also craftily constructed to show parallels between characters , or wrapped together 2 or 3 seperate storylines , etc.After the slighest of let-downs in Season 3 , Season 4 still shows the punch and zip of a fun and humorous mockumentary that 's well edited .	1
Special features for anyone interested:133 minutes of deleted scenes.4 commentaries.22:38 blooper reel.53-minute Writers ' Block panel from The Office convention held in Scranton , Pennsylvania.A few shorter things like the 23-second faux `` The More You Know '' PSA about rabies .	1
I LOVE The Office , and Season 4 caps off the best 3 seasons of The Office Created . Seasons 2 , 3 , and 4 are absolute magic . Every episode is amazing and full of hilarious Michael Scott moments , and spectacular character depth . You will find yourself emotionally attached to the characters while still laughing out loud several times an episode . Truly brilliant television .	1
FIRST OF ALLIt boggles my mind how fans of this show can give this show a zero and try to defend their rating by citing lack of quality . Is it true that this season was n't as consistently strong as the stellarSeason Twoand the classicSeason Three , but there is no way that this deserves such a low rating by anyone 's standards . While the beginning was a bit of a letdown , it is still overall a strong and hilarious season.POSITIVES+ Despite what the other reviewers said , it still feels like `` The Office . '' Whatever faults the early episodes have -- and they do have faults -- are gone by the second half of the season . The second half is filled with episodes as funny and touching as anything that has come prior.+ The character arcs were handled nicely . I loved Pam/Jim , of course , and I loved the emotional roller coaster than was Michael/Jan . A lot of great stuff goes on between all the characters actually -- even Andy.+ Risks are taken a-plenty . Two main characters have left the branch . One of them has left the cast altogether , and the other has moved up to a position of power . By the end of the season , a worker will outwardly defy Michael , a cast member will go to jail , and another worker will leave the office for good.+ This collection also comes with a script ( `` Dinner Party '' ) , which was a wonderful surprise . I 'm a screen writer , so checking out this script was an essential and revealing look into the mechanics of the show.NEGATIVES- The first few episodes feel quite off , and I think these are probably the main reasons people rate the season low . Both Michael and Dwight act even more outrageously than usual in this episode , and the plotline with Dwight and Angela 's cat was really pushing the limits of believability . Also , the first four episodes were hour long ones , so the dynamic of the show -- short , punchy episodes -- felt a bit off for a while.- The comedy seemed more slapstick than before , what with the car going into the lake , the mushroom incident , and the Meredith being hit by a car thing.- I 'm as big a Pam/Jim fan as there is . They are the couple I am very much rooting for ; but I felt that Karen was sort of tossed aside without enough plot focusing around it . It made Jim , as a character , seem sort of cold . I loved their interaction when they finally crossed paths , but it did seem a bit too little , too late.BEST OF THE BEST1 . The Deposition : Michael 's best `` that 's what she said '' jokes yet , along with some really heartbreaking stuff2 . Goodbye , Toby : `` The Office '' has never been able to match Season Two 's `` Casino Night '' when it comes to season finales , but this comes close.3 . Branch Wars : Jim gets sucked into Michael and Dwight 's antics , which leads to an awkward moment with an ex.4 . Dinner Party : Michael 's home life explodes5 . Did I Stutter ? : Ironically enough , I came to respect Michael as a boss in this episode.OVERALLGood season . Not the best of the series by any means , but still a very entertaining comedy . Fans of `` The Office '' will like it a lot , and new fans will be hooked in.8/10	1
There are 5 double-length episodes here that increase the episode count from 14 to 19 . And at 19 , that is just 3 episodes short fo a current full season.What does puzzle me is the varying lengths of the half hour episodes , some are as short as 20 minutes & 30 seconds ; others clock in at 21 minutes & 40 seconds . Are some cut ? If you get the 5-disc version some retailers are selling for the same price , then it is worth picking up ! Disc 5 has a Q & A session from the Scranton `` The Office '' convention .	1
Amazon Unbox rocks ! ! Do not listen to a bunch of mad mac fans . Mac sucks and that is why nothing supports it . The Unbox service is easy to use , easy to download , and you get your episodes a day after they air ! I am very happy with it . If a mac user is waiting for it to go to iTunes , forget it ! Mac messed up again and thought their service was going to be the only one on the block . Now I can buy .mp3 songs ( unprotected ) and video files with being stuck with crapmac software . By the way if you buy a song on itunes it is in .mp4 format and can ONLY be used with crapmac software . So who is Propriety ? Unbox 5 stars itunes 0 stars period !	1
SPOILERS BELOW SO SKIP TO THE LAST TWO PARAGRAPHS IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT EXTRAS.The fourth season of `` The Office '' was effected by the Writer 's Strike as was just about every other show so we have a shorter season set here ( 14 vs. the standard 22 episodes ) . Big changes at Dunder-Miffin as Jan loses her job , Michael interviews for it but , ultimately , it goes to Ryan who started as the office temp . Jim and Pam finally move forward in their relationship while Dwight and Angela fall apart when Dwight sticks her old cat in the freezer . Andy is there to pick up the pieces leaving Dwight moping about in a Charlie Brown shuffle . We see the aftermath of all these changes from season three in four . Let 's hope Michael 's clueless management style does n't change in season five as it is pivotal to the humor of the show ( and it reflects reality -- I ca n't tell you how many Michael Scott 's I 've worked for in 20 years ) .The writing is still pretty strong for the fourth season but what 's truly missing during season four is the Michael-Dwight dynamic as Jim becomes Michael 's # 2 and Andy picks apart the bones of Dwight 's relationship.Picture quality is extremely good throughout the set.The extras include commentary tracks ( although none by Steve Carrell or John Krasinski ) but we do get plenty of deleted scenes cut together in the same order as the episodes ... almost making an alternate episode for each one . It 's a good set even though it 's shorter ( 14 episodes but we do get four double episodes which really makes this almost like 18 episodes ) and does go down a few strange roads ( Michael , Dwight and Jim looking like poster boys for any game featuring Mario and Luigi as they punk another branch ) . We also get a `` Writer 's Block : Q & A '' , the gag reel , the `` Rabies More You Know '' parody , the full Scranton commercial , `` Summer Promo '' that aired before season four AND for a `` limited '' time a miniature version of the script for the episode `` The Party '' .It 's worth picking this season up .	1
Though the third season of `` The Office '' was , for the most part , still hilarious television at its finest , it sort of diverged from what made the show so endearing ... the relationships . While I commended the writers for doing such a thing to bring new life into the show , I also have to say that Season Four was a welcome return to what The Office does best.Despite being cut to just 14 episodes do to the TV Writer 's strike of 2007-2008 , this season manages to still provide a laugh a minute while also getting back to the core of the series , that being the relationships such as Jim/Pam and Dwight/Angela . Michael Scott keeps doing his hilarious thing , but what sets The Office apart from all other comedy sitcoms is its ability to keep developing the characters and maintaining its quality level ( e.g . not turning into a soap opera ) . This season did not provide a drop off in that category as Jim & Pam `` shippers '' will be delighted at the return of that complicated romance , as well as the tension that always exists between Dwight and Angela.Thus , despite its shortened stature , I considered Season Four to be better ( quality-wise ) than the one preceding it . Watch with confidence knowing that the writers/creators/producers are still able to keep things fresh and hilarious .	1
I stumbled on `` 30 Rock '' quite by accident one Thursday night when there was nothing much to watch . I do n't know why I was n't attracted to it when it first came out ... but I can only guess some sort of other distraction . `` 30 Rock '' has grown to become my FAVORITE comedy series of all time . I do n't say that lightly either . I love Tina Fey and with her Sarah Palin imitations she gained new notoriety and I think more and more people began to give `` 30 Rock '' a try.One try ( the 3rd season ) and I was ABSOLUTELY hooked . I received seasons 1 and 2 for Christmas and have just eaten them up over and over . Any time I need to pull myself out of the dumps , I put on some `` 30 Rock '' and enjoy several episodes at a time . I love Kenneth and Tracey ... aww heck , I love them all.I am a late bloomer for this show but a definite junkie. , I , too , am startled to discover how many people really do n't know the show or have not watched it ? ? Like me I guess . One or two episodes and you are hooked.It 's the best . : )	1
Season 1 of `` 30 Rock '' was a landmark of television , if you ask me . Finally a sitcom that was original , refreshing , and , most of all , hilarious . When Season 2 began , my expectations were high . To say that my expectations were surpassed would be an understatement of grand proportions.Whereas the plotlines and randomly vanishing characters ( any one of Rachel Dratch 's appearances ? ? ? ) in Season 1 were out of left-field in that funny-but-almost-too-random kind of way , Season 2 was a different kind of animal . `` 30 Rock '' season 2 came from left-field , but this time , it pulled you over there with it . In the beginning , it held onto some of the pitfalls of Season 1 ( i.e. , Where was Jenna half the time ? ? ? ) , but as episodes aired , the ensemble and the writing both grew into something much greater and more entertaining than Season 1 ever reached.Even as many shows suffocated and failed the hiatus the writer 's strike brought , `` 30 Rock '' seemed immune . In fact , I would be so bold as to suggest the break fueled the creativity . Either those last handful of episodes were pure , unadulterated brilliance , or I was just desperate for more `` 30 Rock '' after their lengthy sabbatical.Some brilliant moments in Season 2 : Carrie Fisher as a crazy ex-writer , EVERYTHING involving the Devon ( Will Arnett ) vs. Jack rivalry ( including the Don Geiss coma ) , Jack 's job at Homeland Security ( can you say , `` gay bomb '' ? ) , & Kenneth 's House Party AND a special appearance by Al Gore satiring himself ( `` A whale is in trouble ! '' ) in one episode ? Oh HECK yeah.All in all , `` 30 Rock '' 's sophomore season was a brilliant display that proved that comedy can be even better the second time around .	1
This is an almost perfect comedy series . ALMOST.The writing is excellent , the ideas are good and Tina Fey is really excellent in the role of LIz Lemon , head comedy writer at NBC . However , and this was the case in the first season , the secondary characters are somewhat unrdeal and often unnerving and tend to distract from what could have been perfect . Teke the page Kenneth , he tends to be very often way too geeky for the good of the series . Also Alec Bladwin 's character is way over the top and somewhat unrealistic ( OK , it is a comedy series ) but he has improved over Season 1 . The problem is that Tina Fey plays the whole thing in a reaslistic comedy kind of way and the secondary characters are way too charicatural and unrealistic IMHO for it to gel completely . However overall it has improved over Season 1 and has a lot of promise fro the future .	1
Run to the bank , LizLemon ! 30Rock busts out for season two sharper than ever ! Spot on with it 's cameos , Seinfeld-esque moments and knockout characters and writing , it deserves every one of its accolades . Bottle of wine and and one `` Play All '' menu selection , I found myself laughing out loud more than once with each episode.Do n't miss the special features of the `` live on stage '' episode , raising money for the PAs during the infamous strike . It 's spontaneous and fun to hear the audience laugh along . Bravo ! If I had the patience to watch network TV , this would be on my list ( but I do n't ) !	1
Minor spoilers ! After a rough off-season for Alec Baldwin -- complete with rumors that he wanted to leave 30 ROCK and a parenting controversy that kept him in the tabloids for a spell -- and a surprisingly disappointing season premiere , both Baldwin and the show can be said to be completely back on track . As the Amazon description reports , the A plot focuses on Jack 's effort to outposition Devon Banks ( marvelously portrayed by Will Arnett in a reprise of his Season One guest appearance ) to become Don Geiss 's replacement at GE , the parent company to NBC Universal . The struggle is quite funny . Devon , who is a lightly closeted gay , has `` turned straight '' and is courting Geiss 's daughter . He is also using the fact of Jack 's heart attack , which he has attempted to keep quiet , to lessen his position within the corporation . In response , Jack merely recruits a young , very handsome dude who tempts Devon beyond his powers to resist . All in all , it is gamesmanship on a very funny level.The B plot is quite as good . Jenna is still very overweight from all her pizza consumption during her involvement in a stage version of MYSTIC PIZZA during the summer break . The writers attempt to take advantage of her weight gain by having her character shout `` Me want food ! '' onstage , which Jenna adamantly refuses to do . But when a skit falls apart onstage , she panicks and ad libs the line she said she would n't say . Surprisingly , she is delighted when the line becomes a national catch phrase . Suddenly , the extra weight gain , previously a liability , is now her good fortune . Unfortunately , she now has to keep her weight up.The first episode of the season had been a serious disappointment , mainly because they stopped doing what they do well in order to restructure the episode around Jerry Seinfeld . But this episode shows the series completely back on track . It ramains one of the two or three funniest shows on TV .	1
Tina Fey is an intelligent ( read : thinking ) Lucille Ball . In her zany skits and amongst her madcap crew there can be a redeeming moral found - life lessons if you would . For instance how to handle homosexuals who all seem to believe that if you do n't allow their advances that makes you a hater not so . I do n't care what sort of perversion that you practice behind closed doors as long as your not practicing them on my children or putting in my face . Jane Krakowski plays a self-involved actress that epitomizes America today and of course Alec Baldwin represents everything wrong with capitalissssm.edit : For instance , how to handle unwanted advances from homosexuals . How to recognize situations where your child 's innocence could be compromised by pack leaders , teachers and other people in authority .	1
Season 2 of `` 30 Rock '' was perhaps even stronger than Season 1 . For me , the biggest improvement was a move away from having Liz ( Tina Fey ) fixed up with a man each week ; instead , she has a few brief flings , notably with two exes from Season 1 - lawyer Floyd ( Jason Sudeikis ) and low-brow Dennis ( Dean Winter ) . The show aso did a nice job of giving less screen time to some of the less funny characters , particular Pete the producer ( Scott Adsit ) and Judah ( Judah Friedlander ) .A number of funny plot arcs were developed over the season . Jenna ( Jane Krakowski ) gains weight because of her role in the musical version of `` Mystic Pizza , '' which apparently involved eating a lot of said pizza . At first , she 's desperate to lose the weight , contacting Dr. Spaceman and discussing drastic measures ; however , she ends up embracing the weight when it makes her popular on the show and gives her a new catchphrase - `` Me want food ! '' Jack ( Alec Baldwin ) spends much of the season sucking up to Don Geiss ( Rip Torn ) , the CEO of GE who is in the process of naming a successor . This plot also introduces a new rival for Jack - Devon Banks ( Will Arnett ) - who 's willing to do anything to get ahead , including marrying Don Geiss ' intellectually challenged daughter.These are just some of the subplots that keep `` 30 Rock '' clicking during season 2 . The season is also chock full of guest stars , some of whom do some of their best work in years , particularly Carrie Fisher as a desperate comedy writer . The show really found its pacing and tone during this season . On a negative note , some of the characters became increasingly silly , especially Tracy Jordan ( Tracy Morgan ) , and some of the episodes are almost surrealistic , but `` 30 Rock '' never was a show grounded in reality anyway . Overall , the season was a great success and the show was awarded Emmy 's for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actor ( Alec Baldwin ) and Lead Actress ( Tina Fey ) in a Comedy Series . Tina Fey also won the Emmy for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series .	1
However , with the denouement or unraveling of the characters and their prospective lives , some of the episodes in this season have become a little far-fetched and tiresome . Nevertheless , viewed in their entirety , I continue to rate them as a well written and entertaining series of stories .	1
The dudes are getting a bit more sensitive that I want them . But hey stuff changes and it is still a lot of fun with math which I never saw coming . Plus we get some super yummy guest spots with Lou diamond Phillips . The guest stars are a lot of fun , you never know who is going to show up and I like that . it is still an exciting show with a good mix of gun fire and family . so sit down with your family and watch this .	1
I like how they solve crimes and have a personal theme as well . Its just not only about the eppes brothers its about the team , family .	1
I really enjoyed this season , the bond between the Epps brothers is a great side story . I suggest this series to everyone !	1
I really enjoy the episodes and am disappointed with they end . At times , however , the resolution to the cases seems a little too tidy . I like all the cast but especially like Judd Hirsch and Peter McNicol in their roles . Seems like I have know people just like them .	1
This is a good entertaining show . With the right amount of humor and drama	1
A lot of action , as well as introducing the math and science into solving crimes . Like the development of the characters , all in all a very enjoyable program .	1
This season was even better than the last one , the stories are always interesting and I love all of the characters especially , Larry . He is so cute and so interestingly played\	1
The series came and I had a marathon Saturday watching , great stuff . Sorry to see that it ended when it did .	1
I enjoy this series . The acting is fine . The plots areentertaining . I like the relationship between the father and his son 's . And the way the son 's work together .	1
Great Show , especially if you love math , common sense and reasoning ! Very Educational but also lots of action . Fast paced action ! Characters are endearing . I have watched all 4 seasons !	1
I love the acting in all these series . The stories are exciting and the plots are good . They are family friendly and there is no vulgarity ; which is rare these days ! You will enjoy NUMBERS !	1
You will enjoy this show if you like police and ( or ) math stories.This show combines a math teacher working with the FBI to solve crimes .	1
Numb3rs is a great television show due to its excellent writing and perfect casting . Rob Morrow has been lucky enough to get his second hit series . Who knew that math could be so fascinating ! ! !	1
the 'season ' , as a whole , does not rate , in my opinion , 5 stars , but considering all the episodes of the series does deserve a 4 star rating .	1
the series had jumped the shark sometime in the middle , and then BAM it came back stronger than ever in the end . Really am glad I did n't give up on it !	1
Watching Colby having to get back with the team and learning more about everyone 's backgrounds are some great plus ' in this season . Also great to see Charlie and Amita getting closer	1
Intrigue and intensity , revelation of newer technology that I have not yet heard of , all of these things are reasons I like NCIS .	1
These are great . We have now watched seasons 1 through 10 and are now anxiously awaiting the 11th season . We love NCIS .	1
Loved Season 5 - every episode with great acting and the characters ' story lines interwoven . Some great writing and awesome cast .	1
My family really enjoyed watching NCIS the Complete Fifth Season ! There are n't many shows left that we can watch as a family but this is one of them ! Thanks for a great sale !	1
Love , Love , Love ! ! ! ! It 's NCIS ... Enough Said : - ) I love this show and have so enjoyed having the DVD 's to watch anytime I want . Looking forward to purchasing season 's 7 , 8 and 9 ( when available ) soon .	1
I really like all of the NCIS episodes and enjoy the interactions of the cast . I 've purchased all of the series up to and including season 10 . In April when 11 is over i will purchase those as well . My wife is currently watching all of the seasons and is having a good time and laughing a lot .	1
Is what the producers named this season as it answers the questions from season four.However , this season creates new questions for season 6.The result is a shorter season , 18 episodes instead of the standard 24 , which is an almost perfect bridge between seasons four and six.The main story line is Director Shepard 's pursuit of an arms dealer code name La Grenouille.This is complicated by her personal considerations and a possible link between La Grenouille and the CIA.Several excellent stories looking at our military trying to deal with multiple wars and cultures support this main story.All of this results in an entertaining season of excellent mysteries , great characters with a solid on-going story.While this is a season of answers their are new questions for next year .	1
NCIS Episode : & # 34 ; Chimera & # 34 ; is one of my all time favorite NCIS episodes , Ziva is at her best here with her and Tony arguing all the time , I can watch this one over and over ! ( And I do ) . Oh almost forgot , I still have not gotten over Cote de Pablo leaving its just not the same without her !	1
This is one of very few current TV shows which is worth my time to watch . Most of the shows on TV now are vulgar , violent , unfunny , or intent on pushing an offensive social or sexual agenda - even the so-called animated comedies . Even the game shows are leaning way Left . Most Reality shows are just plane stupid and fall into the above description as well . Though NCIS is often more GP than G rated , it has great characters and good plots .	1
If you know this show then order the DVDs . No problem with the DVDs , came fast and as stated . I ordered all seasons and love them all .	1
Great series and I would recommend to anyone over 18 years the storylines and interesting and keep you on the edge of your seat .	1
The product was in excellent condition and I got it very quickly . I 'm very happy with my purchase .	1
There has been a pattern in the writing of NCIS that has always been fascinating . Ever since `` Bete Noire '' in Season 1 , this series has always used it 's season finale to essentially set up the next season 's finale . `` Bete Noire '' introduced Ari Haswari . In the finale to Season 1 , Jethro Gibbs shot Ari to cover Haswari 's double agent status -- though Gibbs would have preferred to kill Ari . Because Ari was n't killed at the end of Season 1 , he was able to murder Kate Todd at the end of Season 2 . Because Ari shot Kate at the end of Season 2 -- and more importantly , WHY he chose to murder her -- we were able to get the backstory of Gibbs revealed , the tragedy surrounding his first wife and daughter , which culminated with Jethro leaving the MTAC at the end of Season 3 . Because of Gibbs ' `` retirement '' , NCIS Director Jenny Shepard was able to initiate her off-the-books operation against Rene Benoit , using Tony DiNozzo to romance La Grenouille 's daughter Jeanne.So as we get into Season 5 , we have the culmination of Shepard 's attempt to avenge her father 's death by killing Benoit , though she crosses both the CIA and the FBI in the attempt . `` Bury Your Dead '' -- especially its final scene -- sets the tone for the season . Though the show has its usual action , interplay between its characters , and bawdiness that has made the show such a wonderful view , there also seems a certain weight to the season . The regular viewer knows the story with The Frog is n't over , moreover there has to be a deeper reason why Shepard seemed willing to pursue Benoit without government sanction . It is the playing out of this season that , again while the season has its usual fun , seems to give the season a somewhat sad tone.Still , the performances are at their usual high standards . Mark Harmon 's Gibbs is his usual self , though we are once again shown more of Jethro 's past and his genuine heart . While Michael Weatherly 's Tony DiNozzo is his usual obnoxious self , the aftermath of the La Grenouille affair leaves our boy shaken , both because of his feelings for Jeanne and being used by Shepard . Tony 's conscience comes in the form of Ziva David ; who , while enjoying her usual verbal sparring with DiNozzo , also makes Tony own up to his feelings about what happened and what it may have done to Jeanne . Cote De Pablo 's Ziva , with her hair straightened and deemphasizing her widow 's peak , becomes a more Americanized woman ( and the shots of Cote bending over ai n't too bad , either ) . We did n't have an episode that featured Sean Murray 's Tim McGee a season after The Probie 's year with his nom de plume ( Thom E. Gemcity ) , but Pauley Perrette 's wonderful Abby Sciutto gets her usual fun , especially in `` Dog Tags '' . David McCallum 's Ducky Mallard is most representative of the tone of the season , because he becomes privy to the secret that Jenny hides through the season.This leads to Lauren Holly , and the end of the Jenny Shepard storyline . Shepard seems calmer this season , especially after the disappearance of The Frog ( Even propositioning Gibbs in `` Lost And Found '' ) , but we figure something had to have been motivating Jenny attempting something that would compromise the agency . That something plays out through the season , and is revealed in `` Judgement Day '' , the two-part season finale , which of course sets the table for Season 6.The high points of this season are `` Ex-File '' , in which a part of Jethro 's past becomes a part of an investigation ( Plus , we get a visit from Susana Thompson 's Hollis Mann -- this episode is capped by a wonderfully sad sequence at the end ) , `` Internal Affairs '' ( The body of La Grenouille resurfaces , and we meet Rocky Carroll 's Leon Vance -- Carroll draws greatly from Daniel Benzali 's character in `` The Agency '' from earlier this decade ) , `` About Face '' ( Where Brian Dietzen 's Jimmy Palmer is featured , and reveals a slight obsession with footwear ) , `` Judgement Day '' ( Which brings Gibbs and Shepard 's long-ago Paris operation -- the one where they also became lovers -- to a full circle , as well as Jethro coming to a sad conclusion about the murder of The Frog ) , and the simply magnificent `` Requiem '' , in which Gibbs , while aiding the now-grown best friend of his late daughter , is finally able to put to rest the loss of Shannon and Kelly.Performances of note are Joe Spano -- we do n't see as much of Tobias Fornell as we usually do during a season . Susana Thompson , whose character retired from the Army when she realized Jethro had n't recovered from losing his wife and daughter ( Why do I suspect that Holly will appear again -- in Hawaii , living on the grounds of a novelist , and driving a Ferrari ? ) . Susan Kelichi Watson 's Nikki Jardine , the NCIS Intelligence Analyst who happens to be a germophobe ( Leading to many moments where the team exploits Jardine 's phobia for their humor ) , and Muse Watson returning as Mike Franks in the season finale , with his usual cowboy demeanor . But Cameron Goodman 's performance in `` Requiem '' -- as Maddie Tyler , Kelly Gibbs ' best friend as a child -- gives the episode the impetus that sets Jethro toward finally making his peace with losing Shannon and Kelly.NCIS has always been a fun show , with an ability to wrench at the heart in unexpected moments . This is a season that has an underlying tone of sadness and impending tragedy , and it gives the season some unusual depth .	1
Just more of the same . The show needs to be more realistic . And they should have more interaction with the local cops and with FBI . Some episodes are fairly entertaining but I would not buy the entire season .	1
I would buy this in a new york min.as always well acted plot was on the edge and left you wanting more	1
I just finished this series and now am going into season 9 . I titled this season SOME LAUGHS ; SOME TEARS because there is some added Castle type humor , some really weird episodes and then some really teary episodes . I do n't want to spill the proverbialbeans so I wo n't be specific but there is some changes here in the cast ; one in particular who I have become very fond of . Also asignificant death of one of the CSI persons . I was not particularly fond of this person , but he/she did not deserve what happened tothem . Grissom finally falls for someone but after a serious murder attempt on her life , the relationship falters a bit . There is a veryvile murderer who makes miniature models of the crime scenes even before the killings happen . And the models are incrediblyaccurate . I still have n't made up my mind if I like Cate Willows ; sometimes she seems like she really hates men . sometimes not.But she appears arrogant in much of what she does . And does n't anyone in L.V . stay married ? While I love the show , I do n't thinkI want to visit there ; Detroit has safer streets ! ! There seems to be whores all over the place ; not my favorite type of women.And there is the crossdressing Carp . The quality of the productions continue to be outstanding ; a superb cast and terrific musicalaccompanying backdrops . Good background and theme music is extremely important to me in TV and motion pictures . Some ofthe murders are so gruesomely realistic I almost have to turn away ... .almost anyhow ! I have 13 seasons to date , but wo n't getthe 14th until the price comes down a bit . Still , I get them all from Amazon . And of all the shows I watch , only two bad castingsthat I judge : Jar Jar Binn & Dr. Sweets , although I suppose we could include Martha from CASTLE . I believe that this wonderfulCSI series is the best crime series on the telly ; I am including ALL CSI series of course . Enjoy ! !	1
Great show and gets better as it goes . Arrived quickly and in great shape . Must watch from the beginning . Amazing !	1
My favourite show never fails to deliver the goods . This is a fantastic season , despite the depature of Jorja Fox ( Sara ) . Surprisingly , there was hardly any fanfare when she left ( not on screen anyway ) . Her relationship with Grisolm was only beginning to take off for the viewers and before it could really get off the ground , she was gone.In the first episode , Dead Doll , the team race against the clock to find Sara who has been left for dead in the heat of the desert . That was one of the best episodes . My next favourite episode was A La Carte where they investigate a beheaded teen from a go-cart accident . Then in Cockroaches and Lying Down With Dogs , we start to see Warrick in a whole different light - drugs and alcohol and he 's framed for a murder in these two episodes . The final show for this season is called For Gedda in which Warrick is accused of murdering a famous Vegas gangster and even he is uncertain of his guilt or innocence . What happens at the end of this episode will leave every fan in shock ( even though you 've probably read about it or seen it already ) . I was devastated.This season gives us a real good look into more of the characters personal lives . The story lines always remain fresh and there seems to be no shortage of material and ideas for keeping us fans loyal . It remains my absolute favourite show and as usual , I can not wait for it 's release . I only hope that for a change , they 'll put a synopsis on the dvd cover of each episode . Sometimes you go to look for a particular episode and do n't know the name of it - only the storyline - which makes searching for it a little tricky , but despite this , it 's always a good buy and I thoroughly enjoy re-watching these all . I hope you 'll enjoy it too .	1
A good season but seems like it is losing its umph . I am hoping with the new characters coming up in the 9th season it will get back all of its fire.Each episode was standard fare with little question the crime scene investigators would get their culprit . The last episode is a bit suprising so be ready .	1
Warning : slight spoilers ahead.You 'd figure that for a show going on it 's eighth season ( a season shortened by the WGA strike to boot ) that things would get a bit stale to say the least , especially considering the horde of network TV imitators to pop up since it 's original inception . Fear not , C.S.I . still manages to keep going strong , and it picks up by grabbing the viewer by the throat and not letting go either . Grissom ( William L. Petersen ) and his team race against time to find and save Sara ( Jorja Fox ) as her life hangs in the balance , which eventually leads up to her departure from Vegas , as well as a heartbroken Grissom . Things do n't get much better for the crew as Catherine ( Marg Helgenberger ) receives a threat , and Warrick 's ( Gary Dourdan ) life begins to spin out of control , leading him to be charged for murder , and concludes in the explosive season finale which only promises more changes to come . While some moments may come off as a bit hackneyed , C.S.I . manages to still be spectacular thanks to the depth that the principal characters get in this eighth season . Even lab-man Hodges ( Wallace Langham ) gets an episode to shine as he and the lab techs play some `` murder games '' in the inventive episode `` You Kill Me '' . There 's also a crossover with Without a Trace , as Grissom and FBI Agent Jack Malone ( Anthony LaPaglia ) team up to solve a murder and kidnapping . All in all , C.S.I . still manages to wonderfully deliver the goods even in it 's eighth season , and still remains the best prime time , network TV crime drama on the air today .	1
want to know why amazon does n't have several seasons - it 's annoying to go through 1 to 5 , skip 6 to 10 and then juimp back to season 15 - get with it amazon ! Those of us who love this series want to watch it in order	1
We knew the outcome of this one and it was still good . It was a different take on the island Survivors .	1
I love this show . China was'nt one of my favorite seasons but it was good all the same . I bought it well worth ten bucks .	1
I love Survivor and Season 15 is definitely in my top 5 or 6 . I highly recommend watching . There are a few really fun characters .	1
Great great great ! I love all these older seasons of Survivor . I especially liked this season because unlike most seasons , they are not on a beach on an island . A little change of scenery was appreciated .	1
I give this season 2-3 stars but my GF says 3-4 ... so it gets rated 4 . Yes I realize that averaging our votes would yield 3 but you got ta pick your battles : - ) . This was Amanda and James first seasons , two characters that will go on to be fan favorites . China made for a unique setting , not the usual beaches , and there was some exciting and original challenges . There was okay strategy and pretty interesting characters , just not the best in survivor history .	1
I do n't mind the streaming videos when they are under $ 10 , but I prefer to have the DVD in my newly acquired Survivor Library .	1
by herself is worth watching this season of Survivor . She does n't win , unfortunately , but what a game she plays . She 's both smart and beautiful .	1
This is the first season that James the gravedigger is in . He is great to root for because he 's not a great talker and he 's the biggest powerhouse to play the game . He ends up with 2 idols and makes a bad move . Amanda is one of the stronger girls to play the game but she gets pretty annoying because of how smug she is . Todd is the biggest schemer and deserves to win the game more than anyone else . This season has a big twist that screws the 2 strongest players in the game , Aaron and James . Courtney is probably the weakest player ever to play to game . She starts the game at 93 lbs and ends up at 86 lbs . Jean Robert is the token jerk . Peih Gee is supper annoying and freaks out all the time and she thinks she 's somehow the leader of a tribe . James ' tribe is great to root for and Peih Gee 's tribe is the tribe you hope loses . Jaimee and Erik are both total losers who are great for each other .	1
Speedy deliver . DVD received as advertised . Opened the package ; put in the DVD ; just push play ... It another terrific season of HIMYM	1
This show is just freakin ' hilarious ! The interaction and relationship between all the characters will make you laugh out loud !	1
If you are a fan of How I Met Your Mother this is the D.V.D . for you.Out of the three seasons this one is the best . During this season things change for the gang.1 . Lilly and Marshall get married2 . Robin and Ted break up3 . Ted meets Stella and starts a relationship with her4 . Find out about Robin 's teen years in Canada as `` Robin Sparkles '' 5 . `` Slapsgiving '' and many more adventures that make this DVD legend , wait for it ( hope your not lactose intolerant ) dary	1
`` How I Met Your Mother '' continues the search for the mother in Season 3 , but does n't try very hard . After Lily played by Alyson Hannigan and Marshall played by Jason Segal got married at the end of season 2 , they start looking for their own apartment to live in and think about the future . Marshall tries to find just the right job and is finally exposed to the mountain of Lily 's debt that he has been saddled with . Ted played by Josh Radnor and Robin played by Cobie Smulders are no longer dating and things are tense between them all season . Barney played by Neil Patrick Harris continues to be AWESOME , but starts to develop feelings for Robin.This season was the season of guest stars ! Starting with Enrique Iglesias ( `` Would you dance ... .if I asked you to dance ... '' ) as a boyfriend Robin picks up while on vacation , James Van Der Beek as Robin 's ex she never got over , Heidi Klum playing herself , Sarah Chalke of `` Scrubs '' playing Stella who is Ted 's new major love interest of the season , and Britney Spears plays Abby who is a receptionist in love with Ted and manipulated by Barney . Ted is occasionally a horrible person in this season and his behavior often contradicts his lofty goals and morality of past seasons.Bonus Features : The `` Series Retrospective '' is a great sum-up of the first two seasons narrated by Bob Saget as older Ted . Lily & Marshall 's Honeymoon videos are pretty cute and home video authentic which makes me wonder if they were originally supposed to incorporated into some episodes , but they made a great extra . The `` Cast Favorites '' Featurette is where each cast member tells what their favorite episode is and why.Behind the Scenes of `` We 're Not From Here '' Featurette is just like the last two seasons where they kind of show the process of getting from the read-through , to rehearsal , to run-through , to rolling for the episode . For the additional scenes : How It Really Happened just shows the extended and deleted scenes from episodes.The `` You Just Got Slapped '' music video is just Marshall behind a piano being very serious and does not feature NPH . The `` Sandcastles in the Sand '' music video is just as awesome as `` Let 's Go To The Mall '' . The Gag Reel once again does not disappoint and includes a random makeout session between Marshall , Lily , and Barney and the actual words yelled during Lily and Marshall 's fight that had been dubbed over in a previous episode and features more music from The Solids . The `` Ted Mosby is a Jerk '' Audio Track is playing during `` The Bracket '' episode because Barney once posed as Ted Mosby to sleep with a girl and confronts her and she made a website called TedMosbyisaJerk.com . It 's a weird slow song playing with girls being mad at Ted while subtitles of the show dialogue appear in black.There is commentary on `` The Platinum Rule '' , `` Ten Sessions '' , `` The Bracket '' , `` The Chain of Screaming '' , `` Sandcastles in the Sand '' , `` Everything Must Go '' , and `` Miracles '' and they split up individual actors again and also have Sarah Chalke with Josh Radnor for `` Ten Sessions . ''	1
A bad episode of HIMYM is like a good episode of any other show . in other words , it 's AMAZE-balls . I never turn it off because it 's good medicine : laughter & stress relief.This show is my wrinkle cream ( it pumps blood to my face and increases circulation to my wrinkles , slowing the aging process . Also , cranky people age faster : this is my scientific and medically sound theory ) . A few laugh lines are okay in exchange for general skin dewiness . Added Value : I 'm less of a total behotch after I & # 34 ; watch my show & # 34 ; as the old people say . Everybody wins ! Wow , does Ted sleep with a lot of women . I hope he is covered in a hazmat latex bodysuit with um , many spermicid-y chemicals .	1
Sorry to see it end . Great stories and great acting . The Good guys win , but at great personal cost , not only to the soldiers , but their families as well..	1
This series gives one a genuinely good sense of pride , our troops work hard to defend us the American people.. This show is well written , the actors talented . Delightfully entertaining .	1
It 's been one of my USMC brother 's favorite shows during regular season . My husband & I both picked it up from Amazon Prime and we absolutely LOVE it . Fourth season gets a little cray-cray with the sequestering of the families , but that 's a different review . As a believer , seeing what these Delta Force operatives are facing helps me understand how to pray for our warriors with better intelligence . Good writing . AMAZING CASTING ! Every character is just pitch perfect , although sometimes you just want to take one of the wives out to the powder room for a little WomanUp pep talk . But still believable .	1
I enjoy the unit . Great looking guys that are not afraid to get dirty . The loyalty is very refreshing especially now days . What is not to like ?	1
Beautiful and talented women ... GORGEOUS and sexy men ... ..mysterious Black Ops , well it does n't get any better than this ! If you ask for a review on these guys it is always going to be five stars if it comes from me !	1
I do n't know why this was cancelled prematurely but I really liked this show and wish there were many more seasons to watch .	1
We found these stories exciting , interesting and have tried to see additional episodes but for reasons we could not bring them in . The screen message said to retry an/or cancel . We tried everything but we still could not access .	1
This season was cool . Not better than the first 2 seasons . Kind of slowed down . Still worth getting though . Better than season 4	1
The characters and the stories are all over the places.Does not feel like season 1.Good suspense though.The characters and the stories are all over the places.Does not feel like season 1.Good suspense though .	1
What a great series this was . need to get more series like this one . I wish it was still on television .	1
This is by far the bst series of its type I have ever seen . The characters are solid , you either love or hate them , The actors are all superb in their roles.If this series has not won a bunch of awards then something is wrong .	1
While it was only about half of a normal season ( I assume due to the writer 's strike ) , it was still filled with many different and varied situations along with some enduring story and character development themes . I highly recommend watching the whole series ( all 4 seasons ) . I 'm glad I watched them through all at once instead of waiting a week for each episode .	1
I love the intensity and controlled chaos this show delivers . The show is deep with the units assignments but also with the inner turmoil that each unit member goes through battling decisions of morality and ethics . The wives are in a similar dilemma facing their worst fears of losing their loved one , yet kept in the dark about what the husbands do and unable to speak about their husbands without endangering their lives , careers , and support from the Army who does n't recognize the Unit in any official capacity . Great series !	1
The first part of Season 2 got a bit repetitive and then the train suddenly picked up speed and left the station and it has continued to charge ahead all through season 3 . Great writing , characters and inter-character bonding .	1
I watched the show The Unit when it was television and then bought my husband the first two seasons on DVD . I did n't know that it had continued until I watched it on Amazon Fire streaming video . I liked it so much that my husband and I went back to the beginning of the series after we watched seasons 3 and 4 . Watch it and find out for yourself how good it is .	1
I love this show I thought the beginning of season three was the best of the series . They definitely took a different approach for this season then season 2 but it works and is a fun show to watch . I always get a kick out of how many foreign countries look like a washed out version of California . : )	1
This series keeps you pumped up ! It 's like you 're there with them on their missions . Love this series ! Keep it coming !	1
Best military series on TV , someone missed the boat when they cancelled this one	1
I love this series ! Stories are interesting and are concluded with each episode and not carried over to next time . I love Dennis Haysbert as Jonas . His voice is incledible and what a tall man . Sorry it is no longer being made .	1
There is a lot going on in series 3 of The Unit . By now all the actors are well known and you really do like them . The wives are coming out of the stall they were in during the first 2 series . The Unit has a lot of action and they are always risking there lives for the betterment of our country . Very well put together series . If this keeps up , I will be giving future series a 5 star rating .	1
I love all the seasons of The Unit . Wish it was still on television . I enjoyed my binge watch of this show . One exciting episode after another .	1
I 'm hooked on the Unit , each Season has been fantastic ! Each episode has its own great story line and VERY action packed . I love the characters , the story line of both the mission and the home front . I was truly involved in this season and each episode !	1
The whole series was great . It showed how military teams work together and have each others back . It also showed how the wives help and support each other . I would recommend this series to anyone .	1
Great action in most episodes . Also , good suspense . Surprisingly , the patriotism displayed by these special ops guys is not overdone or offensive , and is very plausible . This season took on some difficult topics , like guilt over the many killings they are asked to do and PTSD that affects marriages and produces affairs . We see hidden agendas and conflict of interest in many episodes . Acting is pretty good too . The season finale was anticlimactic and a little disappointing to me .	1
We love this show ! The acting is incredible and the storyline is very believable . There are characters you love to hate ( like Tiffy ) and then there are characters you adore , and others who surprise you in varying episodes . Scott Foley is so good - you never know what to think about him - whether he 's sometimes careless or otherwise brilliant and shows his & # 34 ; human & # 34 ; side . He is also very good at dropping in bouts of humor when they are very much needed . I highly recommend this show !	1
I ca n't understand why this show was canceled . It had everything : adventure , action , tension on the front and tension at home , great cast . If you missed this on TV watch it here . Best show .	1
I enjoyed the unit , mostly the wives and the problems they had to go through . Most of the things the guys did were so much alike except for some really good ones that you never knew were going to happen .	1
Every episode is exciting and thrilling . I do not understand why CBS decided to stop producing the show after the fourth season . Just like 24 , they should reconsider their decision .	1
After what I felt was a lackluster second season , this short season 's returns to the action that made the first season amazing . The stakes are a little high in some of the episodes ( I wont spoil things , but I 'm sometimes amazed that they dont mobilize The Army instead of The Unit when faced with the trials and tribulations they do ) , but the interaction with the wives and families is a lot more complementary than a separate drama.The only thing missing ? The theme from seasons 1 and 2 ! I like the new song by Robert Duncan , but I thought the `` Fired Up '' cadence from the first two seasons was a rare case of a flawless theme song . But I 'll forgive it .	1
Military missions , duplicity , spy-craft ... Great show , well written . I love the pacing , the problem solving and the never quit spirit of these characters . They use their brawn and their smarts for good and none of them are bad to look at.Overall a very intelligent , action packed show and I wish there were more of it .	1
We just love this series . It 's full of so much action , drama , is funny , love and affection , deceit , and the loyalty between the men in the unit is awesome . We ca n't wait to watch the next episode .	1
I enjoy The Unit . I can not say the acting is wonderful or that the story lines are uniformly excellent , but there is always enough to keep my attention . In fairness , the acting and writing is not uniform . Some episodes are very good and others are ok.Of course , a suspension of disbelief is a good idea as the team always comes out alive , with one exception , against odds that seem impossible . Their cunning strategies , ability to cope with the unforeseen and their military prowess always seems to get the guys home safely . But , hey , what 's wrong with a little suspension of disbelief when you want some escape time ?	1
Another great season , season 3 follows season 2 as my favorite of the series ! The writers do an amazing job and the actors do an excellent job as their characters ! A must see !	1
I feel like a turncoat for giving this set only four stars , since I generally find the series to be top drawer.I have a few simple reasons . First , it is abbreviated , to only 15 episodes , filled out to 19 with four added from Season 4 . Second , it is a transitional season , where Zach Addy , one of my favorite characters , is written out of the series with a MOST , MOST improbable conclusion to episode 15 and Dr. Lance Sweets joins the cast as a guest character in this season . I was not entirely keen on two of the main story arcs of the season , the return of Temperance Brennan 's family , especially her father , played by Ryan O'Neal and the Gormagon narrative . Two other arcs , Sweets ' book on Booth and Brennan and Angela 's search for her Brazilian husband are pretty good , as they help introduce Sweets , and make the Angela / Jack romance more interesting than just constant dalliances here there and everywhere.The first two episodes from Season 4 , which take place in London , seem to breath fresh air into the series , and promise good things . I also miss the early tension in season 2 between Brennan and Saroyan , and a more stable character in Zach Addy .	1
I recently watched seasons 3 through 6 of Bones on Netflix and I decided I would review each season , but I want to preface each of my reviews with three comments . First , I want to give my SPOILER ALERT . I do not shy away from giving away what happens in each season so DO NOT read my reviews if you have not already watched ALL of the seasons ( I sometimes give away things in later seasons in reviews for earlier seasons as well , so be careful if you have not watched all the way through season 6 ) .Second , despite the tone of my reviews I really enjoy the show . I do not watch much television , but I have watched all of Bones , and I would not have watched all of it if I did not find it enjoyable . That having been said , my reviews are going to mostly be complaints . I am ( I am afraid ) one of those human beings who decides to take to the internet to air their grievances on a public forum , because they think their opinions are really more important than they really are . So these reviews are mostly grievances despite the fact that I really like the show . I just find it is easier to talk about what I do not like , rather than what I do like.Third , these reviews are not really written for people who are new to the show , or have not watched the seasons . In fact , these reviews are probably not written for anyone other than myself . But if anyone else should get any enjoyment from them , I would not be upset . I am actually curious to know whether other people share some of my complaints , so if you do ( or you do n't ) and you feel like posting a comment under my review please feel free to do so . Okay , now to the review.I will actually begin with something that I really enjoyed from Season 3 , and that is the Gormogon story arc . Bones is essentially a formula show . Each episode there is a murder . They all start out the same way , with some unsuspecting person happening across a dead body . The show then sets up three or four suspects , before finally settling on one . But the show does not usually have an overarching , season long , mystery to solve . I enjoy it when a show sets up a season long mystery ( like in Dexter ) that only gets solved at the end of the season , and I actually wish Bones did more of that . Gormogon is really only the focus of a few episodes from the season ( if I am remembering correctly ) and there are always individual murders to solve each episode , but it is nice to have the Gormogon mystery hovering in the background throughout most of the season.I was not , however , entirely satisfied with how the Gormogon mystery was resolved ( this is where my SPOILER ALERT is in effect ) . The notion that Zack Addy was an accomplice to the Gormogon I actually thought was a good idea . I like it when shows surprise , and I like it when a show lets the audience know that the main characters are not off limits , and that anything can happen . One way of doing that is by having a character who everyone has become familiar with , and perhaps even grown to love , turn out to be the accomplice of a murdering cannibal.The problem I have is that shows rarely have the courage to trust their audience . If you are going to have a main character turn out to be the accomplice of a cannibal , it would be better to go as dark as possible with it . But shows always tend to pull back at the last minute . First , they pull back by having Zack blow up his own hands in order to protect one of his workmates . I am not saying they should have had Zack kill one of the other main characters , but they clearly set that up in order to downplay Zack 's `` evilness '' ( for lack of a better term ) . I think if you are going to go for it , you need to go all the way , otherwise you do not really make anyone happy . You upset the people who do not like to see the main characters messed with at all , and you upset the people who enjoy that kind of thing by not having the courage to go all the way with it . You can not do something like that half-way . It would have , in my opinion , been great to find out that a character you had been watching for three seasons was genuinely evil , rather than simply misguided by logic . It could have potentially raised some continuity issues , but I think those could have been dealt with by simply saying that he was hiding his true identity.And that brings me to my second complaint with the resolution . One of the recurring themes of the show is the debate between logic ( or science ) and emotion ( or faith ) . Or the debate between the head and heart if you prefer . The show never really succeeds , in my opinion , in dealing with this theme in a very deep way , which , admittedly , I think is too much to expect from a television show . Part of the problem , in my opinion , is that they caricature each position . There is very little subtlety . The representatives of the `` logic '' camp ( Brennan and Zach ) are all logic , and the representatives of the emotion camp ( Booth and Angela ) are all emotion . The solution to why Zack fell in with the Gormogon is that he let himself be deceived by logic , and this is supposed to represent the dangers of pure logic . That is an interesting idea ( although , personally , I think the world tends to suffer from too little logic , and not too much ) but to be executed correctly it needs to be more subtle , and more logical . There is nothing very logical about Zack 's decision to fall in with the Gormogon . Brennan , when she finds out , attempts to reconstruct the syllogism behind Zack 's decision , but it is not a very strong logical argument at all , and certainly not an argument that would convince anyone with even average intelligence , let alone someone of Zack 's supposed intelligence . The notion that Zack would choose to murder people based on such a poor logical argument is highly implausible , and was clearly an attempt to partially absolve Zack from the crimes by removing any actual evil intent.In this season it is also discovered that Zack is responsible for stabbing the last victim of the Gormogon to death . But in the next season ( another SPOILER ) the show again pulls back by revealing that Zack did not really stab anyone , and he only confessed to the murder because he revealed where the victim lived to the Gormogon ( who apparently was incapable of discovering that for himself ? ) and felt responsible for the man 's death . In other words , the show takes the step of making the killer one of the main characters , but then does everything it possibly can to pull back from that decision . In my opinion , you should either go for it or not . Either you make the main character a killer , in which case , you go the whole nine yards , and make him evil as well , or you find another killer . This , to me , is a recurring pattern that you see in television shows . Apparently writers and producers do not trust that the audience will go along with them , or they think people will be too upset , or too shocked . And maybe they are right . I imagine they have done more research on the subject than I have . But still , speaking from my own personal perspective , I would like to see a show go all the way with it sometime , and not pull back at the last minute.Now , I have one more complaint with the third season , but before I launch into that , I think I should say something positive about this season . I was not sure when Dr. Lance Sweets ( played by John Francis Daley ) was introduced into the show , but it says on Wikipedia that it was in the third season , and I think he was an excellent addition to the cast . I think part of the reason I like him is because I was a big fan of Freaks and Geeks ( although it took me at least a season before I realized it was the same actor since he is not a kid anymore ) , but I also enjoy the character , and his interactions with Booth and Brennan . So if Wikipedia is right , and this was the season that Sweets was introduced , then that is a definite plus for this season in my book.The last thing I want to mention , or complain about rather , is the episode where Booth is shot , and the succeeding episode . There is not really any big spoiler here , since obviously the show goes on , and Booth remains a central character , I knew that Booth could not really have died , but the episode where he is shot ends without knowing for sure if he lived . The next episode , to my surprise , begins with his funeral . I will save the reader the details of how the show finds its way out of this mess ( of course Booth is not really dead ) but let 's just say it was a pretty ridiculous solution that made no sense . If they wanted to leave the viewer in suspense for the first five minutes of the episode after Booth was shot they could have found a better way . I realize that shows have to stretch realism to a certain degree , and I am willing to suspend my disbelief up to a point , but there are limits . The solution , in this case , is totally implausible and makes no sense.So that is my opinion . And now I am sending it out into the world , and pretending like there are other people out there who are actually interested ...	1
Like the series and the actors . Please see our other reviews of Bones . Range of personalities and dynamics are good .	1
I had gotten season 1 & debated about getting any other seasons . The show was very well done but the character of Bones was very irritating as she was clueless to everyday life , & only spoke & related to things in scientific terms . ( I realize this was the `` joke '' of the show but it was really annoying to me . ) Friends told me that it got better as the seasons progressed.I got season 3 BEFORE getting season 2 , as I did n't think it would make much of a difference ( & it was cheaper at the time too ) . My friends were right , Bones is n't anywhere near as annoying as she was in season 1 , she 's more normal . The only thing with jumping from season 1 to season 3 , apparently I missed a LOT in season 2 . There are ( now ) new characters ( Booth apparently has a history with one of them ) & there are many new story lines . Season 3 , I find out Bones ' father ( played by Ryan O'Neal ) was arrested in season 2 by Booth . There are other story lines I need to get caught up on as well from season 2.The show is very well done , although the corpses are rather gross & disgusting - and sometimes they are way too graphic . There are several extras on this DVD & there ARE subtitles for the hearing impaired . Also , this DVD set has a `` bonus '' of the first 4 episodes from season 4 . I have ordered season 2 ( so I can see what I missed ) . Season 3 is MUCH BETTER than season 1 .	1
After I discovered Bones , I had to have all seasons . I love the show . Good chemistry , the writing is great .	1
Do n't get me wrong , Bones continues to be a family favorite at our house , but the new plotline about the therapist for Brennan and Boothe just does n't quite work , and some of the momentum seems to have died with the writers strike this year , now that the show s going again , it does n't sound like we are going to get a full season out of any show , but at my house we are hoping that our favorites like Bones are exceptions to that.When you have a favorite like Bones , and you want the DVD set , you want a whole season ! If that does n't happen I guess I will download all of these episodes , since they can be stored in the Amazon digital locker , to avoid crowding my Tivo .	1
**Plot SPOILERS alert**BONES keeps on keeping on . Two excellent seasons under its belt , and a truncated Season 3 ( damn you , writers ' strike ! ) finally all wrapped up , and predictably , these are good episodes , as well . But only fifteen of them ! As Season 3 's first episode ( `` The Widow 's Son in the Windshield '' ) opens up , we learn that Bones has been reluctant to go in the field with Booth and she wo n't say why . However , a head flung off a bridge forces her to reconnect with Booth . This episode also begins a new serial killer arc , this one being particularly even more gristly and diabolical than most , and of which resolution later down the season would have tragic consequences.Season 3 doles out several other subplots . As per the startling news learned at the altar from Season 2 's finale , Angela is already married . An ongoing story arc becomes Hodgins and Angela 's search for her long-time but vaguely remembered husband . `` The Secret of the Soil '' introduces Dr. Sweets , a 22 year old psychotherapist assigned to counsel Bones and Booth , this stemming from the FBI 's concern due to Booth having arrested Bones ' father . These sessions are generally funny stuff as , mostly , Booth ca n't help but treat Sweets like a kid . Plus , these scenes tend to open things up even more between Bones and Booth.I 've a couple of Season 3 favorites . `` The Widow 's Son in the Windshield '' introduces the cannibalistic Gormogon killer , which would become a key ongoing story arc of the season . `` Mummy in the Maze '' is a very neat Halloween show , wherein Booth 's shameful phobia is unveiled and Bones 's costume is ... simply awesome . `` The Knight on the Grid '' is a taut thriller as the Gormagon killer returns , this time with a personal vendetta against Bones and Booth . And `` The Santa in the Slush '' is a standout sentimental episode and provides one of the best moments in the series as Bones cuts a deal to have Christmas brought to her incarcerated father and brother . Cool ending , too . `` The Baby in the Bough '' has Bones forced to babysit an infant involved with a case ( you see the potential , right ? ) . Meanwhile , `` The Wannabe in the Weeds '' ( in which Zach and Bones both sing ) and `` The Pain in the Heart '' are striking for their ability to stun the audience , even if the latter episode definitely had a rushed feeling to it . I feel that the after-effects of `` The Wannabe in the Weeds '' should 've been developed further in `` The Pain in the Heart . '' In fact , `` The Pain in the Heart '' - which wraps up the Gormogon killer storyline and , by the way , will upset busloads of fans - could 've really , really benefited by being a two-episode arc.The cases are still bizarre and the corpses borderline grotesque . But the draw remains Emily Deschanel and David Boreanaz , and that electric `` thing '' between them . These two still get aces in chemistry , and are still the smokingest hot couple on television . Emily Deschanel continues to nail her role of Temperance `` Bones '' Brennan . And while her character might 've loosened up a little bit ( not too much ) , there 's still that endearing naivette and vulnerability which peek out occasionally . And , of course , her refreshing bluntness ( some call it social awkwardness ) has never left . Boreanaz , he 's just a great leading man . Confident and charming , bristling with machismo , yet with a sensitive side . His unveiling of his Christmas present to Bones in `` The Santa in the Slush '' is one of the best , most touching scenes of the season.Tack on the rest of the offbeat but familiar crew from the Jeffersonian Institution , and these folks continue to provide the best show in forensics crime-solving . All the ingredients to the series ' success are on display for Season 3 - the boosts of levity , the whiffs of romance , the chilling mysteries , and the ongoing character developments . BONES just keeps on keeping on .	1
This third season was shorter than the previous ones , but it was particularly hefty in events and closures . And it is these closures that have to be examined.The first one is the integration of the psychiatrist and profiler Dr. Lance Sweets . He officially comes to help Dr Brennan and Special Agent Booth deal with the stress in their relationship due to the extreme tension their work is bringing in and imposing onto them . He is some kind of relation counselor . At first they took it badly but little by little they accepted to consult him and to follow his advice . That brings some clarification in the warped relationship that develops between the two people concerned . Little by little too he is integrated as a profiler in some of their cases and even later in all of them . This is a new development for the series.The second closure is really a closure . It concerns Temperance 's father and by ricochet her brother . He is finally brought to court for his killing of the FBI deputy head . Dr Brennan is not even called as a witness whereas all her laboratory friends and Special Agent Booth are . She stands with the defense and she holds her position well . The tactics of the defense is simple . Let the prosecution put down all their cards and then let 's deal with the jury 's most intimate conviction . In other words let 's give the jury some alternative hypotheses as who could have done the killing . Here Dr Brennan plays an essential role to save her father and set him free . Can such a flawless scientist accept to be doubted and even negatively represented even if it is to save her father 's freedom ? The third closure is Zack . He had been sent to Iraq at the beginning of the season but his absence had not held one full episode . He was brought back to Washington DC because of his disruptive role in a military team due to his inability to integrate . But his attitude and role is becoming overbearing with everyone . Some would say that he must be slightly autistic and that would be a mistake . He is a very fragile personality who compensates his weakness in character with over-competence in his scientific field . He is irreplaceable . Yet he can become the prey of any strong personality he would encounter . His enhanced scientific competence is over-normal but it is a way to hide his brittleness . This season will bring Zack to his doom but you will have to be discovered it by yourself.The fourth closure is also contained in this season . It starts at the beginning of it and ends with its final episode . It is the story of a serial killer that appears in some episodes . This serial killer is obviously imitated from Dexter and his viciousness is even worse than anything you may examine . Of course he tries to penetrate and infiltrate the Jeffersonian Institute and he will succeed for a time , though his agent will not be the best he could have found . He is a cannibal , the heir and continuator of an old practice against secret societies . We can hear there an echo to some of Dan Brown 's cogitation about old secret societies and free masons . That serial killer will be destroyed and will finally exit the series under a nickname , Gormogon . He is nameless.This last element is surprising in such a series because the series is hyper scientific and tries to reject and even rebut all superstitions , mythologies , beliefs and even religions . Dr Brennan should know that the unnamable , the one who does not have a name , the one whose name is unutterable us also the one who was , the one who is and the one who will come . To keep a criminal nameless is to deify or at least magnify that criminal just as if he were some kind of divinity.That 's the last remark I will make on this third season . It deals with social cases more often than criminal cases , and the crimes in each case are the result of weak people who can not cope with the stress of life . Gormogon is the exception . In one word the series gets better as for its thrilling , even frightening atmosphere and it analyses in fair and fine details the relations between the various members of the team , of the laboratory , of the people who have dedicated their lives to fighting against crime.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU , University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne , University Paris 8 Saint Denis , University Paris 12 Cr & eacute ; teil , CEGID	1
I am a big bones fan and have written a number of reviews of Bones as well as other TV shows and Movies . This season wasa kind of change in the wind for the series ; the previous seasons were what I would call pristine , stories dealing with the originalpremise of the series , But now they are beginning to add new characters ; Camille for one , a new boss of the Jeffersonian.. I likeher and she fits in well . But now they added Lance Sweets , a very annoying fellow who is supposed to be a psychologist.Unfortunately he is neither a great actor or has any idea what a psychologist is supposed to do . All of a sudden he is an expert onBones and Booths relationships . He was only 22 when he started at the FBI with zilch experience . And he follows Bones andBooth around constantly injecting himself into their affairs . He as even threating to break up their partnership ! ! In the later seasonshe really becomes annoying , flashing his frog-like eyes around , and ending up going with this equally annoying Daisy . I guess heis supposed to the the comedy relief , but I do n't think he is funny , But there is plenty of good ( & gooey ) entertainment in this series . Some really good episodes : MUMMY IN THE MAZE , THE SANTA IN THE SLUSH , THE BABY IN THE BOUGH & THE PAIN IN THE HEART . There are other good ones as well . Lookfor the kiss between Booth & Bones in the SANTA episode and watch the extended kiss in the special features . DispiteSweets intrusion there is plenty to recommend this season as well as all the 8 seasons . Enjoy ! !	1
Have n't watched all the episodes on this set yet , but they are as good the second time around as the first .	1
Still a very strong series and a personal favourite , Boes has excellent writig good stories and directing . The main problem which will be resolving is the youth of the cast and even the excessive youthfullness of some of the cast memebers which renders the story slightly unplausible . However David Boreanaz is overcoming his character of Angel.Emily Deschael plays the socially inadequate Bones and even she is somewhat too young to be totally credible . OK , these are minor esthetic points that should not distract from enjoying the show .	1
Once more DVD comes to the rescue of a TV series that has turned from so so ratings to solid hit . The series is BONES and there is no better way to watch this than on DVD . Why ? Because once you get into the series you 'll want to continue on rather than wait for the next episode.Just released is BONES SEASON THREE : TOTALLY DECOMPOSED EDITION . How can it be that this show has been on that long already ? For those unfamiliar with the show its time to catch up.Based on the real life of forensic anthropologist Kathy Reichs , the story revolves around Dr. Temperance Brennan ( Emily Deschanel ) , a forensic specialist who works at the Jeffersonian in Washington , D.C . When the FBI comes calling for assistance in the form of Agent Seeley Booth ( David Boreanaz ) , Temperance takes to field work like a pro with an intense interest in each case presented.Along with Temperance , known as Bones to Booth , are a team of equally dedicated professionals at the Institute . Among them are Angela ( Michaela Conlin ) who specializes in facial and body reconstruction via sketches and computer software , Dr. Jack Hodgins ( TJ Thynes ) who specializes in organic materials and Dr. Zack Addy ( Eric Milligan ) who knows more about bones than , well , Bones . Each member of the team adds to a complete whole not only in their expertise but in their character functions as well.For the first two seasons we were allowed to explore the world of the `` squints '' , Booth 's nickname for the intelligent research team at the Institute . But as the show continued , we watched as Booth came to appreciate each individual in their own way . We also watched the sexual tension between Booth and Bones grow in the most subtle of ways as they worked case after case together.There you have it , the main crux of the series . But it 's more than that . It involves cases being solved using clues found only by this team of forensic anthropologists . Each week they discover clues no mere mortal would find with the naked eye . And each week Booth and Bones have the chance to put the guilty behind bars . At the same time we get to watch the interplay between the characters as well.What you have here is a combination of age old detective show combined with the technological side shown in the various CSI series . But rather than focus mainly on the science of evidence we get that as well as interaction between characters in more familiar TV territory . Romance and buddy systems are seen in each episode as opposed to straight police work.This brings us to season three . This time around we begin with Bones acting unlike herself . Could it be because Booth sent her father to prison at the end of last season ? Could it be the attraction between Bones and Booth became too much ? Or could it be because Zack had decided to take a leave and head out to work in Iraq ? Just as the stories offer clues to the murders , the series offers clues and at times answers to these questions.As the season starts we find Hodgins and Angela still very much in love , still planning on marrying and still searching for the man who was a one night stand Angela married in a drunken stupor . This was an arc left open from season two that finds an answer this year.Zack returns from Iraq a bit different . Fortunately for fans of the series ( and Zack ) he shows up in the first episode , just in time to save the day and help find the criminal.Bones and Booth start off not nearly as close as before . Whichever of the reasons discussed that seem to have had an effect on Bones is clearly visible from the first minutes of episode one . And as the pair start to work things out , they begin therapy to help with their work.The first show offers a new challenge for viewers and the team as they encounter a secret cannibalistic society that has left their calling card . While the Gormogon killer may not be a familiar name to most , it will be by the end of this season . Not only are the guilty not found by shows end but they continue to show up during the season.A more in depth view of Bones sex life is offered as well ( no , not seen ) as we begin to meet the men she dates . This seems to upset Booth who does his best to hide it . The affection between these two characters may be more blatant than Scully and Mulder of X FILES but it is still held in check for the present.Humor , mystery , relationships and friendship are all regular topics in each episode of the series . And Season Three brings forth more of the human characteristics of each member of the forensic family found here . It is these human qualities and interaction between characters that makes this show the success that it is . While Bones comes off as cold and out of touch with the world around her , Seely comes off as having lived more than his years would seem . Put these two together and you come up with one of the most successful teams since Nick and Nora Charles.Extended episodes , alternate episodes and more make this box set worth adding to your collection . And if you do n't have them already , buy the first two as well.This is a fresh series with great acting that makes the entire production believable . And that is what makes for good TV . And good TV now means good DVDs . Take a 3 day weekend or the holidays to get acquainted with the Bones family . It 's a great mystery filled time for all .	1
The bones series are one of the best if you like crime and love then these are the series for you	1
This is a great tv series with well developed characters andbevy of interesting stories . I have watched each season on dvd andseason 3 is as good as the first two . Even if it 's a shorter one due to the writers strikes . One of the main reasons to watch this show is theromantic tension between the two lead characters . The show reminds me of C.S.I but it really delves into the personal lives of the characters . It would be great to see more of this with the Booth and Cam characters aswell . There is n't a bad episode in this season either . I ca n't understand the low ratings that some people gave for such a well made and entertaining show . And you do n't need to start at season 1 to enjoy season 3 at all . So if you are into a great crime procedural show with great characters and fine acting then this one is for you .	1
Another great season but a bit choppy . For some reason there were a couple of episodes mixed up or somthing . At the beginning Angela and Hodges were engaged but then in the middle of the season there is a couple of episodes where Hodges is trying to ask her to marry him.It was a bit confusing . THere is a episode about horses and humans running around pretending to be horses.It was rather disgusting . The best part about that episode is the last five minutes when the two main characters are discussing the days work .	1
I did n't think it possible that another TV show would create another relationship with so much chemistry as the one Mulder and Scully shared . This is the kind of relationship where two people are perfect together in every single way , they fight for each other , the save each other and you know , deep down , that they belong together . Oh , and the sexual tension is so obvious everyone knows about it ! And even though you live for the glances , for the touch of the hand , for a single kiss ( The Santa in the Slush ) , you are still hesitant to see them romantically together . You do n't want to mess up a perfect thing.Season 3 sees a lot of changes , the Gormogon storyline ; Brennan 's father , Max , finally goes to trial , Both and Brennan go through some very interesting psych therapy , Jack and Angela look to find the name of her husband and the team experiences loss . Although short ( 15 episodes ) , the season was quite good , with tons of surprises , chaos , and plenty interesting cases . Great season.This season really delves into the Booth and Brennan relationship starting with Brennan 's antagonistic feelings against Booth and her reluctance to go into the field or work with him directly . This is all a result of the events ofBones Second Season . Things gets solved and their relationship is fixed ; just in time to solve the next case . This is a great crime-solving duo that works great together .	1
Bones is one of my favorite tv shows . Whether that 's because I relate to Brennan 's social awkwardness or not is another story . But it is just so interesting and well written ( usually ) that it completely engulfs you and is the perfect tv show to make a marathon out of . Which is what I did this weekend with Season Three.For those not familiar with the Bones series ( and if you are n't go check out the first season , it kind of describes all the characters for you ) , Dr. Temperance Brennan is a forensic anthropologist that works with FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth solving murders . She 's brought in for skeletal remains and helps with clues that most people would miss . Supported by a team at the Jeffersonian where she normally works , she has the greatest resources and best friends for handling the job.Characters : Emily Deschanel : Temperance BrennanDavid Boreanaz : Seeley BoothMichaela Conlin : Angela MontenegroEric Millegan : Zack AddyT.J . Thyne : Jack HodginsTamara Taylor : Camille SaroyanJohn Francis Daley : Lance SweetsBrennan and Booth are definitely the main characters of this show . It 's because their chemistry on the set that everything works as well as it does . By playing off of each other , both poking fun at their weaknesses and admiring their strengths , their relationship feels very real . Adding in Dr. Sweets to evaluate it does n't help much ( at least in my opinion ) but it does give the viewer a chance to see more of their personal interactions . Angela , Hodgins , Camille and Zack all do n't really have as big of a part in this particular season though . At least not until the end episode . They kind of fade away into the background and I think Brennan 's family gets more screentime than they do in a lot of episodes . I really enjoy watching the rest of the group so that was a bit of a disappointment for me.And then there 's the overall plot of this one . Most of the episodes are one-offs and can be watched somewhat out of order because they do n't tie into the main story arc . But there are a couple things that do , like Angela and Hodgins relationship , Brennan 's family troubles , and then the bad guy `` Gormogon '' who is a cannibal and is mentioned in a lot of the episodes . They were all interesting arcs , but since we are dealing with a short season due to the writer 's strike , everything seemed rushed and some of it just did n't tie in . I was especially disappointed in the way they took Zack 's character as it completely did n't fit with his personality and seemed implausible . For them to veer his part in the plot so far off was obviously a casualty of the strike.Obviously because of the graphic nature of some of the crimes and police scenes in this series , it is n't for people who are squeamish . And while there 's no overt scenes , sex is hinted at as is nudity . Although in my personal opinion the scene with Booth in the tub is worth at least a star for this series . I do enjoy the special effects . Everything looks very realistic and even the Angelator machine , which I know is n't real , seems plausible . Although it is n't used a whole lot in this season . The music is always pretty great in the series too . They seem to use little heard of artists and one of the songs from the first season is still a regular on my playlist . They 're just good at picking that kind of stuff out to fit the show.I ca n't say that this was my favorite of the seasons . It offered some disappointments but it 's still better than a lot of shows that are out there . And I still definitely like the main characters enough to keep watching.Review by M. Reynard 2013	1
I 'm a big Bones fan , and this was simply th best price and free shipping . Sold . It came quickly too .	1
The series kept getting better and better . The interaction between Bones and Booth started to really progress . The cases took on some weird overtones .	1
The third season of `` Bones '' was even more compelling than the first . Although it was a shorter season due to the Writer 's Strike ( 15 episodes ) , Fox has elected to include four seasons from the fourth season ( which may have been why the set was deleted ) as compensation . During the fourth we had a number of marvelous episodes but the story arc involving the cannibal serial killer Gormogon dominated most of the season.Two excellent episodes are expanded on this set with an unaired version of `` Player Under Pressure '' and the Holiday episode `` The Santa in the Slush '' has an `` extended kiss '' scene . While the latter is n't any big deal the former for `` Player Under Pressure '' improves an already exceptional episode.We also get the gag reel which is fun , a featurette `` Director 's Take '' ( which I have n't gotten around to watching yet -- I tend to watch all the extras AFTER I 've watched the episodes to prevent spoilers ) . While the extras are n't quite as generous as previous seasons , at least Fox is n't recycling the same idea ( i.e. , commentary tracks -- although I like them -- a lot of folks never listen to them and they are dependent on how engaging the people involved with them are ) . The episodes from season four while we 'll get them again , are a nice way to fill out the set and keep fans in anticipation for the next set which will come out about the same time next year.All in all an excellent season that was unfortunately cut short by the Writer 's Strike . While the retail price is a bit high ( look for bargains folks and snag them while you can ! ) , the extras included here makes up for some of that .	1
Too bad it only ran for one season . Jeff was in top form . He showed emotions that I thought were beyond his acting ability . The story 's were top notch .	1
You will enjoy this show . It has just what your looking for , excitement , drama and those scenes that almost take your breathe away !	1
Enjoyed this series , and the plots.. They were really interesting , and I would recommend it as light entertainment . Acceptable for young people .	1
Do n't know why this show did n't last longer than it did , although ... .I am a Jeff Goldblum fan and I 've found that most people are not . Liked the subtle humor , witty sarcasm , and character interaction . The premise was unique and opened the show to a lot more episodes than it enjoyed . Too bad .	1
Having voices in one 's head to assist with one 's work is not crazy . That detective R gets a visual is a bonus . Really fun to watch each case unfold .	1
I am a die hard Jeff Goldblum fan and absolutely loved this show . I am sorry they cancelled it , but is n't that always the way the networks operate ? This was a quirky show , based on the premise of a homicide detective being able to talk to the ghosts of the murder victims . I would bet there are millions of detectives that would love to have that gift to help solve murders . For Raines , Jeff Goldblum 's character , it provides the ideal vehicle for the hilarious , rapid dialogue Jeff is known and loved for . He tries so hard to fight the gift , but when it proves so useful , he then welcomes it . The fun occurs when the ghosts talk when he is with other people and he either fights answering or answers and then has to cover it up . His murdered partner is the impetus for the & # 34 ; gift. & # 34 ; Raines tries to avoid dealing with the concrete reality of that partner 's death by solving others . It enjoyed the few episodes there were .	1
This show was just a little too early to ride the vampire wave . It came out right before vampires became & # 34 ; cool & # 34 ; Ok there was some cheesy moments at times , it was a low budget TV show . But look at Buffy ! How did Buffy make it and not this show ? I ca n't stand watching Buffy.But it was a really sweet premise . I loved the relationship between the 2 main characters . I loved the storylines . This was a really well done show . As I said it had its cheesy moments , but it was only the first year . It did n't really get into its groove yet . The way the last episode ends is so sweet ! I want to see more.I bought this and I revisit it every so often and mourn its passing . Great potential for an excellent series , but cut short .	1
It is terrible that it was so short of a run . It never lost that special thing that kept me watching .	1
`` Moonlight '' begins with a laid-back vampire PI being interviewed in his mind , defining what about vampires is legend and what is real . `` I do n't hunt innocents . But there 's predators out there that need to be dealt with . `` It 's a quirky reversal of Anne Rice tradition , and it sets the tone for a very unique blend of vampire tale and urban mystery -- and sadly it ended too soon . Especially since Alex O'Loughlin is an absolutely inspired vampire detective , and the quick direction , good CGI and snappy writing save this from being another cheesy vampire story.Mick St. John ( O'Laughlin ) is a vampire detective in L.A. -- where there has recently been a vampiresque murder of a college student . But though the student was obsessed with vampires , Mick soon realizes that she was n't murdered by one . And with the assistance of Beth Turner ( Sophia Myles ) -- who insists he looks familiar -- Mick uncovers a weird little vampire-obsessed cabal at Hearst college , and a professor whose infatuation with undeath goes beyond mere fanaticism.And there are plenty of other nasty cases -- an ex-con gunning for the vampire detective , a forced stay in the desert , `` Black Crystal , '' a feral newbie vampire , a hooker-killing teenage vampire , a supposedly-dead cult killer , a killer gang going after Beth 's boyfriend , a Hollywood starlet , an attempt to kill Mick 's mentor , and a vampire who threatens to `` out '' every single vampire in L.A.But no vampire story is complete without the nasty pasts and romantic tension -- Beth discovers Mick 's true nature , and finds herself drawn to him until she 's hit by a terrible personal tragedy . And Mick is confronted by a woman who looks suspiciously like Coraline ( Shannyn Sossamon ) -- his dead ex-wife , and the woman who made him a vampire.Most vampire stories , whether on TV or in movies , are so abysmally cheesy that you could slice them up and serve them with wine and crackers . Fortunately `` Moonlight '' succeeds in being quite a bit better -- not a lot of vampiric superpowers ( beyond enhanced senses and healing ) , fangs and glowing eyes . The writers even poke fun at some of the old cliches ( `` Garlic ... is good on pizza '' ) .The weakest part of `` Moonlight '' is the crimes themselves -- most are fairly ordinary murder mysteries . But the series does succeed in balancing out the vampire stuff with the private eye plots , and as the series winds on and becomes far more complex , the vampiric element becomes more essential to every story . Quick swooping camerawork , fast-moving plots , some nice nasty action.And these vampires are done with tongue in cheek , whether it 's their un-cliche living conditions ( sleek minimalist apartments and mansions ) or their easy use of modern technology ( `` If I had n't become a vampire I would have missed out on the Internet , TIVO , World of Warcraft and GPS '' ) .That slightly offbeat style is helped by the dialogue ( `` Can you fly ? '' `` Just like Superman . '' `` Really ? '' `` No ... . it would be pretty cool , would n't it ? '' ) . For the record , the best lines are all from Josef ( `` Well , the blood lust can be pretty heavy when you 're first turned . And you could really lose it . I know I did . Damn , those were good times ! `` ) .Alex O'Loughlin is excellent as a vampire PI haunted by his past and his vampiric nature ( `` monsters do n't get happily ever after '' ) , but handling it with a wry sense of humor , brains , and enhanced senses . He even goes through some ups-and-downs that most fictional vampires do n't , such as temporarily becoming sort-of-human , but fortunately O'Laughlin keeps him from becoming emo.Myles is pretty decent as the pretty reporter who begins to wonder if a human and a vampire can find love , and Sossamon is brilliant as the mysterious Coraline . And Jason Dohring absolutely steals the show as the witty , happily amoral Josef ( `` She 's delicious . '82 was a good year '' ) , who nevertheless has his own sad past . `` Moonlight '' manages to avoid the cheeze factor , and this all-too-brief series succeeds in being a unique blend of vampire love story and murder mystery . Definitely worth seeing .	1
An entertaining series ahead of the vampire craze , too bad the writers strike put an end to it . Loved Jason Dohring as Josef and Alex O'Loughlin 's Mick was fascinating to watch . I think the American accent came much easier to him than his co-star Sophia Myles . I saw her recently in a Doctor Who episode and she was much more relaxed with that accent .	1
Ok so it started off well and then about the time of the writers strike it had a bad episode that could have killed this for me and then bam , I do n't know what happened but suddenly the story is flying the action is interesting and the forever knight remake is reborn with new power and vigor not seen since , well forever knight . The episodes are great except for one and even though they are good they keep getting better and better . This has that real touch that goes so well with honest in your face fantasy , like dead like me ? the dead zone ? you 'll like this . it 's a keeper .	1
Now this is a very exciting and sexy show ! I would advise taking all your heart medications before you watch . You will definitely need to cool down after and episode of this !	1
One well done and outstanding show . But it was a victim of a writers strike action . Shame . Great acting and stories . Too me , a must have DVD set .	1
this show was excellent to watch . Alex made a very sexy vampire . WOW I liked the shows and the action scene . Excellent writing too . Should have lsted longer .	1
This is a review for Amazon Instant Video on Moonlight . Compared to the series , you do not miss much here when it is this or DVD . You have some extras but they are not that much or that often , and they are normally interviews and nothing more . For that reason , i think it works out.Moonlight is a story about Mick St. James and a human he has a past with . In the pilot there is a `` vsaampire killing '' case Mick looks into , and this is something that Mick finds dangerous . Apparently vampires have their way of living and concealing , and they do not like attention . This rleationshiip continues on through the show , and this and another one will come to define it.As far as a show on the supernatural , i liked it . It had a lot and it even allowed people to do things that a lot of shows seem to miss out on . The efffects , while not amazing , are great , and the acting was a lot better than anything I expected . Honestly , i thought the show might scream timber and fall a few episodes in but it kept the season going and it answers a lot . We get to know Mick , vamps , some humans , an a weird experiment that is going on.Its worth watching.As with all shows , there are filler episodes as well . That can be one of the great things about this , because you do not have to wathc everything . Still , missing is missing and this , a 5/5 show that is still hanging around , might find you enjoying it.It is hard not to .	1
I love this little human and vampire romance . There is absolutely great chemistry between Alex and Sophia . They make it all plausible.Now there are quite a few vampire shows around . Moonlight was just ahead of the times .	1
Out of all the Stargate spin-offs this is my favorite . Every episode was pretty much engaging and keeps you on the edge of your seat . Sorry it went of the air so early after 5 seasons not reaching the 10 seasons like Stargate . However , at least we can buy the past seasons or view through Amazon Prime .	1
Have finished Season 4 for the series . Am still enjoying the Sci-Fi thriller and have started the fifth season . What a great way to catch on your missed series from being stationed overseas during the majority of the period . Strongly recommended . The key to good SciFi is identifying new technology fiction that meets the challenges of known theories that have a great opportunity for sometime in the future of coming true .	1
I love Stargate Atlantis , but the ending of season 4 did n't leave me anticipating season 5.I hope I 'm wrong because I love this series ... ..I 'll still watch it ( do n't get me wrong ) , but the series seems to be off course ... ... ... ... ... ...	1
As good as SG-1 . One of my all-time favorite sci-fi shows . I only wish they would make more like this !	1
I have watched this series several times . A mix of colorful characters , with some humor from Dr. McKay played by Davd Hewlett and a handsome badass hero in the form of Colonel Shepherd , played by Joe Flannigan . These are the earth people . They travel through a Stargate to explore other worlds and pick up Tayla , a beautiful native of another planet and our first glimpse of the gorgeous hunk from Game of Thrones , Jason Mamoa who plays Ronan , from the planet Seteda . Adventure awaits as the explore other planets and learn of a formidable foe , the Wraith , who like to draw the life out of humans . Altogether a very entertaining ride .	1
Clean and fun Sci-fi . Not as dark and mature as Stargate Universe . Most of this felt like a clear good vs evil . Excellent effects budget and decent acting for a TV Sci-Fi . Hate that it was canceled so soon .	1
I enjoyed this science fiction season because of the well written characters and stories . You see some changes around Atlantis in the city and the situation they are in .	1
New people compared to the 1st 3 seasons . Amanda Tapping joins from original SG . Dr. Beckett character returns . Final showdown with the replicators ( evil ) . Teyla is pregnant . Great space battle scene . Hot space nomad returns . Oh , and Jewel Straite from Firefly is the new medical officer . . .hell yea . There is alot of action and enough CGI to whet the appetite .	1
one of my favorite shows . it miss it very much and look forward to a movie ( that 's what they promised )	1
The series is set in a another galaxy where there are dangers unknown to the team from Earth . If you like stories about exploration , you 'll enjoy this show .	1
First of all , I do n't do the whole spoiler thing so i just want to say how great this show is . Stargate Atlantis is definitely one of my favorite shows , I 've already watched the whole series twice , and thinking about a third time through , I honestly do n't think there 's a dull episode , It 's a little like Stargate Sg-1 , but way better , Sg-1 is pretty good seasons 1-7 but I 'm struggling to get through season 8 , It 's just like they ran out of idea 's , and the bad guy 's , the Go'uld , get old very quick , but the wraith on the other hand are great villains . The only thing I did n't like about this show was that there were only 5 seasons , I literally crave this show . But all in all , if you like Si-Fi , you 'll definitely love this show , and even if you do n't like Si-Fi , I think you 'll still like it , 5 stars all the way for this show .	1
This definitely was one of my most favorite shows , can never get enough of Stargate Atlantis , great plots , great acting , great team , except when McKay keeps wining , great effects .	1
I 'm a Stargate fan since the original movie came out . The original TV series SG-1 was a good one that lasted many seasons . I checked this one out after watching the SG-1 series to the end . This one has a different spin but a similar show ( same creators ) . I 've enjoyed this one as well .	1
The cast works extremely well together . The episodes are well written and directed . There are comical , suspenseful , action , and drama focused episodes that bring out the different aspects of the characters and plot .	1
Thank goodness that a good space opera series is still being made.They really try to put out a quality show with stargate atlantis.This series may not be as exciting as season 3 overall but it 's still agood show and well worth watching . I do think it was a mistake toremove the head of atlantis ; the dr. wier character from the show , just as removing Dr. Becket character from the previous series was not the best move in my opinion . Still it takes guts to remove major characters and the Samantha Carter character does a good job at being the bases new leader . She has to let the others do most of the work though as she mainly runs the base . I still loved the show though due to it 's overall quality and fine acting so it 's worth watching for even non stargate fans who enjoy good sci fi that is very well made .	1
I love this show . Quite a bit more than ag-1 . The characters are just quite interesting.I have to add words	1
While with the introduction of Sam Carter from Sg1 helps boost the fanbase and ratings for the series overall the series has reached a decent peak in its entertainment and sci-fi value for many sci-fan fans of this series and others . While it came as no surprise it did feel a little unneeded to make a formal couple out Shepard and Teyla but oh well , also it 's nice to see that the writers have allowed the side characters to have their own romantic relationships in the series too . While we still have the Wraith and Replicators in the series they have n't seemed as much the viable threat they were made out to be in the previous seasons or series though they still are a threat . The season shows the strong point of the series until the final season which sadly concludes this growing but sadly stumped series .	1
Not quite as good as the original but then again they did n't have RDA as their lead . But on the whole it was a good sequel	1
I did n't watch it when it first came out on TV . Because I was into SG1 and did n't think spinoffs were any good . But now that I watch the series , I think it was excellent . It is well done and the characters have become endeared to me like SG1 .	1
Writers starting having a hard time coming up with fresh ideas for the program , but the family and myself enjoyed the series anyway .	1
I 'm currently engaged in a pretty exhaustive TV viewing project , one that will see me watching just about every major Sci-fi series made in the past few decades . Unfortunately I 'm at a bad point in my project . I 've already seen almost all of the shows that I 've had reason to believe are better than average shows . I 'm now left with the dregs.Now , STARGATE ATLANTIS is hardly a `` dreg '' show . I watched the first three seasons as they were coming out , until I became disenchanted with the series , in particular with the increasingly reliance on standalone episodes and on poor character development ( i.e. , lack of character development ) . I was also concerned about the show because of the elimination from the show of Paul McGillion , who played Dr. Carson Beckett , one of the more interesting characters on the show . Also , Tori Higginson , who had played head of the Atlantis Project Dr. Elizabeth Weir for three years , was planned to depart the show . Despite the addition of Jewel Staite , who I had loved on FIREFLY , I suddenly found myself uninterested in watching the show any longer.I 'm delighted to learn that not only was Season Four not a decline in the quality of STARGATE ATLANTIS , it was actually the most interesting season of the first four of the show . Part of the reason was the replacement of Tori Higginson with Amanda Tapping , who reprised her role from SG-1 of Samantha Carter , sadly available with the ending of that show . I never disliked Higginson , but I never felt that she brought much gravitas to her character ( she also bore a disconcerting similarity to an ex-girlfriend of mind , which I personally found oddly distracting ) . But the main reasons I found myself enjoying Season Four more than the previous seasons were a significant abandonment of the standalone format and the interesting inclusion of a wraith ( Todd ) as a recurring character . In fact , apart from the third episode of the season , most of the first 13 or 14 episodes of the season were tied to the main overall arc . Only in the final third of the season did a number of standalone episodes creep back into the mix . The overall result was a dramatic improvement in the quality of the show 's narrative . Christopher Heyerdahl had played a variety of wraith characters in the first two seasons of ATLANTIS . Then in Season Three came one of the best episodes in the entire series , in which Shepperd is imprisoned with a wraith ( whom the Atlanteans later name Todd ) , who to keep from starving gradually drains Shepperd of life . The two cooperate in escaping from their prison and over the course of the final two seasons Todd would provide an interesting character , often making an odd colleague in advancing causes that were in the interests of both humans and wraiths . In one alternative future , Todd and Ronon even die a heroic death together , teaming up to kill their common enemy . I 've always had a love for characters that defy surface expectations . On BUFFY I loved Angelus for being the completely evil doppelganger of the incredibly good Angel , and then later the utterly evil Spike gradually transforming ( even before he gains a soul ) an increasingly decent character . Almost always Todd 's presence in an episode means a good episode.Also in Season Four there was an increase in the quality of the special effects . I 'm not terribly conversant on CGI , but I do know that at about the same time the special effects on just about all CGI-heavy shows dramatically improved , led by BATTLESTAR GALACTICA . I 'm assuming that there may only be one CGI software package catering to customers at this level . I imagine that the small handful of F/X companies all get the latest upgrade at about the same time . In the 1990s there was a very small market for CGI and you could tell from the way that it was used on TV that it was very pricey . Because much of it was custom , there was a dramatic difference from the way that it was used on one show and on another . There are still differences . Although they are certainly using the same software programs , on STARGATE ATLANTIS the CGI shots are very clear and crisp , featuring panoramic shots fairly distance from the objects of interest . On BATTLESTAR GALACTICA you get very complex shots . In Season Four of BSG , for instance , you might get a super close up of the Galactica , with a large hunk of the fleet in the background , the whole shot not centered from an ideal observer 's point of view , but from what you would see if you were in a spaceship very close to Galactica . In ATLANTIS the visual field is uncluttered , with no cosmic dust or anything else to impair perfect clarity of picture . On BSG there are often vast clouds of cosmic dust that causes a complex diffusion of light from a nearby nebula . Both shows feature photo realistic CGI , but the uncluttered clarity of ATLANTIS shows a different set of priorities with the more complex version of BSG ( and for the record , I much prefer the CGI on BSG , which I believe represents the highest achievement so far of what can be achieved with CGI on TV ) .All in all , I really enjoyed Season Four . I am only now getting around to watching Season Five ( the DVDs come out later this month , but friends showed me some sites that stream the individual episodes ) so I do n't know how it will compare with Season Four , but I definitely prefer Season Four more than any of the first three . I now definitely regret that I stopped watching ATLANTIS . Now that I 'm watching many shows that I have little confidence in to be any good ( I just recently managed to grit my way through ANDROMEDA and fairly soon need to force myself to watch all of LEXX , concerning which I still have n't heard anything to make me at all optimistic ) , discovering how good ATLANTIS was in the season after I gave up on it has been a very pleasant surprise .	1
Great family show . We really enjoy it . Science fiction is a family favorite . The characters are easy to relate to .	1
Great adventure series and good story lines and character development . It obviously has a big budget and the sets are gorgeous . The art direction is tops . My only criticism is that the writers are hell-bent over leather to kill off favorite main characters , i.e. , Dr Beckett , Elizabeth Weir , etc . I think this series could have run much longer had these characters been allowed to remain . The Wraith are some of the most intriguing space villains ever . Deserves the 5 stars .	1
Atlantis is a fast sexy sci-fi made for TV that exceeds all expectations . I would highly recommend to anyone into sci-fi or action adventure .	1
This is the most coolest series . It never lacks for adventure . It has suspense , drama , scary stuff that keeps you on the edge of your seat . It has some funny ones sometimes like when Dr. Mckay had another persons consciousness inside his brain that was hilarious among others . you ca n't beat this series it 's one of the best . you wo n't be disappointed . try it you 'll see .	1
All she says is `` that 's hot '' . I 'm watching the shows in chronological order , they 're pretty good . I gave it 5 stars because of Paris Hilton .	1
This is one of my favorite shows . I personally find it to to be inspirational . I have seen all of the episodes and wish they would bring it back the cliff hanger at the end of season 4 waa intense	1
I like it because the characters make me feel boring but normal . Too bad it is gone . Good thing they have the videos on line .	1
The 3rd season with Earl and his friends is as funny and crazy as the previous ones ! If you like dark & dirty humor , then here 's the show for you !	1
I 've said it before and I 'll say it again , one of the beauties of DVD is the low costs of picking up entire seasons of TV series you may have missed . Be it work related , child related or simply not having time related , it 's nice to be able to get a whole season and watch episodes back to back . Like this week 's release , MY NAME IS EARL SEASON THREE.For those of you who have yet to watch EARL , Jason Lee ( star of numerous Kevin Smith movies ) stars as Earl Hickey , a bumbling goofball whose life has consisted mostly of low end scams , thefts and mischief in general . Earl 's life changes when he scratches off a winning lottery ticket ... only to watch it fly away after being hit by a car.While recuperating , Earl has an epiphany . Karma had worked its magic on him , causing him to lose the ticket in return for all of the bad things he 's done in his life . While lying there , Earl writes up a list of all the people he has done wrong with the intention of correcting his mistakes . As he sets out to do so , the ticket finds its way back to him.Each episode of EARL features Earl and his bumbling idiot-though-lovable brother Randy ( Ethan Suplee ) trying to track down one of the people on his list and making up for whatever Earl did to them in the past . Season three starts off with Early not being able to do so since he made a big correction at the end of season two.Earl took the rap for his ex-wife Joy ( Jaimee Pressley ) and is now in prison . Fortunately for Earl , a number of the people he made mistakes with can be found there as well . And in helping them , he finds himself owing favors to others in prison , including the warden ( Craig T. Nelson ) .As Earl tries to do right , Joy feels guilty so takes Earl 's brother in with her . Talk about a conflict of interests . Joy is self centered , cheated on Earl with crab cook Darnell `` Crabman '' Turner ( Eddie Steeples ) to whom she is now married and is the biggest stereotype of trailer trash foul mouthed gorgeous redneck that you will find on film . Randy on the other hand is about as simple minded as you can get without having brain damage . The two together are like oil and water.The first half of the season is spent in prison with Randy dealing with the loss of his brother that evolves into Randy becoming a guard at the prison ( after scoring a 55 on the tests , the highest score ever ) . Joy deals with being the surrogate mother to her half sister 's baby , requiring her not to have labor induced or have any pain meds during birth . And Earl ? Earl does his best to pay back Karma.Want an example of the comedy involved here ? It 's difficult to choose from one of the many scenes that are side splittingly funny . But how about the one where Randy at the Fourth of July fair finds his head covered in cotton candy . It appears that he got so involved watching the guy make it that he got dizzy and fell into the cotton candy machine resulting in his head being covered in enough cotton candy that he ca n't see . Okay I know , it loses something in the translation but trust me , it is funny as all get out when you see it.The guests in episodes help make this show one of the funniest on TV . But it is the core players who make it worth watching week after week ... or in this case disc after disc . Jason Lee is a treasure , performing as the smart alek with attitude who is n't near as smart as he thinks he is . But in the end , Earl always sees the bright side of things and offers a touch of wisdom that makes the episode a morality fable.Pressley as Joy is hilarious . Her mouthy attitude , strong willed character and ability to see that the world actually DOES revolve around her ( at least in this trailer park ) are a joy to behold . And Suplee as Randy does an incredible feat in making a bumbler not only appealing as a sympathetic character , he makes it easy to laugh when he messes up as well.The rest of the casts are just as acceptable but it is these three that stand out . Season three made me laugh out loud more than once and on more than one occasion , I found myself having to pause the disc because I was laughing so hard . If you are in need of a laugh , you ca n't do much better than this show . This is not just one to watch , it is one to include in your personal collection .	1
I really enjoy this series . The cast is outstanding . Joy is the funniest gorgeous woman I have ever seen .	1
I love the character of Earl , along with all the other comically characters in this show . This dvd season 3 is full of comedy to watch . You never know what Earl is going to do next on his list . Each list item is a new adventure that Earl wants to fix in a positive way . :0 )	1
Funny got better as seasons went on . Whish it was still on . Like to see re make with same people jus tdo n't wait to long .	1
This is a good season . Dean has contracted to go to Hell and they 're try to find a way to keep him out . Only thing I do n't like is that the shows do n't play the lead-in without you having to go some work to get to see it . I enjoy the lead-ins to each episode . As far as I know this is the only season that does n't automatically play them . Still a great show and well worth watching .	1
I have been a fan of this show from the beginning , never missing an episode , but season 3 but put the 1st 2 seasons to shame . Jensen Ackles really got a chance to show what a great actor he is . The season begins after Dean sells his soul to save Sam and has less than a year to live . Ackles shows the broad range of emotions that one would feel knowing that they will de soon , along with terror and denial he feels about spending eternity in hell . I thought that the show would n't have anywhere to go after Dean killed the yellow eyed deamon who killed their mother and Sams girlfriend in the S2 finale , ending the storyline that had driven the show for the 1st 2 seasons . What we got with season 3 was a revitalized show that was alternated between stories that were heartbreaking , ones that kept you on the edge of your seat , and ones that made you laugh so hard you ended up crying anyway . The best episodes of the season have got to be Mystery Spot , and Ghostfacers . In Mystery Spot the Jokster Demon from season 2 returns and tourtures Sam by making him relive the same day over and over until Dean dies a horrific death at the end and the day rewides . You will laugh out loud at the creative ways the writers kill Dean over and over and see a new side of Sam when he loses his brother and realizes that he is alone for the 1st time in his life . Ghostfacers was a very different episode that brought back the bumbling ghost hunters from season 1 . Thay had decided to create their own show and collide with Dean and Sam on a hunt . The entire episode is shot with handheld cameras ( a spoof of Ghost Hunters on SciFi ) and actually has a great storyline included . If you have never watched the show before , you are missing out . This is truly one of the best shows on TV , and not just for the action and effects but amazing performances of everyone involded .	1
This is the best season so far . the first season shows how the boys get started as they hunt for their father . the find him , and hell breaks loose.the second season the hunt the demon that killed mom and dad , Sam dies , Dean sells his soul , and all hell ( litterally ) breaks loosethird season Dean has the year to live , Sam is trying to find ways to save him while demons and demigods tell him he ca n't . there is a macabre sense of humor that shows from time to time : FBI agent `` I shot the sherif '' Dean `` But you did n't shoot the deputy '' . the writing is nothing but fantasticI have n't made it to the end of the season yet , but i wanted to be number 205 in the five star catagory . this show has gone far and fast and there is no telling what will happen next , but i am loving it	1
Love this show and these dvd 's . I can never get enough supernatural . characters are convincing , script is well written , effects are great . I think its one of the best storylines I have ever seen of any show on tv . Season 5 is currently airing , its intense . so buy this and catch up !	1
This season was awesome . If the DVD release is anything like the previous 2 it will be an awesome set . The only thing I am upset with is the fact that there were only 16 parts of this season . Petty , yeah , but hey , I can be petty . The acting , writing , and episodes are pretty spot on . As for Bella , I really dont think she will be in season 4 . Well , unless she can crawl . All in all , a great show , great acting , great writing , just was missing to much for me to be totally happy . I wanted more , not less ! ! !	1
Everyone who goes to hell turns into a DEMON - to answer Dean 's unasked question . That makes cleaning them up MUCH much simpler - no grey area - from the demon 's mouth itself and of course , being a demon , Ruby then claims that she 's not like the other demons and that is why she wants to help the Winchesters . This should tell the hunters everything they need to know . : ) )	1
I love this tv series . I have all 4 seasons and will pre-order the 5th . If you love stories about supernatural things , you will love this series . lots of action and comedy .	1
shows on TV right now . I 've been loving Supernatural since the first episode and Sam/Dean have really grown in the series . From fledgling demon hunters to full on demon killers , but still at the same time keeping that thing that seperates us from them ... their humanity . Yes , he sold his soul to save his brother and that is one of the major storylines in Season 3 . As the brothers race towards finding a way to undo this pact that has been made.Not knowing what lies ahead for them it never stops the Winchester brothers from having a blast doing what their Dad trained them to do . It 's violent , dark and grown up , but at the same time its light hearted and funny to watch . Supernatural is n't like any show out there and that 's what makes me love it so much . Especially after the Season 3 epic cliffhanger , I ca n't spoil for folks that have n't seen it yet.But wow ! It 's something else and will leave you wanting Season 4 to hurry and come out on DVD asap . I love all the characters in story whether recurring ( Bobby ) or not . They all make this show something special and kudos to the writers , producers , directors , set designers , lighting effects , custome designers and everyone else work on the show . Thanks for making Supernatural just that .	1
All my favourite television shows suffered greatly from the Writer 's Strike . Not here . Supernatural Season Three has some of the best episodes yet . The groundhog day episode , the lucky rabbit 's foot , the witch coven . the sixteen episodes are more solid a season that most can do with a full 22 episode season . All in all , it is vastly superior when compared to the previous seasons.The producers included a bit more than the standard fare of special features , more to help fatten the DVD load . There was almost no need for this , given the character growth and the strength of the metaplot . We still have 5.1 audio tracks and the CGI is a heck of a lot better.The season ramps up with a finale that we 've seen coming for a year . And in the end we are left wondering just how the hell this show can keep going . But in fact , it does . And it 's storytelling at its best .	1
The third season has Sam and Dean trying to save Dean soul from hell . They have killed the yellow eyed demon and are now trying to save Dean from going to hell because he made a deal with a demon to save Sam . As we have learned from this series that this family keeps makking deals with demons and pay the price . It cost them there father life . Season was very good . They hunt down demons and other stuff . Gets slow in the middle but the ending is very well done ! A jaw dropping ending that will leave you speechless . They also have that actress who plays Maggie from the Walking Dead in it when she was younger . She was ok .	1
Love the DVD set and beautiful packaging . I love this series and have bought the entire series available . Received set when promised .	1
I took a chance and bought the first season.I had not even finished the first episode , paused the dvd player , and ordered the second season . Ca n't wait for season three !	1
This is the season when Dean dies because he has dealt Sam 's survival in the place of his own life by trading his soul with a demon , and he got a one year delay before going to hell . The whole season is going to turn around the dilemma for Sam and for Dean . Sam will resist the idea of Dean 's death and will do all he can to save him , including by dealing his own death instead , but Dean is willing to die since he-they has-have given everything to this war against the Monster , the yellow eyed demon that killed their mother , and that they supposedly killed at the end of the second season , and this war has brought them nothing as for life , enjoying life , etc . Better dying than just surviving on nothing at all , or even a dry bone . For Sam the only problem is that Dean 's death means he will be alone to go on with this fight and that frightens him though we see him operating a couple of times alone and he can manage properly.We could think then the season would be rather dull . But there you are wrong and the next season is being prepared very carefully.First it is fun to fight demons . So we have a Christmas special this year , and a real Christmas special it is with reminiscences from the past when the two little boys were alone for Christmas when their father was hunting . And neither of them both forgot to get a present , no matter how little , for the other since anyway Dean did not believe in Father Christmas and Sam was told it was all a fake , a scam , a tall tale . But the Christmas party they enjoy now with two nice little Celtic survivors who decide to have some fun for this Christmas and enjoy a good old cannibalistic feast gives quite some enlightening for to the celebration . We can wonder if the mention of the pagan and Christian sides of Christmas , and this including Christmas in the show mean something or at least are there for a reason ; other than simply a Christmas special because it was broadcast one week or two before Christmas , though the series being in real time , there is no reason why Christmas should not be present , especially since it shows how the two brothers when younger and forlorn , some could say neglected if not abandoned by their father , looked after each other including with Christmas presents that were valueless in themselves though emotionally of great value for the two boys.Second it is Reality Show TV time really and fully and they have to have their own reality show and they do with some real blood and flesh dummies who want to visit and track if not trap the ghost who is haunting the Morton House . One of the dummies will die in the adventure , the intern of course which does not count much , not one of the brains of the caper , and they will not be able to put the money in their bank though because Sam and Dean have manipulated their computers with a big magnet that erased all the programs , reformatted the hard disk in a jiffy.Third let 's think of the poor children that are chased away from the TV and this series because of the gross nature of these horrible monsters . So let 's have one full episode on fairy tales . Unluckily it is a girl in a coma who should have been unplugged from the survival equipment a long time ago by her own father , the doctor , who is reenacting in real life the fairy tales her father is telling her in her coma . The versions of Snow White and the Little Red Riding Hood are amazing and the way Sam and Dean manage to save the poor Little Red Riding Hood from the Big Bad Wolf is heroic and absolutely entertaining for very young children who will be able to learn that they must not go alone to the woods nor get in the cars of strangers.But the war against evil is serious and has little to do with a fairy tale . So let 's go back to work , boys.This year is built on the presence of two women . Bela , who could be Bella of course , is a girl whose specialty is to steal ancient objects in order to sell them for a profit . She steals anything the boys , particularly Dean , may have in their pockets . A mummified hand for example , an enchanted rabbit 's foot or the famous colt that can kill the Demon with one bullet . But that is too much , far too much and that will lead to the ferocious end of Dean being taken to hell by the Hounds of Hell and will end up , like in Hellraiser and Hellbound , two fairy tales told in many chapters and volumes by Saint Clive Barker , stretched out at the tip end of hooks tied up to chains that are going to dismember him forever and ever , each body part growing back after having been ripped off , I guess . A delicious ending for a monster hunter.A second woman , Ruby , who is a demon possessing a woman , is going to haunt the two boys because she wants to help and Sam is ready if not keen to listen and accept . But Dean and Sam refuse bluntly when she suggests to Sam to learn how to use his psychic power that can defeat Lilith , the demon who is after Dean 's life . So he ca n't in the final confrontation with the girl who was possessed by Lilith and had caused a lot of damage , who has been able to get a whole gang of demons in the neighbors all around , so that the boys are trapped when they finally come into the house where the girl is living . And at the very last minute when Sam is going to kill her he is stopped by Dean who is able to feel demons since he is minutes away from Hell . Lilith in fact is in the body of Ruby who is possessed twice and since the boys do not have the special colt they ca n't kill the spirit Lilith in Ruby . The spirit keeps them at bay till midnight when the Hounds of Hell are introduced to get Dean away . She is so powerful she can keep Sam at bay against the wall but at the last minute the spirit Lilith goes away leaving Dean in Hell , Sam beaten up against the wall and Ruby with no good sense left in her . End of the season . Let 's wait for the next one to revive the good Dean.But there is even more in this season that prepares the next season . They get rid of Gordon , the black hunter and some of his acolytes , all of them black except one . They have decided that psychic people like Sam have to be executed straight away and they have already executed a few . But Gordon will end up a vampire and Sam will behead him with a good old thick cable just as if it were a butter wire cutting up a block of soft butter . Altogether at least four Sam-hunters are eliminated , three of them black . If that is not a bias or maybe a prejudice , what is it then ? Once again with these Sam-hunters or hunters of psychic people we have a case of their nave feeling they are doing a good thing when they are only doing what seems to them the only right they can do , though they are trying to destroy the only person who can save them , save humanity.At the same time another black character is redeemed , Special Agent Victor Henricksen , who is possessed . He arrests the two boys on a lead given to him by Bela who is escaping with the Colt . But a whole gang of spirits arrive and start killing people around the police station . The demon in Victor makes him shoot the Sheriff but he is kind of forcefully taken under control by the boys who had managed to get a crucifix and had made some water holy . And the boys exorcise the demon out of him . It is then Victor is redeemed and they organize the siege and the trap that will kill all the demons inside as soon as they are trapped using an infernal contraption : the intercom of the station that broadcasts the exorcising ritual formula . Brilliant . He let the two boys go , but they will learn later with Ruby on TV that the Demon Lilith , possessing a little blonde girl ( evil can be everywhere and come in all forms ) came herself afterward to get some vengeance and she destroyed the police station into ashes on the ground killing all those inside and close to it , including of course the redeemed FBI Special Agent . Is n't that sad ? The two boys have it more and more difficult to save one person and when they do then the demon kills a dozen outsiders and innocent bystanders . But the redemption of Victor Henricksen , Special Agent by profession , is good news after all since that one was saved before being destroyed . His soul will go where it should and that is not in hell.The last remark I would like to make on this series is the great number of allusions to other classics in the field . The Shining by Stephen King is so often alluded too that I will not even specify . Come with me , Come with me , come with me , and you will know . Of course you also have Clive Barker at the end . But you have so many others like the Night of the Living Dead and in a way Michael Jackson 's Thriller , If you do have some time and energy left when you have finished watching the next three seasons I would advise you to go back and identify them all . And that 's where plagiarism is not what it used to be . Plagiarism used to make pale imitations of real stuff with tit bits stolen here and there , like Canada Dry instead of Whisky and ginger ale instead of real ale . We could of course think of the fake Frankenstein 's monster who is the doctor himself and who has become immortal by substituting in his own body the parts that are getting old . Mad scientist , mad doctor , or whatever . There are so many of them running loose and free around in the street . Are n't you afraid of going out to smoke your cancer stick in the yard ? I would be if I were you . You might be snatched by two moths from out space . Plagiarism you said ? The pleasure is not plagiarized though.I will not insist on the debate between the two brothers and the love that becomes at times dense and impressive , but also at times pathetic and our empathy for the death of the elder brother is wearing out , especially since we know there are three more seasons to go and a fourth one running right now . But the car is also less present in this season . Sam has his own , by the way , and the Impala seems to have been reduced to a gadget in these episodes . It is present for sure , but certainly less than before . I hope it is not for long because I like the machine . The car seems to be less present since their future as a pair of hunters is compromised . They own the car together and it brings them together . The car being their only real possession , something they inherited from their father and that created a unity in their family , keeping them close and bringing them from one point to another together . On the trail leading to Dean 's death , the car can not keep them together or close , because one will surely die and the other is trying to save him by following new paths to save him , sometimes in ill-advised directions.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU with the help of Ivan EVE	1
I LOVE this show , the writing and acting is edgy , fun , poignant , a full range of emotions . Season one for me was rocky the first time around , was much better the second time I watched it , even then I saw improvement with each episode . Season two shows what the show could be , and now with season three they have hit their stride ! You will not be disappointed with any season of this show .	1
I found the first season to be cool and fun but it never totally scared me or creeped me out . The 2nd , 3rd and 4th season however have had some scary , creepy , brutally violent and disturbing episodes though . No matter how many times I see someones neck snap on the show it still makes me squirm . Season 3 I think has some of the more memorable episodes . There 's nothing more messed up and disturbing than the Christmas episode . While the episode where Dean thinks a young boy of an ex is his son , is one of the funnier episodes despite some creepy scenes . I love when the kid says `` AC/DC rules ! . `` It 's also one of the more engaging seasons , as Sam races against time to find a way to get Dean out of the deal he made with a demon . Dean has one year to live according to the deal . While a hot blond demon says she can help Sam save Dean . The first season never really felt like I was watching a scary horror movie every week , but the seasons that followed have more than a few episodes that have made me feel that way .	1
This show just keeps getting better and better . All of the mythology and the season long plots are super fun to watch . And the show just keeps getting funnier without losing it 's badass-dom . I love it !	1
Hello , This show is absolutely wonderful . My entire family loves watching it and we are definately hooked . I would recommend this show to anyone.Thanks ,	1
I like the arc that this series has taken . The shortened season is a bit disappointing . However even because of it the storyline of season 3 works .	1
If you have n't watched any of the Supernatural shows you are missing out on a great show ! This show rocks ! I really hope they do n't end the show after 5 seasons like the creator keeps saying he 's going to do . You can keep supernatural stuff going forever ! I get the magazine which I highly recommend too . You learn a lot of stuff about the actors and what 's going on with the show in the book . Also has some hot posters too . The music for the show is always awesome ! I wish they could get a soundtrack out if they have n't already . I know there were some problems with that in reading the magazine . We can only hope . Once again..I highly recommend this show..you will not be disappointed !	1
This show is just one of the best 'supernatural ' aka horror related shows of all time . It 's got lots of humor and this season ; while it 's a short one it is still dynamite in terms of writing and acting . The show also has a broad streak of humour to it and that 's a good thing too . This blu ray looks great just like the rest of the series does on this format as well , It 's a dark show and this really comes out on blu ray as this was n't shot on hd film . It has plenty of extras too , thankfully the boys will be back for a seventh season in 2011-12 . And that 's more good news . I intend to buy this entire show on blu ray for my personal collection ; that 's how good this show is .	1
If it is n't , it 's pretty darn close . Supernatural just gets better and better with each passing season . I just watched the third episode of season four last night on TV and it looks like the current season is heading in the right direction . This is the only great show the CW has ever produced . Most people make fun of the network , but I bet they have n't watched this show . It has good acting ( the two leads are very likeable ) , clever and often funny writing , very good special effects , a classic rock soundtrack and a well thought out storyline . Not to mention all the different hot babes that pop up almost every week.Supernatural gets a lot of involvement from the writers and directors of the The X-Files and it shows in it 's quality . If your a horror and action fan like me , you wo n't find any show on TV better than this . Okay , maybe Dexter , but that 's more thriller than horror .	1
Season 3 of this series has long been viewed as the weakest , but looking back , it has some of the best episodes of the show 's six-year run ( so far ) . Fans may miss the intensity of the Yellowed Eyed Demon that taunted the Winchesters in Seasons 1 and 2 , but the writers more than make up for it with new ideas , humor and reflections on the show 's past . `` Mystery Spot '' and `` A Very Supernatural Christmas '' rank among the best things ever for Supernatural fans , so check this one out knowing that the writer 's strike muted what may have been a great season .	1
The Gate to Hell is closed , but not without it 's consequences . Demons are out , and now , Sam and Dean are in a race against the clock . That year Dean has is wasting away .	1
I 've seen a lot of people throw around the phrase `` a lot like Buffy andAngel '' or `` the best show sinceBuffyand Angel '' or things of that nature . Thing is , most of those shows are n't . None of them are like Angel , and the only one I 've seen so far to match Buffy isVeronica Mars . Well , get ready Angel fans , because the show has finally got something that 's come close to a worth successor . Now in its third season , Eric Kripke'sSupernaturalcontinues to show that it has mastered the balance of horror , humor , mythology , and drama that Angel was known for . But enough with the comparisons . `` Supernatural '' is a great show on its own , and this season is proof of that.The writer 's strike left a lot of shows with less than stellar material , but not this show . Each episode , even the less impressive ones , entertain to the fullest . While the overall arc and even the episode-by-episode quality is n't as great as the fantastic second season , it remains a quality show packed with emotional highs , lows , and `` Holy -- -- , I ca n't believe they just did that ! '' moments . This season sets out to tie the previous seasons up nicely , giving deserving ends to many of the old arcs . The Gordon storylin gets paid off , as does the `` Sam/Dean are wanted men '' arc . The main story of the season , however , springs from the deal that Dean made in the finale ofthe second season.Dean , to bring Sam back from the death , made a deal that his soul will be taken to Hell in one year 's time . The bulk of the season , though it maintains a somewhat episodic feel , deals with that situation , throwing the two brothers into a fight against the one force they ca n't conquer again : Death . Dean 's impending death adds such a poignancy to the season , particularly the episodes stretching from the Christmas special to the finale , that even his possible resurrection in Season Four ( it has to happen , people ) would n't take away from the emotional resonance of this arc.Overall , it 's a slight step down from the fantastic Season Two , but still a great season of a great show . Definitely one of the best shows on TV.8/10	1
Very interesting series , but would likely only make sense if you have seen the first and second seasons . Most episodes have an independent story , but there is a larger story , a thread if you will , in the backdrop which you need to be aware of to make sense of it all.I really enjoyed watching this series and ca n't wait for the release of the next season on dvd .	1
This season was wonderful . Really great characters and plots .	1
This season of Supernatural was fairly different from the others . While still carrying an episodic feel there was enough of all elements/characters recurring that it was n't exactly the same as the first two . This season also started to mix in more light hearted hurmorous episodes among the darker and intense ones , which I did n't mind as I had grown to really like what humor had previously been shown.As for the additions of the female anti heroes , I actually grew to enjoy their presence on the show . Yes , they made the Winchesters look childish but that 's actually how they have behaved previously , just no one called them out on it . Also it was pretty interesting to have demons be given more personality and learn that not all of them are completly evil and have motives.Despite that , I did find some flaws within the season . Sam and Deans arguments got even more repetitive , a couple characters from season 2 were written out of this season and the demon army did n't get mentioned that much , which was surprising as I thought total choas would 've erupted from the release of those demons.All in all , the show took some new steps that I liked and keeps it going .	1
I find this seasons very entertaining and the interactions between Sam and Dean refreshing . This is one of my favorite series that I never get tired of .	1
I am very pleased with the PQ on this BLU-RAY 3rd season of Supernatural . Howver , I can not seem to get a menu of any kind , so once I put in the disc , I have to watch all the episodes in order ... ca n't take a break or call up specific episodes ... am I unique in this ? do you other buyers share this ? - I hope the manufacturer will fix this for the other Blu-Ray seasons cause this sucks ! Otherwise , I would have rated 5 stars ...	1
Two major plotlines shape season three of Supernatural . First , Dean has sold his soul to the Crossroads Demon to save Sam 's life and has one year to live before the demon collects on the bargain . Second , the Winchesters open up a Devil 's Gate and release hundreds of demons into the world . Season three runs at a breakneck pace , largely to Dean 's impending doom . His deal is referenced in nearly every episode and you get the sense of being on a trail speeding headlong into the unknown.Two new recurring characters are introduced in season three , both of them female . First there is the demon Ruby ( Cassidy ) who becomes Sam 's guardian angel ( so to speak ) looking after him for her own reasons . Bela Talbot ( Lauren Cohan ) , sometimes ally but usually foe , appears in six episodes . Bela deals in stolen magical talismans and the like but is hiding her own dark secret.Season three is the darkest and grimmest season so far . As time ticks away , the Winchesters become more desperate and careless to find a way to free Dean from his deal . With hundreds of demons on the loose you might think that the season would become one-dimensional but that is not the case . The writers did a good job of sprinkling in side stories into the writer 's strike-shortened , 16-episode season.Among those shows that separated themselves from the main plotline were `` Bedtime Stories '' where a comatose girl brings the Brothers Grimm 's fairy tales to life and the wonderfully amusing ( and gory ) `` A Very Supernatural Christmas '' in which the boys encounter a pair of Pagan Gods disguised as average suburbanites , who are feasting ( literally ) on their neighbors.Among the best episodes of the season ( in addition to A Very Supernatural Christmas ) are `` Jus in Bello '' as the Winchesters are captured by the FBI and are jailed in a small town Colorado jail until they can be moved . The show is inspired by Fort Apache : The Bronx as dozens of demons converge upon the jail intent on killing everyone inside . For the first time we hear about the demon 's new leader , Lilith.In `` Fresh Blood '' , the Winchester-hating Gordon , also a hunter , escapes from prison and begins hunting the boys down again but has a fatal encounter with a vampire , turning him into a creature of the night.People are receiving calls from the dead loved ones in `` Long Distance Call '' . While the people are overjoyed to hear from their deceased family members , the Winchesters do not believe whatever is calling them are benevolent spirits.The season and Dean 's fate concludes with `` No Rest for the Wicked '' as the clock strikes midnight on the last night of Dean 's deal . While it was a solid season finale , it felt very rushed . The last episode would have been better served as a two-hour finale but that probably was not possible due to the strike.One of the major developments of season three was Sam 's development as a stronger character . When Dean tells Sam that they have to kill Gordon before he kills them , he surprises Dean by agreeing . Sam becomes more forceful and takes the lead on several occasions as Dean tries to prepare him for life as a solo hunter . The only disappointment about season three is that Cassidy will not be back for season four as Ruby , as her contract was just for one season . She is replaced in season four by Genevieve Cortese.While the five-disc set does not feature any audio commentaries like the first two seasons did , it does come with episode introductions by the various directors or writers . Other extras include three featurettes on special effects , Dean 's Impala , and the `` Ghostfacers episode '' along with a gag reel .	1
With the Winchesters ' dad gone , they are truly on their own except for a friend or two . All they have is each other , though I wish I could count the Impala.Some spoilers may follow ... ... .There is an even darker tone this season , if you can imagine that , with Dean having made a literal deal with the devil to save Sam by going to hell -- which he absolutely does not deserve . There is constantly a sense of time running out , with Lilith doing awful things to our boys and to others , Dean doing some crazy things because he knows what 's coming , and Sam looking at him with a blend of pity , fear , and heartbreak over his brother 's horrific fate . I wo n't soon forget the last few minutes of this season 's final episode , and I do n't want to reveal them here.Since there is a season four , I can only hope that Sam finds a way to rescue Dean.On a lighter note , the gag reel is very funny , as they always are .	1
Those Winchester boys always flirt with danger . The third season of `` Supernatural '' added some unusual twists that made for an entertaining , exceptional third season for the show.The upside -- a terrific looking Blu-ray transfer with plenty of detail , rich , dark blacks and a nice smooth look to the show . Digital imperfections are minimal and hardly noticable unless you 're really looking for them . Sound is also extremely good with hice use of the surround channels . Audio is in Dolby Digital Surround 5.1 NOT in TrueHD.The extras are the same as on the regular DVD set although this is packaged in a Blu-ray multi-disc pack as oppposed to the cardboard packaging for the regular DVD and in standard definition for the ones I 've watched so far.There 's a booklet with info about each episode and also digital download as part of this package ( although it 's not from disc but , instead , like the original DVD from iTunes.The extras are the same as the conventional It would have been nice to have the option with BDLive for this to post your own commentary tracks ( since this season does n't have them -- instead we get `` A Closer Look '' featurettes with the writers/producers/directors discussing the making of the episode , challenges they faced and inspiration for them ) or to have a commentary track with PIP but that 's a minor quibble.The only downside for season three was that we got fewer episodes because of the Writer 's Strike but that did n't prevent creator Eric Kripke along with producers/writers Sera Gamble , Ben Edlund ( creator of one of my fav cult shows `` The Tick '' ) , producer/director Kim Manners ( `` The X-Files '' ) and producer/director Robert Singer ( `` Lois and Clark '' , `` Midnight Caller '' and `` Monk '' among other projects ) from presenting one of the strongest seasons yet of the series.Dean ( Jensen Ackles ) has sold his soul to save his brother Sam ( Jared Padalecki ) from death . Sam devotes himself to try and find a way out for his brother from this binding deal and they find a new adversary -- Lillith a major , nasy demon . They find Ruby ( Katie Cassidy ) a demon WHO is surprisingly on their side and instructs Sam ( and a very reluctant Dean ) in how to fight Lillith . The Winchester boys also must face off against Bela ( Laruan Cohan ) who often allies herself with them so she can extract her own pound of flesh -- she 's a dealer in supernatural curios and makes millions doing it . The third season also finds the boys facing the seven deadly sins incarnate , being pursued by their nemesis the hunter Gordon ( Sterling K. Brown ) , being caught by the FBI ( and facing an oncoming army of dark assassins working for Lilith ) , changlings that infiltrate a neighborhood , dealing with those goofy `` ghostchasers '' who shoot a pilot for their own TV series and also manage to stir a very nasty ghost in the process.The variation on `` Groundhog Day '' took an unusual twist midway through which improved the quality of that episode . It moves from comic to sobering and quite moving as Sam copes with Dean 's fate and learns what caused them to repeat the same day over and over again.It 's a terrific set and well worth picking up on Blu-ray although I will admit that even with the reduced price , it 's still pretty steep for only 16 episodes . Still , it 's 16 strong episodes ( although there is a clinker or two most nicely mix horror , suspense and humor ) .Highly recommended . Those with little ones should be warned , however , that there is occasional bad langauge and some pretty scary situations .	1
You know something ? It really irks me when a TV Show airs on TV and barely has any time to show everyone just what it is capable of . I 've seen this happen , one too many times , with my favorite shows . Such is the case with Tremors , the TV series.Taking place after the third film in the Tremors series , the series picks up with the residents of Perfection attempting to co-exist with a graboid ( or El Blanco , as he 's affectionately called ) while also dealing with the government , real estate developers and other assorted characters . It originally aired on the SCI-FI Channel ( which is now called Sy-Fy ) in 2003 and , by all intents and purposes , was a good success but was cancelled because it did n't reach the ratings that Farscape had ( which is the show it replaced on the channel ) .Watching all thirteen episodes , I never once found an episode that did n't keep me interested until the end . I know this is going to seem like a stretch but I liked this alot more than some of the films it was derived from .	1
If you liked the sequels to Tremors then you should like this show . This show is very similar to the sequels . The same odd humor is there and it somehow seems to work.This show actually might be better than the sequels somehow , though maybe that is due to the surprise that a sci fi original series has a decent bit of merit . I would say you are definitely getting your moneys worth with this product .	1
Perfection , NV : A tiny western town of dust , sand ... and giant carnivorous graboids burrowing underground.And after three movies of battling the graboids , shriekers and ass-blasters , fans of the `` Tremors '' series finally got a ( tragically short-lived ) TV spinoff . `` Tremors : The Complete Series '' takes everything fun about the movies tacks in some conspiracies and freaky mutants -- there are a few mildly grating characters , but it 's still deliciously fun and strange.A new guy named Tyler Reed ( Victor Browne ) rolls into Perfection , intending to take over the Desert Jack Graboid Tours ... just in time for El Blanco to go on a berserk feeding frenzy.It is n't the last graboid-related problem -- Burt Gummer ( Michael Gross ) and the other Perfectionites must deal with a gourmet assblaster , a scientist training shriekers to be rescue animals , a graboid attacking a town of UFO-fanatics , graboid-rights activists who claim the Perfectionites are killing El Blanco , and a pair of mob thugs who run afoul of El Blanco and lost a very important key.And pretty soon there are even worse problems . Burt finds that a strange substance called MixMaster , leaked out of a secret laboratory , begins to infect the valley and turns the creatures into bizarre hybrids -- giant shrimps , omnivorous termite/maggots , a mineshaft `` ghost , '' or an acid-spitting reptilian plant . `` Tremors : The Complete Series '' was cancelled after only thirteen episodes , but those episodes are brilliant from beginning to end . And they have everything you 'd expect from a Tremors series -- lots of big guns , explosions , orange goop , and highly imaginative ways to kill various monsters ( including with weather balloons and tar ) .For the record : the MixMaster , the secret lab and the eccentric old scientist all seem rather hokey , but soon they mesh nicely into the existing `` Tremors '' mythology . Think a funnier , lighter `` X-Files '' vibe . And the writers do an excellent job , weaving clever plots with plenty of action , a bit of tragedy ( Cletus and Project 4-12 ) , and lots of hilarious dry humor , especially regarding Burt ( `` Somebody get up on the wrong side of the bunker today ? `` ) .Gross is , as always , brilliant as the endearing survivalist Burt -- he has to start a survival school , wrangle with a hard-headed government rep , and deal with a town of hostile UFO-fanatics . Browne is decent as the new `` everyman lead , '' and there are some solid supporting performances by Lela Lee , Marcia Strassman , Sarah Rafferty , and especially Christopher Lloyd as a wonderfully eccentric scientist-turned-desert-hermit.Two of the cast are n't quite as endearing -- J.D . Walsh 's pushy ubernerd just ends up being annoying . And Gladys Jimenez 's Rosalita is a fun character ( an ex-showgirl with a shady history ) but sometimes it feels like she 's there to run around in filmy shirts . `` Tremors : The Complete Series '' has a couple bumps in the road , but overall it 's a brilliant spinoff to the classic B-movie series . A must-see ... or if you 're a graboid , a must-eat .	1
enjoyable series with Michael Gross and a cast of cool new characters . Short lived with only about 12 episodes.Relive the Grabbers .	1
With a pretty cool subterranean monster , Tremors ( 1990 ) was a fairly successful creature flick , which spawned three subsequent films . Tremors the TV series , retains many of the original story elements , as events are mostly centered near the tiny settlement of Perfection , Nevada ( Population 12 ) , where the carnivorous sand worms known as & # 8220 ; Graboids & # 8221 ; , continue to threaten those residing in the area . For those acquainted with the movies , the TV program has a very familiar feel , as Michael Gross resumes the role of Burt Gummer , a heavily armed survivalist type , with a passion for killing the creatures who are responsible for the death of his wife.Kevin Bacon , Fred Ward , and Gross were the stars of the original movie , with Gross assuming the lead role in the sequels , as the gun happy Gummer was the ideal character to continue the battle to save Perfection . With Gross as the producer , the TV series features a stubborn group of settlers , who are determined to stay , in spite of the danger . Newcomer Tyler Reed ( Victor Browne ) arrives in Perfection , as the new owner of Desert Jack & # 8217 ; s Graboid Adventure , and is quickly integrated into the community that includes Nancy Sterngood ( Marcia Strassman ) , Rosalita Sanchez ( Gladise Jimenez ) , and storekeeper Jodi Chang ( Lela Lee ) . Melvin Plugg ( Robert Jayne ) is a developer looking to buy out the residents , while the charismatic Dean Norris ( Breaking Bad , Under the Dome ) plays W.D . Twitchell , an official from the Department of the Interior.The stories are pretty creative , with some good action scenes , as the settlers are threatened by several variations of the beast , who are attracted to the heat of the human body . In addition to head sandworm & # 8220 ; el blanco & # 8221 ; , and other Graboids , there are also & # 8220 ; shriekers & # 8221 ; , two legged creatures , that often attack in groups , and even a flying beast known as an & # 8220 ; ass-blaster & # 8221 ; . The special effects by Encore Visual Effects , and Greg Nicotero & # 8217 ; s KNB EFX Group , are often impressive , much better than you might expect for a TV program.When originally aired on the Sci Fi Channel , the 13 one hour episodes were broadcast out of order . The DVD release presents them in the order they were intended to be . The picture is full screen , with image quality being very good . If you & # 8217 ; re a fan of the Tremors franchise looking for a little more Graboid action , you will probably enjoy this short lived series , which is currently available at really low price .	1
I was late to the Stargate Party , watching them on amazon and dvd just as the series was ending , but the series has grown on me and become something of a favorite.This two part episode , which explores Sam 's relationship with the Tokra/Goa'ould that briefly inhabited her is a strong episode with good plots that add to the larger arc that Stargate slowly builds over its many seasons of mostly stand-alone episdoes . A favorite .	1
When we last left Our Heroes , they were on Apophis ' ship , facing the impending destruction and/or enslavement of everyone on Earth.So unsurprisingly , the second season of `` Stargate SG-1 '' can only get better from there on . In fact , this is when the clever , innovative sci-fi series really started to gel together , with more intriguing storylines , character arcs , and some new alien allies -- basically , it all blooms.Intending to blow up Apophis ' ship , our heroes get captured by the Jaffa and thrown in a cell -- only to be unexpectedly rescued by Bra'tac ( Tony Amendola ) , Teal'c 's old teacher . As Earth mounts a pitiful defense against the Goa'uld , SG-1 joins with a small band of rebel Jaffa to stop Apophis ' invasion -- but they may have to leave one of their number behind.Obviously the Goa'uld make things awkward throughout the season , with the second episode featuring Sam ( Amanda Tapping ) being possessed by a Goa'uld during a rescue mission -- but it seems that it 's part of a rebel Goa'uld faction called the Tok'ra . Teal'c 's ( Christopher Judge ) son is kidnapped and brainwashed , and Daniel ( Michael Shanks ) finds that his beloved wife is pregnant with Apophis ' child.And of course , SG-1 has to deal with lots of other stuff -- insectile transformations , black holes , prison planets , Native American `` spirits , '' invisible bugs , hostile alien orbs , reliving their most traumatic memories in a VR world , and time traveling to 1969 . And O'Neill ( Richard Dean Anderson ) gets an ancient repository of knowledge downloaded into his head -- and he 'll die if they ca n't reverse it . `` Stargate SG-1 '' really got into its stride in the second season -- the basic Air-Force-versus-evil-headsnakes story gets expanded out into a bunch of arcs . We get new villains , some surprising new allies , hints about the true origins of the Stargates and the human race , and corrupt factions on Earth who use the spare Stargate for evil ends.The writing gets even steadier and the alien worlds more interesting -- even stuff that sounds goofy , like the planet of singing mushroom-people , somehow works . The drama is stronger , and the sci-fi usage of the Stargate ever more creative , such as when a black hole 's gravity well keeps the gate open , and is slowly sucking Earth through the wormhole . Good , tense stuff.Of course , all the action and sci-fi is heavily tempered with comedy . Even in grim situations , there 's usually at least a few funny moments , such as Daniel 's tour of the custodial closet . And of course , the dialogue is priceless -- most of the good stuff comes from O'Neill ( `` That 's between you and your god . Oh , wait a minute ! You are your god ! That 's a problem '' ) , but Teal'c ( `` In my culture , I would be well within my rights to dismember you '' ) and the others usually get some good ones as well.Of the main cast , Amanda Tapping gets the juiciest role in this season -- Sam deals with the impending death of her father , becoming a Goa'uld host , and trying to deal with the feelings it left behind . Including a cute Tok'ra boyfriend . Yet when we see Sam 's vulnerable sides , Tapping never lets her character be anything but a strong , capable military woman.But the other actors are n't neglected -- Shanks ' Daniel grapples with the news that his wife is pregnant with Apophis ' baby , while Teal'c faces losing his entire family . Anderson is brilliant as the quirky , capable O'Neill , but he really gets brilliant when Jack 's brain is being overwritten -- he has to emote and communicate without a comprehensible word.The second season of `` Stargate SG-1 '' is where the story began to really get great , building up a series of strong story arcs , funny dialogue , and strong characters . Definitely a must-see .	1
One of the best SciFi shows out there . I Ca n't stop watching this show . If you enjoy good stuff you 'll enoy this .	1
Yea . This was the best SG-1 I 've ever seen . The only thing that would have put it over the topis if it was a tw part that had more time to develop the last 15 minutes of the show .	1
If you love your Sci-Fi as much as I do , then you & # 34 ; re in for the ride of your life with & # 34 ; Stargate SG-1 Season 2 & # 34 ; . This show never did disappoint me ! It has & # 34 ; jaw-dropping & # 34 ; action all the way through it and then some . The good guys don & # 34 ; t always win in this block buster of a hit , but when they get the upper hand and do win , you feel triumphant right with them ... ..AT HOME ! Every one of the Seasons in this series is just a part of the whole ... ..wait until you see how it comes out in the end ! Yes , I very highly recommend watching a show like & # 34 ; Stargate SG-1 Season 2 & # 34 ; . I think you may even begin to like Sci-Fi , too !	1
There have over the years been a number of great shows that followed a good first season with a great second one , including THE X-FILES , BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER , and FARSCAPE . There are a variety of reasons for this in each case . With STARGATE , it is the increasingly complex storyline about the relations between various races and cultures with access to stargates . Season One was basically your stargate-of-the-week format , each week an individual adventure with no real connections with any other episode . This is the format usually preferred by network executives , since it allows new viewers to join a show without much background . Serious fans , on the other hand , vastly prefer the complex storylines , where each week 's episode does not stand on its own , but is embedded in an ongoing saga , almost like a chapter in a huge novel . This has been and probably will continue to be an ongoing struggle between the creative talent and the network bureaucracy , though my own hope is that the success of shows like LOST will pave the way for more complex formats.Season Two does not tell a single unified story the way that FARSCAPE or BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did , but it does start spinning out a largely political struggle about the five races ( only a few that we have met by the end of the season ) aligned against the Goa'uld . The STARGATE story by the end of Season One was still a relatively simple affair ; by the end of Season Two it was already sufficiently complex as to make following the details difficult for a newcomer . But it was not only the season long arc ; the individual episodes improved in quality as well as the writers came to know the characters better . All in all , the improvement in the show from Season One was not unexpected , but it was delightful nonetheless.The only sour note in Season Two was the season finale . Most shows try to build up to a dramatic season-ending episode that both sums up everything that happened in that season and propels the show into the next one . The season finale for Season Two of STARGATE has to be one of the lamest ever devised . Most of the problem is that most of the episode was constructed of segments of previous episodes that were simply replayed . STAR TREK : THE NEXT GENERATION used this method a few times . My guess is that the latter show used it as a cheap way of creating a new episode . If 20 minutes of your air time consisted of clips from old shows , then you had dramatically lowered your operating budget . I do not know why STARGATE employed this method in the season finale , though perhaps they were over budget and had no choice but to go cheap . Nonetheless , it was a surprisingly false note in an otherwise marvelous season.As with Season One , the story largely focused on the four members of the Stargate SG-1 team , with all other character functioning as supporting characters . We are introduced to a number of characters who reappear in subsequent seasons , the most important being General Jacob Carter , Samantha 's father . His importance to the show is cemented in the two-part episode that introduces the Tok'ra , a group rebel Goa'uld opposed to the regular Goa'uld , only entering as symbiotes in willing hosts . Since Sam 's father is dying of cancer and the Tok'ra Selmak 's host is dying , he is approached to become a host , since Selmak can cure the cancer . This is also a wonderful resolution to one of my favorite moments of the season , when Sam 's father pulls strings to get her admitted to the NASA space program as a potential astronaut . Not knowing about her work with the Stargate program , he ca n't understand why she has no interest in going into outer space.All in all , this is a remarkable season for one of the finest Sci-fi series that television has seen . Although I 've never forgiven the Sci-fi channel for failing to renew FARSCAPE , keeping this fine show alive has at least partially redeemed them in my eyes .	1
Season 4 starts with dealing with the fall-out from the S3 finale . Four regular characters discover they are Cylons , Starbuck has reappeared despite last being seen in a Viper exploding above a gas giant and the fleet , having undergone a mysterious power failure , is under attack by a colossal Cylon fleet . The opening episode gives us the most impressive space battle yet as the fleet sustains heavy losses as it tries to escape . It 's not too much of a spoiler to reveal it does escape , but the victory is marred by discontent over Starbuck 's return and her claim that she has been to Earth . Adama decides to trust her and gives her a ship and crew to see if they can locate the planet , but Starbuck 's orders do not prove popular and soon she has a mutiny on her hands ... Meanwhile , the Cylons are in turmoil with the revelation that the mysterious 'Final Five ' models are in the human fleet , and it is n't long before the gulf between the models begun by events on New Caprica explodes into a fractious civil war . Back in the fleet the four Cylons try to work out what is going on whilst concealing their identities , and Apollo begins a new career in the fleet 's political system . Baltar finds himself the leader of a new cult fascinated by the Cylon 's belief in one true god , and Roslin , dealing with the return of her cancer , is confronted by the prospect of her own mortality.Season 4 raises a lot of interesting issues and the story does move forward in an intriguing manner . However , the fact that what were supposed to be two full 20-episode seasons have been compressed into one is painfully obvious at times : Apollo 's meteoric rise through the political ranks in just a few episodes and weeks of time in the series would have made more sense spread across a whole season and maybe a year of narrative time , and the Cylon Civil War happens mostly off-screen due to time and budgetary constraints . All of this really hits home in Episode 8 , 'Sine Qua Non ' , which is possibly the most confused , bemusing and borderline nonsensical episode the series has ever done , moving characters into the positions they are needed in for plot purposes by having them behave totally out of character ( Adama especially ) .However , once that painful act is accomplished , the final two episodes of the half-season return the series to a form it has n't enjoyed since early Season 3 . The controversial alliance between the humans and one of the Cylon factions raises a number of very interesting questions about the nature of both humanity and the Cylons , whilst the attack on the Hub is nothing short of breathtaking . But it is the mid-season finale , 'Revelations ' , which impresses the most . The best episode since the 'Exodus ' two-parter , it moves quickly but does n't feel rushed and is packed with moments of stunning acting ( Eddie Olmos as Adama and Michael Hogan as Tigh give us the most dramatically intense scene of the series to date , whilst Jamie Bamber delivers his best performance as Lee is put in a really difficult position ) . The final two minutes or so of the episode represent one of the most talked-about moments of television in the last year , and will ensure that everyone comes back for the second half of the season , regardless of how much they charge for it on DVD.BSG : Season 4 is not the series at its best , but it does undertake a lot of necessary plot movements to set things up for the show 's grand conclusion , and the episode 'Revelations ' justifies the price of the set by itself . Recommended . Also remember that the final episodes of BSG begin airing on 16 Jan 2009 in the USA and 20 Jan 2009 in the UK .	1
Good show , pretty similar too the org . Other than the sex change of starbuck is was along the same lines .	1
I have recommended this series to anyone that likes a good mix of action , relationships and plot twists . We watched about 3 episodes a day for weeks ! ! Loved It ! !	1
The remake of Battlestar Galactica ca n't be compared to the original , or many series for that matter , because it ended what it started . While I was disappointed in season 3 , overall I have to give the series a great rating . They finished what they started with a wild ride inbetween , season 3 drift aside . So many shows are written year to year with extensions to stories based on ratings it is nice to see a story told from beginning to end and while revolutionizing the original story in the process in depth , quality , and provoking thought . Many subjects are touched on , some left without answer as they should be and most of the others with some form of closure . I 'm thankful the series did as well as it did so that after it was over I could find the chance to watch it when the original was on when I could n't . If you are a science fiction fan then do n't be prepared to be wowed by the futuristic technology , just a great story told through a fictional setting that allows some deep questions to be presented and great entertainment enjoyed . Great Job , hope to find more nuggets out there of which I can say the same ! ! !	1
I 've seen in years . I could n't keep away from it . You do have to watch from the beginning but the acting , directing , developing storyline and soundtrack continued to be exceptional . I highly recommend this show to anyone with good taste .	1
It is BSG . Do I need to say more ? Season 4 is full of good writing and acting along with some fantastic special effect scenes .	1
To me , the story at times seemed stretched , thin and contrived . OK , so it is a fantasy , but the characters seemed to be doing things that would n't happed in their situation , things just to force a situation . Other times , I could n't follow what was going on , like you had to have read the book to get it , but without the book . Overall , I enjoyed watching the whole series , though it could have been better.Would I recomend it ? Depends on what day you ask me . It could go either way . Guess you have to watch it and see for yourself . If you are going to watch it , by all means start at the beginning or there 's no chance you will understand what is going on .	1
Epic conclusion to an epic series . BSG continued on it 's wonderful trek in the stars ( sorry for a & # 34 ; Trek & # 34 ; reference ! ) with an ending , while likely controversial amongst the BSG community , still managed to work albeit somewhat bittersweetly . I have mixed emotions on the finale , but I ca n't deny this overall series .	1
One of the best syfy series I 've seen . So good I rewatched Caprica series . Please bring it back . So much more to see .	1
I enjoyed all 4 seasons of BSG . I think this season finished off the series in a way that wrapped up most of the story lines just right	1
I 've watched this series from beginning to end about a dozen times now . It seems that I never tire of watching it .	1
This is the fourth year and it was as well written and filmed as the other three . The characters are fantastic . I think Edward Olmos has done a wonderful job in this series . I liked this series better than the original with Lorne Greene .	1
Though I was captivated by the series right from the start , as the seasons progressed it only became more engrossing . I thought that Season Three really took off , and felt that anything attempted beyond that would be a let down . Alas ! Season 4 tops them all for the depth of presented ideas , characterization , and adrenalin raising action.THough there were , I believe , 77 episodes in the series , as I approached the final episodes I felt a close friend was packing and departing from me . Then , in keeping with that feeling of loss , the final episode brought , I thought , the reality of life for us all to the center , and that is exactly how any production that & # 34 ; holds the mirror up to nature & # 34 ; as well as this series did should have ended . Magnificent ! The finest video production I have ever experienced .	1
exceptional story line , character development is outstanding . set decor and CG is on par with the best movies . really a stellar series . whether you are a fan of sci-fi or not , you need to watch this . and there are no little great men , or multi-legged tenacley things .	1
One of my favorite television series of all time along with 'The Wire'and 'Breaking Bad'.Like 'The Wire ' this is a complex , Dickensian study of human nature , not afraid of asking big questions , and meticulously plotted like agreat novel , so that each episode is a chapter in a much larger whole.Just as 'The Wire ' used the overly familiar clich & eacute ; ' world of the copshow to jump off from and shatter our preconceptions , and 'BattlestarGalactica ' uses the sci-fi series , and the idea of human versus robotwars the same way.This is thinking person 's sci fi , in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke , or Isaac Asimov . It 's about why we are how we are , what it means to bea human being , morality under constant pressure in times of war , fathers and sons , impossible loves , metaphors for modern and recentpolitics and real world situations.My wife , far from a sci-fi fan was hooked after 3 episodes , and we torethrough 5 years of shows in just a few days . It 's that addicting.The acting is all at least quite good , and some cast members areremarkable , creating characters full of depth , complexity andcontradiction . The writing is terrific , allowing the characters tochange and grow , but always in ways that make sense , creating seeminglyinexplicable conundrums , only to find surprising , sometimes shocking -but ultimately logical and satisfying - ways to explain where they'vetaken us . The special effects are generally very impressive for TV , even if they 're not really why you watch this show.It also has some of the most tense episodes of television I 've everseen , and some of the season enders left me completely wrung out andblown away . I was sad to get to the last episode , just as one is sad tofinish a great book.Things definitely get a little stranger in Season 4 . To some theshow went a little of the rails . For me it took another step intobrave and twisted plot turns that confounded expectations inthe best way . I loved this show for the chances it took withstory , with character , with ideas and with style , and season 4might the the pinnacle of that .	1
I almost gave up on this show afeter Season 3 , which I thought it was not bad by itself , but simply inferior to the amazing Seasons 1 and 2.Anyway , people sometimes tend to demand that each single episode of a TV show be a master-piece of film making . This is simply not possible . The shooting and writing schedule is frenetic , they are exposed to ratings , to threat of being cancelled , etc , etc . the producers of a show ( usually ) try do do their best.Of course , sometimes there is sloppy and lazy writing , but I think this is more the xception than the rule.In this season , sometimes I got pissed with some cheap `` matrix-sequel style '' riddles and philosophy , but other than this ( and KAte Sackhoff as Starbuck - I simply thins she is so unpleasant and such a weak actress that the Starbuck character is obnoxious sometimes ) it was a superior season than season 3 .	1
This very intelligent and entertaining series is finally coming to an end . I , for one , am caught up in the game : Who 's the last Cylon ? I do n't think that the series creators are going to go for the clich & eacute ; `` it 's the Admiral or the President '' , but for the life of me , I do n't know who that leaves.The entire series has been an adventure that parallels our current political atmosphere but translates it into a sci-fi journey . This is what this genre does best - it holds up the fun house mirror for us to view ourselves in a distorted perspective.The mood of BSG tends to be quite `` Film Noir '' . When I looked up a definition in Wikipedia I found the following : '' Film noir is often described as essentially pessimistic . The noir stories that are regarded as most characteristic tell of people trapped in unwanted situations ( which , in general , they did not cause but are responsible for exacerbating ) , striving against random , uncaring fate , and frequently doomed . The movies are seen as depicting a world that is inherently corrupt . Classic film noir has been associated by many critics with the American social landscape of the era . `` I thought this was a pretty good account of all seasons of BSG . Another film noir factor to take into account is the general moral ambiguity . It seems that the Cylons are the ones who are now taking the moral high ground and seem to be more open to weighing the pros and cons of each ethical decision . They are becoming the principled ones and the humans have adapted an ethos of `` if it 's different , it 's bad ! '' and not to be trusted . Lifelong friendships are dismissed in an instant if this person ( entity ) turns out to be a `` toaster '' .This may be a foolish question but I wonder if the Earth they found is real ? I 'm going to miss this show . The acting , writing , directing , music and all other aspects are a tribute to each and every person connected with this fine series ... bg	1
Just an amazing ending , nothing in televison history even comes close to this conclusion . It 's so great it leaves you wanting 10 seasons more .	1
Season 4 of the Battlestar Galactica remake begins with a bang and ends with a whimper . The first episode begins with Starbucks ' miraculous return to the fleet . Quickly we see the murder of Cally , the growing friendship of Galen and Balter , Baltar 's admission of guilt over the destruction of the colonies , and Baltar 's growing cult-like status . The final episode ends with a whimper as the fleet reaches Earth , only to discover that it has been ravaged by nuclear war . Taken together , this season probably has more major events packed into such few episodes than any of the other episodes . It is quite a testimony to the skills and abilities of the writers and directors . Along the way , we have several great space battles , several key betrayals , and an illicit relationship between Tigh and a Six model . This is a great viewing experience that combines drama , comedy , suspense , action and fantasy . But this is not what makes this a great series . No , what makes this a great series are the well-crafted illusions to mythology , religion and history . First , the voyage to Earth parallels the spread of monotheism within the fleet led by Baltar , a former farmer from a poor colony who is ashamed of his past and heritage . Second , we have a growing disenchantment with the leadership of the fleet as represented by President Roslin and Admiral Adama . Together , they blends Moses 's trek thru the desert with the gradual conversion of the Roman Empire from paganism to Christianity . Then there is the return of Starbuck , a resurrection by any definition of the word , and her guidance fo the fleet to Earth . And most importantly , Hera , the union of human and cylon , and the visions that surround her by both humans and cylons . All told , quite a show and probably the year 's best TV series .	1
Fascinating serial that has more twists and turns than an arthritic snake . It has a constantly changing story line and a very moral base to it and perhaps that is what appeals to me most -- the integration of moral considerations in a changing universe . And yet it is not overly moral either with plenty of blood and gore to satisfy that side of the equation .	1
The long odyssey of the remnants of the human race comes gradually to a head in the first part of BSG 's final season . The wear and tear is starting to show in both ship and crew . Edgy , gritty as hell and operatic in scope , this sets the bar for outer space SF well into the troposphere . There may never be another series or movie to compare . I look forward to owning the entire series and watching it again , from start to finish . Amazing stuff.That said , I do think the producers are screwing us with this split season approach ... .	1
Warning ! Many , many , many spoilers below . Do NOT read if you want to stay spoiler free.In watching Season 4.0 of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ( when Universal released the first ten episodes of Season Two of BSG at the end of a near six month hiatus they dubbed the first half of the season 2.0 and the second half 2.5 ; that has been continued with 4.0 and 4.5 ) , I kept thinking of soemthing one of the world 's best known self-proclaimed BSG fiends , Joss Whedon , once said . Sometimes you have to give fans what they need rather than what they want . Not everything that happened in Season 4.0 was what any of us wanted , but in the end , I think we 'll find that we got what we needed . ( BTW , Ron Moore asked Joss to direct an episode of BSG and was more than willing to do so , but preparation for his new series DOLLHOUSE , which will pair BUFFY and ANGEL alumna Eliza Dushku with BSG alumnus Tahmoh Penikett , placed demands on him that prevented him from being able to do so . Part of me deeply regrets this , because my two favorite shows of all time are BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER . As Jack White says , `` Oh well , oh well , oh well . `` ) No show in the history of TV has had more truly great and shocking endings than BSG . BUFFY had two season finales that were as good as any I 've seen ( Seasons Two and Five -- the climatic scene from the Season Five finale , `` The Gift , '' was recently voted in landslide fashion on the official Emmy 2008 website as the Most Memorable Moment in TV history ) , but because Joss Whedon was always and wisely terrified of the cancellation of his shows , he would not end any season on a cliffhanger . Ron Moore and David Eick have bravely ended each season with some of the greatest cliffhangers in TV history . My favorite may have been the end of Season Three : the Cylon fleet bearing down on the Colonials , who will not be able to engage their FTL ( faster-than-light ) engines for several minutes , the sitar-drive version of Bob Dylan 's `` All Along the Watchtower '' playing in the background . Apollo goes to investigate a mysterious bogey only to discover the deceased Starbuck flying a Viper as shiney and clean as the day it came off the assembly line . She comforts him with the words , `` It 's going to be alright . I 've been to earth . And I 'm going to take us there . '' Then the breathtaking CGI shot of a `` camera '' pulling back over the two Vipers , through the Colonial fleet , through the Cylon fleet , through the nebula , then across the universe until it comes to rest on a beautiful blue planet showing the continent of North America basking in the sun . It was a jaw dropping moment and the question was whether Season Four could pick up successfully at that moment.Well , of course it could . And did . After learning the identity of four members of the Final Five we knew that the final season would primarily deal with two major questions : 1 ) Who is the final Cylon ? and 2 ) Will they reach earth and what will they find there if they do ? I think everyone would have put money on the first question being answered first and the second one in the final episode of the series . But shockingly the second question was answered first , and in the finale seconds of the final episode before the hiatus.Much of 4.0 focused on Starbuck striving to convince Adama and everyone else that whe was not a Cylon and that she really did know the way to earth . Though many harbor deep suspicions , in the end Starbuck is able to persuade the fleet to go where she believes earth can be found . In an absolutely brilliant moment , she succeeds . I had managed to avoid spoilers ( in fact , though I was a pretty well known poster on the official BSG board on Scifi.com , I stopped visiting there in order to avoid spoilers ) so I had absolutely no idea that they were going to reach earth so much earlier than anyone had assumed . Indeed , even in interviews leading up to the episode , Ron Moore indicated that they would get to earth before the end of the series , not giving any clues that in fact it would be in the very next episode . So a viewer 's first shock is that they found earth at all . Even as the Raptors and other atmospheric spacecraft descend to the earth 's surface , another shock takes over . In one of the great one shots I 've ever seen on TV , a camera focuses in close on the bandaged hand of Adama , scooping up liveless soil , a Geiger counter registering high levels of radioactivity . The camera raises up slowly to register the blank expressions of Adama and , standing beside him , Roslin , who utters the shot 's lone word , `` Earth . '' The model 3 Cylon known as D'Anna walks up beside them , horror on her face , as Sharon and Helo walk behind them . The camera then loosely follows the two of them as they walk all the way to the far right , stopping along the way to register the reactions of the other major surviving characters on the show . First Cylons Anders and Tory , the same expression of despair on their faces . Then cutting in front of them Apollo , who walks further to reveal Caprica Six in the background , Baltar sitting in the foreground , and Tyrol behind her . Six walks past Dee in the foreground over to Colonel Tigh , lightly touching his arm . Past Apollo , who has stopped walking , past Leoben , briefly back to Sharon and Helo who continue walking , to Starbuck , who turns and walks over to where they have stopped . The camera continues on its own to reveal a body of water and a destroyed bridge , ruins everywhere . It is a scene that will remind any viewer strongly of the end of PLANET OF THE APES . I have to add that there is no hint that this was New York or any other city . Though one ruin clearly features a large carved cross , apparently denoting a Christian building of some sort , there are no other signs of what they have found . Many assume that the bridge is the Brooklyn Bridge , but anyone even minimally familiar with that bridge 's design knows that it is not . Some argue that it is n't really earth , but I just do n't think that argument holds water.4.0 was not very happy . These were sad , upsetting , bleak , despairing episodes . But I truly believe that they were what we needed and not what we wanted . Most of us would have had more fighting , more combat , more huge space battles . But we would n't have broken new ground or challenged its viewers . The mark of a great show is that it takes you to places that you could n't expect existed . Most of us have impoverished imaginations and as a result think in small , hackneyed ways . I was n't always happy with Season Four . My favorite character is Sharon Agathon and on various boards I speculated that her story had largely ended in Season Three , after the last major question ( What would she do when she found out that Hera was alive and that Roslin had stolen her from Sharon ? ) was answered ( Answer : She would do whatever she needed to get back Hera , but nothing to harm Roslin. ) . Season Four showed her as an anti-Cylon zealot , even assassinating a Six who was striving to create some sort of working arrangement with the humans . We got fewer humorous encounters between Six and Baltar . We did n't get to visit interesting planets . Happy times were not had . But as I 've reflected back over the show as a whole , I have been amazed at the astonishing journey that it has taken us on . In fact , the show in 4.0 even departed from so much of the political allegory that dominated the first two and a half seasons.We are now set up for the final ten episodes of a show that has completely redescribed what it is possible to do within the confines of a science fiction show . In part it did this by refusing to succumb to a single one of the tried and true conventions of the genre . And it did this by never repeating itself . Along with another show that was launched in 2004 , LOST , it has helped create a new kind of television narrative : the very long story . Other shows had attempted this to some degree . Each season of BUFFY told a self-contained story , with some elements that carried over from one season to the next . THE X-FILES spent several seasons on the alien colonization story ( though more than half of each season 's episodes were standalone episodes ) . BABYLON 5 had elements that took the first four seasons to resolve ( though there were a number of reasons the narrative was n't as successful as it should have been ) . But LOST and BSG will be the first two that will have told a single story through the course of the show with a beginning , middle , and an end . Other shows are following in this path . I think it makes for tremendous television , even if it does n't always pull in a lot of viewers.Finally , I 'd like to engage in a little speculation . I 've made a couple of predictions before . Both of them turned out correct , even if one of them was only partially correct . I think I was the first person on the Internet to predict how Sharon would get Hera ; because I knew they had only 42 minutes for Sharon to somehow get to the Cylon basestar and back with Hera , I predicted that someone would kill her ( with the Cylon prohibition of suicide , I knew she would kill herself ) and that she would grab Hera and return to the Colonial fleet , possibly on a heavy raider . Well , I did n't know they had a Raptor on board , but I got close . ( I know I was the first to post this theory on the official board and it only appeared elsewhere after that ) . The second prediction was that Tyrol was one of the Final Five . What I got wrong was that three others would also be revealed . My third prediction has been a short list of the final Cylon . I do n't have room to give all of my reasons for my theory , but it hinges on a passage in a book that Roslin reads aloud to Adama on the Temple of the Five in `` The Eye of Jupiter . '' She reads , `` The five pillars represent the five priests who are devoted to the one whose name can not be na -- '' and she is cut off by Adama , who says , `` Laura . '' I argue that this is a literary convention in which the one whose name can not be named is indirectly revealed . Basically , I believe the key to the Final Five is that they are crucial to helping Roslin lead the survivors to earth . Tigh , Tyrol , Tory , and Anders all beautiful fit this . My other argument is that the final cylon could not have been in a position to respond to the song that the other four heard at the end of Season Four . Using these two , I came up with the short list of Billy , Kat , and Elosha . Of the three , Billy was closest to Roslin and he remains my first choice . Elosha was not , I thought , a sufficiently important character to satisfy the requirements of the final cylon . Kat slightly fits the bill , and Starbuck 's talking to her photo just before they get to earth strengthens her case . I still think the final Cylon is most likely Billy . But unless Ron Moore has flat out been lying , neither Adama ( especially not Zak ) nor Starbuck is the final Cylon . We 'll see if my third and final prediction is correct or not.But there is no question that BSG has helped redefine what it is possible to do on a television series . It has taken narrative to new levels , has introduced a moral and spiritual darkness that surpasses even THE SOPRANOS , and has shown that you can completely redefine an other moribund genre , making Science Fiction that speaks more to adults than the teenagers . I ca n't wait for the final ten episodes.Edit -- 1/18/09 -- Well , I was wrong on the final Cylon ( if , that is , Tigh is correct ) . I was half right in my reasoning . I was convinced that it could n't be someone who was with the fleet and that they were most likely dead . But I was equally confident that they were supporters of Laura Roslin . To that degree the person currently revealed as the final Cylon does n't make a lot of sense . But one of the things about being the executive producers is that things in the end do n't have to make a lot of sense . That said , the Season 4.5 opener was a stunning episode in many , many ways , and further proof of just how great this show is .	1
Well , this is a fantastic Blu-Ray set . It includes the movie `` Razor '' in addition to the complete season 4 . There are a couple of Blu-Ray only features that made the upgrade especially worth it for me . Unfortunately , it 's missing `` The Face of the Enemy '' webisodes , which is unacceptable.Basically there are ten webisodes , that if you combine together form the running time of almost an entire episode . They explain the evolution of a character that leads to a very important arc in the main series , and answer a question already raised in the series regarding an unheard `` whisper . '' Although the writing in `` The Face of the Enemy '' kind of sucks , it drives me batty to have them missing here . Just because they are n't the best episodes does n't mean we do n't want them . They are on the 2013 release in Japan ( in 1080i ) , so there 's really no excuse.As far as the ending goes ... I did n't care for it . I feel like they made the viewers a few promises they could n't keep , but the series is still great , so I 'm not gon na cry about it . Solid recommendation , I just wish Universal Home Video would get their act together . Their overseas counterparts are *always* outdoing them .	1
finish a story , and do it well , very rarely . This show did that , and with style , it should be considered the standard .	1
Do n't miss this series . This is as good as it gets . Strong characters , great fx , plenty of complicated plot . See it .	1
With such a strong ending -- sad to see one of the best shows end , but thanks for the ride ! If you have n't seen this , watch it from the beginning -- you 'll be glad you did .	1
I 've finished watching all four seasons and have tried to figure out what made this series so watchable . I could n't get enough . The overall plot was basically incomprehensible , there were so many holes and so much illogic that it should have been awful -- but it was n't . I 've watched other popular sci-fi shows , and found them blah after a few episodes , the characters one dimensional , the story arc predicatble . I was watching a discussion of the BSG show with Ron Moore , and something he said finally clicked : we learn more from our heroes by their flaws than their virtues . The characters on BSG are VERY flawed -- they 're just plain wrong a lot , they use their positions for personal purposes , they ca n't figure out who they really love , they shift allegiances according to what serves the moment -- and that makes them immensely intriguing . Is Baltar a saint or a devil ? How about Roslin -- does the end justify the means ? Is Adama a hypocrit ? What the frakk is wrong with Starbuck ? And how can you not forgive Lee for being such a goody-two shoes when he had come through the battle of the bulge ? The scene with Apollo and Starbuck in the ring in priceless -- what better way to prove how much you love someone than by knocking their teeth out . Not that anybody 's teeth every get knocked out , fortunately . It 's one of those seemingly illogical things , that after as many blows to the jaw as they all take , any of them have any front teeth at all . And what 's with the way the sixes dress ? I mean , really , put some clothes on . The heat ca n't be all that good in those big drafty ships . So , in sum , all the plot holes and illogical points are so overpowered by the amazing acting and perfect casting and great character development and endless surpises and REALLY BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE that you HAVE to keep watching . When Baltar says things like , `` I never really belonged to you , you appropriated me '' or `` You 're right . I would n't trust me either '' you want to cheer the writers . The subtlety of that is something few shows can achieve . And then , of course , there 's the HUGE pay-off at the end . Not many series can boast that . Most dribble away into some underwhelming resolution that seems to be there just because the show has to end somehow . I REALLY want more -- not a prequel . I want to know what happens next -- how come only one dna line makes the cut ? And really ? People as social ( or anti-social ) as Adama and Chief would choose human isolation ? You ca n't even be anti-social if you do n't have something to be anti TO . So please , I wan na know how it all works out for the next 150,000 years ... or at least the next 148,000 of them.More , please .	1
I love the battlestar galactica seasons and this seasons was more spectacular than the last . Full of action and storylines	1
This is one awesome show , each time a eposide ended had to start the next . If you liked the original , you 'll love this one .	1
`` Battlestar Galactica : Season 4 '' is very much in keeping with the rest of the series . It has a few very good episodes but many episodes are quite tedious . I do not understand why this series gets so much praise , when the humans are constantly depressed and the Cylons are endlessly babbling . I 'm happy that so many people enjoy the show , and when it 's at its best , it is wonderful , but its relentless showcase of despondency is a bit much . Reviewed 4/5/2009 after watching on DVD .	1
I would give it 10 stars if I could . Loved the music , the characters and the plot line . It lasted 4 seasons as it had an end point it was working towards so it could n't last any longer.It got a bit convoluted at times but pretty much sorted itself out in the end . A few questions were left unanswered in my mind but , oh , well.I had to limit myself to only viewing a few episodes at a ltime or I would have watched them all at once and been lost to my family for a week or two . As it was I watched 3 or 4 in a row . Hated to turn it off to eat or sleep . The background noises of the ship was such an amazing addition . Sort of like watching a move filmed in a submarine . Creaking and groaning . And how solid the doors to the rooms were , again like the seals in a submarine . Nothing like the flat and sterile scenes of Star Trek.This is not a mans only series . Lots of strong women characers doing things I can only dream of doing and doing better than a man.I 'm thinking of putting it on my Chrstmas list for next year.So watch a few episodes yourself and see if you do n't get hooked and add the word & # 34 ; frak & # 34 ; to your vocabulary .	1
Some spoilers ... ... This show remains as dark , gripping , and challenging as ever . The Cylon rebels break away from the others , while the humans still struggle with the fact that any one of them could be revealed to be a Cylon -- at any time . The cast gives powerful performances all around , and the revelation to Adama by a certain person was wrenching to watch . Olmos showed the anguish and shock that any one of us would feel upon learning that a trusted confidante was never a human at all.Richard Hatch , from the original series , is great with his delivery and timing . He should be given more employment . James Callis as Baltar leads us into uncharted territory as he becomes a religious cult leader , while Mary McDonnell shows how hard it is to maintain grace and hope while battling cancer.Then they get where they wanted to go , and ... .oh , I ca n't tell you , but of course they had to leave us hanging there !	1
After two seasons of slowly developing its character-based drama , `` Battlestar Galactica '' come on strong in Season 3 with more intensity . The same can be said for this first half of Season 4 , as literally every single episode crackles with dramatic development , action , and even philosophy.I wo n't give away any major spoilers here , but this season begins with the aftermath of the Gaius Baltar ( James Callis ) trial and the miraculous `` return '' of Kara `` Starbuck '' Thrace ( Katee Sackhoff ) . From there , it also deals with the revelation of four of the final five Cylons ( and how they deal with that knowledge ) , as well as a potential human/cylon alliance in order to find Earth . There is so much going on this season both plot-wise & character-wise that I could write for paragraphs and still not cover it all ! This set also ends with a cliffhanger that you will NEVER see coming ( even if you know it is indeed coming ) .Again , mirroring what I liked about the third season of this show , the beginning of this effort is just as much about the Cylons as it is about the humans . To me , the human/Cylon relationship has always been the backbone of this show , and this season gets off to a great start by exploring that relationship in even greater depth.Of course , as per usual , the acting and character drama is also incredible . Each member of the large ensemble cast is given a juicy role ( no one is left out ) , while the show even proves it can survive for a few episodes without a strong Admiral Adama ( Edward James Olmos ) presence . We 're talking LOST-like character progression ( the highest compliment I can give a TV show ) .Overall , this beginning half of Season 4 continues the strong BSG tradition of crafting intense , character-driven drama that truly makes you care about the participants . You might as well have 4.5 ready , because you wo n't want to wait to see what happens next !	1
Definitely one of the best shows that are around . Love the dry humor and the adaptability of all the heroes . Never saw Donovan before so he was a very pleasant surprise . Gabrielle Anwar is simply wonderful as Fiona - her cheerful bloodthirstiness has something rather innocent in it and thus adds to the general merriment . Sam , Mom and the little brother are also good ( the brother is definitely better clean shaved ) .It would be interesting to see where all the relationships go in the second season - and hope for more !	1
This show is fast paced and fun . I love the `` helping the little guy '' angle and the quick humor in every episode .	1
Great for background noise . keeps you interested and entertained yet you do not have to sit and watch the whole thing .	1
Having watched every episode of Burn Notice , my wife and I , along with several friends and family members , are completely hooked.In a way this show reminds me of another series we thoroughly enjoyed 20 years ago , Stingray . Although Stingray was completely under the radar , and Michael is always blip number one , there are still similarities . Michael 's skill at going undercover and improvising a role comes to mind . Also , Stingray 's stories were a trade in 'favors ' , and Michael and friends often help someone as a favor , or for only expenses . Both had secretive but evidently quite successful histories in secret ops.One of the things I enjoy most about Burn Notice are the little 'spy tips ' that grace every show . Some of them make sense , some are utter nonsense , and some of them I 'm not too sure about , but they 're all fun.Another thing I like about it is the way in which the 'bad guys ' often come to grief in very satisfying , often funny ways . The late 2nd season episode where Michael foils a bank robbery is hilarious.Whether it makes sense all the time or not , obviously the writers of this show care , and are putting a good effort into each script . That makes up for any sins and makes for a quite entertaining show.Season One obviously contains the `` origin story '' in the pilot , which is a big advantage . However , this series is remarkably consistent throughout its run , and all the episodes are of very consistent quality as well . Although there have been a few stand out shows that I particularly enjoyed , I ca n't really think of any `` stinkers '' that I had to overlook . USA Network just keeps coming out with many of the most entertaining shows on TV over the last few years , and Burn Notice is part of that group .	1
What makes this series great is n't just the excellent writing , but the cast . Sure production values , directing , and F/X are wonderful as well , but it is the cast that truly makes this show work . The chemistry between Jeffrey Donovan , Gabrielle Anwar , Bruce Campbell , and Sharon Gless makes it worth watching alone . I have always enjoyed spy type TV series , but this is an interesting approach to it . An agent is retired , given a burn notice , while he is still quite young and capable . Him figuring out why is the main focus . Add in the fact his friends and family are trying to find him work which is mostly of a detective nature and you have a good mix of action and comedy . I highly recommend it , especially if you are a fan of series like Magnum PI . Though `` Burn Notice '' is a bit more `` MacGyver '' -ish than Magnum PI , you still see the similarity.I could n't help but make some comparisons to that series with a handsome hero narrating his thoughts , good dramatic stories , interesting and often resourceful friends , beautiful locations , and some very funny comedy thrown in at the right times . I think Donovan is perfect for the role . I recall when I saw CSI the first season why William Petersen was so good in the role . If you had seen him in `` Manhunter '' several years prior it was like the role was designed for him . I swear this role in `` Burn Notice '' is designed for Jeffrey Donovan . Do n't miss the best new series of 2007 . You can bet I pre-ordered it . The box is mediocre but the DVDs are excellent . I am a little disappointed there were not more episodes , but the price is quite reasonable . I highly recommend this series and give thanks to USA channel for having the intelligence to properly support it unlike some of the other major networks that often fail good TV series .	1
Fellini it ai n't , but Burn Notice is a well made entertainment with watchable people and a snarky sense of humor . The story is about a fired American spy , who seems to have some lethal enemies up high , but the episodes are - well - episodic , as he takes on various violent jobs to make a living while trying to find out who did what to him in DC . In a sense , Burn Notice is a story about families - Donovan , his ex-girlfriend ( Gabrielle Anwar - very watchable and funny ) , and his best friend making up one family , the members of whom are always there for each other , though not without the resentments and egos of real family . In addition , Donovan also has a `` real '' family with whom he has issues - an annoying mother ( Sharon Gless ) and an irresponsible brother ( whose character actually seems to develop over time . ) The acting ranges from appropriately deadpan ( the lead actor , Jeffrey Donovan , who is good here and was even better in the much mourned Touching Evil ) to appropriately over-the-top ( various villains . ) Two objections : 1 . The story is set in Miami , but there are no African-Americans . Why not ? and 2 : Why is Sharon Gless both under-used and confined to one whining note ? She 's a good actress and could do so much more . Still , all in all , a winner in the light entertainment mode - light years better than so-called reality TV .	1
Unfortunately , most action/mystery/suspense shows that are popular these days take the form of grim police procedurals . I guess a lot of people like them , but my wife and I do n't . The newspapers , news sites and TV news and reality in general provide enough grimness to fill our daily needs . That 's why we 've missed mystery shows with some humor , flair and even romance -- shows like Remington Steele , Magnum PI , Moonlighting , Moon Over Miami , Buddy Faro , Seeing Things , the so-awful-it's-almost-good Acapulco HEAT etc . The only recent show that fits this bill that we follow regularly is Monk . So when I read a few encouraging reviews of Burn Notice ( like Monk , on the USA Network ) we checked it out via Netflix . Bingo ! It has clever capers . Plenty of laughs . A wry , self-deprecating hero . A gorgeous but dangerous love interest . A semi-goofy sidekick . And the color and danger and tropical heat of Miami Beach . What 's not to love ? If you like suspense with a smile , Burn Notice is the show for you .	1
THIS is the series that started it all for our family ! We love the shots of Miami , we love the banter between 'team Michael & # 34 ; and we especially love the 'over voice ' as Michael explains what 's happening !	1
was fun to watch and my wife and I enjoyed it ! What more can I say -- anything rather than watch 643,588 drug commercials between the actual 30 minutes of show . Do all men who watch this have erectile disfunction - that sure seems to be the audience they are targeting .	1
Entertaining , action-paced , if a bit low on credibility . The Miami landscape is a definite plus .	1
Burn Notice - Season OneEnjoyed the series , enjoy it more without the commercials .	1
Michael Westen : `` Most people would be thrilled to be dumped in Miami . Sadly , I am not most people ... I 've never found a good way to hide a gun in a bathing suit . `` When you 're a spy , getting a burn notice means that you 've been officially deemed unreliable by your covert brethren , and that you 're no longer wanted in the cloak-and-dagger community . Always good at rubbing people the wrong way , international spy Michael Westen ( Jeffrey Donovan , TOUCHING EVIL ) is in Nigeria brokering a deal with a terrorist when he learns of his burn notice over a cell phone . Barely skedaddling out of Nigeria with his life , Michael somehow finds himself stranded in his hometown of Miami , with his finances frozen , his options about nil , and former friends and colleagues keeping far , far away.Michael decides to lay low for a while and , because a man has just got to make a living somehow , becomes a makeshift private investigator and troubleshooter . But , even as he takes on the criminal elements in Miami , his overriding objective remains finding out why he was blacklisted . But it 's hard going as , mysteriously , no one will tell him anything . Meanwhile , various spooks are monitoring his every move . So , something 's going on ... Yup , I dig this show . The USA Network 's BURN NOTICE proved to be one of the more pleasant surprises of 2007 . Not having seen a lot of Jeffrey Donovan 's work , I 'm still quickly becoming a fan . He brings a wry , deadpan charm to the show , and he looks like there 's stuff just churning underneath his character 's self-contained exterior . And it 's exactly because of this distant persona that I appreciate Michael Westen providing a very quotable , `` been there , done that '' voice-over narration . This device not only engages us further but also makes us privy to Westen 's cynical inner musings , as well as giving us frequently amusing first hand advice on various stuff . No , it 's not exactly life lessons that he 's imparting . Rather , it 's more of a tutorial on espionage and breaking heads . Y'know , the cool stuff . For example , Westen , on fighting : `` You do n't want to break the little bones in your hands , so you look for a bathroom , which has plenty of hard edges and surfaces . '' On guns : `` Guns make you stupid . Better to fight your wars with duct tape . Duck tape makes you smart . '' Or on setting traps : `` A good trap does n't scare people , it makes them curious . '' And , so on and et cetera . Dude 's often wry observations make my day . Someone should put together a quotation book , because I 'd shell out.Chemistry rears its beautiful head . Donovan 's supporting cast is very good , and two of them are very engaging . Westen 's tiny circle of trust consists of three folks . There 's his sexy and fiery Irish ex-girlfriend Fiona ( gorgeous Brit , Gabrielle Anwar ) . Fi is an ex-IRA agent and into mayhem and violence , and , of her , Westen unequivocably states , `` I am NOT hooking up with her . I need her for tactical support . '' ( sure , sure ) . Slovenly Sam Axe ( Bruce Campbell , who 's casually let himself go ) is Westen 's long-time buddy and a semi-retired spy . Now Sam helps Westen out on cases , and vice versa . And then there 's Westen 's irritating dragon of a mother , Madeline ( Sharon Gless , CAGNEY & LACEY ) , who is a champion emotional blackmailer . Gless is effective at channeling Doris Roberts from EVERYBODY LOVES RAYMOND . So if you 're hating on Gless 's character , then she 's just being brilliant.BURN NOTICE , with its first season 's 12 episodes , brings it with suspense and some action , and with humor and a rocky romance , even if I could do without the fractured family stuff . It 's a well-done lighthearted spy & crime drama , with an element of the sting , and it left me craving for more episodes . Jeffrey Donovan might just have found his breakout role in the glib and uber capable but emotionally detached Michael Westen . Certainly , he makes for a compelling character . I enjoy how he uses his Special Ops training to satisfyingly one-up Miami 's teeming lowlifes . And , all along , there 's slow progress being made on the whole burn notice arc . The writing is smart , the production values are terrific . And it does n't hurt that BURN NOTICE is filmed in sun-drenched , visually arresting Miami , so give the show some style points . I definitely do n't have anything against babes and bikinis and margaritas and martinis.Michael Westen , who dislikes his hometown , might beg to differ , but , hey , bienvenido a Miami . And bring on Season 2 .	1
This series has a variety of plots , and the chemistry works well among all the characters . It is fast moving with a lot of action , yet it keeps its humanity . The main characters are all fascinating because they 've previously been clandestine agents and have many tricks of their trade from which to draw . The female lead character is very strong and strong-willed with her own mind and actions , which is very refreshing . She also has a good heart , along with the other 2 male leads , so they find themselves constantly helping other people instead of sticking to their own agendas . All 3 three main charcters are fearless and capable of extracting themselves from dangerous situations and people . The violence is not graphic and not overdone . Recommend Seasons 1 - 4 . Have n't seen 5 yet . Have a good day , everyone .	1
loved the first season very , very much , especially Sam . lots of excitement and intrigue . this was the very best season	1
This is a great show with a great cast , and it immediately can count itself amongst USA network classics like Monk and MacGyver . A funny , down to earth intelligence officer/agent has been `` burned '' by his handlers ( declared unreliable ) and is confined to Miami where he must work under the table as an `` investigator '' while he figures out his situation . Its not really that deep or ground breaking , but it works as an original series.Caveat , I saw this at the store for 39.99 , regular price . That is too high , do n't pay more than what is advertised here . Show is great , but you only get 11 42 minute episodes and the video quality is mediocre at best . 25.99 is a fair price .	1
I have been a fan since the first episode . Jeffrey Donovan is a awesome actor . Plus we always looks hot in his suites . I also really like the actor that plays Sam . He is so funny and cute also . If you like action packed shows you got ta see burn notice . There 's never a dull moment .	1
Jeffrey Donovan has played some really smarmy jerks in some of his previous roles . It was tough for me to want to watch `` Burn Notice . '' Glad I did . I really like the show 's concept and chemistry of the cast .	1
I 've often wondered what happened to Sharon Gless after `` Cagney and Lacy '' . Now I know , she 's still appearing in top notch serials.Now if Hulu would start running old `` Cagney and Lacy '' episodes .	1
I really love this show . It 's one of my 'new ' favourites . To be honest , I first started watching it because of Jeffrey Donovan , who plays the lead , Michael Weston . I used to watch him in The Pretender and Crossing Jordan and loved him , so I began to see what this was like . It 's a great show and I make sure not to miss any episodes . Speaking of episodes , this is how season 1 plays out ; PILOT - Michael Weston , a contract agent for various agencies including the CIA , finds that a burn notice has been issued for him . Stranded in Miami , he takes the case of a caretaker accused of stealing millions from his boss.IDENTITY - Weston is roped into helping his mother 's friend get back money she lost in a scam , but Fi and Sam may ruin everything with their bumbling and bickering.FIGHT OR FLIGHT - Michael 's landlord , Oleg , is having a problem with one of his waitresses . She has n't come into work because she witnessed a crime committed by a man who just happens to be a member of a local drug cartel . Michael is ( mostly ) happy to look into it , as he also continues his investigation into who stuck him with his burn notice.OLD FRIENDS - Michael 's brother is back in town , and he involves him in the search for a friend 's daughter for less than pure motives . Elsewhere , an agent with a grudge comes after Michael.FAMILY BUSINESS - Michael takes on arms dealers for an airport worker , while Nate obsesses about the car and their dad 's will.UNPAID DEBTS - Michael helps out an old SEAL buddy of Sam 's who has gotten himself on the wrong side of a smuggler while trying to repossess his boat , and a new agent hits town set on making Michael 's life miserable since he wo n't give up on finding his burn notice.BROKEN RULES - Michael works to rid a community in little Havana of a crime boss , all the while baiting Jason Bly at the risk of his family and friends.WANTED MAN - Fiona decides to try bounty-hunting , but then convinces Michael to help prove the man innocent.HARD BARGAIN - A slightly dim house sitter 's fianc & eacute ; e has been kidnapped , and Sam guilts Michael into a rescue while he 's negotiating with a D.C. bureaucrat to stop the burn notice.FALSE FLAG - Michael makes plans to leave Miami , but has to do one last job - locate a woman 's missing son - so he can get a new identity.LOOSE ENDS PART 1 - Phillip Cowan has arrived in Miami , but Michael has to put him off when a job involving heroin and blackmail goes south.LOOSE ENDS PART 2 - With Cowan 's bosses now tracking him , Michael must protect his family and rescue Sam all before his own capture if he does n't move fast enough.To elaborate just that little bit more , a 'burn notice ' is when a spy is cut off , no jobs , nothing . Jeffrey Donovan is great in this and so is Gabrielle Anwar and the writing for this series is sharp . I was hooked from the first episode and I 'm sure you 'll be too . It 's brilliant and I highly recommend it .	1
My son got me watching this show and boy are they addictive . We can watch 5-6 shows at a time . The plots seem quite original . Never a dull moment . Love the characters . Am trying to figure out what makes these so entertaining -- original plots , realistic and unusual lead characters , pretty scenery , the narration -- they educate the viewer about spy stuff while they entertain . I think that 's what sets them apart -- the aspect of educating about spy work . The humor is fun , too . They 're upbeat but not silly . The violence does n't seem heavy . You 're happy to see the bad guys get their due . A fresh , original series !	1
Michael Weston ( Jeffrey Donovan ) is a spy and very good at it . Or at least he was . One day , while in the middle of a covert mission , he is burned . For us civilians , that means fired . Barely managing to escape with his life , he passes out and wakes up in Miami with no money and no idea what happened . Worse yet , Miami is him home town , and that means dealing with his Mother ( Sharon Gless ) who he has n't seen in years.Michael is determined to figure out who did this to him and why so he can get back to work . So while he slowly gathers pieces of that puzzle , he picks up odd jobs as a private investigator . When he needs back up ( which is often ) , he teams up with ex-IRA weapons smuggler ( and ex-girlfriend ) Fiona ( Gabriella Anwar ) and friend and former FBI agent ( who is reporting on him to the FBI ) Sam ( Bruce Campbell ) .And together the three of them take on plenty of hard cases . They deal with kidnapped sons , drug dealers , smugglers , arms dealers , and assassins . Meanwhile , Michael is piecing together why he was burned . All this leads to a gripping and explosive season finale with a great cliffhanger.I passed on this show originally , but based on the buzz gave it a chance . I 'm glad I did . This show manages to fix suspense , action , and humor in the perfect dose . Michael , Fiona , and Sam have excellent chemistry , which makes their jokes better . And Michael 's narration adds some fun , too.But yes , this show is about the action . Every episode leaves me on the edge of my seat trying to figure out how they will deal with the problem . There are lots of explosions and shooting . This is a show for those who love spy stories.I will admit , the show took me a few episodes to fully appreciate . But I usually find the first few episodes are the weakest of many shows as everyone is figuring out the characters and storytelling.After that cliffhanger , I am really looking forward to the start of the second season . If you missed this show when it aired , get the set now .	1
One of the biggest advantages to come of with the dawn of the DVD age is that television shows that might otherwise have gone unnoticed have been given a new chance at life with the release of series seasons on disc . Such is the case with BURN NOTICE , a fairly moderate hit on cable that has the chance to gain viewers with the release this week of season one on disc.The story revolves around Michael Weston ( Jeffrey Donovan ) , perhaps the best spy the US has . The problem begins when right in the middle of a transaction with foreign operatives , Weston is given his `` burn notice '' . In effect , a burn notice is a termination of current employment where an agent is left in the field without identity , backup , funds or anything that might help him . Happening in the middle of an illegal transaction with killers is not the best time to be notified.Weston escapes and lands in Miami . Using his knowledge and special ops skills , he sets up a place to stay , contacts his old friend Sam ( Bruce Campbell ) who helps set him up with some work . He also meets up with past girlfriend Fiona ( Gabrielle Anwar ) - an ex-IRA bomber that he left behind , and his mother ( Sharon Gless ) , a chain smoking retiree.Things are not the best he could hope for.The character of Michael Weston is charismatic and yet hard at the same time . He has difficulty relating to what you and I might think of as normal civilians . Put him in the midst of a group of soldiers discussing weapons and explosives and he 's in his element . Sitting next to a young boy whose father has been threatened by a rich employer who has set him up to take the fall for a fake theft and that 's a whole different ballgame . As played by Donovan , the character is believable and easy on the eyes for female fans.Most of the episodes consist of two stories running side by side . The ongoing story consists of Michael trying to discover who issued his burn notice so he can go back to doing what he does best . Whoever placed him there has let him know in no uncertain terms that he is to remain in Miami and let it go . FBI agents that follow him around , NSA members who visit him and more attempt to get that through his head . But Michael does n't choose to take this situation lying down.The second storylines involve Michael either being recruited to help someone in need or taking on jobs that his friend Sam puts him in contact with . Anything from a kidnapping to the fake theft mentioned above requires him to use his cunning and skills to help someone in need.What I thought made this series work more than anything was the interplay between characters . Not only that but the casting choices make this work like a Swiss watch . Each actor has his or her piece to play and they do it to perfection.Campbell has found his niche here playing the friend who was once involved in covert actions as well . Sam not only helps Michael but feeds information ( usually false ) to the Feds who keep an eye on Michael.Fiona as played by Anwar offers an elegant looking woman with tremendous sex appeal but who has a deadly side that she lets loose now and then . Even then she offers some of the most humorous lines in the show as she matter of factly considers eliminating anyone who gives Michael trouble . This let 's kill ` em attitude coming from this petite woman makes for an interesting character.The series offers plenty of action , lots of thoughtful plotlines , a ton of subtle humor and even a touch of romance . With the second season getting ready to begin this summer , now is the time to pick up season one and get caught up . The cliffhanger at season 's end will be a great jumping on point this summer . Until then , give this DVD release a try . It 's worthy of adding to any collection .	1
amazingly unique series . great views of miami and lots of laughs and gaffes . jeffrey donovan has come into his own in this series with help from great actors like bruce campbell , gabrielle anwar , and sharon gless .	1
I love everything about burn notice - the idea of a cast out spy , living in Miami , doing odd-job MacGyver -type work for the fun of it and to help & # 34 ; innocent & # 34 ; people . it 's fun ; it 's full of action and J. Donovan is fun to watch .	1
This is one of the best series ever . I love the way he explains what he is doing . Not fond of the brother character , though . Bruce Campbell reminds me how much I loved Brisco County and I have been watching that with great joy .	1
The first season , particularly the pilot , just drew me in . Good pacing , good plotting , interesting characters and plausible situations . The later seasons get a little bit more complicated ( situations , plots , and premises ) and I sometimes get tired with trying to keep up with what 's going on , nod off and fall asleep . But the first season , yeah , 5 stars !	1
Michael Westen , with his distinctive droll humor and mellow charm is an endlessly fun character . His way of being placidly befuddled by all things female is a great counter to his spy smarts . Donovan fits the role so perfectly it is as though the series was written for him.The plots are light and fast blends of stuff - CIA operative spy stuff , Miami lowlife stuff , romantic stuff , family stuff , and other stuff . Fi is perfectly Fi - her pretty , petite , and generally nearly naked self , loving to blow things up and so very eager to shoot anything that moves . Michael takes Fi home to have dinner with mom , and Fi turns into the sweet and innocent `` girl next door '' - laugh out loud funny . The somewhat slovenly and slightly alcoholic Sam , a womanizer ( but not in the typical misogynistic way ) adds just the right presence . Madeline round out the fine core quartet.Only one thing marred my otherwise unqualified enthusiasm for Burn Notice . Mom Madeline 's chain smoking . Watching someone smoke is about the same as watching someone barf - flat out nauseating . And it generates two obvious flaws in the character -- Madeline 's beautiful complexion and her sparkling white teeth -- no chain-smoker has either of those . Not that the series is meant to be realistic - no appeal in that ! But if Madeline were scripted with an interesting addiction or predilection , rather than this dull and repulsive one , the role could have been enhanced . So many opportunities lost ! As one of the other reviewers noted , Michael is eminently quotable : `` Duct tape makes you smart . '' Ahhh ... ... The Westen Wisdom .	1
The movie has many moments from happy to sad ... ... ... ... .also loved the story line . Of course , Donald Sutherland is a fantastic actor . I was surprised as I did not know what to expect . Very entertaining ! Held my interest all the way . Definitely recommend .	1
From the opening scenes of FIERCE PEOPLE ( an interplay of tribal customs as photographed by the anthropologist father of the young narrator Finn Earl , demonstrating why this South American tribe of Ishkanani is so fierce ) the direction of the film is nebulous : are we watching a dark comedy about comparing life in the New York streets to uncivilized peoples , or is this a message film of a more serious intent ? But as the story develops this fine line between entertainment and philosophical impact becomes increasingly clear . Griffin Dunne 's direction of Dirk Wittenborn 's adaptation of his novel may be a bit careless at times as it strays from rational plot development , but in the end there is a strong enough final impact to patch up the holes he created.Our narrator Finn Earl ( Anton Yelchin ) lives with his coke-addicted masseuse/sexually obsessed mother Liz ( Diane Lane ) in New York , waiting for the summer when he is to join his anthropologist father on a field trip to South America ( a father he knows only from letters and videos ) , when a drug bust abruptly changes their lives : one of Liz 's wealthy clients Ogden Osborne ( Donald Sutherland ) rescues the down and out family and moves them to his ten acre estate , the epitome of wealth and power . In exchange for being Osborne 's private masseuse , Liz and Finn can live in the mansion with the 'filthy rich ' Osbornes - daughter Mrs. Langley ( Elizabeth Perkins ) and grandchildren Bryce ( Chris Evans ) and Maya ( Kristen Stewart ) . Osborne and his physician lead Liz on the drying out path and Finn bonds with Osborne and his grandchildren , and despite the disparity in poor versus wealthy , the living situation works - for a while . Incidents occur to alter feelings and Finn is attacked and raped by a masked assailant , a turning point for the film and Finn 's view of the Osborne family . Osborne reveals his past to Finn and together they manage to discover the truth about Finn 's troubling incident - and also about the fierce disease of the wealthy class.The film uses many clips of tribal activity during the film , drawing some disturbing parallels for some of the more challenging scenes . For this viewer that works well , but when the director elects to place tribal individuals in full regalia within the context of the Osborne estate , the concept feel contrived , as though the audience has to be forced to 'get it ' . The various subplots between maid Jilly ( Paz de la Huerta ) and Finn and the introduction of an obese retarded chalk artist Whitney ( Branden Williams ) push the credibility edge of emphasizing the line between the wealthy and the 'lower class ' , but the performances by Sutherland , Lane , and Yelchin are strong enough to make us forgive the film 's lapses . Not a great film but one with a lot of worthy ideas splashed around on the screen of a project that often feels lost in its struggle for direction . Grady Harp , February 08	1
At first I thought it was going to be a corny love comedy but as the movie continued , it kept me interested . The cast is great . Every one is going through something and money plays a big factor for some . There is drama , comedy , and love . The story between mother and son is beautiful and though her mother was not the best mother , her son has a huge heart for integrity and loyalty . Truly enjoyed it .	1
That pretty much sums up the theme of the film . The immensely wealthy paterfamilias Ogden C. Osborne and the poor son of a masseuse Finn Earl are two peas in a pod , and Osborne sees that right away . Osborne has already triumphed , thanks to a little blackmail on the part of his grandfather , and you get the impression that Finn will do the same after surviving a very rough coming-of-age summer with the Osbornes and his ex-drug addict mother . It 's about tribal behavior in a `` fierce '' primitive tribe studied by his biological father and tribal behavior in a `` fierce '' robber baron family headed by Osborne : sex , love , murder , rape , jealousy , and all that human stuff that does n't change no matter what costume you happen to be wearing or how much money you have .	1
Impressive cast and a mystery to solve in the enclave of the very rich and devious . This film has a running concept that compare 's a primitive tribe and their brutal rituals with the behavior of the very rich . This works very well . Great Prime choice . Recommended .	1
This movie is outstanding ! It 's intense , and terrible things happen , but the story and the actors are all amazing . I 've been wanting to see Anton Yelchin in something else ever since seeing him in `` Taken '' , and I was really impressed by his role in this film . I also wanted to see Kristen Stewart in something else , and I watched this one and another one she was in , and I 'm extremely impressed with her . I expected another Bella , but in both movies , she was totally different . I do n't know what it is , how some actors can be so many different characters so convincingly . some are basically the same all the time , but not these two extremely fine actors ! Everyone in this movie played their roles to perfection , and I highly recommend it .	1
This series starts with lots of explicit scenes of screwing -- and ends up being a fairly deep meditation on love and loyalty and family.David Duchovny plays a washed-up writer who drinks , snorts drugs and sleeps with anyone who will sleep with him ( and apparently there are many ) -- but harbors a deep and abiding love for his former partner , about to be married to another man , and their 12-year-old daughter.There are many funny scenes as the series develops and we also meet an interesting supporting cast . But the laughs and the sex scenes become fewer as the story unfolds and the Duchovny character 's inner sadness and longing for permanent connection becomes the dominant theme.I found this series a rather effective critique on the emptiness of the fast-lane L.A. world the characters inhabit and of our insistence on eternal youth which inhibits people growing up to become true adults .	1
I can not believe I missed it when it was first showing , but I am also kinda glad because now I can see it all at once . It is a little ( well , a lot ) racier than my taste allows but the story line and the characters and the DRAMA ! ! ! ! ! . totally ADDICTED .	1
it 's got a lote going 4 it . cursing very tasteless humor . it 's a more human swing of parts 4 dave compared to moulder . puss the most important to me NAKED LADIES and a few big named stares . only thing missing is graphic violence	1
If there was ever a sequel to catcher in the rye ... this would be it . The humor is witty and sharp plot twists abound and there are many belly laughs thrown in . Binge watch it !	1
Like HBO 's `` Deadwood '' series , `` Californication '' defies viewers to look beyond the obvious , coarse provocations that frame the show and look into the souls of its characters . In this case , it 's egregious swearing , brazen sexuality and occasional drug use that are thrown at the audience , in this rough-and-tumble portrait of Hank Moody , a bad-boy boho novelist who 's made it to Hollywood only to lose his moral compass , and his marriage as well.Although the Moody character seems a little forced -- he 's a two-fisted , heavy drinking thinking man 's roughneck who sleeps with any gal that pauses long enough to make eye contact -- actor David Duchovny invests the character with unexpected nuances and depth , and turns in a fine performance all around . Indeed , viewers like myself , who thought he was kind of a dud as Agent Mulder ( in `` The X-Files '' ) will be pleasantly surprised to find what a clever , funny performer he actually can be . Likewise , this show will sweep you up and ensnare you in its ribald humor , jaw-dropping outrageousness and intelligent writing . There 's great dialog , plenty of hot monkey love , a de rigeur skewering of vapid LA culture , and a delicious , fast-paced soap opera scandal that will get you squirming in your seat . Yummy fun ! ( Joe Sixpack , Slipcue film reviews )	1
This show is bordering on pornography . There is a lot of sex , drug use , profanity and some nudity . Some of it leaves me with my jaw hanging but it is very witty and funny , so I enjoy it . Definitely not recommended for children , holy rollers or people who just ca n't handle this type of content .	1
I dont get Showtime so the only time I got to see this series was when they were running a promo over a weekend and I finally got to see the show . I ll be honest , I had no interest in the show . It sounded like yet another 'risque ' show and it didnt sound that interesting but I was wrong . I caught the last ten minutes of an episode and that was more than enough . I went to iTunes and one by one , I bought the entire first season . Yes , it is very honest and holds no punches and has tons of sex but it is also the best written show ive seen this past year . It is never dull and has some very shocking , and hilarious , moments throughout . This is strictly for adults , though , and that is no exaggeration.I would give Emmys to the show , to Duchovny , to McElhone ( who recently lost her husband , my sympathies to her and her family ) and the writers and some supporting nods.If you dont mind frank talk , then you will love this show .	1
Note : I saw the pilot episode with XFinity On Demand.The pilot episode for this series starring David Duchovny is interesting , and I can relate somewhat to his plight ( though I 'm a virgin , straight as an arrow and very very very single ; no woman would want an ugly little bastard like me ) . I like this series and I think i 'll keep watching it . Definitely NOT for kids .	1
DIalog ( writing ) setting and plot execution , acting and more make this a stand-out series . The mix of human-realities insights with humor just works . it feels real . It IS fun . This is just great television	1
CALIFORNICTION is a really good series I missed when it was on TV . Now on disc do n't miss this great series , season four is just about to arrive . A notable writer with writer 's block , besides being a womanizing drunk , it is all for this man who is really deeply in love with his wife and daughter . Follow this very funny adult series . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED	1
Californication is a very fun , wild , and inventive show . In someways it feels like a highbrow entourage minus the literal entourage . The main character , Hank Moody , is a wild bad boy writer whose fun times usually lead him into some sticky situations . There is a solid balance between love , laughter , and over the top situations . At several times you will find yourself wanting to be in Hank 's shoes and other times so glad you live a relatively benign life . A very fun watch and i would recommend it to anyone that does not mind excessive profanity and at times nudity .	1
I enjoyed the unlikely antics of the main character . There really is n't much else I can say other than it 's entertaining .	1
It took me a few episodes to warm up to `` Californication . '' At first I was n't quite sure what the show was trying to be ... maybe `` Sex and the City '' for men ? But it 's actually much more than that . The show revolves around Hank Moody ( David Duchovny ) , an author who 's been in a bit of a writer 's slump ever since his last novel was published seven years ago . Hank longs to return to his hometown of New York City , but remains in California because his former lover , Karen ( Natascha McElhone ) , lives there , along with their teenage daughter , Becca ( Madeleine Martin ) . Hank is still very much in love with Karen , and it 's pretty obvious that she still loves him , too . Unfortunately , Karen 's engaged to stuffy Bill ( Damian Young ) , and Hank unwittingly has sex with Bill 's 16-year-old daughter , Mia ( Madeline Zima ) , who eventually ends up blackmailing Hank and trying to take credit for his latest manuscript . What a mess ! `` Californication '' also boasts a strong supporting cast . Evan Handler plays Hank 's best friend and agent , Charlie . Poor Charlie and his wife , Marcy ( Pamela Adlon ) , experience some problems in the bedroom that lead to both of them cheating on each other with Charlie 's hot young assistant , Danni ( Rachel Miner ) . Handler and Adlon are amazingly funny on screen , and they play off each other very well : They 're the funniest television couple since Lucy and Ricky Ricardo ! By far , the best thing about this show is its sense of humor . There are some incredibly funny scenes in `` Californication '' that definitely are among the most hilarious moments in TV history , and that 's saying a lot . From Hank throwing up on Bill 's priceless painting to the office dominatrix scenes to the three-way/orgy culmination , there are plenty of great scenes to go around . I do n't remember the last time a TV show made me laugh so hard.The first four or five episodes of the show were a little bumpy , but then `` Californication '' evolved into a great program about love , relationships , and self-discovery . The entire cast is brilliant , and most of the episodes are incredibly touching . I especially loved the last scene of the final episode , which came as a complete surprise and resulted in a very happy ending , at least for now.Overall , `` Californication '' is a surprising success . I ca n't wait for the second season .	1
I REALLY WAS A BIT SHOCKED , ESPECIALLY FOR SOMETHING YOU CAN WATCH ON TV , THAT BEING SAID , I ENJOYED BEING ENTERTAINED AND ALL OF THE `` SEX TALK '' WAS NEW AND DIFFERENT , SHOCKING , AND I LOVED IT ... I HAVE A MAJOR CRUSH ON DAVID AND THAT 'S ALWAYS A PLUS ... TO HAVE THE `` HOTS '' FOR THE STAR OF THE SHOW ... SERIOUSLY , THE WRITING AND THE WRITERS ARE SECOND TO NONE ... IT MOVES RIGHT ALONG AND IS NEVER BORING AND THE SUBJECT MATTER IS ALWAYS SHOCKING AND SLEAZY AND ENTERTAINING , TO SAY THE LEAST , TO SAY THE MOST , I AM NOW ADDICTED TO THE SHOWS ... .AND WILL EVENTUALLY OWN THEM , ONE SEASON AT A TIME ! ! ! ! SMOKING POT , GETTING HIGH , THE SEX SCENES ARE THE BEST AND JUST TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY DO TO ONE ANOTHER AND FOR ONE ANOTHER IS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME ... I AM SORRY THAT I MISSED THE SERIES WHEN IT STARTED ... HOWEVER , NOW I OWN THEM VIA MY VIDEO LIBRARY , SO I CAN KEEP THEM AND ENJOY THEM ANYTIME THAT I AM IN THE MOOD TO WATCH THEM AND ENJOY THEM OVER AND OVER AGAIN .	1
This is certainly a funny show . The antics of our main character is sometimes outrageous and somewhat a naughty boy . I like all the regular actors on the show and they all seem well suited for their parts . I guess it 's only fair to let you know there is plenty of sex and cuss words . If you enjoy a show as I 've described than you will enjoy this series .	1
Series these days are usually careful and stupid . Careful not to be profane , sexual , bitingly funny and self deprecating . Stupid because money usually rolls down to the lowest common denominator of humanity . Most series are terrified of being labeled that most ugly of all adjectives , intellectual . This series is smart and wide frigging open . It will run your slow a $ $ over if you do n't watch out and make you laugh at the tire tracks on your forehead ... this is the stuff Lenny Bruce would have written if he were alive.You do n't like it ? There are a million other stupid and careful shows for you to watch . Later .	1
I seldom review TV shows because there can be so many of hours of material to sort of sift through and contemplate . HOWEVER , once in awhile , I either feel compelled to add my voice to the chorus of praise , or I happen to see a season in a very compressed timeframe and can articulate something resembling a coherent thought.Such was the case with Season 1 of CALIFORNICATION . I saw the brief first season in about a one week time span , and here are my thoughts.CALIFORNICATION pretty much hinges on the ability of David Duchovny to make an insanely unlikeable person likeable . He plays Hank Moody , the smuggest of writers , a best seller who loathes the movie made of this work . It is the making of this movie that brought him , his long-time lover Karen and their daughter Becca from NYC to LA . Upon arriving in LA , Hank and Karen grew quickly apart . Hank now lives alone and wallows in self-pity , self-loathing ( which he turns on everyone around him ) and enormous amounts of sex , booze and smoking . He has an almost magical touch with women wherever he goes , and each 30 minute episode may find him bedding several different women.His only bright spots are the times he spends with his daughter Becca ( a stone-faced girl of around 13 or 14 who plays rock guitar , has her father 's smart and observant mouth and longs deeply for mom and dad to get back together ) . Hank also spends an awful lot of very hot & fraught time with his ex , because we feel that while she has found the love of a stable and rich man who plans to marry her ... she is still very much drawn to the exciting & dangerous Hank.Duchovny mostly pulls it off . If you only know him as Fox Mulder , then his performance here is almost a revelation . He 's disgusting , foul-mouthed , and always unshaven . I told my wife , `` it strikes me that he would smell bad . '' He 's also super-smart and tosses off the most amazingly tart observations on everyone and everything around him . Duchovny is a smart enough person himself that we actually believe he understands what his character is saying . ( Given the recent revelations about Duchovny and his deteriorating relationship with HIS family ... there may be more of him in Hank than I 'd like . ) Most of the time , Hank is despicable . We laugh at his antics and at his credulity-stretching ease with picking up women ( although some of the sex scenes are among the funniest parts of the show ) . But we also feel the genuine love he has for Karen and Becca . He 's mostly a good father , in a casual California way ... and his love for these two women in his life is obvious and believable ... thus his character is redeemed to some extent . He is a man tormented by the mess he 's made of his life ... but also a slave to his passions.His closest friend is his agent Charlie , played by Evan Handled ( Charlotte 's husband in SEX AND THE CIY ) . Charlie is married to Marcy ... but there relationship has tamed down and he 's acting out his S & M ; fantasies with his secretary Dani.You might get the idea that CALIFORNICATION is not for kids ... and you 'd be correct ! It is foul-mouthed , contains much explicit sex and generally depicts degenerate lifestyles.But the writing is tart , and much of the acting is first rate . Duchovny is very good , even if you do n't care for the guy he is playing very often . He balances the role neatly . Karen is played by Natascha McElhone ( the only person in the show , it seems , who wo n't do nudity ) . McElhone has the most ferocious cheekbones ! She does a nice job , although her character seems to be stuck at roughly the same spot all the time . Evan Handler does well at letting his freak-flag fly and Pamela Adlon , who plays his wife Marcy , is a revelation . She reminds me a little bit of Suzie Essman ( from CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM ) but far racier . I look forward to seeing her character 's progression in Season 2 . Less successful are Madeleine Martin as Becca ( I hate , really hate , to say something bad about a child performer ... but Becca may actually be more annoying than Hank because her face is virtually incapable of expression , her hair is horrible and her rock vocals are unbearable ) and Madeline Zima as Mia , the woman Hank sleeps with in episode one , who turns out to be the 16 year-old daughter of Karen 's fianc & eacute ; . This leads to many awkward situations , as you can imagine ... but Ms. Zima is unconvincing in the role . Also disappointing is Rachel Miner 's Dani , who plays Charlie 's kinky secretary and only manages about 2 expressions in the entire season.Overall , I recommend the series for adults who do n't mind some really rough material . It is witty ( seldom laugh-out-loud funny ) and the debauchery is sometimes jaw-dropping . Duchovny earned a Golden Globe for this role , and while he might not have been my first choice for the award , he is certainly perfectly up to this complicated role .	1
David Duchovny is awesomely cynical and brash in the opening season of Californication . I love this show . If you 're a fan of biting comedies like Curb Your Enthusiasm , Arrested Development , Weeds , The Office ( U.K. ) and Louie , and you have n't seen this show , check it out !	1
I would give Californication another star but Amazon for some reason took it off of Prime while I was in the middle of season 1 ! Why did you do that , Amazon ? ? I thought the series was smart , sexy and fun and you obviously did that so consumers would buy the rest of the season . Maybe it was because it was streaming for free but Californication was n't great enough for me to justify paying $ 2 per episode when it was once free . Sorry to go on so long about this but it really bugs me . Shame on you , Amazon !	1
There is not even a shadow of doubt in my mind that BREAKING BAD is the greatest TV show ever made.Vince Gilligan , Bryan Cranston and Co. created a show so freakishly addictive , mesmerizing , and terrifyingly good it was like a drug you had - HAD - to get more of . From the jaw dropping opening Pilot ( `` I only had you in my heart . '' ) to the heartbreaking Felina , the quality of the five seasons never once dropped from Perfect.I could go on . I could talk aboutBryan Cranston 's legendary , immortal performance as high school-teacher-turned-meth-chef Walter White . I could talk at length about the jaw-dropping work from Aaron Paul , Anna Gunn , Dean Norris , Giancarlo Esposito , and Bob Odenkirk in their moving , finely crafted roles . I could talk about the perfect use of music and lighting , the camera work and stunning cinematography . I could talk about the writing , sharp and realistic and beautiful . All these and more are the elements ( this IS a show about chemistry ... ) that took Breaking Bad from what it could have been : an entertaining black comedy/drama , into what it is : `` a labyrinth of blood , destruction and hell '' of Shakespearean proportions ( words of B.B . superfan Anthony Hopkins ) .But I wo n't talk about that . I 'll just say one thing : watch Breaking Bad . Watch all 57 perfect episodes of it , and when you 're done , come back here and drop a comment telling me what you thought . And if I was right ... tell someone else . BReaking BAd gets five stars from me .	1
In the wasteland that is television and most `` entertainment media '' there are fewer and fewer really shining stars . We are left with two masterpieces of darkly comedic drama . Dexter is one and deserves its own review.Breaking Bad is the apex of adrenaline-pumping cliff-hangers , with every real-life adventure possible built in . It outshines and pales anything else on TV , with the exception of Dexter.Breaking Bad is built on a plausability-factor that works in the real world , if at its most extreme.It laces the most perfect syncronicity into every plot and each and every plot realates to each and every previous as well , no doubt , as all plots to come.I end every episode recovering my breath and uttering `` My God , that was good ! `` If they were to produce 26 , or even 52 episodes per season , it would n't be enough . Vince Gilligan , Bryan Cranston and their wonderful cast tear my heart out , make me furious , and leave me feeling compassion for the most flawed group of characters imaginable with every episode ... Though fewer , as the series intensifies , there are also incredible laughs to be found.Breaking Bad is life lived on levels none of us can imagine for ourselves , but know , could happen to any of us with one wrong turn or one cruel twist of fate.Bravo to a true masterpiece of entertainment ! I am in awe of a perfect work in the making.If you have not watched Breaking Bad from the beginning , it is the only place to start . Buy season one , and just keep going ! You will have no regrets , and you will experience the very best any media has to offer in truly imaginative entertainment .	1
this series is fantastic Bryan Cranston freaking rules this series . Its wild entertaining i must watch for any tv series watcher out there this series delivers the goods never letting down .	1
Here we have the first season of BREAKING BAD . It is amazing to realize that it is only 7 episodes for the character , plot and drama development is so thorough and realistic another show would need at least double the episodes to achieve it . The basic plot is a teacher who finds out he is dying of cancer and thru unexpected situations gets the opportunity to make a great deal of money thru manufacturing meth . He does so to make money for his family to be able to live on after he dies . But the show is about so much more than this . Every character is addicted to something and the introduction into the dark world of drugs is terrifyingly realistic . This is honestly one of the best shows ever to air on television . It tells a story that may be too dark for some to handle but the superb acting , writing and directing make it all work . These characters are all believable , necessary and the intertwining of their lives is seamless.The show also succesfully combines deep psychological profiles of each character mixed with the heavy , often disturbing drama . And the plot always serves a purpose , is realistic no matter how heavy , and is in no way gratuituous . And with this show we also get one of the best duos ever in Walt and Jesse . When Jesse , Aaron Paul , a former student of Walt , Bryan Cranston , joins him in the making of meth a perfect chemistry is formed . BREAKING BAD also provides the occasional comic break that helps alleviate the heavy drama . This series is a must for its great acting , superb writing and directing and totally unique premise . If it sounds like any other series you have seen believe me when I say it is not . The blu ray of course adds a dimension to the series over that of the dvd . There are many dark scenes but the detail and clarity still shines thru and the scenes with color and specifically the lovely scenery shots pop off the screen . Audio is superb . This is a series that is dialogue driven but when the action sequences happen nothing is held back . This series is superb and I highly recommend it .	1
Outstanding 1st season ! I loved this show ! Brian Cranston was hands down `` phenomenal '' as Walter White and easily deserved his Emmy . Aaron Paul is awesome in his role as Jesse Pinkman , and all the other cast members seemed to be a perfect fit.I knew the show was good , because of all the rave reviews , but I was'nt expecting it to be this good ! `` Breaking Bad '' Season 1 has a 5 star overall rating here on Amazon.Great writing , great timing and development of the characters . The storyline is dramatic , hilarious and keeps you watching . Just when you think the story is starting to slow down , they nail you with something big ! I watch alot of TV seasons on DVD ( The Shield , CSI , Rescue Me ) , because I work at night . I have n't seen a show in its 1st season that was this good , since `` Dexter Sea . 1 '' ! The only bad part about this show , was that the 1st season was only 7 episodes ! Looking forward to the next season already ! Highly , highly recommended !	1
This is the second of two AMC series I went to catch up with , because this and `` Mad Men '' were constantly winning awards , and my favorites were being left in the dust . Both series had a hurdle for me . How can I possibly empathize with a meth manufacturer and dealer ( the two lead roles ) . As it turns out , the story line is so inventive and so believable that it is hard not be be drawn into the perils of these characters which are so totally under water . The story on the face of it is so tense , that the show 's creator had to add to the premise the fact that the brother in law of the Walter White ( Brian Cranston ) is a lead DEA agent , and , in most regards , a pretty good one . Perhaps one of the only improbabilites of the first season is that this DEA agent comes so close to gathering evidence which implicates Walter , but he does n't catch on.Perhaps the most compelling aspect of the story is seeing the extent to which people will do totally out of character things , things which are not only illegal ( as one may think about drug business as a victimless crime ) , but violently illegal , including multiple murders . The acting by Cranston and Brian Paul , his `` dealer '' is superb , worthy of their Emmy wins . I must also give a good word for Raymond Cruz , who does a character far , far different from his police detective role on `` The Closer / Major Crimes '' . The tension between his character Tuco and Walter White holds one 's attention like little I 've seen elsewhere.This is not for everyone , but watching one or two episodes shows why this one wins awards , and shows such as `` White Collar '' , `` Royal Pains '' , and `` Suits '' do not .	1
Breaking hilarious ! This is one occasion where all the hype is true . Endearing characters you want to love and hate at the same time . Situational comedy with a twist .	1
at least for me it isn'ti was sorry that season one was cut short by the writers . THIS is what TV should be like . i loved it and am a devoted fan now.Ca n't wait for season three on Blu Ray	1
I think many , when looking at the main star of this show ( Bryan Cranston ) will have only really been familiar with him from Malcolm In The Middle . He played Hal , a simple Dad with simple values and an unbeatable love for his family . Who would have thought that he can take a character with the same basic love of his family and create something incredibly unique from that . In Breaking Bad , Bryan Cranston plays Chemistry professor Walter White who 's married with a handicap son who suffers from Cerebral Palsy and a child on the way.One day Walter is hit with the ultimate bombshell as he finds he has inoperable lung cancer and has little time left to live . Walter realises that he ca n't assure his families financial security for the little time he has left being a teacher . He hears about a raid on a crystal meth lab that seizes millions of dollars worth of drugs which he decides that he must be a part of that . He knows how to make the best crystal meth ever seen , but not how to get it on the streets which is why he must enlist the help of his former student and drug pusher Jesse Pinkman ( Aaron Paul ) .I honestly did n't have high hopes for this show as , although I 'm a huge fan of Bryan Cranston for his work on Malcolm In The Middle , I struggled to believe he could pull off such a train wreck of a character . The family is a typical middle class American family struggling to take care of their disabled son trying to make him have as normal a life as possible . In a way I can relate to the situation as I 'm disabled myself and know how much of a strain it can be on parents . Sure , it 's not the same disability , but the family struggling through it is definitely displayed well and R.J. Mitte as Walter Jr. is an excellent fit . Although I 'm betting he was only cast because he too has Cerebral Palsy , he still fits the bill and plays the character brilliantly.Fantastic , fantastic show . I do n't want to tell you much about the seasons events as it is quite short and risks spoiling certain events . I have to tell you that there are times in which this show does n't hold back . It has no qualms about showing you the brutality of a broken man fighting against his own sense of morality , joining the drug world and even dealing with the fact that he killed a guy . Oh and obviously he 's dying and is reminded of that from time to time but it 's certainly gelled together brilliantly.Just to wrap it up I can only really say this TV show is amazing in every way and I would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone . Bryan Cranston is a very underrated actor , but he 's determined to prove himself for which he does a terrific job . When this DVD set comes out in the UK I 'll certainly be one of the first to buy it .	1
The scenes , interviews and explanations made this series intriguing . I 'd like to see the show based on this introduction and feel that I understood why it is so popular .	1
What a provocative show . From the pilot forward this has been an addiction to me . Everything about this show is outstanding , the acting , the writing , the photography , everything.There 's nothing like this show . Some of the finest television I 've ever seen .	1
The first episode will confuse and make you question just what is going on . It is a little slow at times but there is a lot of set up for the second season which is just unreal . It 's a dark show but it is awesome .	1
Dark , gripping and unique ! Emmy Award winner Bryan Cranston plays the role of Walter White , a chemistry teacher at a local high school trying make ends meet for his family . His wife Skyler ( Anna Gunn ) is pregnant and his son Walter White Jr. ( RJ Mitte ) is physically challenged . The family are struggling financially and behind on bills.Walter tries to provide for his family by working two jobs . He is a very intelligent chemist that can probably work anywhere and make a lot of money but yet he teaches chemistry to high school students ( who have no care in chemistry ) and then having to work part time at a car wash in which his students mock him for it . To make matters worse , Walter has just discovered that he has inoperable lung cancer.Knowing that his family has no money , he does n't tell his family about it . In fact , he keeps the cancer to himself and with all the crap going in his life , this is the last thing he needs.Depressed and just out of it , he is surprised that his wife has a surprise 50th birthday party with all his friends and his family ( with their friends ) . He watches his sister-in-law Marie 's boyfriend Hank ( Dean Norris ) is a DEA ( Drug Enforcement Agency ) agent on television and how he goes after the notorious drug dealers in New Mexico and has been successful . Always finding a way to poke fun at Walter 's weakness , he offers Walter a chance to go on a DEA ride-along as they go after drug dealers . But what catches Walter 's eye is the discussion of how much money is made by these drug dealers.So , Walter decides one day to take on Hank 's offer to go on a ride along for a crystal meth bust . He sees how chemistry is applied to crystal meth , how it 's developed in their labs and how these drug dealers are making really crappy products . With basic chemistry , he can cook the finest crystal meth and possibly make some money for him and his family.So , during the bust , he sees a former student named Jesse Pinkman escaping from the area of the drug bust . Walter goes to Jesse 's residence after the busts and tells him that he wants to join forces with him . He 'll create the best crystal meth using his intelligent chemist skills and Jesse finds a way to make money.In an unlikely collaboration , both Walter and Jesse begin to work with each other . But because Walter 's crystal meth is perfect , Jesse 's distributor want to know who 's cooking it . Thus they go to where Walter is cooking and threaten the both of them . In trouble , Walter uses his chemistry skills to create a cloud of poison and thus killing the drug dealers.Caught up in a botched up drug deal , both Walter and Jesse have now crossed the line and now have murdered one and keeping the other captive in the basement of Jesse 's home.Walter goes from a ho-hum life to a criminal life involving drugs , theft and murder . And because he needs money badly , he gets him and Jesse farther into criminal territory with ruthless drug dealers .

I was really impressed by the Vince Gilligan 's writing and the talent of Bryan Cranston ( who won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for `` BREAKING BAD '' ) in such a demanding role.I have to admit that I was a bit hesitant about watching the series because I was n't sure if I wanted to watch a television series that may glorify crystal meth and it 's good to know that the series doesn't.In fact , it 's more about a television series about a very intelligent man making a very stupid decision that will eventually take him to the lowest of lows in order to make money for his family and his treatment.It 's so shocking that Walter H. White forgoes working at a great company in order to utilize his talent towards creating crystal meth and getting him involved with the unthinkable and commiting certain heinous acts that you are just shocked.And that is what is so impressive with `` BREAKING BAD '' is that it 's a series that is well-written , smart but dark , shocking and even disturbing at times . And what helps break from the typical dark and depressing storylines is the other characters and the chemistry these characters have with the main character of Walter White.Anna Gunn as Skyler White , a loving wife , mother and sister other does an excellent job of playing a character with so many layers . In one scene , she may be the concerned housewife and then another scene , the sultry wife who wants to make love to her husband.Then you have Walter 's chemistry with the drug dealer Jesse . Two unlikely people who would never be together in society but now having to work with each other in making money and despite the viewer feeling empathy for Walter because of his health condition and trying to make ends meet for his family , you can foresee nothing but darkness as both Walter and Jesse continue the downward spiral of working in the criminal underground.You see Walter eventually understanding that he put himself in a terrible position . Having to work with unstable drug dealers , watching Jesse getting beaten and bloodied and even these two having to get involved in various criminal activities.This is not a television series glorifying drugs , it 's a series that shows the seedy , dark and gritty criminal underground and things are not all rosy . I was shocked about the developments that happen in the series which I rather not spoil for the viewer but you have to watch and see for yourself . Definitely many twists and turns in this television series.Overall , `` BREAKING BAD '' is a unique , well-written and well-acted television series . Surprisingly , AMC of all cable networks to showcase two exceptional dramatic series ( the other is `` MADMEN '' ) is impressive and you can only think of how far this series will go . The first season for `` BREAKING BAD '' really was surprising , entertaining and unique . I was very impressed and looking back , I 'm still quite shocked about a few certain scenes.An excellent television series thus far and I look forward in the upcoming twists and turns for the second season . `` BREAKING BAD - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON '' is definitely recommended !	1
Missed the shows when they started and began to catch up with the season videos . Up to season 6 now and we agree , it is one of the best shows ever produced for TV .	1
I cant wait to see and buy the 5th season . We watched and bought all 4 , and sold them , the day after we watched them , instantly . This is what tv and entertainment should be like and isnt ! The acting is superb ! The characters amazing and believable ! they take something that I didnt think Id be interested in and just made it real , even though , it is is so unbelievable , but you KNOW and love or hate all of the characters , and the love and hate changes and is soooooooooo believable ! Cudos to these guys , for real !	1
It is like Weeds and Dexter gave birth to one bad @ $ $ little kid . It says something about today 's standards of life when a meth head and a chemist can engage a powerful range of personal growth . There 's probably a good joke in that line ... .But the cook gets burned and finds out he has lung cancer . What 's a guy to do when he has a family that depends on him , even after he 's gone ? Not even the Writer 's Strike can get in the way of this train . It 's bad . Very bad . And that 's good.Why is it that we gravitate towards those who , twenty years ago , who have been abhorrent and never even considered to be 'art ' in the media sense of the word . And I guess it says something else about our world today when we 've realized not every bad guy is indeed a bad guy . Progressive or the way of the High Road ? Whatever . That 's all philosophy . Skip the musings and watch a few episodes of this award-winning series . First sampler is one me ... .	1
`` Mad Men '' is great and I 've watched three seasons of it , but `` Breaking Bad '' is phenomenal ( and I 've only just gotten started ) . In fact , this could be one of the best shows ever . Seven fantastic episodes kicked off by the pilot-to-end-all-pilots . The only lull in the season is when Walter White 's family has a long intervention with him about why he does n't want to get chemotherapy . Do n't get me wrong , it 's not a bad scene , but it 's blown away by every other scene in the show . Bryan Cranston does a great job , as usual .	1
Season one . Great TV . This is selling at a really good price now . I bought it for a friend who does not have netflix .	1
My family was addicted from the first episode ! The writing is so clever , crisp and unique . The acting catches you up and does n't let you go . We would sit down saying that we were only going to watch one episode and end up watching three ! Time flies by and you are completely caught up in a story about an over-qualified high school chemistry teacher who gets a death sentence ( lung cancer ) and decides to cook and sell meth to make enough money to provide for his pregnant wife and his 15 year-old son who has muscular dystrophy . When I heard that description of this series , I was under-whelmed and avoided watching it until the final season was set to begin ... but my daughter talked us into it . THANK GOODNESS SHE DID ! It is one of the BEST series I 've ever seen on TV . I highly recommend it !	1
I heard about Breaking Bad ( BrBa ) through word of mouth , and by the time season 4 was underway I picked up the first season , late on the bandwagon but still wowed . All of the seasons of BrBa are great , but they all sort of drag out what 's going on , and while the tension and suspense are there I still have a hard time remembering each episode because a lot of them left me with blue balls . This season however short it is , moved at a lightning quick pace and barely gave me time to adjust my face.Breaking Bad 's first season shows the beginning of Walt 's transformation from unlucky high school chemist to criminal mastermind , and it 's all fascinating because it 's all circumstantial , Walt 's almost forced into this new dangerous world because the other options are die and leave his family with nothing , and that 's what makes BrBa different from say , Scarface since Tony was just a greedy thug in the first place , Walt is a family man.Basically season 1 chronicles Walt taking out his competition early on in New Mexico , and there are many memorable scenes and results from it , one of my favorite moments is Walter putting a plate back together and making a horrible discovery , you know the one . But pretty much episode after episode some new variable changes the game completely , keeping the whole season short and sweet ; television writers take note.If you have n't seen BrBa before and are curious you need to stop reading this right now and get your hands on the whole series , season 1 especially starts out the show with a bang but by season 3 it starts to show it 's stretch marks . Still Breaking Bad is proof that HBO has some competition .	1
Bryan Cranston is absolutely amazing as Walter White , a loving family man stricken with terminal cancer . In a desperate attempt to provide financial security for his family , the chemistry teacher joins forces with a former student Jesse to make the best quality meth lab around.This is a very stylized story driven by the number of odd and quirky characters that surround Walter . His pregnant wife Skyler knows Walter has a secret but what could it be ? Add in Walter 's streetwise brother-in-law who is a DEA agent , and there is quite a story here.Jesse , the low level drug dealer , and conservative and proper Walter become allies and unwilling friends in a world of violence and murder . Somehow a story about two drug dealers becomes a fascinating study of human nature and a fight between good and bad . Meth dealers as heroes of a show ? Somehow it works mainly because we only see the `` bad '' guys in this scenario - not the addicted buyers of the meth.Be ready for a high level of violence . Somehow Walter and Jesse stay ahead of the law and fellow drug dealers . A simple idea to make money becomes a life-threatening career that probably can only end in disaster and destruction.The writing is incredible as we follow the twists and turns of Walter 's life . The obvious is never what it seems and somehow we believe it all and crave for more.Cranston is at his absolute best as the cancer-striken chemistry teacher in for the fight of his life on many levels . Cranston 's appearance and demeanor changes as he progresses through chemo and his new life as a criminal.It 's all absolutely amazing .	1
I 'll have to admit , after seeing Mad Men ( and just about everything HBO and Showtime had to offer ) I was pretty much convinced that there was nothing else worth watching on TV ... .. happy to be proven wrong.You 've probably heard all the hype surrounding Breaking Bad and know about it 's premise ( dying chemestry teacher becomes Meth dealer to support his family ) . While this sounded interesting , I was n't too impressed ... .that is until I actually saw the first episode.You already know about the great performances , dark humor ( Walt-the main character going from timid to fearless ) and gritty scenes of drug dealing , but what really sold me on this show was it 's honesty . Not just the characters but of how their situations play out and how everything they do effects the world around them.If I had one problem with the show , it 's that it 's first season is so short . But honestly I 'd rather have seven outstanding episodes than a handful of filler between them.This DVD set also has some great commentaries and interviews . I 'm very impressed with how much the actors and producers of the show believe in the project and want to see it succeed.I wo n't pretend that this series is everyone 's cup of tea , but if you dig the first episode you 'll be in for one of the wildest rides of your life .	1
I already owned the series from a few years ago . A friend mentioned she wanted to see it . I gave it to her as a Christmas present . She texted back that they & # 34 ; binge & # 34 ; watched it all the way through . I ca n't speak to the technical quality , but I assume it was fine because she did n't mention it .	1
Enjoy it so far but I 've not yet finished the series . Anxious for the next seson season good or bad	1
I got into this show late in the game , as it was heading into its final episodes to be exact . After watching hours of the AMC marathon leading up to the finale , I could n't resist picking up the first couple seasons on DVD . First off , I 'm glad I went with the DVD , which is uncensored , as opposed to instant video , which I 've read over and over is not . Watching the show uncensored makes for a more authentic , cinematic viewing experience . The first season only has 7 episodes , so it 's sort of the introduction to the crumbling world of Walter White . I do n't see how anyone who watches the first two or three episodes can avoid being hopelessly hooked by this superbly written and acted , genre-blending show . `` Breaking Bad '' mixes elements of drama , action , thrillers , and even Westerns , and adds bits of dark comedy in presenting a unique , thoroughly entertaining story . Full of shocking twists , it never fails to drop my jaw with something completely unexpected . It 's an addictive show I ca n't seem to get enough of .	1
Breaking Bad has to be the best TV show I 've every watched . Watch the whole thing in sequence , and pay attention to the details ! BRILLIANT ! ! ! The lower star review is because the version sold here is ed*ted , and I got sick of the numerous bl**ps and fuzzed-out b*dy p**ts . Seriously interfered with appreciation of the acting and the character development . I watched this on N*****x , where the uncensored version is available !	1
this episode is a good one , Jesse tries to get a job since his partner do n't want to continue making money off drugs . Walt and his wife goes to a old friend birthday party . Jesse meet his old friend after a bad job interview . They hook up to make crystal meth but it goes wrong when Jesse tries to make it perfect like his old partner , meanwhile Welt is offer a jod by his old only because the friend was told Walt was dying by his wife . Later on in the show Jesse & Walt are back at it .	1
If you have n't started this show , then I feel sorry for you . It 's so , so good . I do n't want to give anything away . I think you need to just buy this DVD , ship it prime and when it arrives , take the day off of work and watch the first season . When you 're done do the same thing with Season 2 , etc . until you 're caught up . You can thank me later .	1
After I completed watching The Sopranos I was in need for a new show to watch . Multiple friends , coworkers , and family members of mine Reccomended this too me , because I 'm a fan of Bryan Cranston I thought id give it a try . I ordered it on a Tuesday and it was here by Thursday ! I got a chance to watch the first episode of it on Friday , I started watching the show at 7:00pm , the pilot was good , so I watched the next , the next , the next , I looked at the clock , it was 12:30am ! I watched the whole 7 episode season in one night ! I just finished watching all seasons and im currently waiting for the final 8 episodes in August 2013 . If you thought this seasons was n't that good , still stick with it because each season gets more darker and better .	1
Having come very late to this series , I felt that I wanted to be able to see this show uninterrupted over a very short period of time in order to appreciate the dramatic flow tat led to the incredible series end . This excellent Blu-Ray package did it for me . While I understand that I am not getting the original completely unedited version , but considering the cost of the box set , I could not afford it , and wanted to see the series asap , so I went with the first season and will buy the next dvds as I can afford to . I thought this was a good buy all told !	1
With Breaking Bad currently airing the first half of its final season , I obviously arrived late to the party having just finished the first and second season . Until recently all I knew about the show was that it involved meth , starred Bryan Cranston , and was highly acclaimed . I do n't watch too many television shows , but I questioned how a channel like AMC would be able to pull off this kind of material effectively . As you likely know , these questions are unwarranted . It 's difficult to review the seven episodes that make up the first season without taking the brilliant second season that followed it into account . I believe this is why the first season is held in such high regard now and I think the reviews tend to reflect one 's opinion of the show as a whole rather than this specific group of episodes . Because it 's the first season and it was cut short by the writer 's strike ( from nine to seven episodes ) , the first season of Breaking Bad is n't as compelling as the season that followed it . This is not due to lower production values or weaker writing , merely the amount of exposition it takes to set up a series and the way Breaking Bad carefully establishes its characters . Perhaps this is biased itself as I 'm judging this season based on how great the following season was . However , in regards to these seven episodes ; the first three intrigued me , the fourth and fifth served as appropriate dramatic segues , and the final two episodes are nothing short of astounding . The show is undeniably a masterwork , but the first season sets up the masterpiece ; it is n't one itself.At this point it seems superfluous to provide a synopsis , but it helps provide context . Walter White ( Cranston ) is a high school chemistry teacher , with a second job at a car wash , living with his pregnant wife Skyler ( Anna Gunn ) and their disabled son Walter Jr. ( RJ Mitte ) . Shortly after his 50th birthday he 's diagnosed with stage-three terminal lung cancer . With no health insurance and stress piling up , he keeps his diagnosis secret from his family . With the financial burden weighing on him , Walt begins looking for a way to make money when his DEA agent brother-in-law Hank ( Dean Norris ) mentions how lucrative cooking meth can be . By chance , Walt notices Jesse Pinkman ( Aaron Paul ) , a former student of his , sneaking out of a house that Hank has busted . Walt 's extensive knowledge of chemistry makes him able to cook highly potent meth and he blackmails Jesse into assisting him in the cooking and distribution . Shortly into Walt 's newfound career , things go awry . I should add ; this all happens in the pilot episode , which works like a self-contained movie . It 's an impressive introduction.The second episode amps up the excitement with a shocking story arc that comes to a dramatic conclusion in the third episode . The fourth and fifth episodes are , as I mentioned , dramatic segues that put the focus on the characters and give them the depth necessary for us to start to care about them . These episodes are the least compelling , but they provide some of the most powerful dramatic moments of the season . The sixth episode debuts bald Walter , the look of the character that has become iconic as well as introducing Tuco ( Raymond Cruz ) , the psychotic and powerful drug distributor with the power to lead Walter and Jesse to a big payday.The last two episodes are so intensely well-written and well-acted they immediately elevate the series . Each episode seems to improve upon the previous one and every creative decision that goes into forming the framework of the show is a success . A lot happens in only seven episodes , and every new character , every new conflict , seems inspired . The season ends on a high-note , opting to point the series in an intriguing direction rather than ending on a cheap cliffhanger . There 's a real confidence in the direction of this series and the way it is put together.If the first season is slightly less than perfect , it 's only because of necessary exposition . Every event here provides the catalyst for the rest of the series . Every episode of season one gets more intriguing and suspenseful ; with season two , it only gets better.So what makes it so good ? Well , you never get the impression that you 're watching a television show . The cinematography , the pacing , the acting , the dialogue , the look , the feel of the show make Breaking Bad simply feel like a long movie . Bryan Cranston is a phenomenal actor who finally got people to take notice with this role and had this been a movie his work would be Oscar worthy . Aaron Paul also gives a terrific performance , one that takes a few episodes to grow on you and the love-hate chemistry he shares with Cranston is palpable.AMC is not HBO and there are FCC regulations , yet nothing about the content of the show ever feels restrained . There 's violence , language , and sex ; yet it 's done tastefully and it works . This whole review is ultimately superfluous as I 'm sure anyone reading it has already started watching the series . However , I must add to the pile of acclaim ; this is one of the best shows on television and the first season is a special and unique introduction to it . Friends of mine had tried to convince me to watch this show for some time and I put it off . Do n't make the same mistake . This show is almost as addictive as the drug it 's based around and , similarly , it only gets more addictive the further in you go .	1
By now there really is n't a whole lot more to be said here . Some people object to the subject matter or Walter White 's moral choices , but then that 's largely the point , is n't it ? As I sit here waiting for the final season to unfold in another week , I look at the cover to the Season One set and think about the Walter White that was . To have managed such an evolution in the central character of a television program in the manner it was done is a remarkable feat -- unprecedented , really . There 's a lot to object to here in a moral and ethical sense , but as a fictional meditation on the nature of those choices -- and that 's in large part what fiction is about anyway -- Breaking Bad is hard to beat . Everything comes together so well : Acting , production , writing . This is one of the great works of the screen , big or small . Highly recommended .	1
Now many of you may be thinking the same thing and I don'tblame you at all . The mere mention of the fact has long helda power seldom used for anything . Again thanks .	1
This first season is fantastic . There are definitely relationship scenes that are skip-worthy , but the story feels original , and interesting . The young guy is dumb , but that 's ok , we all know a few dumbies in real life . The following seasons are OK , but the first season really shines .	1
Best show on Tv . You never know what might happen on this show . There 's always a good twist on every episode .	1
Teachers do the most interesting things these days and teaching does n't seem to be one of them . Breaking Bad is an about a Chemistry Teacher who learns he has lung cancer . He wavers on treatment but does n't waiver on learning a new line of work to help his family after he is gone . It 's called drug dealing and he makes crystal meth . He even enlists a former student and high school dropout to help him in his new endeavor . The show is absorbing and very interesting . It is low key and not showy but does n't hesitate to see humor in the man 's predicament . His wife is pregnant with their second child . Their first child has cerebral palsy . His sister in law is a shop lifter married to a fervent DEA agent . The dropout he ignored in school now becomes his favorite pupil . So much for role models . Good show with a lot going for it .	1
Walter White 's ( Bryan Cranston ) life is not what he expected nor wanted . A mild mannered high school chemistry teacher , he just turns 50 as the show starts . His wife is expecting another child , his first some is a well adjusted 16 year old with cp and life for Walter is just , well boring.Walter 's job does n't hold the glamour for him that it did when he began . After years of teaching ( or at least trying to teach ) kids chemistry and trying to pass along his passion for this knowledge , he now faces a generation that more so than the rest just does n't care or take an interest . His second job working at a car wash results in an extra income but more degradation as the owner routinely disrespects him and has him do menial jobs.The worst finally comes around when Walter collapses at the car wash and is rushed to the hospital . Not informing his family , Walter is told by the doctors there that he has terminal , inoperable lung cancer . Where does one go when their entire world collapses around them ? For Walter it comes in the form of his brother-in-law , a tough talking jovial DEA agent named Hank ( Dean Norris ) . Cajoled by Hank time and again , he takes him up on his offer to go on a ride along when then next meth lab bust takes place . There is method to Walter 's madness here . He wants to get a glimpse of the set up being used with plans of making meth on his own to sell and make a fortune that he can then leave his family . Fate steps in as Walter sees a young man escape from the house next door and recognizes him as Jesse Pinkman ( Aaron Paul ) , an ex-student of his.Walter tracks down Jesse and offers him a proposition . He wants to be the chemist involved in making the meth that Jesse would then in turn distribute . A straight business deal that would yield them both a nice wad of cash . To do so they need a place to cook and with the DEA seeking out houses being used , Walter comes up with a plan . A Winnebago , a meth lab on wheels.They get set up , make their first batch and Jesse is stunned by the purity of the product . Walter gets in a poke at Jesse concerning his ability to listen and learn , something he did n't seem to do in high school . Had he done so in chemistry class , he would have learned the tools he needed to become a major drug provider.So here we have the set up . This is a true anti-hero if there ever was one . A mild mannered suburbanite turned into a major drug dealer ? Yes this is the basis for the series . But do n't misunderstand . It does n't glorify the drug culture or Walter 's decision to create drugs . The story more involves Walter 's attempt to do a good deed in providing for his family but at the same time making decisions that place himself and them in jeopardy . It 's more about living with your wrong decisions and watching as Walter and Jesse attempt to save themselves from the decisions they made.As the series progresses ( only 7 episodes ) we watch as Walter comes to life . Perhaps it 's the sense of danger , perhaps the fact that he is living outside of his comfort zone or perhaps it 's that he is facing death by cancer that has made Walter change . We see him move from mild mannered chemistry teacher to a man willing to walk into the home base of a wild and jacked up drug dealer to demand respect and money.But the series is n't just about that . It 's also about his wife and her love of her husband as she tries to understand his change , not knowing until halfway through the series that he has cancer . It 's about his son dealing not only with his own problems but with a father he loves but has n't quite learned to respect . It 's about a man driven so far to the edge that he gets involved with drug manufacturing even though his brother-in-law is a DEA agent . It 's about a man who when faced with what he feels are no options , turns to the darkest part of his soul . It 's about life as we probably all wish we never have to experience.The series is not just a hard edged drama though . Throughout the escapades of Walter and Jesse we get plenty of actual laughs . Whether it 's Walter standing in the middle of a road in his tighty whiteys with a gun he does n't know how to use or Walter grabbing his wife 's thigh in the midst of a PTA meeting , there are some truly funny moments.When I first heard of this show it did n't interest me , it did n't sound like something I 'd like . The more I watched it on DVD though , the more invested in these characters I became . I liked Walter but not what he did . I felt for Jesse but wished he seek treatment . And I hoped that this family would find a way to survive everything that happened to them.It might not be the cup of tea that the average renter would enjoy . But the dark humor , the danger and the interest in the main character make this compelling viewing as it progresses . Cranston and Paul do a fantastic job as an odd couple for the current state of affairs . And once the series ends , you find yourself looking forward to season two ( coming out on DVD soon as well as season 3 starting on AMC in March 2010 ) .One thing that has to be mentioned again about this series . It 's the story of a man who produces crystal meth . It would be easy to write the series off as an homage to meth dealers and manufacturers . But that is n't at its root what the story is about . It 's about a man who makes the wrong decisions for the right reasons and then has to face the consequences . Movie makers have made films about bad guys doing bad things for years and yet we 've found ourselves both enjoying the films and rooting at times for the bad guys ( think BONNIE AND CLYE , BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID and possibly even Hannibal Lecter when he snacked on characters we learned to hate ) .My biggest fear with this series is that it will become the norm . With series like WEEDS where a recently widowed mother becomes a major marijuana dealer or DEXTER where a serial killer becomes a hero for killing bad guys and other serial killers , a trend seems to be starting . And with Hollywood being a place that loves to imitate or repeat past successes with poor quality knock offs , this could turn out to be just the first of many shows like this . Let 's just hope that they know it 's good and do n't move forward with plans on shows about loveable hit men , goofy corrupt politicians or silly next door neighbor pedophiles .	1
I was hooked the moment this started and I met the lead characters , Mr. White is great , Jesse is adorable , Hank is hilarious the kids and a wifes are a perfect fit .	1
This show is NOt for kids . In fact , the lead character is a man driven by anger and humiliation to do everything that is wrong . He literally breaks bad in his fifties as he condemned to die from cancer . The show is well written with a large amount of very dark comedy in it . It 's very unpoliitcally correct in a bad way , but it also does depict how nasty some people are . Meth of course is destroying whole communities , so the writers picked the most offensive drug they could for the character to fall into . After all breaking bad pot man would n't be that offensive would it ? The acting is great , with emmies ' won by cast members over the years . This is not a nice show , but it is dark and horribly funny . This looks best in hd of course . SO a blu ray would be the best way to go . or hd video .	1
I & # 8217 ; m several years late to the Breaking Bad party , and I just got on the train by watching Season One . The acting is very good and you really get sucked into the story . Despite being such a bad topic & # 8211 ; person turning to drugs for money , the associated destroying of lives , etc . & # 8211 ; you find yourself rooting for the new drug dealer . The series is engaging and I am off to order Season Two.Rather than a DVD , I purchased the season via the Video on Demand and have watched it on both my TV and Kindle Fire . I really like the portability vs. having to have a DVD player !	1
The unsettling tale of a good man turned bad out of desperation to not leave his family with mountains of debt . What 's the solution ? Open a meth lab with one of his old students and proceed down the dangerous path of operating with criminals and their drug lord overseers . To complicate matters his brother-in-law is with the DEA , his wife is pregnant and his teenage son has cerebral palsy . There 's a lot of humor interwoven with the more serious themes which I can understand or this would be unwatchable . The emotional arc of the main character , a borderline genius , is one of the more refreshing elements to watch . Think from caterpillar to butterfly ( but in a bad way ) . Good to great supporting cast ( Hank is the best ) . Extremely clever uses of chemistry ( especially with fulminated mercury ) . It has won several Emmies since 2008 , including PeaBody Award ( 2008 ) and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series ( 2010 ) . CHARACTER/DIALOGUE : B plus to A minus ; STORY/PLOTTING : B plus ; HUMOR : B plus to A minus ; CHEMISTRY USES : A ; WHEN WATCHED : January 2011 ; MY GRADE : B plus to A minus .	1
Wish I started watching it back when it was new but never too late . Thinking about buying the 2nd season .	1
I hear it gets rather raunchy as things progress but am nonetheless eager to watch further episodes , until I ca n't take it anymore , that is !	1
Great shows do n't come around too often , but 'Breaking Bad ' is one that belongs at the top the list ! Great drama , action , comedy , acting and story telling make this show a must see ! While this season only had 7 episodes , it packed more entertainment than 90 % of the theatrical films released in the same year.The story of a high school chemistry teacher who finds out he has lung cancer is both heartbreaking and shocking . The casting is perfect , the story is gripping and it 's the kind of show that will have you saying OMG more than once an episode . The series is filmed in widescreen to give it that movie look and there is plenty of adult action to keep the most jaded viewer interested from start to finish . If you like TV shows like 'Rescue Me ' or films like 'Pulp Fiction ' you will love the show ! Do n't pass this one up folks ! ... it 's a knock out ! If I have one gripe it 's that I think the price is a bit steep for such a short season , but considering the episodes are 46 minutes long . you can count them as 14 episodes of a standard 22 minute sitcom . Regardless of the short season , the release is full of interesting extra material and looks wonderful on Blu Ray .	1
I had heard about breaking bad from friends for years , but in my quest to not spend so much time watching TV I resisted for years . I finally broke down and bought the first 2 seasons on blu ray and I ca n't stop watching them ! Bryan Cranston is an amazing actor and I ca n't wait to catch up on all the seasons ( up to season 3 already and I still ca n't stop watching ! ! )	1
Just finished season one and started season two . Was convinced to try watching by my daughter . She was right it is addictive ! ( no pun intended )	1
Character development at its best . At first I was reluctant , not wanting even to watch episode one , season one , of this series . In spite of my reluctance , the name of the series kept on popping up in random conversations with my friends , and Netflix continued to suggest it based on my interests . I finally gave it a shot and was extremely satisfied with not only the quality of the acting , of the film ( filmed in 35 mm film ) , but also on the strength of the story itself.Walter White , the protagonist of the series , is a high school , genius chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer . After being told that the cancer was inoperable , and sneaking a peek into his bank account , he realizes his financial situation is n't healthy at all , worse off when he is offered medical treatment costing hundreds of thousands of dollars . S*** truly hit the fan for Mr. White . With less than a year to solve his financial crisis and having to pay a bucket load of cash for his treatment , Walter White recurs to a less reputable business to ensure his family 's financial situation before he lays down on his deathbed . His brother-in-law , a DEA agent , spoils hims by saying a meth-cook may make up to seven hundred grand in less than a couple of batches of methamphetamine . Being a chemistry genius , he has no problem in conjuring the most perfect , purest recipe for cooking meth . He would n't imagine hell would break loose while dealing with the maniacs in this dark business . He thought he would be staying within the confinement of his RV meth-lab and living his normal parallel life.At the beginning the purpose of the series was for Walter to justify the `` righteous '' act of providing for his family 's future when it meant going to the dark-side of money-making by not selling , but actually making the drugs : cooking meth ( a.k.a crystal meth , ice , clouds , crystal , glass , tik , catch my drift ? ) . It felt wrong but somehow , the fact that he was desperately struggling to keep his family from falling into the brink made the illicit act seem righteous.Molecular visuals of METH.Did you know that meth has a medical use ? It 's used for ADHD , narcolepsy , and treatment-resistant depression.After many attempts to sell what was renown as the purest meth out there , `` the blue stuff '' , Walter and Jesse ( his partner , a former high school student who is known to be a mediocre meth-cook ) found trench after trench , failing at their attempts to make money by selling their product , which albeit highly addictive , always seemed to fall into the wrong hands . Fail after epic-fail , they found themselves delving into the dark-world of selling drugs , not at all expecting it to be such a treacherous path . They then recur to an alternate source of selling their genius-formula by contacting a fearless and very well respected business man and drug lord , a strategy they would eventually regret.For me the series has been very enjoyable , with more than just a great story-line and more than just action-and-adventure psychological excitement . Character development was the biggest takeaway for me from this series : How a man in search of a path , once thought righteous and bittersweet , found that he , in the contrary of rejecting the darkest parts of himself as he deepened into the dark-side , embraced them -- the bitter portions of darkness gone after a prolonged dose of positive reinforcement upon earning heaps of cash by selling batch after batch of meth . How the character devolves was supremely achieved by the actor , Brian Cranston , winning him the Prime Time Emmy Award for three consecutive years in 2008 , 2009 , and 2010.In parallel with Walter 's charter development , I also admire Jesse Pinkman 's ( Aaron Paul ) devolution into a darker creature , more menacing , less tolerant and much less merciful . If he started out as a meth-head , he slowly turned into an character of many layers , of half-patched hidden depths . After having suffered beatings , the death of his true-love , and warming up to the idea of shooting people in the face , Pinkman becomes a man to fear , a man who has seen too much and is willing to die even if it means to defend what little is left of the world he loves.At the beginning of each episode , I was a little bothered by knowing I would have to watch so many more episodes that were fifty minutes long each , but hell , the production and quality of each one is so good that once you start watching it , you 're lured into its mind-gripping world ; you ca n't just shake it off . You 'll end up watching the whole series in a matter of weeks.Season 5 is said to bring us a total of 16 episodes , divided in two parts . The first part was debuted last year , and the second part will be premiered in August 2013 . It will surely be a blast as Mr. White 's , Jesse 's , Skyler 's and Hank 's future is wagered by the odds.DISCUSSION : I 've asked myself many times these two questions in the midst of each episode : Could a series like this one actually increase the production of the drug `` meth '' by amateurs in their own `` RV super lab '' ? Or could it , in the contrary , decrease the amateur production and consumption of the drug after seeing what effects it has on peoples ' lives and the appalling consequences it could have to their families ?	1
I love this show and wo n't bother to echo the many good reviews . I 'm just adding my hit on the symbolism of the names . `` Walter '' is reminiscent of `` Walter Mitty '' the repressed , nerdy guy who dreamed of bigger things . `` White '' -- -well he is the prototype good guy , lilly white and always doing the right thing . ( This is great fodder for Jungian analysts . ) `` Schwartz '' as they explain , his ex-colleague in grad school , means `` black '' and he has stolen Walt 's ideas and made a fortune from them . They had together formed `` Gray Matter '' which included both of them but apparently Schwartz got greedy and cheated out Mr. White . Then there is the interesting Jesse Pinkman -- -who is neither all white in his behavior nor all bad . ( I came to love Jesse . ) He spills his share of blood but shows a good heart . Then ... the sexy , hot and beautiful assistant principal , Carmen , ( red , if you do n't already know ) who seems to have the hots for the suffering White . I 'm only in the beginning of the second series so I hope to see more of Senorita Carmen.So far , so good ... .looking forward to more..in spite of too much violence for my taste.My only complaint is that some of those home homes do n't look like any I 've seen in Albuquerque and I 've lived there . All those leafy trees and green lawns ... .looks more like Southern California or Michigan than anything I 've seen in New Mexico .	1
it took a few episodes to really get into the rythem of this series . From the start anyway I was definately addicted . But by the end of seaon 1 I knew this is the kind of television that goes far beyond the typical material . It 's powerful stuff . By season 2 of found my self so additcted that I could n't watch less than 3 episodes at a time . I 've seen every season of The Sopranos , and every season of 24 , and up until I discovered this series I thought TV could n't get any better , but I was definately wrong . This is riveting story tellling . The tension , realism , originality , and creative visuals makes this probably this best series I think I have ever seen on TV . At times gut wrenching . Other times brutally realistic . And at other times suprisingly heart touching . Never predictable and always absolutely top notch and exciting story telling . Its bold , powerful and simply unlike anything you 've ever seen before . Season 1 was grade A , but season 2 is so completely astounding it 's hard to imagine anything coming close to the masterful achievement this series had acomplished . It 's simply breathtaking story telling I ca n't recommend enough. , This rates as the best in television hands down . Fantastic visuals , incredible writing , and might I be as bold to say that Vince Gilligan is truly a gifted writer and director . This is simply an astounding achievement in film making , Be it television or motion pictures . I ca n't recommend this series enough .	1
My son loves this season and I bought this season for him so he can enjoy it again . I rated it 5 stars	1
The season that started everything for Walt . I suggest you watch this if you are into action , and drama . What a great show .	1
Breaking Bad TV series is an outstanding piece of work from the cast and crew . Kudos to the director for making this one of the very best TV series that I have ever watched in my life . I rarely praise any TV drama but honestly this TV series is one of the most addicting series ever . The work is technically perfect ! Everything is well done from acting to sound effects to storytelling . There is something for everyone in the household to watch and enjoy.Warning ! After watching this series , you will find most other popular TV series dull and boring ! I am confident that within less than 10 mins into the season 1 episode 1 show you will get addicted and can not stop watching the series.Excellent ! 5 Stars !	1
First I want to say that this series is great and if you have n't seen it yet or are unsure about it , buying this affordable set is a great way to test it out with the first seven episodes now available in high def . If you like those episodes or if you 're one of the people who already love this series then this Blu-Ray Set is for you .

With a son , Walter Jr , who is disabled and a wife , Skyler , who is pregnant with her second child in her late thirties he decides the best way to take care of his family is to start making crystal meth with one of his old dead beat students , Jesse . The further he goes to try and provide for his family the darker and more complicated his life becomes with crazy drug dealer 's , increasing extended family issues with his wife 's sister , Marie , and to top it off a bother in law , Hank , who is a Drug Enforcement Administration Officer.The episodes found on this set are : Ep 1 : Pilot - Walter White is a high school chemistry teacher who learns that he has lung cancer .

I suggest fans of television that is made like movies give both these series a try . Breaking Bad 's first season barely broke the surface of these character 's and the storyline possibilties they hold . Thanks for your time .	1
Amazing start to the greatest tv show that has yet to come out . No show has ever induced so much binge watching out of me watched the first 4 seasons on netflix over the course of a few days	1
I 've now caught up on BREAKING BAD by watching all of Season One on DVD and Season Two on DVR . I 've been extremely impressed by what I 've seen so far , and consider all that I 've seen so far to be first rate . While I 'm not yet convinced that this is going to end up a truly great series , it clearly has enormous potential and is buoyed by several exceptional performances , especially by Bryan Cranston as Walter White.Just about everything that has taken place so far on the show has been beyond criticism . My hesitation in proclaiming this a masterpiece or even one of the best shows currently on television stems from a lack of sense what the endgame of the show is . Only time will eliminate my hesitancy . If it turns out that Vince Gilligan has a clear vision of where this show will eventually end up and if that vision is compelling , then this will indeed go down as a great series . Does Gilligan have a rough storyboard for the entire series ? Or does he just have a rough idea of where the next season is going ? It is an important distinction . Although Ron Moore repeatedly hinted that he had only a few ideas of where he was taking BATTLESTAR GALACTICA , the ending and the way it deeply coheres with so much that happened even in the first couple of seasons leads me to believe that he was essentially deceiving us and really knew all along . Contrast this with a series that was just making it up as it went along , THE X-FILES ( a series upon which Gilligan worked extensively ) . Although there were many great episodes on that show and a host of memorable aspects , in the end it was a show that was greatly harmed by the ramshackle long story arc , with a host of variant versions of key events ( e.g. , what precisely happened to Mulder 's sister and who his father was , answers to which changed several times over the course of the show ) . We simply have n't had enough episodes of BREAKING BAD for us to tell whether there is an end towards which everything is pointing.That being said , there are a number of things I really love about this show . Sticking with narrative structure for the moment , I like that many of the episodes more or less pick up from the end of the previous episode . I 'm a passionate believer in the superiority of serial narrative . Almost without exception all the TV series that I have loved over the course of the past twenty years have featured serial narratives ; virtually none have been episodic . I love the complexity of character and story that can result from this . And BREAKING BAD clearly has embraced the serial format . This will , in the end , be a series with a definite beginning , middle , and end.I also have been blown away -- along with everyone else -- by Bryan Cranston as Walter White . He was good in MALCOLM IN THE MIDDLE , but he is so much better in this it is as if Jerry Seinfeld had gone to sleep and work up Laurence Olivier . The range and depth of his performance is absolutely astonishing . I especially love how nuanced he makes Walter . Although someone engaged in criminal activity , he does so from a sense of moral obligation . He is pursuing immoral means to achieve a moral end . Above all he is a man dedicated to caring for his family . At no point is this illustrated more than in the moment where he compiles a list of the reasons for sparing and the reasons for killing Crazy Eight , a drug dealer being held in his partner 's basement . In the `` not to kill '' column he has a long , long list of compelling reasons . In the `` kill '' column , there is only one : if he lets him go he will kill both him and his family . That pretty much sums up Walter . He will do no wrong , unless by so doing he endangers his family.Another thing I love about the show is the wide range of responses it evokes . Although essentially a drama , I find myself laughing constantly . His life has been reduced to one long absurdity , and Gilligan does not hesitate to emphasize this by showing how ridiculous things are . But the show can turn on on a dime to go from humorous or dramatic , to out and out shocking . There are many , many OMG ! moments one the show.This has become one of the shows that I simply wo n't miss . No one who cares about quality television should neglect catching up on this one ASAP .	1
My introduction to the greatest TV drama of all time , and the beginning of Walt 's downfall . & # 34 ; Crazy Handful of Nothin & # 34 ; is the episode that hooked me , with one of the coolest Heisenberg moments ever !	1
This show is awesome . i got rid of cable last year ( one of the best ideas i 've had ) but i miss shows like this . i had no idea breaking bad was this good . a must watch if you 're like me and do n't have time to watch much .	1
I am at this point undecided as to whether I really enjoy watching Breaking Bad . After viewing the first two episodes , I am curious as to what happens in the story line , I am also a little disturbed about the subject matter . Seems so immoral .	1
People who wax philisophical about this being the Golden Age of television arent off in any way . Never before in my life have I been around so many solidly great shows airing at once . I 'm not saying this is universal , because of course this is also the era of reality TV , but between The Wire , Dexter , Numb3rs , Lost , Californication , etc , etc , I 've never before been as excited about what is possible with television as an entertainment media . I think we have far and away trumped movies as far as overall content and originality . Movies are all about the `` remake '' these days , but shows like Breaking Bad are about as original as you could possibly ask for.I wont really get into too much thematic elements or subject items , because I dont want to spoil one second of this extremely brief Season 1 , but Bryan Cranston absolutely hits it out of the park with his portrayal of `` average middle class dad '' . He plays it so numb , then breaks bad with such force ... I honestly think this is one of the performances of the year . I 'm not overstating this in any way , he 's phenomenal . He makes you so sympathetic to his plight that you really watch each episode absolutely rooting for him to best the challenging sitution he 's involved in . He 's the baddest nerd that ever was.Give this show one episode , and you 'll be hooked , and go ahead and set aside another six hours to marathon the rest of the series . Its that good .	1
AMC 's Breaking Bad is a terrific show , that has won an unprecedented number of awards , but it 's one that is extremely difficult to get into . The show is centered on High School chemistry teacher , Walter White ( Bryan Cranston ) , who discovers he 's dying from cancer . Determined not to leave his family with nothing , White teams up with his former student and local drug dealer , Jesse Pinkman ( Aaron Paul ) in an attempt to process and sell crystal meth . Producing the drug is n't the hard part , it 's distributing it while staying out of trouble . That 's easier said than done , especially when your wife is on your case 24/7 , and your brother in-law is a DEA agent.This show is terrific and worth every second I 've spent watching it , but I almost missed out . The pilot episode was not a strong one , in fact , many fans of the show have called it the worst episode of the entire series . If you can make it passed that , the first season is n't much better . The first season is extremely dark and depressing , focusing mainly on Walt 's illness and the effect it has on his family . It really was n't easy to watch , especially if you 've like me , and have had family go through the same thing.The good news is that after the depressing 7 episode first season , the show gets much much better . The network or the producers had to have to seen the same thing that everyone saw and the attention of future episodes is centered around Walt and Jesse 's growing business and the problems they have , including nosy family members , the DEA , seedy people looking for a taste , and of course rival dealers and gangs . The show really picks up in the second season and starts to evolve into the award winning crime drama it has become.Bryan Cranston plays Walt and how good is he ? He has won 3 Emmy 's , and has been nominated every season the show has been on . The man he plays is so complicated that you really needed the very best actor you could find to play him . Walt White is a mess of emotions , concealed within a strong persona , it 's this concealment that also helps to keep his conscience at bay , most of the time.Jesse Pinkman is played by Aaron Paul who is also very good . Paul himself has been nominated for four Emmy 's , winning twice , and will now and forever be required to call people bitch . Paul is a very good actor and does a great job playing a character who I find to be extremely annoying . Jesse is always managing to ! @ # $ thing up , he 's always putting them at risk by saying stupid things and doing stupid things . To be honest with you , I do n't care much for the character , but the fact that the character , as opposed to the actor , annoys me , shows how strong his performances is.Walt 's family is also a main stay in the show , his wife Skyler ( Anna Gunn ) , is as strong a housewife as I have ever seen . There is nothing Skyler White wo n't say and she is often Walt 's morale compass , albeit one that is remarkably nosy and unappreciative . His son is played by newcomer R.J. Mitte whose handicapped angle is actually real . Mitte was born with cerebral palsy , which effects his speech and movements . He admits that he over-dramatizes the effects for the show , but he is still handicapped in real life and one hell of an inspirational person . Through it all he has never let anyone tell him he ca n't do anything and he has been open and upfront about his condition to anyone who has asked him about it . He 's really an inspiration kid , who took a handicapped and used it to his advantage.Finally , Walt 's brother-in-law , DEA Agent , Hank Schrader ( Dean Norris ) , brings much needed comic relief to a show that can be hard to watch sometimes . Besides being a great cop , Schrader has a personality that is larger than life . Even in the context of a show , where the cops are the bad guys , you find yourself drawn to Schrader and rooting him on.Breaking Bad has won a total of 7 Emmy Awards and is one of the highest rated shows in cable history . The show most defiantly fits into the category of addictive television , but unlike it 's neighboring show , The Walking Dead . The acting is as believable as it gets and the story just gets better and better every season . If you can make it through the slow and depressing first season , you will find an unbelievable show that may very well be one of the best that cable has ever seen .	1
There 's really nothing more to say . I was hooked by the end of the first episode . The writing was spectacular . The acting was great . And it had you craving more . The worst part about the show was that it had to end . If you & # 8217 ; ve never seen the show , you definitely want to check it out . Trust me , you will not be disappointed .	1
Why oh why only seven episodes ? This is a great and addictive series that leaves you hungry for more . Ah , but maybe that 's the idea . Bryan Cranston is absolutely fearless as the cancer stricken high school chem teacher who has a lovely wife , a bright disabled son , and a daughter on the way . He 's also got a brother in law who is in law enforcement , and a talent for cooking meth that makes him a legend in Albuquerque . Meth means money , and money means the best in chemo and other treatments . Of course , it also means dangerous company , accidents and other physical dangers , and lots of pressure to produce more meth.minor spoiler below ... ..Cranston is also heartbreakingly good in the intervention scene , in which he at first lays out his case for not wanting to be sickened by the treatments ... before he changes his mind.Very strong episodes .	1
The first season of `` Breaking Bad '' establishes the tone for Vince Gilligan 's series ; Gilligan was fascinated with the idea of someone who went from an ordinary guy to the epitome of evil ; Walt ( Emmy winner Bryan Cranston ) after being pushed out of a company that he helped co-found has adjusted to life as a High School chemistry teacher married to Skylar ( Anna Gunn ) expecting their second child when Walt finds out he has inoperable idiotpathic non-small cell . lung cancer . Determined to leave a nest egg and to pay for his cancer treatments without breaking his family for his family after discovering how much money amateurs make creating crystal meth , Walt decides to do the same thing with the assistance of a former student and drug dealer named Jessie ( Emmy winner Aaron Paul ) . As Walt fights cancer and produces drugs he changes profoundly . He discovers the darkness that always lurked in his soul and allows it to consume him.Walt also must contend with his DEA brother-in-law ( Dean Norris who is marvelous and often overlooked by the Emmy committee ) and the fear he will find out about his extracurricular activities and try and prevent what he is doing from both Skylar and his physically handicapped son Walt Jr. ( R. J. Mitte ) The Blu-ray for the first season looks quite nice although the show occasionally looks a bit soft . It 's not a pristine prsentation but the show looks quite nice with improved detail ( the video noise is occasionally a bit distracting and in the form of increased 'grain ' ) . Before the Blu-ray I had rented the DVD set back in 2009 and it has many of the same strengths and weaknesses as this set just not quite as noticeable because of the lower resolution of DVD . Most folks probably wo n't notice the minor flaws in the transfer and , on the whole , the presentation is quite pleasing . Colors pop while depth and detail are noticably improved.The first season was shorter than all the other seasons with only seven episodes and they are spread over two 50 gig discs.The lossless 5.1 audio sounds marvelous and is top notch . English SDH and Spanish subtitles are available.The special features although limited compared to other sets . We get two audio commentary tracks on both the pilot featuring Cranston , Gilligan and a number of other cast members and also on `` Crazy Handful of Nothing '' on the second disc.We also get deleted scenes for three episodes as well as auditon footage for Gunn , Paul and actress Betsy Brandt ( who plays Skylar sister Marie ) .We also get a featurette `` The Making of 'Breaking Bad ' '' as well as an excerpt of the show `` Shoot Out '' about the improved quality of cable TV shows . `` Inside 'Breeaking Bad ' '' is a series of short featurettes . `` Vince Gilligan 's Photo Gallery '' can be viewed as a slide show.The first season of `` Breaking Bad '' establishes the tone of this brilliant show -- one of the finest written shows on TV -- and although the first season was unnecessarily short ( due to the Writer 's Strike at the time as I recall ) , the quality of the show is high.Highly recommended .	1
This season was resurrected out of the ashes of Jericho 's cancellation after the first season . Plus , things were complicated by Hollywood labor force walkouts . Eventually , due to MASSIVE fan base engagement with the studio , a truncated second season was approved , just to close up the loose ends from the excellent first season.No , it 's not as good as it would have been with a full season to develop and play out the various plot lines and character twists . But it is still GREAT television ! My rating of only 4 stars is due primarily to that truncated season ... they had to squeeze a LOT into those few episodes . Given that constraint , the writers and directors did a great job.Some do n't like Jericho because & # 34 ; it is too right-wing ; & # 34 ; oddly enough , folks on the right see it as & # 34 ; too left-wing & # 34 ; in its perspectives and plot developments ! Talk about irony ! Again , accept its limitations and understand that it is just ONE possible scenario of how the world could turn out as its characters endure rather extraordinary circumstances.Well worth watching ... but watch season 1 first !	1
It was a surprise ending and I was let down only in that it was the end of the show . Many of my favorite characters were killed but good prevailed in the end . Wish more series like this were on TV instead of the competitions and reality junk . I love a good story and good acting .	1
just when this show really took off , it stopped ! ! ! why do they keep crap on the air on not good ones like Jericho ? ?	1
I still have 2 episodes to watch of season 2 but have enjoyed viewing all of season 1 and the partial of season 2 . Nuclear disaster hits and a small town American misses the disaster and trying to survive with everyday drama and personalities added in . Boiling down to survival of the fittest .	1
About life after nuclear war . Amazon needs to get rest of series does n't have it all . I highly recommend . It .	1
Watched season 1 , got hooked on it , so when season 2 came out I had to watch it . I like the show , actors , and the content of this show . Would recommend it to everyone .	1
A top 10 show cut short . I ca n't say how much I enjoyed this show and was depressed and sorry to see it end . You really do root for the characters and they are well developed . How awesome is it to see an alternate Usa after the bombs go off . In many ways there are similarities to the current Usa with corruption at the highest levels and frustration with how things are run at the lowest levels being the common citizen . This is a must watch for any end of the world type of fan . There is allot of action and plot twists . I love how Texas was shown to be tough and key to the future of the country just as in History Texas has been a key state . I am a walking dead fan , breaking bad , arrow , Viking and Game of thrones to show some of my favorites if you like any of those shows you will love this one ! I watched it free on Prime but would of paid as well . Just watch it as the reviews show it is a 5 start show ! !	1
There were one or two that dropped in excitement a little , but all in all great story . The actors developed and interacted well . To bad it ended after only two seasons .	1
It was a well written show , that was cut short . The plot was very possible , are characters did an amazing job selling the idea . The show was very addictive , the excitement stay at a constant rate .	1
I show parts of this show in my US History class near the end of the year . It is what I personally think is a good representation of what would happen to humanity if parts of the country fell apart . There are flaws in some of the physics but I can live with that . I deal more with the psychology of the whole thing and how people would react to an American ending event . Story is excellent and the acting is really good . The second season was short and wasnt as edgy as the first season but a lot of unanswered questions are answered and all in all it was a good season .	1
Season Two of the TV series `` Jericho '' was n't supposed to happen ... the taut , terrifying post-apocalyptic drama had been canceled due to weak ratings , but was revived by the network after intense lobbying by fans . In this second season , the claustrophobia of Season One gives way to paranoia as the town of Jericho is taken over by a provisional Federal government based in Nebraska . As it turns out , this new government is the result of a political conspiracy , and the citizens of Jericho , like Kansans in the 1850s and '60s , are caught in the middle of a chilling civil war.The ensemble acting of the first season is replaced by a fast-moving , plot-heavy political narrative over which contemporary ( Iraq War-era ) politics cast a long shadow . The new government installs a Halliburton-like mega-corporation in charge of all economic activity in the town ; this company also owns a private , mercenary security force ( ala Blackwater ) which terrorizes the locals . Finally , the townspeople have to take a stand : are they going to knuckle under to a powerful , remote dictatorship , or will the spirit of 1776 survive ? Action junkies and fans of political conspiracy-theory films will dig this . Although it may feel a little rushed , this short season ( only seven episodes were made ) ties up most of the loose ends , and should satisfy most fans . Fun stuff , and a little scary , too . ( Joe Sixpack , Slipcue film reviews )	1
More of the same , but excellent show . I love these shows of survival as long as they do n't get too panic ridden .	1
My wife and I rated this a four-star series . The makers of the series quickly roped you into the story line , and the actors were believable . There was a sufficient amount of action with an appropriate combination of heroes and villains . We got hooked on the series and spent a good portion of one weekend enjoying it . We finished the entire 20+ episode series in just a few days . Our only disappointment was there was only one full season and a very-abbreviated second season . That being said , we found this series to be very much worth the watch .	1
I wish they would have finished the season , kind of a let down . I am going to buy the books though . I hope the money goes to the author and not the short visioned dweebs who dropped the series !	1
The season was way too short . It kinda did n't have a proper development . Skeet Ulrich is a underrated actor since Scream . Jericho was a very well written & acted drama , even though it was political I digged it .	1
an interesting plot line . How everyone reacts is interesting and makes you think what you would do in a massive disaster.Hope nothing like this happens but it makes you think .	1
I would have given it an excellent rating if not for the fact that the show was obviously cut short . To bad I did enjoy it .	1
The 2nd season of jericho does not disappoint . There are new villains including the newly formedGovernment and new challenges to face . The story remains so interesting and fast pasted.I kept coming back for the next episode which meant to me it s still a good show . Sometimes the secondSeason of a series is not as good as the first , that is not true of Jericho .	1
Writing is beginning to get worse . When the writers run out of what to write they turn to sex and violence . The story was much involved in the survival and now it is turning into a lot of batteling and some romance . It should stay with the origional direction set when the series started . Writers are making a mistake .	1
A fitting end to an exciting show . The second season is only 6 episodes long but very worthy to watch . There is an ending to the show though it leaves an opening for something more . Very nicely done . I wish there could have been more .	1
Watch it and see how America overcome comes domestic terrorism and once again victorious . True Americans are some of the toughest with courage and strength that shows through in this film .	1
This is one of the better & # 34 ; post-apocalypse/alien invasion & # 34 ; series if you do n't want your story or production too complicated ... it 's just easy viewing , with understandable characters and events .	1
Best & # 34 ; what if & # 34 ; series I 've seen since the & # 34 ; Amerika & # 34 ; mini series years ago.Very good acting . Very convincing.Hollywood used the & # 34 ; nuclear blasts & # 34 ; scenario , but I honestly do n't believe that scenario will be the catalyst to bring this country ( actually this planet ) to it 's knees . I believe it 's going to be some major cosmic event that 's going to change this planet and the life of every living thing on it . No one knows exactly what 's going to happen , but it more than likely will be life changing .	1
Jake : Is n't this something you should be covering ? Journalist : Nah , Cheyenne [ the new capital of the western states ] does n't like incidents like this covered . They control my credentials.Jake : What the hell kind of reporter are you ? Journalist : The working kind ... .Jake : So nobody 's reporting the real news , that gets you off the hook.Journalist : I used to work for the LA Times before the attacks , I won two Pulitzers , so I got a pretty good idea about what it means to be a journalist , and they do n't exist anymore ... .Journalist : People get the news they deserve ... .Journalist : When I was a kid , two guys took down the White House with a typewriter because people listened . They got angry , they acted . If I thought anybody was willing to listen , believe me , I 'd be talking.Heh . And they call this fiction . In the years since the show was broadcast , we 've learned that the above is true regardless of who is in office.The show 's as good as the previous season , which , since this is a continuing story , you 'll need to watch first . However , the story comes to no resolution in either version of the final episode ( which only differ in where one of the characters end up . )	1
When this show came out on TV I tried to watch every episode , but life sometimes got in the way . Watching every episode on Amazon Prime is the perfect way to enjoy the work of the writers and splendid actors without having to miss key elements in the story . They did a teriffic job and I just wish they had had the OK to make more episodes before the show was shut down . Of course nuclear war is the nightmare that no one in their right mind ever wants to happen . But as the story shows , the human spirit can rise above great tragedy and rebuild .	1
Wish they had continued on with this . Husband , sons and I all enjoyed the series . Great story line . Seems plausible . Makes you think .	1
AWESOME SHOW ! ! ! ! ! ! I DID NOT WATCH IT WHEN IT WAS ON TV ( BAD TIMING ) IT KEEPS U HANGING ON WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN ! ! ! WITH NO ADVERTIZING U GET THE WHOLE SHOW ... NO LAG ... TO BAD IT WAS CANCELED	1
This show needs to be rebroadcast over and over , and brought back to the networks . This country needs a lot more Major Becks . Like PFC Manning , and Ed Snowden . Libertarians , this is the show for you !	1
It is really to bad that this was the final season , the later seasons showed potential for some really great storytelling .	1
does n't quite follow the more realistic aspect of this kind of event but still a very good show . recommend watching .	1
Great show . It is also a difficult TV show to quit and do something else that I have to do . It is worth spending time to watch the entire episodes .	1
An entertaining show to watch . The series moves at a pretty fast pace and I have n't run in to any slow segments in the series .	1
This show is an example of how good TV can be . The situations and characters were all interesting . Each episode had lots of tension . You never knew what was coming next . I recommend this show for anyone .	1
Pounded through this show , the 30 episodes has some bumps , but all and all is a great ride . There are some great stories and intertwining of story lines with giving you just enough new information each show to keep you interested .	1
The best and the worst of human behavior is brought to life in this series as a small town copes with the aftermath of a nuclear war . The adorable Skeet Ulrich leads a stellar ensemble cast in this compelling drama . I wish the show had lasted a few more seasons . A contemporary and relevant show ...	1
If you like survivor check this out . I really liked it , well worth the ten bucks . I want to own them all and I do n't usually like reality TV .	1
I love Survivor and it does n't get better than this . This is , without doubt , my favorite season . Do n't hesitate to check it out .	1
Probably my favorite season of Survivor yet . Blindsides and backstabbing galore , just how I like my Survivor . It was so good I ended up watching the whole season in one day !	1
I purchased this one on streaming video because it was less than $ 10 for the season . If it costs more than that for streaming video , I prefer to own the DVD .	1
this season of Survivor . I wo n't tell you the winner 's name , but she played a fantastic game and is beautiful to look at . All the challenges were great and great statigizing by all the players .	1
There are several island shows in a row and this one showed the vast number of islands surrounding the location and volcanos . I always like the shows and enjoy watching over and over .	1
This season has the 2 biggest badasses in survivor history , Ozzy and James . They may be not the most strategic players and both get played by Parvati . Parvati is a pretty good player but not the best . She gets lucky that all the fans on the jury are obsessed with her . Amanda deserves to win the game . The fans are pretty worthless except Erik who is a pretty good player . Erik gets duped at a point and makes one of the dumbest move in survivor history . There are some early exits that are pretty disappointing . Ozzy finds an hidden immunity idol and replaces it with a stick and one of the fans finds it and thinks its the real idol .	1
While I 'll admit , this movie is a fun waste of time that fanboys of Jenna Jameson and Roxy Saint will love , I 'm at a loss to what to say about it . It 's not your typical zombie flick , per se . It 's not your typical stripper flick either . It 's not even a horror comedy . Yet , whatever it is , it is strangely a pretty good movie . The story has something to do a with a zombie-like virus passed along to a member of a military strike-team , who then escapes to a strip club where he bites Jenna Jameson , who the bites some more people . Robert Englund plays a strip club owner who realizes that there 's a lot of money to be made in zombie strippers - until everything goes wrong.Oddly enough , I still do n't know what to say about it except to see this movie . It 's a real hoot..lol .	1
The only reason for watching this movie or owning it is because of robert englund . and jenna jameson . This movie was actually pretty good . robert englund is awesome . and jenna jameson is totally hot . if love these two actors then you 'll love this movie	1
First do not let the name fool you , yes there are strippers and some nudity , but no more than in the average horror flick . This movie if HILARIOUS ! The political satire is utterly priceless and I thought the cast was lots of fun . You KNOW they had a ball doing this , it shows . This has quickly become one of my favorite Zombie/Comedy classics . Sure , there are some continuity problems , but so what ? It is so much fun who cares ! Take a chance on this little known gem , you wo n't be disappointed ! !	1
The title just says it all does n't it ? Zombie Strippers tells you by title alone whether or not this is your kind of flick or not , and if it is , you should be pretty well satisfied with what you get here . In the not too distant future , the government has outlawed public nudity and is experimenting with re-animating dead flesh . Hence the title , when a zombie outbreak begins at a secret , illegal strip club run by a germophobe ( a gleeful Robert `` Freddy Kruger '' Englund ) . It is n't long before a number of the dancers not only start craving human flesh , but also become an even bigger draw , which you know of course inevitably leads to a nasty , gorey massacre . With tongue firmly in cheek and even featuring some decent political gags , Zombie Strippers features some great practical gore effects ( and some cruddy CGI effects ) , and also features adult entertainment icon Jenna Jameson , who actually seems to be having some fun with it all . All in all , Zombie Strippers by all rights and purposes should be a terrible , terrible flick , but it ends up being an enjoyable romp that is more than worth checking out if zombies , B-movies , or just plain trash is your pleasure .	1
This is a very well done horror movie . Guillermo has certainly proven himself at very adept at creating moods , fantastical sets , etc , and this is no let down . Good story , and a few scenes of very scary stuff . Before you know it , you do n't even realize its subtitled . Very highly recommended .	1
This movie is a must see and one of the best . The film had a lot of twists toward the end but kept me interested . The film uses an unfolding mystery and atmosphere to create fear . The feel of this movie is dark and foreboding throughout the film . Simple things made this movie : the desolate seaside location ... the cliffs ... a burlap mask ... The house itself is creepy with dark corners . Dripping water , creaking floorboards added to the ominous feel of the movie . Only one scene involved gore - and the entire theater gasped when it happened . Rueda is wonderful as the tormented mother Laura . She carries this film to the end with palpable desperation . She appeared thin , and was not made up with hair and makeup which created more belief in her character . Hollywood actresses could take notes on her believability and strong performance.TOP NOTCH scrip/chills & acting MUST SEE ! ! ! This movie has the feel the `` The Others '' and has an `` M. Night '' twist towards the end .	1
I love a well-told ghost story . THE ORPHANAGE is fantastic ! It is a flesh-bubbler w/ loads of mystery and dread . If you enjoyed THE CHANGELING ( w/ George C. Scott ) , THE HAUNTING ( the original version ) , or any intelligent spooker , then consider this movie a gift from the ghoul-gods ! I was very satisfied w/ the story , the heavy atmosphere , and the puzzle to be solved . The ending is both terrifying and heart-breaking at once . THE ORPHANAGE deals w/ the agony of tragic loss as well as the supernatural . It is a human story that slowly shifts into nightmare . It is also about the unbreakable bond between a mother and son . Highly recommended . Spanish w/ english subtitles ...	1
Guillermo Del Toro delivers again ! The Orphanage or El Orfanto , whichever name you would like to call it , is excellent ! It 's a movie at its best ! Great storyline , great characters , a little spookiness and alot of twist & turns that you will never see coming ! The trailer for this movie , makes it out to much scarier than it is , but the movie will not disappoint.If you watch this movie and like/love it , watch Del Toro 's other movies , they are all good- Pan 's Labyrinth , The Devil 's Backbone and Hellboy !	1
It 's a good movie . A different ghost story . Also a good movie the `` Devil 's Backbone '' .	1
The old , old stone mansion that once was an orphanage sits isolated within its ill-kempt gardens and grounds . The abandoned lighthouse on the cliff not far away no longer shines a beacon . The cave below and the sandy beach still receive the incoming tide . Be wary . Laura Sanchez grew up in the orphanage . When she was about seven she was adopted and left . Now she is 37 , married to Carlos , and they are parents to a little boy , Simon , about seven . They adopted Simon , who does n't know this , and who is deadly ill with a disease only pills can keep at bay . Now Laura and Carlos have just bought the abandoned orphanage and are moving in . It is a large building of many rooms and hallways , with dark oak paneling , old fire places and frosted , etched glass . They hope to make it a home for children with special needs . There are no children yet , just Simon.Simon makes friends , make-believe friends . They tell him things , he says . `` I wo n't grow old . I 'm not going to grow up , '' he tells his mother . `` Will you be like Peter Pan ? '' Laura asks . `` Like my new friends , '' Simon says . `` There 's more than one ? '' `` Six . '' `` They wo n't grow up either ? '' Laura asks . Simon looks at her . `` They ca n't , '' he saysSimon leads Laura in a game to discover clues , a game he and his friends have invented . Suddenly the game is foreboding . `` You 're not my mother ! '' Simon screams at Laura . `` Who told you that ? '' she asks , stricken that this little boy , her son , is facing something she and her husband were waiting to tell him when he was older . `` My friend told me , '' Simon says . `` What friend ? '' `` Tomas , '' Simon yells , crying and defiant . `` Tomas told me the truth , that I 'm just like them ... . I have no mother or father and I 'm going to die . `` Days later , Simon disappears , apparently kidnapped . The parents , with Laura increasingly frantic , try everything to find him . In time , there will only be Laura and this moldering stone mansion where she was raised as an orphan with other orphans . We begin to learn what happened there when Laura as a child left.So ... whose imagination , whose story are we inhabiting ? `` Horror '' is a term that has been debased in the movies over the last thirty years or so . Technology and computers have eliminated most of the need for imagination and the kind of dread we make for ourselves out of little things . Market research drives so many creative decisions into the dead end of splatter and special effects . The Orphanage is just slightly a horror movie . It is lonely , deliberative , sad , thoughtful , even quiet , even , surprisingly , with a degree of contentment at the conclusion.All the actors do fine jobs , and there is a notably quiet and intense performance by Geraldine Chaplin as a psychic whose own death is near . It is Belen Rueda as Laura who helps make this movie something special . There are so many opportunities for intense `` acting , '' distraught `` acting , '' tearful `` acting . '' Rueda does nothing of this . We believe her as Laura because she does n't try to over-dramatize Laura . Laura is often intense and sometimes distraught . She also puzzles through this mystery , is determined to find her son and can take action . But Rueda never overacts . Thanks to Rueda 's performance and fine directing and screenwriting , I think The Orphanage establishes itself as an unusual and intriguing movie.The audio and video transfers are very good . There are some typical `` How we made the movie '' extras . If you have a taste for unusual and unsettling stories , I recommend you tryThe InnocentsandThe Sixth Sense ( Collector 's Edition Series ) .	1
The Orphanage ( El Orfanato ) tells the story of Laura , her husband , Carlos , and their adopted son , Sim & oacute ; n. Laura was adopted herself and spent time at an orphanage when she was younger . She returns to the same orphanage as an adult with her family to do the same thing for handicapped children now that it do for her so many years ago ; take care of them until they can find families of their own . Sim & oacute ; n is n't much different from other kids his age and has a couple imaginary friends , but it 's when he meets a new one one day at the beach in a cave that things start to get strange . There 's something more going on . It seems as if the children may have never left after all ... The Orphanage is able to accomplish being the creepy masterpiece that every horror film in the past ten years has tried to be . That 's not to say there have n't been good horror films in the past ten years , but there are only a handful and this one has to be close to the top . What sets this apart from other horror films is that it does n't rely on cheap scares or CGI to try and scare the viewers . It 's all about the atmosphere and it works so well . In general , I 'm not a fan of horror films that are about ghosts . This seems to be on a whole different level though . It 's also one of the more original horror films I 've seen in quite awhile , which is quite a relief . I 'm not sure about you , but I 'm kind of sick of sitting through a movie and realizing it reminds me of this movie or this movie or it `` pays homage '' to three movies in one film . I 'm not saying that influences are a bad thing , but originality is so hard to come by these days and I embrace it with open arms . It also seems like whatever movie Guillermo Del Toro is involved with can do no wrong , in my eyes . I know he only produced this film , but still . I 've yet to see any movie with his name in the credits that I did n't love.I do n't think this film is for everybody though . If you 're looking for the next Ring or Grudge or if you 're wanting blood spewing from amputated limbs , then you 'll probably want to look elsewhere . But if you 're looking for an intelligent thriller that is heartbreaking yet beautiful , then I think this is a movie you should look into.Rating : 8/10	1
THE ORPHANAGE is scary . Not Hollywood-hey-let's-show-all-our-cards scary . I 'm talking about cover your eyes , look away , symbolic terror . A woman wiping her face with what we know to be human ashes . Creepy figures half-seen and then gone . This is a film that gets under your skin.The plot is fairly simple : Laura moves into the orphanage where she grew up . With her is her adopted son Simon and her husband Carlos . Before moving into the Orphanage , Simon had two imaginary friends ; after a day in the new place , he has six . And then a strange old lady shows up ... and then Simon goes missing . Months pass , and eventually Laura feels compelled -- against her husband 's wishes -- to seek help from beyond.The film plays with typical horror stereotypes : creepy old buildings ; creepy little children ; creepy old people . What makes everything work here is director J.A . Bayona 's understated style ; he does n't spell things out for us , he lets the tension -- and character development -- build , until we reach a gut-wrenching climax . You can see it coming , of course ; the problem with horror films these days is that there 's not a lot that has n't been done . Thus , we must focus on HOW it is done ; and in this regard , THE ORPHANAGE excels.The lead performances from Belen Rueda and Fernando Cayo are rock-solid ; supporting roles -- especially an incredibly spine-chilling turn from Geraldine Chaplin -- are just as good . In case you 're wondering : Guillermo Del Toro 's presence is felt , but only in an off-hand way . Some scenes are so horrifically beautiful , one ca n't help but be completely awed . This is , ultimately , a beautiful little film ; not the greatest horror movie ever made , but certainly a rare treasure , and proof that there is still gold to be mined in the genre , even if it takes a fresh face like Bayona to find it .	1
I didnt mind too much that the movie was in Spanish . I just switched the subtitles on to English . Which i do frequently when watching anime and other things . While the movie itself was as frightening as I thought it would be . The Oprhanage works because it leaves you thinking that something scary is coming around the bend or right there behind you . It works due to the acting of the main lead character played by Belen Rueda and the children that are running rampant all over the house.It revolves around the house that she used to live in as an orphan herself . Her husband and child move into the house and things start off innocently enough minus a visit from a creepy old lady that might be alive or not . Until they are having a hosting party and her son disappears madness ensues and things start getting crazy . Not a violent , horror type movie . Its more of a thriller with mixes of horror thrown in as well.The end result a solid movie that really enjoyed ... even the ending worked for me as well .	1
Amid the current crop of slasherly , hyperviolent horror films , `` The Orphanage , '' from Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona , stands out as an artful , restrained gem of the genre . The movie is driven by plot , personality , fine acting and gorgeous cinematography . Although many elements are familiar ( with wisps of `` The Shining , '' `` The Devil 's Backbone , '' and numerous other classics ... ) the film still feels fresh . Lead actor Belen Rueda 's turn as a mother fighting to get her child back from the grip of supernatural forces is a powerful performance ; indeed , everything about this film is well-crafted and intelligently assembled . Worth checking out ! ( Joe Sixpack , Slipcue film reviews )	1
It is a horror movie of sorts , but also a tragedy , and tale of some spiritual dimensions . Not your standard 'horror ' fare or slasher film and audiences who do n't come expecting that may find the story , upon reflection , to be quite seamless , clever and ultimately rather satisfying . I give it 4.5 stars . It is n't quite the odyssey that Pan 's Labyrinth was ( different director , same producer ) , but for what it sets out to do , it accomplishes much . The cinematography is top notch , as is the acting . Crystal clear transfer on the DVD . A story with a bit of a twist . A story that may leave you feeling oddly hopeful rather than frightened .	1
This & # 34 ; ghost story & # 34 ; is simply amazing , I watched it after learning Guillermo Del Toro produced it ( Pan 's Labyrinth is my absolute favorite movie ) and it did not disappoint ! It is a thriller from beginning to end - Definitely worth a look !	1
I love foreign horror movies because they often times breath life into a stale genre . We just do n't know how to do it over here anymore . And I loved this movie . It 's simple in a lot of ways , but twisted and it sucks you right in . I do n't want to give anything away , but you should really check this out . A really great horror movie !	1
A workshop in being scary . Amid the dreck of the genre , this movie shines . Dread fills the room as you watch . There is a moment of insight , as in `` Do n't Look Now '' , that fills us with despair . What great movie making . Run out and get this . Put it on your netflix .	1
The Orphanage or El orfanato is a horror film directed by Juan Antonio Bayona and produced by one of the most creative filmmakers around today , Guillermo del Toro ( Pan 's Labyrinth , Hellboy ) . I was just having a conversation with my brother the other day about horror films and how I often , unintentionally perhaps , rate them on a scale . In other words , a four or five star horror film is probably not the same as a four or five star drama in most cases . The Orphanage really is a four star movie because it is more than your typical horror fare . Let 's call it a supernatural thriller instead . It was nominated for 14 Goya Awards and won seven.The film opens at an orphanage and we briefly see young Laura find out that she is leaving . Years later and Laura decides to return by actually buying and living in the orphanage with her husband Carlos and her son Sim & oacute ; n. Sim & oacute ; n makes several imaginary friends and the plot unfolds with a series of effective and believable twists and turns . It would be a mistake to give anything else away here.It really is impressive how far a film like this can go with good acting , smart writing , and solid suspense . After the movie was over I realized that the twists were unpredictable to me because I was n't waiting to find out what they were . I was preoccupied with an engaging screenplay and atmosphere . I actually cared about the characters too much to focus on forecasting the secrets . The Orphanage made me excited to go along for the ride without even realizing . Bayona had me trust his film at just the right times and for that I was caught off guard , and the film 's surprises were far more rewarding.While watching this movie I kept thinking of films likeThe Changeling , The Others , The Sixth Sense , or even del Toro'sThe Devil 's Backbone . I probably think of those movies not just because they are like-minded supernatural thrillers but because they are impeccably well crafted films . I give The Orphanage a very high recommendation and it is probably the best movie of its kind from 2007 .	1
Well above average haunted house film . As emotional as it is scary.The same could be said of most of producer Guillermo Del Toro 's films.The story feels a little too familiar for most of it 's length to quitemake it to classic film status , although the last 10 minutes doelevate it to something more moving and more thoughtful than 95 % of thegenre pictures currently being made.Wonderfully acted by Belen Rueda , as a mother whose child mysteriouslydisappears . Well shot as well.The kind of film I look forward to re-watching , sure that now that Iknow its secrets , there 's even more to be uncovered .	1
THE ORPHANAGE is a terrific ghost movie.Not only does it have plenty of moments that will make you jump in your seat , and I can assure you that I did several times , but it also contains a very intelligent , human story that makes you care about the people involved.The exquisitely photographed Spanish-language picture ( with English subtitles ) was directed by J.A . Bayona and co-produced by Guillermo Del Toro . The filmmakers describe it as `` a Peter Pan-like story from the mother 's point-of-view '' .Belen Rueda , in an award-worthy performance , stars as `` Laura , '' a wife and mother , who with her family buys the seaside house that was once the orphanage where she was raised . They have no sooner moved into the mansion when her son starts seeing `` invisible friends , '' and shortly after that , he disappears . Laura 's husband ( Fernando Cayo ) thinks the boy was kidnapped , but Laura is positive that he was taken by the ghostly children in the house.Geraldine Chaplin has a strong cameo role as a medium.Leave the lights on for this one . Michael B. Druxman	1
`` The Orphanage '' is a rare horror film whose strong emotions and believable motives make it a tear jerker as well as a supernatural thriller . Laura ( Belen Rueda ) spent half of her childhood in an orphanage on Spain 's coast , before she was adopted . As an adult , she returns to the enormous and beautiful home , long since fallen into disuse , with her physician husband Carlos ( Fernando Cayo ) and 7-year-old son Simon ( Roger Princep ) . The couple intend to re-open the establishment as a home for disabled children . But Simon 's temperament is becoming belligerent , and he is fast accumulating imaginary friends . Then he disappears without a trace.This is a ghost story , but , in spite of its supernatural elements , `` The Orphanage '' has a rigorous logic . I appreciated that , as horror films so often get sloppy with their narratives . The story is propelled forward by two strong emotions : fear of whatever lurks in the house and Laura 's fierce maternal love . Laura takes the audience with her on frantic searches for clues , which give the film an action movie pace and emotional immediacy between the thoughtful lulls . At the halfway point , I thought the film lost its pacing and went off the rails until I realized that the film -and the audience 's perception of it- pivots at that point . Then I was impressed by the well-conceived structure.Director J.A . Bayona , writer Sergio G. Sanchez , cinematographer Oscar Faura , and editor Elena Ruiz , amazingly , are all working on their first feature film . Bayona harkens back to the best years of Hollywood genre filmmaking by creating the orphanage completely on a soundstage . It 's a stunning set and a wonderful character in the movie . They go easy on the score and try to tell the story visually as much as possible . Belen Rueda makes us feel her anguish , desperation , and fear at the loss of her son . `` The Orphanage '' is top-notch gothic horror , comparable to the best psychological thriller/horror films that have come out of Asia in recent years . In Spanish with optional subtitles.The DVD ( New Line 2008 ) : `` When Laura Grew Up : Constructing the Orphanage '' ( 16 min ) interviews director , producers , writer , cast , et al about characters and themes , acting with children , the set , digital effects , and the score . `` Tomas ' Secret Room : The Filmmakers '' ( 10 min ) is a documentary in 5 parts about various aspects of production : the crew , the score , the orphanage , digitally effects , the title sequence . `` Horror in the Unknown : Make-up Effects '' ( 9 min ) interviews the make-up artists about Tomas , Laura 's leg , and Begnina 's make-up . In `` Rehearsal Studio : Cast Auditions and Table Read '' ( 3 min ) , the director talks about working with the actors . There are 6 Still Galleries of 198 sketches and photos . `` Marketing Campaign '' includes 2 Spanish trailers , 2 US trailers , and 12 posters . Subtitles for the film are available in English and Spanish .	1
I decided to buy this based on the good reviews and the fact that Guillermo del Toro -- one of my very fave directors , and the director of my fave ghost story -- The Devil 's Backbone -- produced this.Well , no disappointment here . Not in any part . The acting , the direction , the scenery , the set design , the script , the music , the ending -- it all worked together , all paid off.This starts off slowly , gently . But from the first images of children playing a game in the yard fronting a large , mansion-style orphanage -- the shadows , the direction , the way the action of an innocent game is set up -- perfectly sets the tone of the film . It 's nostalgic , but it 's also slightly creepy . It foreshadows a lot . Pay attention.Zoom years later . One of those children who 'd been playing in the yard , the girl Laura , is now grown with a son . We find out the main characters -- mother Laura , father , son Simon -- have purchased the former orphanage and plan to set up a residence to care for special needs children . Simon , himself , is a special needs child : He has HIV.Soon , the game of `` invisible friends '' takes on an ominous reality . And every scene builds tension , builds , builds , until we really are at the edge of our seat as this mother is thrown into the greatest nightmare of parents.The film then asks the question -- of the lead and of the viewer -- how far will a mother , this mother , go to find her missing son ? While the conclusion felt inevitable and was pretty obvious quite early on ( the clues are all there , and the script does not cheat ) , it 's the HOW of getting to it that makes this all work . Almost all is fairly foreshadowed , but the small actions and words that lead us along to those conclusions can be easily missed if we focus on something that seems more emotional.I can not describe how beautiful the finale -- the climactic moment -- is . Tragedy , sorrow , redemption and beauty all coalesce . It is a miraculous cooperation of acting/direction/storytelling/setting/lighting and music that brings us to this moment of bittersweet magic.The denouement is lovely , too , leaving us with a feeling of what we lose as human beings , mortal beings , and what we can gain if there is more than mere matter.Tragedy redeemed -- that 's what I thought as I went to bed after seeing this.Yes , this is a ghost story that disturbs mightily , and the scares are surely present , but it is not a gore-show . It is a more human and artistic ghost story , and is in fact MORE than a ghost story . It 's a story of family and friendship , and of a mother who will not give up , because the deepest love outlives the grave , even defeats the grave.You really need to see this film . Magnificent . ( And pay very close attention to EVERYTHING , for all the strings come together in the end . ) Mir	1
If you have n't seen the George C. Scott film , The Changeling , do so as soon as possible . Watch it with the lights off and no distractions , it will freak you out . The Orphanage is similar in pace and scares to that film . It 's often what you do n't see that scares you the most . Belen Rueda who plays the mother delivers a very strong performance and really holds the movie together . Worth seeing in theaters , even though some people failed to realize it was going to have subtitles and walked out . Do n't people find out a little about a film before shelling out $ 10.00 to see it ? I guess not .	1
Excellent Spanish gothic film by first time director Juan Antonia Bayona that feels like and Edgar Allan Poe poem . Along the lines of `` The Devil 's Backbone ( Special Edition ) , andThe Others ( Two-Disc Collector 's Edition ) this Spanish film proves to be a great haunting movie . Creepy in all the right places . Suspense builds throughout the movie at a perfect pace ; this is basically the perfect formula film . First off , the acting is phenomenal . Every single actor , especially Bel & eacute ; n Rueda , delivers an exquisite performance that comes off naturally.The film itself is the perfect formula for a horror movie . But herein lays one of the few flaws of this film : it is too formulaic . If you have seen as many horror/suspense movies as I have , you will be able to predict what happens in this film to a T. A bit predicable to the horror fan , the movie still manages to deliver great suspenseful scenes that made pause and become absorbed in the film . There were some scenes that should have been edited out , but the film had a great pacing , building the suspense on each and every scene . The movie had great pacing and great horror moments that left you wanting to see more . The cinematography and direction are the best aspects of this movie and what gives it that great feeling of suspense throughout . The storyline itself was pretty good , but left many things unexplained . I think that many aspects were inconclusive and unfinished . Still , the film is really good and it is one to watch .	1

I fully figured this film to be pretty much what I expected , which was another over rated supernatural thriller . Indeed within the first 30 minutes I was feeling like it might be just that . I found that portion of the film to be pretty average noting along the way the superb acting and production values . But the film quickly gets much more atmospheric and fills its canvas with an unusally creepy and melodramtaic tone . The story s suprisingly unique even if there were moments that seemed like they could have been inspired by films like Poltergiest or The Others . As a solidly moody supernatural story this film ranks as one of the better ones I have seen . And there is plenty of good creepy scares and horror along the way . The film gets more intense as it goes along . I found this film to sometimes be a soild performer as horror films go . It was often indeed very creepy and made me squirm more than once , I foud my self biting my nails , which is something I havent done in a good long time at the movies . There was some subject matter here and there that seemed a little bit contrived and predictable , and the end was not much of a suprise , but mildly touching . Some members who reviewed this film commented that it made them cry . Im figuring they were refering to the end . But the end really didnt bring me to tears , and I love a good tear jerker the same as the next person . I agree though that it was rather touching at then end though . Its rare that a horror thriler really is truly good nowadays , but this one delivered some solidly crafted chills that really made the movie truly worth taking special notice of . Ive seen better but this movie was truly very good .	1
Film that explores themes of : childhood , death , motherhood and orphanage . Produced by Guillermo Del Torro it still has dark tones similar to the ones we say in `` Pan 's Labytinth '' . Some of the scenes are just too gruesome , even for the adults to watch . We meet Laura , a woman who used to be orphan herself who now has adopted son Simon with potentially fatal desease . Simon is a sensitive and lonely child and he has imaginary friends . But when the circle of his imaginary friends starts to grow , his worried parents arrange for the children 's party in their new home that used to be an orphanage where Laura grew up before she herself was adopted . Before long , Simon disappears and police has no clues on his whereabouts . The love that Laura feels for Simon is unconditional . She wants to find her little boy no matter what the cost . It is at that point that we see what a true motherly love is . It is also heartbreaking after we learn that Simon 's desappearance and ultimately his death is partially her fault too . I liked film 's idea on how living family left behind has strong ties with people they were close to once , long gone . Just as Laura has strong impressions of her son being around , so does Laura 's husband about her presence once she is gone to another world . The bond we have with certain people is unbreakable between the two worlds . It is there to sustain us in times of grief and emotional pain . Not as powerful as `` Pan 's Labyrinth '' but very touching nevertheless .	1
I feel the key thing to remember when thinking about THE ORPHANAGE is that this is a ghost story , not a horror movie . The idea , the intention , is the creep out the viewer , to give the viewer pleasant chills . It 's the kind of movie that does n't merely FEAR the afterlife , it accepts that ghosts can have their own motives that are just as worthy as the motives of living folks.THE ORPHANAGE comes from the current revival in the ghost story within Spanish cinema . Fortunately , we have n't had to endure too many English language remakes ( like we did with many of the misguided Americanizations of Japanese films recently ) . We get to see the original films , in their original languages , with subtitles . Although THE OTHERS was remade into English , a terrific film like THE DEVIL 'S BACKBONE is only viewable in Spanish right now . That film is simply too steeped in Spanish history to be in any other language.THE ORPHANAGE takes place in a deserted old mansion that some 30 years prior had served as an orphanage . The main character is returning with her adopted son and her physician husband to reopen the facility into a home for special needs children . The mood of the movie is one of foreboding right from the start ... how could this rundown , dusty old place every be an inviting home for anyone ? Sure enough , right away the young son Simon begins to `` see things '' and he quickly finds new `` imaginary '' friends that make him do things . There is NOTHING new about this whatsoever , and for awhile , you might suspect you 're in a clich & eacute ; ridden story.Then comes opening day , when the new children arrive for a sort of welcoming party with their parents ... and Simon disappears . The frantic search of his mother scares off the prospective clients , and for the next bit of the movie , we see the mother 's descent into obsession . She is convinced she can find her son . Further , she is convinced that some ghosts have taken him.Naturally , her husband does n't believe her and neither do the police . At one point , we have a GHOST HUNTERS INTERNATIONAL kind of scene , when a psychic comes to the house with her scientific crew . ( The psychic is played by Geraldine Chaplin ... an unusual but effective casting choice . ) This crew kicks things into a higher gear ... but they depart and eventually , mom is left on her own to unravel all the secrets she needs.I do n't want to reveal much about the plot specifics , because part of the fun of these kinds of movies is figuring out just what the ghosts want and who they are . The movie builds to a fairly surprising plot revelation and finally to a bittersweet ending . It 's a combination of SIXTH SENSE , DARK WATER and POLTERGEIST.It 's an artfully made film ... very atmospheric . There is n't much unusual about the story , the mood or the technical work ... the filmmakers are n't breaking new ground . But what this films DOES bring is a genuine feeling of sadness and a true glimpse at the bonds of mother and son ... and even a mother to all children in need . It 's a well-acted film , with Bel & eacute ; n Rueda really terrific as the mother , Laura . She 's in virtually every scene , and it 's her actions , reactions and emotions that drive the film . We experience in through her eyes . She 's a fragile woman who finds pretty large reserves of toughness when she needs to , and it 's nearly as satisfying watching her character grow as it is to see how the plot resolves.This movie does n't cover new ground or show us anything we have n't seen before . But it 's skillfully made with no irony , and it simply works . It 's a pleasurable ghost story indeed.One note on the `` R '' rating : There is one `` F '' word . Otherwise , I think it gets an R because so much of the death and jeopardy involves children . I think the film is fine for anyone 14 and over .	1
If you want a new spin on a ghost story that avoids falling into a silly formula , you just may like this film . It is heavy on atmospherics , has psychologically realistic characters , and you can not guess where things will go . I found it riveting and frightening , always wondering how it would turn out and did not at all anticipate how it was resolved . Indeed , it is so original that I am sure I will watch it many times for nuance and the strength of the performances.The story is about a woman who wants to return to her orphanage and give to others what she received . She has a beloved son with her , who sees playmates where there are none and disappears early on . The mother in her turn tries to discover where he went . As the film progresses , the viewer learns more and more about the woman and her past , which influences what she experiences in the present . Her discovery and then her choice are brilliant yet different than at least I assumed they would be , as are her reasons.Recommended for all who enjoy a good ghost yarn .	1
`` The Orphanage '' offers proof positive that quality filmmaking can triumph over even the tritest of themes . In bare outline , it 's really just the oldie about the family that moves into a creepy older establishment - in this case an abandoned orphanage with a very dark past - only to be hounded by the spirits of the people who died there under horrific circumstances . Laura ( Belen Rueda ) is a woman who was herself raised there as a child and who has now returned with her husband , Carlos ( Fernando Cayo ) , and their adopted son , Simon ( Roger Princep ) , to open a home for disabled children . In no time flat , however , things begin going bump in the night , and Simon disappears under mysterious circumstances . Could the souls of the children who died there be trying to contact the living , and could they be using Simon as a means of achieving that end ? Anyone with even the most rudimentary knowledge of how such stories normally play themselves out should have no trouble divining the answers to those questions . But in his debut as a director , Juan Antonio Bayona demonstrates a real flair for the macabre , so that every haunted-house-movie clich & eacute ; - every creaking door , every sudden apparition - that comes our way seems somehow new and fresh again . Perhaps it 's the artful imagery , the fluid camerawork , or the highly effective soundtrack - or all three combined - that account for the movie 's effectiveness . Whatever it is , Bayona is able to imbue even the most mundane object - a playground ride , a child 's doll - with the utmost menace and dread.Bayona has clearly done his homework , for , at times , the film seems to be channeling some of the `` greats '' of the genre , namely `` The Innocents , '' `` The Omen , '' `` Poltergeist '' ( especially with its high-tech ghost-hunters and creepy psychic played by Geraldine Chaplin ) , and the original version of `` The Haunting . '' And because of the quality of the work here , the movie emerges more as an homage to those earlier classics than a slavish imitation of them.People may be divided over the story 's resolution - finding it either immensely satisfying or unnecessarily corny - but no one can deny that , for genuine thrills and suspense , `` The Orphanage '' is one of the better horror movies of the past several years .	1
This was on of the best if not the best movies that I 've seen to come from Spain . Just about every element of this movie was crafted with loving hands that put the finishing touches on each and every scene before you and I would ever see it . The acting from Laura played by ( Rueda ) was very good as her emotions changed from a loving mother to a panicked , distraught woman on the edge after the disappearance of her son Sim'on . The other case members also give good performances , but Rueda is the standout in this movie . The director worked magic with his cast and crew to bring this story to life from the beautiful orphanage remodeled into the families home . The cinematography was noting short of spectactular from inside the home to the beach and cave to the shots in town where the accident occurs . The mood was thick enough to cut with a knife and is so seldom seen in movies of this genre where mood can make or break a movie . The writer and director were able to turn words into this increadible work of visual and audio art . My only real issues with this movie is it seemed to drag a bit at times and the tension buildup was not always rewarding or paid off ( ok we heard that but ? ) . I would have liked to of seen more from the ghosts prespectives than was shown . I do n't need tons of cgi or gore to make a story good , but I do need payment and thats where this looses a few points . Did it ruin the story/movie ? Not at all . It was just not as exciting/terrifying as it could have been . What happens to their child is a good and bad twist to the story and again kind of a let down after all that happens to the family and especially to Laura.Rating 0 to 5Story = 4Acting = 4+Direction = 4+Mood = 4+Fear/Chreepy Factor = 3.3Gore = 2 One scene was gorySex/Nudity= No/NoEntertainment Value = 4++	1
Why is it that Spanish people make the best horror films ? They just do ! This , THE DEVIL 'S BACKBONE , and THE OTHERS are some of my favorite horror films . They have the knack for tapping into my deepest paranoias and fears , and I love them for that . I 've always enjoyed a good ghost story - `` good '' being the operative word . You do n't find many good ghost stories lately . There is most definitely a drought , and so finding a film like THE ORPHANAGE is like finding a needle in a haystack - forgive the cliche . It is terrifying , it is beautiful , and it is heartbreaking . The performances , the direction , the writing , the score , and the SOUND MIX are all top notch and totally effective . I do not wish to go into the story or plot for fear that I may give something away , all that I know is that you should stop what you are doing and rent this , if you are in the mood for a chill . You will not be let down , trust me . You may even get emotional by the end of this film . It 's rare to find a film that can scare the piss out of you and make you cry at the same time.RENT IT , BUY IT , whatever , just as long as you SEE IT !	1
Guillermo Del Toro , the director of `` Pan 's Labyrinth '' and `` Hellboy '' , seems determined to revive the ghost story . Quite frankly , we need it . Too many ` horror ' films are excuses for filmmakers to throw buckets of blood and gore at the screen , hurling everything at us in an attempt to see what sticks , or more appropriately , what makes us sick . Gone are the suspense and terror filmmakers like Hitchcock ( `` Psycho '' ) , Robert Wise ( `` The Haunting '' ) and John Carpenter ( the original `` Halloween '' ) who created films with such skill , riveting us to our seats and scaring us away from showers , dark houses and babysitters . Now , ` horror ' films seem determined to use as many special effects as possible to recreate the goriest , most vial displays . How is this suspenseful or frightening ? It is merely sickening.So , it was especially nice to see `` The Orphanage '' , a truly creepy , scary ghost story produced by Del Toro and directed by JA Bayona.A brief prologue introduces us to the Orphanage , situated near the ocean . The headmistress takes a phone call and it becomes apparent Laura , who is outside playing with the other five children in the home , will soon be leaving her friends for the comfort of a new family . Many years later , Laura ( Belen Rueda ) , returns to the orphanage with her husband , Carlos ( Fernando Cayo ) and their adopted son , Simon ( Roger Princep ) . Laura and her husband have purchased the building and are renovating it to care for five or six children `` with special needs '' . As the renovations continue , Simon makes a new invisible friend and begins talking with him . This is really nothing new for Laura and Carlos , Simon has other invisible friends , so they are n't really concerned . But when Laura takes Simon down to the beach , and they explore the caves , Laura begins to suspect something is different . During the party , to celebrate the opening of their house , Laura has a run in with a strange child wearing a scarecrow mask and Simon disappears . Laura and Carlos search desperately for Simon , following every lead and looking everywhere . They meet a man who agrees to help and brings in a medium , Aurora ( Geraldine Chaplin , Charlie 's daughter ) . Infrared equipment is set up everywhere and they watch Aurora 's every move as she tries to communicate with the spirits , the presence she feels . After a particularly harrowing moment , she comes back to the present and tells them they have many spirits roaming the house . Six to be precise . As Laura becomes more and more determined to find Simon , she also begins to unravel the secrets behind the other visitors in the house . `` The Orphanage '' is n't so much about horror , or shock value , as it is about setting the mood for events that will transpire , creating suspense . From the moment Laura , Carlos and Simon return to the orphanage , to set up their home , we know they have made a bad decision . Why would Laura want to return to the orphanage where she grew up , to set up her new home ? This seems strange at first . Was she drawn back to this place ? Is there some tie with it , making her return ? Then , we learn of Laura and Carlos ' plan to reopen the home and care for children with development problems and disabilities . Laura wants to give back some of the help and kindness she received as a child , leading her to take on this huge task.As Laura and Carlos go about setting up this house , they try to provide a normal family life for Simon . But Simon has special needs of his own , and they try to deal with , and address these needs . They try to go about their normal activities , but every time they hear a crash , Laura stops and shudders , not from fright , but because some worker somewhere has probably cost her some more money or delay the project . This is a great way for the filmmakers to divert attention , to give us some false chills , and make the real scares even better.As they get settled in , and begin to explore the grounds . Laura tells Simon about the lighthouse just a bit away , and how she and the other children used to find comfort in it 's light . She and Simon spend a lot of time together and begin to explore the grounds . One day , as they enter a cave on the beach , Simon tells his mother of his new friend . Laura has clearly heard of other invisible friends in Simon 's life and seems to give it little regard , until he runs off and she sees two sets of footprints.When they are ready to open the house to the other children , they throw a party to welcome everyone . But Simon disappears and Laura has a run-in with a child wearing an old smock , like she wore at the orphanage when she was a child . More bothersome , the child is also wearing a burlap mask with a big smile painted on . Who is this child ? When they realize Simon is gone , Laura and Carlos put everything else on hold to search for their son.As all of this is going on , I was amazed at how well Bayona maintains the feel of impending horror . The key to this success lies in how realistic everything appears . Laura 's impending dread is almost palpable and Rueda does a great job of making her seem real . As the film progresses , the relationship between Laura and Carlos takes some natural turns and develops in a real way.But everything kicks into high gear when the medium , Aurora , played by Geraldine Chaplin , appears . Carlos is reluctant to go along with this , but because he loves his wife , he follows her lead . And Laura is willing to try anything and everything to find their son . Aurora 's associates set-up elaborate recording equipment throughout the house . Then , they put her in the old children 's bedroom and watch as she tries to communicate with the spirit or spirits in the house . She almost immediately makes contact and begins to walk through the house , trying to find out more about them , about what they need . As Aurora talks to these spirits , we follow her progress as Laura does , watching everything through monitors , the images captured in grainy green infrared monitors . As we follow her progress , we believe she is actually communicating with these spirits and hope she will be able to make some sort of breakthrough.Chaplin does a great job of making this character believable , scary , yet natural . Aurora believes she can communicate with the dead . Because she believes , there is no reason for her to protest when other people doubt . She knows the truth.More importantly , this sequence is all the more effective because we are watching along with Carlos and Laura , as Aurora progresses through the rooms . We do n't see ghosts , or spirits materialize out of thin air , we only hear Aurora trying to communicate with them . We only hear what she says , and it is cryptic at best , but it is very effective at making the scene creepy and spine tingling.Then , Laura continues to search and when the truth is finally revealed , we feel everything she feels.I guess , long story - short ( I know , too late ) , what I am trying to say is Guillermo Del Toro is quietly trying to revive the ghost story , the horror film , and wants us to feel the genuine scares and chills behind the characters and the stories . He is making some scary films , and he is earning our fright with intelligent , well-made efforts that just might prove more influential than the current crop of torture porn . `` The Orphanage '' is very successful at creating a mood of impending horror , terror and dread , using none of the techniques we have become accustomed to in horror films . Thank goodness .	1
Those who like such films as `` The Sixth Sense '' and `` The Others '' ( or Jack Clayton 's `` The Innocent '' and Robert Wise 's `` The Haunting '' ) should not miss `` The Orphanage '' ( `` El orfanato '' ) directed by Barcelona-born Juan Antonio Bayona . The Spanish film is a rather remarkable effort in that , like a classic ghost story , the film , which cleverly uses some of the familiar elements from horror genre , favors atmosphere over logic , and it works.The following paragraphs contain a mild spoiler . [ STORY ] Laura ( Bel & eacute ; n Rueda ) comes back to the abandoned orphanage by the sea 30 years after she left the place . This is where she was raised when she was a little girl , and Laura is going to open a new orphanage here for the handicapped children with her husband and adapted son Sim & oacute ; n. When everything is going well , however , some strange things start to happen . And finally during the party Sim & oacute ; n disappears suddenly , as if spirited away.Some say `` The Orphanage '' is a ghost story , some a supernatural thriller . Whatever the film is , it owes its success to Bel & eacute ; n Rueda as Laura . The Spanish star literally becomes the character she plays , a tormented mother whose beloved son is long missing . Her acting is so strong and her character 's sadness sometimes so painful to see that `` The Orphanage '' ultimately becomes an intense mother-and-son drama , even though the son is not always there.True , most of the narrative devices in the Spanish film `` The Orphanage '' are not particularly new - a little boy `` speaking '' with his `` imaginary friend '' or the `` secrets '' of an old house have been dealt with so many times before . But there is something very unique about The Orphanage , '' that is , something unnerving that curiously stays in your mind long after watching the film itself . It is hard for me to describe the nature of it . Maybe it is the shocking `` truths '' about the orphanage and the missing case . Or maybe it is some of the film 's very spooky scenes or the ending that defies our expectations . All I can say is see for yourself.The film is co-produced by Guillermo del Toro , of `` Pan 's Labyrinth . ''	1
Not unlike its predecessor , Pan 's Labyrinth , this film is beautifully photographed on a dramatic shore with a lighthouse and an old orphanage that has now become home to a couple with an adopted son . That the parents have kept the adoption and the boy 's HIV status a secret from him , and that his mother had grown up in the orphanage , set in motion a chain of sad and frightening events when the ghosts of dead orphans tell the boy the truth . There 's also a woman who had some information and was also a caregiver for a deformed boy ; unfortunately , she is accidentally run over before she can tell Laura , the mother , what she needs to know.The boy , Simon , disappears with the ghost kids and his heartbroken parents spend months searching for him.All of this ends with life after death ; Laura , Simon and the others die , but they seem to be very much alive , with Laura caring for them in the nursery since they will not grow any older , and Simon is reunited with her as well.There is even a hint at the end that Laura 's husband is greeted by her and the boy , though we will never know for sure.It seems to be a common thread in this director 's work that the living and the dead , the reality and the fantasy , are very close together and sometimes intermingle with each other . I will be very curious to see what he does with The Hobbit .	1
The Orphanage is a ghost story in the classic tradition [ at various times whilst watching this I was reminded of some of my other favorite ghost stories such as The Changeling , The Others , and at one point , even Dark Water , the Japanese version ] . It is high on atmosphere [ the imposing gothic mansion in a remote location , sinister looking people , mysterious noises ] and has a riveting plot.The story centers around Laura [ Belen Rueda ] who has moved into her childhood home , an orphanage , with her husband Carlos [ Fernando Cayo ] a doctor , and their 7 year old son Simon [ Roger Princep ] who like most children his age has an overactive imagination and an abundance of imaginary friends.They settle in nicely into the old mansion until one day when they go down to the beach to play - Simon lingers in a cave and when Laura comes to get him , he claims he was talking to a 'friend ' and even leaves a trail of seashells so that his friend , Tomas can follow him back to the house . At first Laura dismisses Simon 's ramblings as the figment of his imagination but soon comes to fear a more sinister force at play as a game of 'find the treasure ' seems much too elaborate to have been cooked up by Simon , revealing a secret that she wishes to keep from Simon.The story gets truly going when a party to welcome the newcomers [ Laura and Carlos had decided to take in about 5-6 children into their home , all with some sort of disability ] results in the tragic disappearance of Simon [ who had opted to play with his imaginary friend than join in the festivities ] . The rest of the story centers around Laura 's desperate attempts to find her son , even resorting to hiring psychics [ one played by Geraldine Chaplin in a very credibly portrayed role ] whilst her husband plays the role of the skpetic , refusing to believe in any supernatural explanation for Simon 's disappearance.There are some truly chilling moments in this movie - the sinister child with a sack over its face watching Laura in a darkened hallway , mysterious banging sounds that waken Laura at night , the psychic summoning and the discovery of some of the house 's old secrets - all these add to the storyline and keep viewers engaged . Though the acting itself is not extraordinary , except perhaps for Belen Rueda 's convincing mother in distress Laura , and Geraldine Chaplin 's psychic , this is not an issue for the real pull of the movie lies in the subtle unfolding of the plot through a series of 'clues ' that lead Laura to what she seeks.A highly recommended ghost story that does n't rely on any gore , sex or unnecessary special effects , but allows the natural light and atmosphere coupled with some very effective old school effects to tell a classic ghost story .	1
A bizarre but believable premise , puts these interesting slightly creepy characters on a course to what will probably be a total downfall . And yet - they all keep landing on their feet . It is great television featuring some young actors that I think will be huge talents in the years to come .	1
Season 2 is the `` bombs . '' There were good parts of each episodes . I 'm glad that I also owned this copy to watch , over and over again .	1
First , thank you to the folks at FX.Not only do you continue to deliver top notch programming for grown-ups , but you also make the seasons to work counterpoint to the other networks , allowing us to watch something other than reruns for more of the year.As season two begins , the moral dilemmas multiply and the plotlines are even more intriguing . Wayne , Dahlia and the two younger kids decide that they like being upper-class and decide to try and keep what they have despite the mounting risks.In another thread , the Travelers also begin to play into the plotline again . Oldest Malloy son Cael decides for good that the house at Eden Falls is stealing his soul , and opts to run away back to the Travelers , who have a new college educated ( from prison via ( University of Phoenix ) spurting his mail order philosophies in order to take control of the clan ) .The new season is finding more moral and legal dilemma 's for Wayne/Doug having to lie to his family and more issues with his less than bright adversary Dale . On the side of that , Dahlia decides she does n't want to be liar any more finds herself lying to the people she loves most.This show continues to be very good mature audience only entertainment , but not for those who are easily offended , but really you should watch this show from the pilot forward to enjoy it thoroughly .	1
I thought this show was very entertaining . The story is original . It has elements of comedy , action and drama . Now , if only there were more !	1
Watched the first season pilot on Amazon Prime , and ended up watching 11 hours one day then finished the whole 2nd season the next day . Fantastic . Except the ending . But wow , as if I was n't already impressed with izzard , this made me an addict . Minnie did the most amazing acting I 've ever seen her do . And the youngest boy Sam made me fall in love with the writers and of course the actor . Excellent . I need more please !	1
When I am well entertained and my interest is involved in what will happen next , it 's a good program and worth continuing . I highly recommend for entertainment value . Good acting too .	1
I give it 5 stars because the show is totally entertaining . Just the right amounts of suspense , excitement and comedy makes this a must watch show for me . Eddie Izzard and Minnie Driver play extremely well off one another . Their kids are played by Shannon Woodward and Noel Fisher who are both engaging and believable . The one downside is that they cancelled the show after only 20 episodes . Please bring back The Riches ! : p	1
We like this show . It is good and funny sometimes and serious and dramatic all at once . Lots of killing but not terribly gruesome .	1
I was n't ready for the show to end . I wa n't a new chapter , the traveler part . I did n't know who eddie lizard was before this show , and to put minnie driver with him was brilliant . There was so many chapters to choose from , why end something so brilliant ? This season is great , I just wanted to it to continue ...	1
As my review title goes , this was a great show . Originally I thought it would be a comedy , but it 's more of a drama with a lot of irony . Not your typical formula show , which is why it was so cool but also probably why it got cancelled . Very disappointed that they cancelled it halfway through the season ( can anyone say & # 34 ; Firefly & # 34 ; ? ) with so many loose threads that will never be tied off .	1
This is a series that makes you glad that you do n't have friends like this . If these are the average citizens of today we are all in trouble if they vote . . .	1
I have been a fan of all the top chef seasons , I enjoy the reunion specials they are funny and have a great way of looking back at some of the best parts of the season ... They do NOT disappoint .	1
This was a fun mix of entertaining personalities and obviously talented chefs . There are some intense tempers and personality clashes , but I like that that is not the focus of the show as with some other reality programming .	1
This is another winning season for top chef program . As in season three , this show came off with flair , some arguing , a little backstabbing and winning talented chefs , no matter who went packing . I throughly enjoyed this season as much as season three . What is also nice , that even though these chefs are highly competive and talented , it showed that they can compete and not be totally abrasive in their behavior towards one another . Give this one a try .	1
Wonderful . Loved it .	1
This was my first Top Chef DVD set . I did n't see it on cable . I was very impressed . I loved it . I have bought other seasons . I will be glad when all of the seasons are on DVD . I look forward to ordering them	1
Joe Dante 's `` Homecoming '' for Showtime 's `` Masters of Horror '' anthology series was easily the controversial high point of Season One . Alternately described as `` brilliant '' and `` complete trash , '' there were very few who straddled the middle on this political zombie satire . Needless to say , this intrigued me to contemplate how Dante would follow up this divisive little tale . Well , for Season Two , Dante clocks in with `` The Screwfly Solution . '' It certainly has a provocative topic , and is the ultimate battle of the sexes -- but I suspect that it is a lot less likely to engender the passionate debate of `` Homecoming . '' That is not a criticism , however , as I think this episode stands as one of the more sophisticated entries we 've seen so far ! Contemplating the end of the world , `` Screwfly '' offers a new take on the apocalypse genre . A virus affecting men is discovered where if the man is to become sexually aroused -- his feelings end up turning to a murderous rage . Needless to say , this does n't bode well for the women of the world -- as this rage is directed at them ! While this may , on the surface , seem to be a bit ( or a lot ) misogynistic -- the disease is handled well and its repercussions are real , unpleasant and not taken lightly . The principles include Jason Priestly and Elliott Gould as researchers trying to combat the virus , but this just may take the ultimate toll on their families . `` Screwfly '' may not be scary in the traditional sense if you 're looking for quick thrills , but the premise is chilling and disturbing and it leads to appropriate gruesomeness . The tale is well acted and sometimes harrowing , with an emotional context I have n't found often in the `` Masters of Horror '' series . In fact , through most of the film , I thought I might be scoring this episode at 5 stars -- that 's how pleasantly surprised I was by this tale . The end scenes , however , may be a bit prolonged for some viewers . That did n't bother me as it brought the real domestic dilemma of this story to the forefront . But , at the last minute , the film provides us with an unnecessary explanation for the whole catastrophe which was both unnecessary and not worthy of what has preceded it . This terrific tale went wrong in the end , but that does n't keep it from being one of the best this show had to offer ! KGHarris , 04/07 .	1
Have you ever read Poe 's tale of intrigue and suspense called The Black Cat ? About a murderer who walls up his dead wife and the cat gets in there somehow with suspenseful results ? The Masters of Horror Showtime series had Jeffrey Combs as Edgar Allen Poe in their second season , episode 24 of their anthology series . Poe is a drunk and is suffering writer 's block in his home in 1841 Pennsylvania . We see him unable to pay his bar bill , gets thrown out on his rear several times and has some interesting delusions caused by alcohol.He has two worries : money and his wife suffering from `` the consumption '' where she coughs blood ( quite realistic ) . Poe goes nuts at one point and smashes the piano they were going to sell . Suddenly the piano is fine . Alcoholic delusion ? The viewer is kept guessing throughout the hour episode as to what is delusion and what is real . When Poe crushed a half-dead bird , his goldfish disappears and when he pops out the cat Pluto 's eye ( ewwwwhh ! ! ) damn that 's hard ! Just hard ! As I 'm watching this I know that his wife died some years later from consumption ( TB ) and not an axe between the eyes ( another sight you want to wait to see well after dinner ) and so the story intrigued me and yet was fairly familiar with Poe 's tale.Was the Black Cat autobiographical , a real thing , or an alcoholic delusion ? Combs comes off of his film Re-Animator and again plays a slightly crazed yet not as eccentric part as Poe -- he even looks like the famous horror writer ! Drinking gallons of whiskey may not break your writer 's block but this horror story may . Highly recommended but not for the timid or the sensitive stomach ! !	1
i love this season . if your a fan , like i always say , and even if you dont watch this show , this is a great season to pick any episode you want and you will find that is represents the show . it has humor , ramsay going nuts , some sex appeal , an ending that is a surprise , and the chefs are tested in many extreme ways . and there are several chefs that are so nuts , you have to wonder how they make it through as far as they did . you get a good laugh at the chefs in this season . and so many funny lines . and of course a lot of really nice prizes along the way . its just a unique season in my opinion . you get more in this season than in many of the others and the others are fantastic . please trust me , especially if your a fan . just pick an episode . start with episode one of this season and you will be laughing really hard . even though its a serious show and the finale is huge . this season is so good you cant go wrong just picking any episode to see if you like it ... ..there is bad language , and a lot of yelling and screaming . its in your face tv . but i love the show . give it a try and i believe the majority of you will love it ... ... this episode is especially great ... .and you learn a lot as well ... .the cool thing about ramsay is he makes everything from scratch , everything is fresh , and no left overs . ever . that is what makes his food so special ... ..i really hope you ejoy it ... ..	1
i never seen this before ordering this , when i did get it i watched it and i loved it.im very happy i bought it..it was very good , ramsey is even crazier in this season .	1
My husband is a huge fan of this show , and was glad the 'Raw and Uncensored ' version was available for a good price . Thanks !	1
If you 've seen any of the previous seasons before than you know pretty much what to expect from it , basically you have about fifteen contestant wannabe chefs each vying for the prize of being the head chef of a renown restaurant but they must first pass Chef Gordon Ramsay 's cuisine qualifications first . The one thing I have to say that I feel anyone can tell is that these supposed chefs are n't chefs at all , we have one contestant supposedly who had almost eight years of culinary skills and they still could n't cook a steak right ? If you want to actually see real chefs check out the cooking channels Iron Chef this show is just about a bunch of wannabes trying to pretend to be good cooks just for their fifteen minutes of fame and a chance for a comfy position , I mean you ca n't help but laugh as Ramsays tears into the contestants as they spoil the entrees and dishes in rather spectacular style most of the times and you ca n't help but laugh as some of the impostor chefs mess up their cooking from mashed potatoes to salads . At the end it really is n't so much about the contestants but just watching as Ramsays goes about criticizing the ineptitude of these fake chefs , and while it 's enjoyable it also becomes annoying too somewhat as you watch the background backstabbing of these people when they 're forced to choose someone for elimination from the show . So if you 're looking for a soap opera cooking show with lots of shouting , bad cooking , and basically lousy chefs here 's the one for you but for a true cooking show challenge Iron Chef is really the only way to go ...	1
At this piont in Hell 's Kitchen things begin to change : there are more people , the crazy factor goes up , there are more reasons to laugh or sractch your heads , more development in the cast shows , the cast is more entertaining to observe and while you hate people it generally helps the show be good.Hell 's Kitchen Season 4 steps into the 2nd era of the show and it 's a great ride . There is never a boring episode except for the first ( When you are n't hooked to the show ) and the finale ( Where let 's face it , it gets slower ) . This cast was great , development showed , friendships between chef 's and friendships with Ramsay were made , and Ramsay delivered great challenges and insults that set me off laughing.Potneital Spoiler Below -- -- -- -- Potnetial Spoiler Below -- -- -- -- - Potential Spoiler BelowThere are however , three weaknesses with this season . One is obvious , but two more are my thoughts.1 ) There are couple people who you know ca n't win the show , and you want them out , but they stay in after multiple instances where choas insues . I do n't need to give names as they become obvious.2 ) It is possible to identify one of the final two chef 's , way before the final two , based on gut instinct . Maybe some of you wo n't feel this way , but its my thoughts . ( I liked the chef so I did n't mind in the end ) 3 ) Many of you will believe Ramsay made the wrong final two decision . I feel he made the correct one , but this season some of you WILL feel he DID NOT.But I thought this was a great transition for the show and it 's a season many of you should enjoy .	1
The grans loved it . It kept a four and five year old happy . Nothing better in the entire world to me . Family friendly .	1
My two year old is self identifying letters ! Wherever we go she is pointing out at least 6-8 letters and is consistently correct .	1
I love this series for my toddlers , each episode starts off with a book that they explore . Along the way they touch on letter recognition and spelling . Character is loveable and the kids can relate . It 's a show I can let my kids watch and not feel guilty .	1
My son had delay speech but after watching these shows on sprout and on amazon he started to say more words and able to recognize what the words say and mean.The songs are catchy ... yet saying the ABCs they go a bit fast for my 23 month old & I just do n't understand why they have Little Red Riding Hood looking like a hooker in her outfit ... but all in all . its a fun - word builing/learning show .	1
Educational , fun , diverse characters . relatable characters for my kids . Interesting that most shows do n't have an African or African American male character or if they do it is only a supporting character	1
This is a neat cartoon that teaches kids to read . Good stories and twists on the classics , would recommend this series for preschoolers	1
my 18 mont old recites much of the alphabet and cheers . His fav dvd . Highest recommendation possible . The concept is awesome .	1
my daughter loves this . she will sit and watch this and interacts with all the things that they ask you to do	1
I decided to give & # 34 ; In Plain Sight & # 34 ; a preview on Netflix as it seamed interesting . After the first disk I decided it was good enough to at least give it a chance so I watched the nextdisk and I was hooked ! This show is amazing , each episode has the snitch of the week that goes into Witness Protection and almost every weekly story is a hit . The real beauty of this show is the ongoing family darama between Mary and her family as well as the shenanigans between her co workers . As a member of AA for 13+ years I can tell you the family problems related to this are very real life and they show much of this with enough humor to make me appreciate the honesty . If you buy Season 1 you will be hooked , I have the first three seasons now and will soon buy 4 and 5 to completye my set . I just ca n't say enough about this show , IMHO it is remarkable .	1
I was in love with a great show , who features a strong woman in its lead.so sorry to hear it was cancelled.such a loss for we the viewing public . : (	1
In Plain Sight : Season OneLow price . Arrived quickly and just as described .	1
I missed the first season , so I decided to buy the DVD set . And like most new shows , they seemed to be trying different things to see what worked . Some things did , and some were only so-so . But overall it was a good first season ( subsequent seasons had more good episodes ) .Of course the two best eps were the last two . The next-to-last culminated with the events of the entire season - lots of drama and action . The last episode involved resolving ( most of ) the personal drama with Mary , her mom and her sister.Certainly worth the very reasonable price to buy the set .	1
Essentially a romance , as Raymond Chandler would put it : that is a fantasy rather than an attempt to capture the reality of a life situation . His Marlowe , he said , and the situations in which he participated were an attempt at fictional creation not the way life really is . This is a good and entertaining show , at least in this first season , in which never to be found in real life characters , provide an unreal world of drama and comedy , of people who pique our interest through the unreal things they do , which to us , for the brief time in which they are on-tv-stage , may seem very real . The star would be very obnoxious ( in the part she plays , that is ) if one had to deal with her in real life ; in a fiction she is made to seem quite human and appealing -- with foibles . At this stage of development in the show ( I 've seen nothing of the other seasons ) the star is carrying the show surrounded by some well-played and potentially interesting supporting players.I liked it with qualifications based on my more than occasional irritation with the Star . I think that people who like a show that does not seek to tell it as it is , will be appealing to many in the audience . It is certainly worth a try .	1
this set of dvd 's was a gift for a friend overseas , i 'm sure they are going to be disappointed that the series was taken off the air	1
I 'm not really into `` cop '' shows or `` detective '' shows that dominate network t.v . because they are usually dull , predictable , depressing , and totally lacking any humor . `` In Plain Sight '' does n't suffer from these problems.Luckily , I stumbled across this series last summer . The main character is a Federal Marshall who is involved in the Witness Protection program . She has to keep her clients safe and solve murders based upon her client 's testimony . She and her partner Marshall have great chemistry together on-screen.If you 're a fan of `` Burn Notice '' you will enjoy this series as well ; although they are different shows , what they share in common is humor , action , and great characters which are well written . The writers also explore the personal dramas of the main characters which makes for an interesting back-story.Season 2 premieres April 2009 on USA network for existing fans of the show- for those that are curious and have never watched the show , rent/buy season 1 on dvd and you 'll be up to speed when season 2 starts . ** highly recommended **	1
I remembered when this show started . I 've loved it from the beginning . I finally decided to collect the whole series . It 's a good show . But it 's not one the whole family can watch .	1
This is one of the best series I have ever watched with interesting , quirky , characters and a very good story line . Good writers and a top notch leading star kept this misfit marshal returning to my living room season after season .	1
You know , I really like plucky McCormack and her seemingly hopeless family . She 's got my vote and I 'm sorry the series came to an end .	1
I enjoy this series Mary has the type of personality that I like . I feel this show gives you an insight into how crazy you have to be at home to work in some jobs . This series will make you laught , sweat and cry .	1
i liked the first episode , but by the second , it became clear that this is a GREAT show . the characters are unique and interesting and the twists and turns are actually surprising . if you 're in the mood for a wild ride of a show , which looks like it might be a typical crime of the week show but ISNT , download this one . fun fun .	1
Mary is Juno grown up . Sympathy wrapped in practicality . Her family is dysfunctionsl and she has to somehow perform her incredibly difficult and time consuming job and save her sister and mother from themselves . Her lover is hot . Christian was previously one of the more successful Dancers with the stars .	1
See my review of the third season . I got hooked on the first season but still felt the same after the third season .	1
I had never seen an episode of this but the advertisements intrigued me . I felt I had to try this series out and I 'm glad I did . I 'm very fond of character-driven shows/movies and this one is very well done . I 'm enjoying it tremendously .	1
I liked this show and was sad to see it leave the air . but now I 'm watching it all over again . Mary is quite the cynic to start it is amazing to watch her grow over the seasons .	1
If you 're not a fan of the Venture Brothers then I 'm not sure why you 're even here reading this review . For fans of the show , I highly recommend season 3 . It 's a decent continuation of the show , good story lines and entertaining episodes . The humor follows the standard formula of the show . Overall season 3 is n't as good as the first two seasons , but is still well worth watching if you enjoy what came before .	1
This tribute to the great cartoons of my youth ... Johnny Quest ... Speed Racer etc.. is done extremely well . The animation is done in a throwback style . The writing is fast and witty . There are constant references to those classic cartoon shows . Somehow though the show is watchable in its own right . There are plenty of laugh out loud moments as well as head shaking & # 34 ; I cant believe they made THAT joke & # 34 ; moments . Watch this show ...	1
The Venture Bros. are back and season three picks up where we left off from season two . The monarch now with his wife Doctor Mrs . The Monarch must endure tests from the guild to ensure that they can be villans as well as man and wife . Meanwhile Doctor Venture is enjoying his Monarch free life and gets back to work in the world of super sicence . Only to have a new arch enemy Sgt . Hatred razed his front lawn and needing him to fill out a questionaire form about his villany.All this plus the O.S.I out to kill Brock Sampson . Spiderskull Island new museum deicated to Doctor Jonas Venture . A message from the past that will save the Earth . What is the secert of the O.R.B and why it is linked to Rusty 's past and the future of all mankind . What happens when The Venture Compond is turned into a day camp for fans of the Rusty Venture show ? We also meet Dermott who thinks he may have met his father at the Venture place . The Triad gets to select thier arch enemy . More thrills and chills then anyone can think of as well as a battle to end all battles and a death no one saw coming.So check out season three of the Venture Bros today !	1
After 3 seasons you might worry the the Venture Bros ' parody of 70s and 80s cartoons would get a bit tired . Do n't worry . The show is a funny and fresh as it ever was . There is a GI Joe parody half way through that 's worth the price of admission.At the same time characters who started as transparent parodies have grown and become fully realized characters that viewers can care about.This is one of the best cartoons on TV and I recommend picking it up .	1
This is my favorite animated show and I loved this 3rd season when aired on TV as much as I loved the first two seasons . BUT PLEASE STOP CENSORING THE DVD SETS !	1
This kind of movie is always fun for those of us who enjoy the superhero genre . They did a nice job with this story . It was well done , just not spectacular .	1
In the early 90 's CBS tried this series out and it did n't work . The writing just was n't there . The costume looked good and looks better than the & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; Flash 's costume which is n't even red like the comics ! Here on & # 34 ; Amazon Instant & # 34 ; you can buy individual episodes for your devices . I recommend the 2 with Mark Hammill of & # 34 ; Star Wars & # 34 ; as & # 34 ; The Trickster. & # 34 ; There 's also a couple of others here that include 2 other famous comic villains & # 34 ; Captain Cold & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Mirror Man. & # 34 ; Hamill 's turn here changed his life , he was that manic and good , because he was hired soon after to voice & # 34 ; The Joker & # 34 ; in the 90 's & # 34 ; Batman & # 34 ; series from Buce Timm .	1
If you like the genre of Super Heroes ; you 'll love the Flash . John Wesley Shipp provides the lead character with a humanity , unlike his cartoon version . This Flash is thoughtful , intelligent and has a sensitivity that other comic adaptations get wrong out of the gate . The shows cleverly adapt the comics in a way a modern audience will enjoy . The reason why it was canceled ? CBS did n't have much respect for the genre and kept switching it on different days . It never found an audience because it never came on the same day each week . Football and other events kept delaying the broadcasts . I believe it was done to get rid of the show . Now you can enjoy them all . I only wish it was allowed to survive . It was a gem that will never be duplicated again . If you like the Batman , Superman TV shows with a modern twist , this is a show you 'll like . You wo n't be disappointed !	1
The show was great back in the day and I still enjoyed it now . Definitely ahead of its time . If this show was made with today 's technology and storytelling , it would 've been amazing . Also Mark Hamil was great in it too .	1
Since I did n't get a chance to watch this when it first came out , I 'm glad I finally got to watch it , though I will admit that I skipped around and concentrated on episodes that also included Robin or Batgirl or had plots that I was more interested in.http : //batmantheanimatedseries.wikia.com/wiki/Robinandhttp : //batmantheanimatedseries.wikia.com/wiki/Batgirlinclude lists of episodes that include Robin and Batgirl.I figured out other interesting episodes by reading the episode summaries on Amazon Prime .	1
My son loves Batman and this is a decent show for him to watch . While he does prefer live action - this seemed to entertain him .	1
Batman as detective more than a vigilante . Mark Hamill as the Joker and you get to see how most of Batman 's foes started . Some are great stories with very little Batman .	1
I love this Batman . Film makers should look to this version of Batman when casting their various versions . Kevin Conroy 's voice does this cartoon Batman justice . The voice matches the tall and broody Dark Knight .	1
This is one of my favorite animated batman series . This is not for younger kids due to some of the more adult story lines and situations . Still good clean good vs evil storyline .	1
This show is just generally excellent even the episodes that were clearly rushed or done with the intent of a single viewing are very well acted ( voice talent ) , as well as well illustrated , despite the moments where batman seems to have superman-like abilities to defy gravity ; but hey its a kids show at this point in the series , its not until the 3rd season of this show when they started to air it with Superman that superman could be the silly hero , so batman was able to become much more serious . And aloud for the tone of the whole DC animated world to get darker until where we are now where some truly amazing animated movies are coming from the same guys . And as always they are perfect for kids ages : being able to speak and up . Just like this show .	1
Enjoy the blend of great writing , well-cast voices , noir/Art Deco atmosphere , and remarkable depth of storytelling ! This was the best adaptation of the Bob Kane character until the Nolan Trilogy .	1
Great show . Took the classic Michael Keaton Batman theme for the intro . Remember watching this as a kid . Only issue I have is why are the episodes out of order ? If you look at each episode , it has the original air date . It starts right , but then jumps to November and all over . why ca n't they be in order Amazon ?	1
the best batman animated was from 1992 and still is highly recommend the graphics are far better than the newest ones	1
My 6 year old son is really enjoying this series and I like that they are 23 minutes long , so it is a quick show to watch .	1
Batman Animated done right . After more than 20 years without a Batman ( stand alone series ) this came out after the Michael Keaton 'Batman & # 34 ; movie with great animation , stories , and voice acting . This was huge in the early 90 's on Fox or the WB . The great thing about it was that it brought out story of the other villians from the comic book that we had n't seen in the 60 's TV series or 60 's animated series like & # 34 ; Clayface , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Killer Croc , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; The Scarecrow , & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Two Face , & # 34 ; etc . Mark Hamill did the voice of & # 34 ; The Joker & # 34 ; after his performance on & # 34 ; The Flash & # 34 ; TV series as the villain & # 34 ; The Trickster. & # 34 ; It 's still better than all these other Batman series that have followed and get worse by the year !	1
What can I say this has to be the best animation of a cartoon series I have ever seen not to mention it was way ahead of it time when it came out and still going strong as far as stories go directing and development especially with the first 3 season of the seasons .	1
This is one of the best American cartoon series of all time . The production is made for each 20 something minute show on a movie caliber . The music and transitions are amazing . The characterization of seeing into the eyes of different antagonists ( even the sociopath joker ) to and seeing batman as a man with odds with his own psychopathic tendencies and past mistakes .	1
I love this show because I grew up watching it . It lasted at least for five or six seasons , eventually crossing paths with superman 's animated series . I recommend this for kids and any adults who are big Batman/ DC comic book fans .	1
One of my all time favorite Batman installments . The animation is fabulous for its era and the voice acting is fun . It is a little dated so some people may find it a little slow , but a definite must see for Batman fans .	1
This version is more like the history of Batman . It shows how he is developed into the hero he is and how the supporting characters factor into who he is as a person .	1
I did n't realize he was born and raised in Michigan ! Being a fellow Michigander I think that is really awesome . Started acting young , married a beautiful actress . I enjoy all his films because they were so varied . Really enjoyed this rental !	1
Great collection of movie trivia all about Heston . He was an interesting character in his own life !	1
So enjoyed seeing the performances of this impacting actor whose films have entertained and thrilled . Enjoyed hearing the opinions of fellow actors	1
Charlton Heston along with Ronald Reagan were two of Hollywood 's & # 34 ; Greats & # 34 ; ! Charlton dominated his scenes and somehow always told you that your existence could be & # 34 ; bigger & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; , and more than life itself . This collection was revealing and remembering of his life and movies of all time . Definitely worth watching .	1
Season 5 was SO good . What a shame , SG-1 was ten seasons , I wish Atlantis could have had a few more . What a great show . The visual effects were getting better and better with lots of action , story line and plot twists . Where are these Stargate Atlantis movies they talked about making ?	1
They did a nice job . Characters were interesting . Plots plausible and stimulating . Good resolution to issues . Dialog allowed to be genuine .	1
Enjoyed the last show of the epic with its cavalry charge over the hill at the last moment . Would continue to have followed it if there were more seasons . The Stargate series is more than just Atlantis and there is a lot of good SciFi left in the writers who have been doing this . Hopefully , it will re-emerge later as another riveting series . Great series ; great actors ; great writers .	1
The others before me have given great reviews of some episodes and characters so I wo n't repeat them.I 'm here to say buy this and all seasons-if you love scifi this show and SG1 are one of the best.Ca n't wait for the movies to start coming out on dvd !	1
If you liked the original Star Gate movie , , you will like this show which is the best of the 'Gate ' Spin off shows on TV	1
Hated for this to be over ! I wish they made more Sci Fi like this !	1
If you did not see it , this episode totals 50 minutes . I scanned forward after the credits and ran into a scene with Woolsey and Todd . But , there is no sound . I think this may have been cut from the episode and why it is here I do not know . I just wish it had audio .	1
Too bad this fantasy could n't continue . Stargate Atlantis represented a good Sci Fi platform for delivering lessons , like good old Star Trek TOS .	1
I was confused on a couple of episodes until I seen how they fit into the story . Great ending to the series .	1
Culmination and unfortunately the last season . Great ending . Threw in some curve balls . Significantly more action compared to the last 4 seasons . Mikey dies , Ronan dies , but comes back . McKay hooks up . Teyla 's baby grows . Todd is in alot more episodes . This does complete the series . Still does n't answer alot of questions , but the stories were never dull or boring . There were so many different avenues , just like SG-1 could have taken , but in the end . . .one of the better closing finales .	1
Spoilers included : This episode is unique , in my opinion . I 'll state this now , in case I 'm mixing up episodes . I have seen this but I 'm reviewing after not having seen it in a while . So , do n't be to hard.The whole idea of Teyla having an alteration to be a Wraith for the time being is really interesting . Especially how Todd manipulates events to his wants . I do enjoy Teyla 's use of her authoritative position at the end where she warns Todd about her coming back in the event that he does something that she would not want him to . She can be very intimidating when she wants to be.I wo n't say much more , but I 'll give good points on the creativity of the episode and the acting . Teyla , the actor playing her more specifically , did an excellent job . I ca n't imagine dealing with having to put all that make-up on.However , I 'm going to stop there , as I 'm not really one to delve into the actors themselves , other than to rate them as something along the lines of good or bad.Anyway , the episode was very good . It put Todd in a position of power whilst taking down the Queen . However , even though the Wraith to Human potion , as I 'll call it , did n't get to go into place , I think it flows with the episodes . With it , it would cut the series short , and that would put a downer on our want for more.So , the Wraith war continues . Good episode . I hope people continue to enjoy the series.Just to note in ending , I 'll apologize now if any of this information is out of place . As I pointed out in the beginning , I have n't watched this episode in a while . I wanted to write a review and give stars to this episode so that people would know it was good , instead of just seeing one star.Ok , hope you like the series .	1
I 've seen this show from 'end to end ' several times over . While it is a very good Sci-Fi show , I thought it a shame that the two best shows of the entire series were the final two shows . That being said , however , I would recommend it if you 've never seen it . The on screen chemistry between Colonel Shepard , Rodney McKay , Carson Beckett & later Ronan Dex were what ( in my opinion ) made it the better of the two & # 34 ; Stargate & # 34 ; series.While it will never measure up to & # 34 ; Battlestar Galactica , & # 34 ; ( the best sci-fi show , ever ) the two of them were a great mix as they both started and ended at the same time . SGA had roughly 25 more shows than BSG ( which had a propensity for agonizingly long hiatuses between seasons ) , I recommend it for any Sci-Fi ( I refuse to say 'Sy Fy ' ) fan .	1
This series deserves five stars . Season Five is the final season but unlike other series did n't let up on the storylines . Each episode was worth the time to view it.Knight68	1
I LOVED the first 3 seasons of Stargate Atlantis . Till they started to rip off movies . But I still watched . The only really good ep . I felt was Tracker . But The series was a good one . Joe Flanigan as John Shepared ? Love him.Really like the whole story lines but is was never the same after Carson and Weir left .	1
Not quite par with the original Stargate SG-1 in my book but this was a good spinoff series that carried its own weight and did well with the stories . I thought it ended the series nicely too . Some last episodes can try too hard but this one did a decent job . Overall I enjoyed the series and the characters were strong and people you cared to know . I will say they were a little annoying killing off some lead characters but other than that good .	1
Have n't received the DVD yet - it is due in June.Linda Sheean	1
Stargate Atlantis is one of my all time favorite series . The cast is excellent and the plot takes a couple unexpected twists and turns that keep things interesting . Just finished going through the series a second time and am sorry they did n't make one more season .	1
I just a fan of the Stargate franchise its just a shame that it did n't last longer maybe two more seasons but hey I enjoyed it while it lasted .	1
Wish they had more seasons available . I am not sure they are filming more , but a great series ! Excellent Si-Fi !	1
Love the Stargate series ! Started out watching SG-1 then onto Atlantis . The acting is great and the visual effects are spectacular . I bought this for my husband as a Christmas gift because I got him hooked on the franchise.Ca n't wait to see Amanda Tapping join the cast and see how the chemistry is between them . The special features are mostly non-exsistent in the first 3 so I 'm wondering if it 's better in the last two . I really like special features and get into seeing the behind the scenes , deleted scenes , outtakes and the cast talking about themselves and the show . Watching season 3 now ! Ca n't wait for Christmas to watch the others . The packaging is very nice with a picture of the entire cast .	1
Another great season of a great show . Really wish it was n't over . What an entertaining show with such a diverse cast of characters . Got ta love it	1
Season five has fulfilled a lot of expectations I had from the beginning . While not tying everything in a neat package in the end , this one has loose ends . Not enough to turn off those who stuck with the program for five seasons . Rodney McKay , John Shepard and the rest , do n't meet a terrible demise . The show ends on a positive note . The evil Wraith , while not entirely finished , wo n't be bothering earth for some time.I recommend the program because it follows the tradition of SG-1 with a set of likable characters . Woolsey , portrayed by Robert Picardo ( of Star Trek Voyager ) does an incredible job as station captain . It was good to see Colm Meany and the actor that portrayed the chief engineer on Enterprise in other roles . I was glad to see Nicholas Pellegi ( from the X-Files ) in the role of a starship captain last all five seasons ! What impressed me about this saga was the quality of the writing . If only this studio was in charge of the Star Trek franchise ! They seem to be delivering much more in terms of action and dramatic possibilities . There was more adventure in five years of Stargate : Atlantis than in seven years of Star Trek : Voyager . The writers were fans of Star Trek and it shows in the writing.I wonder if they had to get permission from Paramount to use the beam up gimmick Trek utilizes so frequently ? This show leaves open the possibility of a sequel or future films . The last episode in paticular shows the fans there will be more in the future .	1
While the finale of the series could be call ambiguous it also left a decent ending that will still leave many fans of the series happy enough so there should be little disgruntlement felt by them . This season saw the removal of Sam Carter as leader of Atlantis and the Representative of the IOA placed in charge though he is n't the puppet many expect him to be . Also we see a much stronger showing of some of the background characters which is appreciated especially since this is the final season I guess the writers and producers felt that those characters deserved that . While we say goodbye to this sci-fi series which started weak but ended strong a sad farewell you can add this series to your other t.v . show dvd collection to watch again at your leisure and for the price very much worth it ... .	1
Not a bad show as far as spinoffs go , just not as good as the original . And unfortunately the show became too repetitive and lost it 's original luster .	1
Love it ! only wish the series would have continued and/or the made a movie ! I liked the characters interaction and loyalty .	1
I saw this episode of Stargate Atlantis on cable and liked it so much I bought the episode from Amazon . It was well written and I only regretted that I had skipped a lot of the previous episodes of the series , not that I liked the series that much . I especially liked the Johnny Cash version of Solitary Man ( by Neil Diamond ) that was played at the end of the episode . . . worth watching the episode just for that . . . good writing .	1
All 5 seasons of Stargate Atlantis series are good . They had a great series but in season 4 lost a couple of major characters thathurt them . Then in the last season it started going down hill . It is still good and fun to watch but disappointed that they fell apart and this was the last season .	1
We really enjoyed this season as a family . Their are a few episodes that are not as interesting as the others . The special effectts are good and the science fiction premise is also interesting .	1
It 's really sad that this is Atlantis ' final season , as their stories are only getting better -- the writing is tighter , the characters developed and emotional . Such drama was only bested by Galactica and Stargate SG1.Jennifer is taken over by a thief who was messing around with the same Ancient communication device that Daniel messed with when he discovered the Ori . That lead to a huge story arc . On Atlantis , it leads to attempted murder and possible loss of a loved one.Ca n't wait for future episodes . I here there 's a DVD movie coming.Stargate Atlantis - The Complete Seasons 1 and 2Stargate SG-1 - The Complete Series Collection	1
Terrific space opera , great CGI , good plot , lots of action , terrific villains , food for thought . Also has lots of humor .	1
it 's always a sad time when you reach the final season of characters you invested so much time in . Especially enjoyed the last two episodes the second to the last one reminded me of the Robert Rodriguez film in terms of the music that was used . there are numerous episodes that are more memorable than others . And of course some of these showcase the acting ability of each separate team member on the show.honestly think the corporate executive should turn loose of some mega bucks and start making movies based on the series the go deep into the various alien cultures that were shown the first 5 seasons	1
I love the character of Monk and virtually everyone who watches it is also hooked on HIM . Monk is a former San Francisco police department detective who had to go onto disability from the force because his OCD psychiatric disorder incredibly worsened after his wife was murdered by a fire bomb in her car . On its face , this sounds like it could be offensive as it satirizes a mental disorder . However , Monk is so lovable yet so aggravating with his OCD disorder that it works . Monk now consults with the police department . The reason he is such a good detective is because of his OCD . He notices everything . He is a fountain of information , including esoteric trivia , which he gravitates towards due to his illness . Put it all together and he can reach amazing deductions although he drives everyone around him completely bats.Some viewers feared the series would suffer when the gal friday was replaced ( from Sharona to Natalie ) but there were no repercussions . Monk is so totally the show , which everyone else revolves around , that the change caused barely a ripple . As the series has gone on , it has evolved into more of a comedy and a character study which is also a mystery . Monk always solves a murder but that is secondary to everything else going on . Two characters I would miss are Leland Stotelmeyer , the Captain , and his sidekick Randy . They have grown very funny in their own right and are the next strongest characters to Monk himself . A month ago I rewatched every single episode of Monk and found myself every bit as fascinated with the episodes as I 'd been the first time through . If anything , I was even fonder of Monk this second viewing through . Some excellent guest stars have also been on the series . Gena Rowlands was on one episode in season 7 and she was magnificent with Monk . I 've read she 's up for an Emmy for it . John Turturro has also guest starred as Monk 's brother and he was also wonderful.One loss to the show is that Monk 's psychiatrist died ( the actor in real life and thus the character on the show too ) . This relationship had been building with every season and the two , Monk and shrink , were very good together . Those pairings had been growing so it was a regular for them to have a session . There were some great sessions between them with both insightful and comedic moments . However , that is being soft pedaled now that a new shrink for Monk had to brought in . This new shrink is ok but it is not the same.Tony Shalhoub plays Monk and he is wonderful . The one thing the viewers would never accept is a new Monk . He 's said he thinks they should stop after season 8 ( next season ) but I hope he can be persuaded to do it a bit longer .	1
Monk , Season Seven , arrived very quickly and in perfect condition . I would buy more products from this seller in the future .	1
I find the obsessive-compulsive detective very entertaining and funny . Great characters and usually funny dialogue along with solid mystery techniques . He might drive some people to distraction with all his phobias but as a tv series it 's fun . Tony Shaloub is perfect as Adrian Monk .	1
Love Monk ! ! Great show , they should bring it back.It ' hard to find great shows like Monk.Tony Shaloub is amazing in this show .	1
Received the package in excellent condition . Was excited to watch this season . He is so very funny and indeed a message is being portrayed .	1
Every season of Monk just gets better and better . I never get enough . Monk is a character we can all identify with in one way or another !	1
Monk was a really good show . I have enjoyed all the seasons and I think this was one show that even got better as it went along .	1
Quirky detective Adrian Monk has only one more season of obsessive-compulsive detection left . Start mourning now , because it 's still one of the best shows on TV.In the meantime , the seventh season of his dramedy/mystery series holds up well and shows little signs of its age . It 's got everything you 'd expect of `` Monk '' -- new phobias , personal crises ( shot in the leg ! ) , lots of hilarious writing , bizarre mysteries , and the celebration of Mr. Monk 's one-hundredth case.Monk is having more trouble than ever after Dr. Kroger unexpectedly dies , and the neighbor girl starts playing the piano . So he decides to buy the house of an old man who recently fell down the stairs . Unfortunately , some creepy people want to get their greedy hands on whatever is hidden in that house -- and they 'll destroy his dream-house to do it.Unfortunately ( for Monk ) it 's the least weird case he encounters this season . He has to deal with ( in no particular order ) : a murdered homeless man , miraculous fountains , lottery murders , a stolen bike at a biotech lab , submarine `` suicides , '' exploding grills , protecting a boxer , the impossible murder of Monk 's annoying neighbor , and a manly-bonding football game with Stottlemeyer.And Monk struggles with his own problems , with the help of his new therapist Dr. Bell ( Hector Elizondo ) and his assistant Natalie ( Traylor Howard : bad hypnosis , a kindly old lady , a crush , a looming physical , and a half-brother escaped from prison . And Monk tries to stop the parking lot where Trudy died from being demolished , only for the council-woman involved to be found murdered in the bay ... Most quirky TV series do n't survive past the first few episodes , or the first season at most . So while the seventh season of `` Monk '' has a few bumps in the road ( such as `` Mr Monk and the Bully , '' where he comes across as rather too vindictive ) , it still has the right balance of humor , poignancy and brain-twisters.The whole season is pretty much a solid string of enjoyably complex murder mysteries -- baffling crimes , obscure clues , and a few new eccentricities for Monk . Despite all the murder and bittersweet moments , the episodes are peppered with some comedy as well ( Randy watching the football game upside-down in the stairwell ) and plenty of solid dialogue ( `` It 's a square tomato . You 're doing the Lord 's work ! `` ) .This season Monk 's biggest problem is his biggest phobia of all -- his fear of being left by everyone , whether it 's a mother substitute or his beloved shrink . Fortunately Shalhoub has the skill to keep his tragicomic character from seeming cartoonish -- good-hearted , socially clueless ( see `` guy banter '' ) and trapped in the cage of his own fears and sorrow . The only flaw is that for some reason , Monk tends to be a wee bit more mean-spirited here.Traylor Howard does a solid job as Monk 's assistant Elizondo is quite good as the replacement for Dr. Kroger , and Jason Gray-Stanford continues to be hilarious as Randy ( `` Ergo the killer . Is that Hungarian ? '' ) . Ted Levine gets to show different side to Stottlemeyer , when the longtime cop becomes a monk ( yes , the religious kind ) and goofs off at tailgate parties . Not in the same episode , of course.There 's only one more season of `` Monk '' to go , but the seventh is a heckuva penultimate chapter , with plenty of befuddling mysteries and strange problems .	1
As with any extended series the fringe characters get a lot of development and this is the case here . Really adds a lot to the series .	1
Outside of one big change , much is the same on season seven of this hit show . Adrian Monk ( Tony Shalhoub ) is still obsessive , compulsive , and phobic . But he is still able to consult for the SFPD and help old friends Randy Disher ( Jason Gray-Stanford ) and Leland Stottlemeyer ( Ted Levine ) solve difficult cases thanks to the help of his assistant Natalie Teeger ( Traylor Howard ) .What has changed is his psychiatrist . After the death of actor Stanley Kamel , Dr. Kroger was also killed off , giving us a great case for the first episode . Monk is desperate to get away from a song that reminds him of Dr. Kroger , so he buys a house , only to find out about a mysterious death that took place there . Joining the cast in that episode is Hector Elizondo as Monk 's new doctor , Dr. Bell.From there , things settle down to normal . Or as normal as you can have it for Monk . Monk and Natalie get trapped on a submarine . Monk takes on a chess master who might have committed the perfect crime . Stottlemeyer witnesses a miracle and becomes a religious monk . Monk makes friends with his neighbor , only to find she 's a murder suspect . In the only development relating to Trudy 's murder , Monk attempts to keep the parking garage where she died from being turned into a park.And I have to mention my favorite episode of the season . The special 100th episode is full of fun . Yes , Monk solves a new case . But the episode also features appearances by quite a few people we 've met over the course of the show so far . It was very funny and a very clever way to mark the momentous occasion.Unfortunately , this season is as uneven as the previous season was . Yes , I still enjoyed it . But the comedy and tender moments are n't as natural or real as they have been in previous seasons . Actually , the first half started strong . It was the second half where things fell into predictable molds once again . The writers seem to be running out of steam and going for the cheap laugh over the real character moments that make this show for me . Do n't get me wrong , I still enjoyed the season . It just was n't as strong as it could have been.The show is slipping from its peak , which makes me happy that this was the penultimate season . It 's still good , but it has been better .	1
Monk 's 7th is just as hilarious and entertaining as the previous seasons . Adrian Monk is still miserable and continues to help Captain Stottlemeyer and Disher with solving murders , with the help of his devoted Assistant , Natalie . Monk is forced to find a new therapist because Dr. Kroger has died . Throughout this season Monk matches wits with a chess player , helps a boxer , gets stuck on a submarine underwater , meets his other brother , fights City Hall , and much more . I highly recommend MONK : SEASON SEVEN ! ! !	1
Monk caught me from the very first episode . I love this show . Every episode , and I mean every episode is gold . This season is no different . It is a fantastic season , with Tony Shaloub at his very best . What a versatile actor he is . He seems to seamlessly fit into any part he attempts to do . I have read some of the negative reviews of this season , and I have to say that the reviewers are missing the main points here , Monk is an evolving character leading up to a conclusive ending in December of 2010 . Season 7 , shows Monk getting away from the use of the wipes , every time he touches someone or something , this is huge . There are other steps toward interdependency as well . All leading up to the finale episodes when all is resolved for Adrian Monk . I for one , prefer to see an ending to the TV shows I watch . Monk clearly has issues , that 's what makes him so lovable as a character , but to see those issues reach a resolution by the ending of the series is what we as viewers want in a series . Season 7 , has set up the parameters for those resolutions . I believe that those who are seeing this in a negative light , need to reevaluate the show , the premise , and the character.Wasitchu	1
Monk returns for his seventh season and is on new cases . From chasing bad guys on the streets of San Francisco to protecting a parking garage , Monk has his hands full once again .	1
We all know how it goes by now : Monk gets a case , Natalie helps him , the captain maintains order , Randy is still a goofball , and Natalie 's daughter barely appears . It 's a formula , but it 's enjoyable.There is a nice inclusion of Mr. Monk 's 100th case , which is apparently the 100th episode , and it features some alumni such as John Turturro , playing Monk 's brother.I 'm hoping that the final season will really pull out all the stops .	1
That would be a better title for this doc. ! The tide of war , in all reality and truth turned against Germany when Hitler began to think he knew more than his Generals . It started in 39 when he failed to Invade England and waited on the worthless Goeing to win the Air War . His hesitancy lost it again in Russia when he turned his Panzer Generals away from their original objectives . Hitler was a megalomaniac whose fears were fueled by his use of drugs and his diseased brain to map out strategies that were doomed to fail . Good thing for the Allies it did fail or we would all be speaking German though I would n't have because of my Father whose career in military intelligence would have doomed all of us in our family to extinction !	1
The video compilation reflects the original footage presented as 5 stars . Fascinating and horrifying . . . the absolute disregard for humankind exhibited by the Nazi 's is well documented . The Eastern Front presented not only a solution for the Jewish Question but for the extermination of those considered as 'unter menschhen . ' Instead of hiding the facts , the Nazi indoctrination revels their true purpose . There is the realization of what happened to prisoners of war and civilians alike . Only original footage can portray all the terrifying consequences to areas conquered by the Nazi war machine . Stalin 's manner of treating German prisoners of war and even Russians taken prisoner by German forces is well documented . This series allows one to follow all the war atrocities as well as the sentiments of Stalin and Hitler . How to explain the aberrant behavior can be found in recent genocide . Provocative and compelling with accurate information . The narration is typical of the propaganda/documentary films of that era . Unique footage and a more in depth presentation of prevailing 'ideology ' than the usual overview . Recommended for beginners as well as those who are students of WWII history .	1
It is good but so old that the producers could not take advantage of animation which helps with war documentaries .	1
Great footage of a significant aspect of the war that is vastly under-represented , but the clarity of narration , quality of the script , and music are not very good .	1
Oklahoma City detective Grace Hanadarko is never much of one for the straight-and-narrow . She is frequently forced to balance her personal issues with smoking , drinking , and sex with difficulties between her family and friends , her high-stress job in law enforcement -- and not to mention her interactions with an angel named `` Earl '' who has been sent by God to convince Grace to turn away from her evil ways to God . Grace may be on the road to hell , but , with Earl 's spiritual guidance , she may be able to save herself.Saving Grace : Season 2 follows the continued adventures of Grace as she deals with her turbulent relationship with fellow detective Ham , her friends ' Doug and Maggie 's impending wedding , the ever-present fear of death for Grace 's friend Leon , the day-to-day drama of working with homicides , the constantly lurking memory of the 1993 Oklahoma City bombing and of course , Grace 's journey through faith . While just as intense as the first season , Season Two builds on the spiritual questions and character-centric stories that the series is known for.The cast of Saving Grace is phenomenal , led by Holly Hunter 's believable , relate-able performance as Grace . Other key performances include Leon Rippy ( Earl ) and Bokeem Woodbine ( Leon ) , who have amazing intensity and chemistry on screen that make their semi-intellectual conversations about death , life and faith resonate with viewers and force them to reflect on their own lives . Kenny Johnson ( `` Ham '' ) has perfect chemistry with Hunter and delivers a heartfelt performance as a passionate detective who must balance his odd , off-again , on-again physical relationship with Grace while still maintaining a certain level of professionalism.While the plots of Saving Grace seem a little soap opera-like and can occasionally become diluted and slow-paced , each episode is packed with some of the most amazing character development and complex character relationships on television . While the plot can occasionally became inaccessible for me , the characters kept pulling me in and forcing me to keep watching on the edge of my seat just to see what would happen next in the crazy , dramatic world of these characters . The series ends with a bang that will leave viewers moved and emotionally drained.This DVD set includes all 14 episodes from Season 2 , in widescreen format . The set also includes two featurettes that document the many successes of Saving Grace -- both on television and in the person lives of the actors -- and a Hollywood-style wrap party where the cast reflects on the series ' second season . While these features give an interesting look into the heart behind the drama , it just seems like there could have been more to it -- maybe some episode commentary , more behind-the-scenes footage or even a few deleted or extended scenes that just did n't make the final cut.I also personally enjoyed the fact that this series is set in Oklahoma City rather than in New York , Washington D.C. , Los Angeles , or one of the typical locations for cop dramas . Having this unique setting helped to bring something new to a seemingly worn out ( and overdone ) genre.Saving Grace : Season 2 is a great series for fans of character-driven dramas and cop-associated shows that have a little more depth to them than just figuring out who-dunnit . Each episode delivers a thrilling emotional ride that will stick with viewers long after they turn off the television .	1
The actors are sublime ; the characters extremely diverse and interesting in this series . Season Two moved all characters forward in their personal growth and development , although I would have liked to seen more detail about the Bailey Chase character.The plot effectively weaves a vivid web of real life events into profound change for Grace . The final scene between two tortured souls ; one straining against unfathomable psychological and physical pain and leather execution bonds in full-fledged terror , the other , paralyzed into submission by the greatest love and the fear of something soft and all accepting.The eyes of Grace embrace and beckon Leon , soul to soul into the last seconds of his life . Quietly , with large Angelic eyes and a yielding voice , and the infinite truth she beckons & # 34 ; Look at me. & # 34 ; She repeats . & # 34 ; Look at me & # 34 ; .Grace is saved when the choice is made to comfort Leon as he passes before her eyes . His passing reveals her deepest self .	1
Beats the hell out NYC blue . The only unbelievable thing is her high witch is showin in one of these . I have a brother who was a pilot now works for the FAC his job is qualifying pilots I quote & # 34 ; Just like police work we have a high requirement we also have a weight requirement witch means if you are under 5'7 & # 34 ; forget it . If you are under 160 lbs forget it . You have to be able to put enough weigh on that brake to stop that plain . Just like in law enforcement you have to have it to take down felons. & # 34 ; We also have x cops in the family who agree and I went up for the job of police officer in San bernadino , Ca . and was funked out because I only weighted 140 lbs . With % '7 & # 34 ; that got me through , but did not have the weigh . Grace is 5'2 & # 34 ; accourding to the high board in the squad room . With cowboy boots on and she is nothing but skin muscles and bone . But I bet she still only weights about 100 lbs . LOL But she is a great actress . Just wish someone would give her a hair brush and tell her to use it . NO cop would get away with that mess she calls a hairdo . The closer was the same way , that and her horrable lipstick witch I commented on before it got called to her attention on that show.Oh well you have a love story the kind men and women die for . BUT in season 3 that great love that Ham feels for her and you think would flip her around has gone south for a preaty younger face . TO BAD .	1
I watched all seasons , and then have come back to watch it again . The ensemble is great , and Holly Hunter is stellar ! Love the writing , the acting , the cast , the stories , and the interweaving of Earl , the angel , and Grace the tough cop with a huge heart . I really like Oklahoma City as the setting ; it 's my part of the country , and the Texas/OU rivalry is handled beautifully . It is more than just another police drama . Some theological and philosophical , social and cultural dilemmas are included . Great show !	1
I started watching Saving Grace in the middle of the second season and I had to order the first season to catch up . Then I had to rewatch the second , its an awesome show of both crime solving but with a bit of an edge . It 's funny and has a bit of a `` bad '' side , but in the good sence of the word . It 's great I fell in love with it after a few episodes .	1
Show is like an addictive drug . Once you start watching Saving Grace you will not be able to stop watching .	1
Gritty , funny , even pushes at the idea of faith ... the acting will knock your socks off . It 's a shame this show only ran for three seasons- clearly too controversail for suburbia .	1
Just as the sorrow I felt when & # 34 ; The X-Files & # 34 ; ended , I was sad to see Grace leave the stage . Holly Hunter is larger than life and every cast member filled their spaces with emotion , sincerity and clarity .	1
Great picture and audio quality and many episodes you feel like you are watching a feature length movie . I would recommend seeing this even if you are not a Science geek or SciFi fan	1
I have really enjoyed watching Eureka . The first to seasons introduced all of the key characters and a lot of the projects of the company that built the town . Season 3 brings several changes including that the children have grown older and graduated or advanced scientific minded teens . I love seeing the new projects and their results . The roles of Fargo and of Jo change . Excellent show . Very good imagination .	1
This is a quirky , fun show to watch . Would just love a smart house . Each episode they seem to come up with some interesting future device . I look forward to what is next .	1
This is a really fun Sci-Fi . The characters are all well done . When this show came out , my husband I always tried to watch but missed many episodes . This is just the best way to watch your favorite series . No interruptions and when you want to . Love this show .	1
great writing , the cast is terrific , whimsical and amusingthe storylines are interesting and the theoretical physics are ... at least interestingone of the shows that starts and ... . seems like 5 minutes later , it 's overhave no clue ( well $ $ ) why they cut the last season out ... but this is worth every second in my opinion	1
Great program for the family no sex bad language or real violence good family show you must watch from season 1 to understand	1
We enjoy Eureka because it is different than any other show on TV . It has comedy , drama , suspense , and is a clean show that kids can watch too . I would call it refreshing and interesting .	1
This is a good way to spend 45 minutes . This show is lighthearted and fun to watch .	1
Good writing , good acting , quirky plots . It is campy enough that the absurdity of the story line is hilarious . What 's not to like ?	1
I really hate sponsor product placement in movies . The `` Degree '' body deodorant is all over the episode , I get it okay , you want me to buy some deodorant , I already do , but it just looks stupid when I am supposed to imagine that this is a real `` GD '' `` Eureka '' secret genius town , and then you remind me with your Walmart Deodorant advertising , its stupid and annoying . Why cant they just have a list of sponsors at the end of the episode for someone who actually gives damn ?	1
This show took a while to grow on me but I really enjoy it now . The characters are unique and there are n't many shows like it .	1
Overall has most of my favorite episodes . It 's hard to explain , but there is something about the cast of characters and how they interact that is very believeable despite the unreal events they cope with . The acting is sincere , and we know the foibles and quirks of the characters which makes the epidsodes more fun . I think I like & # 34 ; Insane in the P Brane & # 34 ; best of all . The two scientists on either side of a scientific breakthrough , unknown to them , but one thinks he 's hearing his mother from the after life is done very well . I miss my Eureka & # 34 ; friends & # 34 ; .	1
the first three and most of the forth was great but it kind of fell apart kind of lost what made it a great show to start with .	1
My husband likes it . It 's science fiction I personality do not go for shows like this . This show is on his favorite list if I am busy he puts this on cause he knows I do not care for it . If you like science fiction you will like rhis	1
Like to watch on Kindle late in evening . Funny and yet addictive . Like the characters in it and stories are pretty enterning .	1
Eureka is fun science fiction . Elements of current science are woven into catastrophic happenings that the cast of characters always finds a way to solve . The scene is set on earth in a small science town populated mostly by scientific geniuses . They live relatively normal lives compared to lots of other science fiction , and that is part of the appeal . Elements of romance are woven into the stories , comic relief at times . Wish someone would decide to reactivate the series with a Eureka Two series .	1
We really enjoyed Eureka . Has all the right ingredients for our type of Sci - Fi..comedy and drama with some thought provoking ideas thrown in . It 's ashamed this series was cancelled while lesser shows survive .	1
Great show . Great acting . Great scenarios and story lines . Always a lot of fun . Will be sorry when I 'm at the end of the series . Luckily still have a a couple seasons left .	1
Loved the series it was just pure fun to watch , no bad language very little sex andI really liked the way it ended ,	1
Quirky , but awesome . This puts a new perspective in the meaning of Government experimentation at the cost of human comedy .	1
Mixture of events in Eureka life . New boss with personal agenda and on the personal side there are interesting developments in love . And of course the & # 34 ; dull & # 34 ; scientific/technological events to keep everyone busy ...	1
I have thoroughly enjoyed this series - and this 3rd season was just as entertaining as the previous 2 . I really love that I do n't have to sit through endless commercials and can watch whenever I want to watch .	1
What a wonderful show . ( All seasons ) It 's Science Fiction made fun . Everyone would enjoy this show . It 's mostly humor , not serious science fiction .	1
Great show absolutely love this series I hope it continues to stay this good . I would love for this show to stay on for years to come .	1
Great mix of sifi , detective work , and comedy to give light entertaiment to a small but unsual town . Watch it !	1
Not much to review . Quicker than expected delivery a plus . And a great season of HIMYM .	1
After years of what felt like a collection of stale broadcast TV sitcoms , I was introduced to How I Met Your Mother . While I 've never been a big fan of any particular sitcom , this show got me excited about the genre for the first time ever . I was introduced to it by my sister , who brought a borrowed copy of the third season on DVD home with her from college . I ended up watching a few episodes and was very pleasantly surprised by How I Met Your Mother -- it was absolutely hilarious . While I always thought that sitcoms were just full of overly used jokes and cardboard characters , How I Met Your Mother was not only funny and fresh , but felt like it had more depth than the typical sitcom . I was hooked.How I Met Your Mother has a unique storytelling style that continues into season four . The overarching story is being told by an older Ted Mosby ( Josh Radnor ) to his children . The series consists of a series of flashbacks from Ted 's 20s and 30s about the lives of himself and his friends living in New York City and , ultimately , how he met his future wife . This frame may seem complex , especially if you have n't tuned in from the beginning , but it 's done in a breezy , comfortable manner that feels natural and does n't confuse viewers . I felt like it was a story that my father could have been telling me because sometimes there are flashbacks within the overarching flashback and scenes and timing are not perfectly linear , which is more like how a person would share memories -- as they are triggered by something else , rather than chronologically.In season four , the gang continues to mature as they enter their 30s . Ted successfully proposes to Stella ( Sarah Chalke ) , but is left at the altar . Ted fights to come to terms with it , and later reenters the dating scene after becoming roommates with ex-girlfriend Robin ( Cobie Smulders ) . Ted is later laid off from his job , and he decides to begin his own architecture firm . Barney ( Neil Patrick Harris ) struggles with growing feelings for Robin . While Barney continues his usual womanizing ways , tension grows between him and Robin as Barney 's feelings start to come out . Meanwhile , Marshall ( Jason Segel ) and Lily ( Alyson Hannigan ) move into their new apartment and struggle with whether or not they 're ready to have children . Each character 's world changes throughout the series , building up for more antics in season five.The cast of How I Met Your Mother does a perfect job of playing off one another , making the jokes and punch lines feel snappy and well-utilized . While many comedies run the risk of overdoing jokes , How I Met Your Mother does a fantastic job of balancing the joke surrounding an episode with all of the characters . By far , the best ( and most hilarious ) character in this show is the awe- ( wait for it ... ) -some Barney Stinson with his unnamed corporate job , endless supply of suits , and constant bedding of various women . Barney is always up to something off-the-wall and funny , no matter what 's happening in the lives of the other characters.The season four DVD set includes all 24 episode on three discs in widescreen format with English 5.1 Dolby Surround sound plus English , French , and Spanish subtitles -- not to mention a great selection of bonus features . These features include a recap of season three , episode commentaries , a gag reel , `` A Night with Your Mother '' special featuring an Academy of Television Arts & Sciences panel discussion , a hilarious gag video about how awesome Barney is , and an extended scene from `` The Fight . `` Season four is another great chapter in the How I Met Your Mother saga . The series is just as humorous as when it first began , and the characters continue to be interesting and funny . The amazing thing for me about this series is how it can cover such a range of emotions in just one episode . I do n't usually respond to TV or movies emotionally , but How I Met Your Mother can make me roll around laughing and takes me to the brink of tears in the same episode . I ca n't wait for the new season to start .	1
How I Met Your Mother in Season Four is just as good as the first three seasons with some really interesting and funny episodesA major part of the season deals with Ted and Stella 's relationship after they get engaged .

As the wedding draws near Ted tells Stella that he invited Robin and Stella gets mad because she does not want a significant ex to be at the wedding so Ted invites Tony , Stella 's ex .

While living with him they become friends wit benefits so that their bad habits wont get on each others nerves.Barney helps Robin though by making her a great audition tape that gets her a job as an anchor for a 4 am show .

This series just keeps getting better and better , love the characters and the situational comedies , the cast has a great sense of timing and the writers are keeping it fresh ... ..	1
RECAP : The series follows Ted , an architect telling his children the story if how he met their mother . Each season shows Ted and his friends experiencing all of the moments and antics that will eventually/hopefully lead to Ted meeting and falling in love with his future wife . In general , it 's probably necessary to have watched the previous seasons before jumping in at Season 4 , since there are references to the past and previous character development plays a role . This is a well-written and family appropriate show that keeps fans begging for more.Season 4 kicked off in the fall of 2008 with main characters : Josh Radnor as Ted Mosby , Neil Patrick Harris as Barney Stinson , Cobie Smulders as Robin Scherbatsky , Alyson Hannigan as Lily Aldrin , and Jason Segel as Marshall Eriksen . As the series progresses it is also picking up more and more celebrity cameos [ ehem , did you know that the voice of `` future Ted '' in the precaps is actually Bob Saget ? ] ; season 4 features : Sarah Chalke as Stella Zinman , Regis Philbin as himself , Erin Cahill as Heather Mosby , Bill Fagerbakke as Marvin Eriksen , Alex Trebek as himself , and Jason Jones ( from The Daily Show ) as Tony Grafanello.I generally prefer the DVD versions to Blu-Ray because it can be a pain to wait on a slow Blu-Ray Player . That being said , the picture and sound qualities are fantastic in this format.SEASON 4 : Following three seasons of Ted and his single friends ' ( pardoning Marshall and Lily ) shenanigans , Season Four gives us a look into the deep desire of each member of the gang to be happily settled -- but do n't worry , nothing is set in stone just yet . This season seems to mark some changes in the group , revealing some character `` flaws '' that ultimately bring viewers closer to the emotional needs of the main cast and elicits reinvestment in their futures -- namely Ted 's and his hunt for the woman he calls his kids ' mother.Episode 1 : `` Do I Know You ? '' -- Stella and Ted are getting married as feelings develop between Barney and Robin.Episode 2 : `` The Best Burger In New York '' -- The gang ( and Regis Philbin ) seek out the diner that served Marshall 's first burger in New York.Episode 3 : `` I Heart NJ '' -- The gang ventures to New Jersey to see Stella 's home , and the home Stella hopes Ted will call his own.Episode 4 : `` Intervention '' -- Ted calls a re-intervention over his engagement.Episode 5 : `` Shelter Island '' -- Ted and Stella rush to the altar , but feelings get altered by old flames.Episode 6 : `` Happily Ever After '' -- The gang reminisces about old enemies.Episode 7 : `` Not a Father 's Day '' -- Lily and Marshall have baby talk , but seek advice in Robin and Ted .

'' -- Ted offers his design plans for the company 's new building ; Robin has a little crisis and seeks affirmation from a group of `` Woooo ! Girls . `` Episode 9 : `` The Naked Man '' -- After getting an eyeful of Robin 's boyfriend , Ted finds a way to revitalize the gang 's love lives.Episode 10 : `` The Fight '' -- Ted , feeling a little emasculated from the Stella debacle , lets the rage fly as he and Barney compete for Robin 's attention.Episode 11 : `` Little Minnesota '' -- While Ted 's sister visits , Marshall and Robin do some bonding at a bar featuring their favorite pastime , hockey.Episode 12 : `` Benefits '' -- A frustrated Robin and Ted decide to alleviate some stress , but not if Barney can help it.Episode 13 : `` Three Days of Snow '' -- Carl ( foolishly ) gives command of the bar to Barney and Ted as Marshall and Lily try to reunite despite a blizzard.Episode 14 : `` The Possimpible '' -- Facing deportation , Robin resorts to the help of Barney in order to find a job.Episode 15 : `` The Stinsons '' -- The gang uncovers Barney 's secret wife and son.Episode 16 : `` Sorry , Bro '' -- For fear that Ted may try to rekindle an old flame with a girlfriend they hated , Lily and Marshall devise a plan to keep Ted from ex-girlfriend Karen.Episode 17 : `` The Front Porch '' -- Battles emerge between Lily and Ted when Ted discovers she has been sabotaging his relationships.Episode 18 : `` Old King Clancy '' -- Marshall and Barney cook up a cover story to protect Ted from learning a devastating truth about his job.Episode 19 : `` Murtaugh '' -- Barney discovers Ted 's `` Impossible Bucket List '' and takes it as a challenge.Episode 20 : `` Mosbius Designs '' -- Marshall looks a little foolish trying to impress people at work ; Ted forms his own architectural company and hires an interim intern.Episode 21 : `` The Three Days Rule '' -- Barney and Marshall punish Ted for a dating-rule taboo.Episode 22 : `` Right Place , Right Time '' -- Barney hits a ladies-milestone as Ted appreciates all the variables that put him in the right place at the right time.Episode 23 : `` As Fast as She Can '' -- Barney makes his own challenge for dodging a traffic ticket ; a guilty Tony tries to atone by helping Ted find a job.Episode 24 : `` The Leap '' -- Ted feels the weight of his business while Marshall tries to bring him up to a party . Things close with Barney admitting his feelings to Robin .	1
HIMYM is not so much an original sitcom , but instead more of the perfection of the sitcom . Every once in awhile I feel I 've seen a similar episode of friends or will & grace . But I ca n't deny how much fun the show is to watch . I love all of the characters , and enjoy watching their various adventures . This season had some great stand outs like the news years eve episode where they take three ( 3 ) separate stories and find a way to intertwine them , the `` intervention '' episode , where they had an intervention because they had too many interventions , and of course my personal fav Barney 's family ( when you see it , you 'll understand . ) Sure , the show may not be the most original , but it sure is fun . And frankly , not every show has to be the Wire to be great . I highly recommend this show , and ca n't wait for season 5 !	1
season 4 has some of the most outrageous and downright hilarious story lines . This show never gets old and I highly recommend it to anyone who needs a good laugh . I own seasons 1-7 and i can always go back , watch them , and stilllaugh like I never saw them before .	1
One of the funniest shows I 've ever seen but , while it 's proven it can go the distance , the profanity seems to have been unnecessarily amped up this season and , in my opinion , is detrimental to the show . The `` mystery poop '' episode takes the show 's crudeness to new heights ( or lows , rather ) , but I still found myself laughing . The absence of the McPoyle family this season was regrettable , but a colonial-era episode where the `` gang '' cracks the Liberty Bell sort of made up for it . Funny stuff .	1
I do n't know how they do it . Each season just keeps getting funnier and more twisted . I do n't care how much time they take between seasons , it 's worth it . Everyone on this show cracks me up and I have no idea how far each episode is going to go . This is one of the best comedies I 've ever seen .	1
The things these characters do are very interesting and somewhat sordid . They carry on from show to show doing outrageous things and their reasons for doing so are also outrageous . Not for everyone - the first season is without Danny DeVito , then he joins the group and things get more outlandish . It wo n't take you long to know if this show is for you .	1
I ca n't get enough of & # 34 ; It 's Always Sunny. & # 34 ; This is pure genius hilarity . I could watch these guys everyday , all day for the rest of my life .	1
BY FAR - The funniest episode in & # 34 ; It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. & # 34 ; It 's not just the main story but the subplot of Dee trying to create her own Sex and the City 'girls club ' is hilarious .	1
Prison Break returns for its fourth and final season , a season filled with the kind of high-octane action and wonderful characters that this show is known for . Prison Break is one of the best shows FOX has aired in a long time , and it was sad to see it go.The season opens with Michael ( Wentworth Miller ) tracking down Mahone ( William Fichtner ) , Whistler ( Chris Vance ) , and Gretchen ( Jodi Lyn O'Keefe ) to avenge the death of his beloved Sara ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) . However , once he finds Gretchen , the truth is n't what it originally seemed . Partial secrets are revealed , and a mysterious new player appears.Soon after , Michael and Lincoln ( Dominic Purcell ) are pursued by a Homeland Security agent , who wants to blackmail them into doing his dirty work for him . Michael and Lincoln agree to the agent 's demands . The majority of the season then tells about the intricate operation they work on for the agent , and Michael and Lincoln 's attempt to avoid being returned to prison.The show slowly grows to a thrilling climax , where many familiar Prison Break faces return . However , Michael 's story does n't end as perfectly as many fans would have liked.Every performance this season is amazing , as it is in the previous seasons . The characters leap off the screen with their lush , realistic feel . Every actor in this show completely embodies their character . Miller is a hard-edged , driven actor who draws you into the character 's world . His chemistry with Purcell is amazing . The two characters show strong bonds of brotherhood and help get another through the crazy happenings in their lives.This DVD set includes a decent collection of extras , such as two featurettes on the series and its ending and commentary soundtracks for some of the episodes . While I really enjoyed the commentary tracks that exist , it would be far better to have them on all the episodes . I know that there are 22 episodes here , but surely there could be more commentary for the final season ? It is also a little surprising that there are n't any deleted or extended scenes from the season . Really , that 's part of the reason for getting your favorite TV shows on DVD -- to see more of what was originally filmed for each episode.The biggest issues I have with this release is actually the packaging . I know that sounds a little picky , but the transparent , thin plastic seems cheap and tacky to me -- not to mention it does n't seem like it will protect the discs very well in the long term . Of course , this new packaging does make the set considerably thinner and lighter , but I somewhat miss the look and feel of the older packaging styles ( call me old-fashioned ) .Season four of Prison Break did n't make every fan happy -- in fact , some fans thought that the series should have ended after the third season . I think that this season was a good ending to the series , filled with edge-of-your-seat intensity , and amazing performances . I definitely recommend it .	1
I 'll be completely honest , this season is absolutely awesome , I do n't care what anyone else says . Every season of this show has been exciting and it has been almost impossible to stop watching.Season 4 is charged with heavy emotions . The events since season 1 are finally taking their toll , especially with Scofield who is a good person at heart but blames himself for so many of the things that have gone wrong . Burrows gets to be even more of a bad- @ $ $ and is obviously done playing games . Things never get dull or boring in this season.The unfortunate thing about this season is that it 's the last one . Fortunately , they releasedPrison Break : The Final Breakto bring things to a close . This is definitely one of my all time favorite shows .	1
Aww , man ! It 's over . This show was a thrill ride from the very beginning , to the very end . I loved looking forward to how Scofield was gon na outsmart The Company every monday . But unfortunately all good things must come to an end . Prison Break season 4 is ... interesting , to say the least . If you are someone that watched from the start , you may be a little disappointed with how the show came to an end . To me the last season was very unbalanced . The writing was all over the place . Starting with the re-emergence of Sarah and Scofield 's sudden illness . Plus how T-Bag after three seasons , develops a heart . I 'm sayin ' , come on ! Although I have to give all the actors credit for making entertainment out of what those wacky writers scripted . I thought The General 's performance was exceptional as usual ! ! ! As well as Gretchen . She is definitely a force to be reckoned with . If you are someone that enjoys quality acting and intense drama than this is for you . Prison Break will always be remembered by me . It was a GREAT show with a very imaginative story line ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
I loved this series , I remember when it first started and my daughter was hooked on it , I did n't think I would like it . Then it came to Amazon Prime and I fell in love with it ... ..okay lots of holes in the plot and lots of issues with logic , but it is still a good watch .	1
This season was better than season 3 which was boring as hell . Brought back a lot of players from the first 2 seasons and got rid of a boring person from the third season . This show had good twists and a shocking ending . Wrapped everything up nicely.Overall a good series .	1
The DVD arrived on time and is in great condition . I would recommend this seller and definitely use again .	1
Scolfield ( Wentworth Miller ) and Burrows ( Dominic Purcell ) and the others find themselves working with an FBI agent ( Michael Rapaport ) . He claims he 'll clear their names if they steal something from the Company that 's very important to them . While Sarah is really alive and joins Michael 's team.That 's only the beginning of the season . There 's many twists and turns as the season goes on . This last season certainly does n't disappoint and it 's probably the best next to season 1 . The season was packed with action and drama . The series finale was one of the more satisfying ones to any show . The only thing that bugged me a little was the very end but I ca n't really say it did n't work . It 's just not how I preferred to see it end .	1
The Fox series Prison Break debuted in 2005 and had a first season that was intelligently written , intelligently executed , and endlessly exciting . The series miraculously had two more seasons ( with season three being cut short due to the writer 's strike ) and Fox announced the fourth season would be the final season . I absolutely love this show , but the idea to end it was a good one . Prison Break was a one-season concept that made two seasons work but just got more and more ludicrous as it went on , while never failing to be entertaining . With that said , the fourth season is very entertaining . It 's this season that the writer 's throw all logic out the window . Character 's who were dead return , character 's who were forgotten come out of nowhere ; the writer 's of this season seem to have had one rule for writing ; if it can go wrong ( no matter how implausible ) , make sure it does.We 've followed these character 's as they escaped from prison ( season one ) , ran from the law ( season 2 ) , and had to escape from another prison ( season 3 ) . In season 4 , they have to break in to a building . Sounds interesting , right ? Everyone has escaped from Sona , the prison in Panama that housed the characters for the third season . Now in Los Angeles , Michael Scofield ( Wentworth Miller ) , his brother Lincoln Burroughs ( Dominic Purcell ) , girlfriend Sarah Tancredi ( Sarah Wayne Callies ) , Sucre ( Amaury Nolasco ) , Brad Bellick ( Wade Williams ) , and former FBI-agent Alexander Mahone ( William Fichtner ) are recruited by Homeland Security agent Don Self ( Michael Rappaport ) for a top-secret operation to help take down The Company for good . With an offer of immunity for everyone on the table , the group agrees to help Self retrieve Scylla , the Company 's little black book.All of the characters are back , including everybody 's favorite villain T-Bag ( Robert Knepper ) , who ( as usual ) has a different agenda than the rest of the group . Also , in a much larger role , is Leon Russom as General Jonathan Krantz , but more on that in a moment.Season four will have you shaking your head several times throughout simply because of how completely ridiculous many of the plot twists are , but it ranks high on the excitement scale . As for how it ends ... Well , those who have followed this show and these characters for years will be divided , but how else could they have ended it ? The ending works , but could have been executed a little better.Now , on another note ... I 'm not the first person to complain about the weak , anything goes-style of writing on Prison Break , but I wish to mention that the writer 's never failed to write strong main characters . It 's hard to deny this is a show with strong characterization that has a knack for establishing characters for us to care about and establishing characters for us to hate only to trick us into liking them later . But , I will not let the actors escape without credit.Prison Break , during its run , was never honored for the actor 's it had on its show . One does n't have to even watch this show very long to see that this was a shame . Wentworth Miller , for example , is the only person I can see as Scofield . He 's quietly menacing , committed , and charismatic ... Not to say he does n't overdo it sometimes , but he balances the tough and emotional in a way most actors would not . If one denies the range of Wade Williams as Bellick , watch all four seasons of this show and tell me how Bellick goes from one of the most unlikeable characters on the show to a very sympathetic one in such a short span of time . Even Purcell , who never had to do much in the series besides look tough and be intimidating when needed , embodies Burroughs . That description of his acting is pretty much all the character needs to do , so it all fits . Finally , we have Robert Knepper whose performance as T-Bag only got better with each season . If this had been a theatrical film as opposed to a TV series , Knepper would have received an Oscar nomination . If not for fan-reaction to Knepper 's portrayal of the devious , depraved T-Bag he likely would 've been killed off at the end of season one . Knepper takes a relatively simple character and just molds him into one of the most memorable characters I 've ever seen on a television series . It 's no easy task to take a character that frequently betrays and hurts the character 's you care about and make him likeable and every moment Knepper is onscreen , he 'll keep your attention focused there . Finally , Russom as the General has a very menacing look coupled with a deep , foreboding voice ... He makes a great antagonist for Scofield 's gang . All of the other actor 's are great too , but this has already taken up a large majority of my review.There 's not much to write about the fourth season of a television show . If you 're reading this , you 've likely seen the previous three seasons or you 've already seen all four . If you 're a fan , this season is definitely worth checking out if only to see the last hurrah of these character 's you 've watched for so long . While Prison Break lost some IQ points along the way , it never lost its ability to keep your heart racing and keep your affection for its main set of characters . With that said , if you 're a fan of the series ... This is essential.GRADE : B	1
Season four was not as good as the previous ones , as the story drifts apart from its original idea . It 's kind of `` A-Team '' mission of the week , but the characters are still growing . Still worth watching it !	1
I love this series but the ending was really bad . Seemed like the writers were just tired and did n't try too hard .	1
I was sadly disappointed with this ending . Not because it was n't good . Michael finally caught a break and then the series ends ! i think it was pretty crappy of the producers to put the last years of Michael 's life on a separate DVD . It think it was just a gimic to push us to buy a two hour DVD that cost as much a the whole 4th season . I loved the series and wish there was more !	1
COULD NOT WAIT TO START LAST SEASON OF PRISON BREAK . WAS SO EXCITED TO SEE JUSTICE HAS PREVAILED HOWEVER , THE CONCLUSION OF SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SEASON LEFT ME DEPRESSED FOR WEEKS . : (	1
But I still love this show , it was one of my favorites when it was originally on the air.Something about prison shows I have always enjoyed them.They had a good cast , and a good back story to work on.If I had n't been watching here on Amazon I never would have known there was a & # 34 ; Final Break & # 34 ; then I had never seen.Of course they do n't include that in Prime , but I did go out and find a copy .	1
So at the end of the last show , we find out Crab-man Darnel ( the black guy ) is n't Earl Jr. 's father . Then the show gets cancelled ( I guess ) . Maybe they just quit making the show because no writer could figure out how to continue . Anyway , I watched every episode . It was ok .	1
Too bad I did not find this show until years after it was canceled . They make me feel almost normal .	1
WHAT DO YOU SAY TO NBC , WHEN THEY CUT A SHOW ABOUT AVERAGE PEOPLE , WHO ARE NOT RICH AND FAMOUS . BUT THAN AGAIN NBC CAN PAY THEIR EMPLOYEES , MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR , MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGES THAN THE REST OF US GET . BUT WHEN WE LIKE A PROGRAM LIKE `` MY NAME IS EARL '' AND MAYBE ONE OF NBC 'S CEO WIFE , OR KIDS DO N'T LIKE THE SHOW , IT GETS CUT OFF.WELL , I LIKED MY NAME IS EARL , IT MADE ME LAUGH . IT SHOWED HOW PEOPLE LIVE THEIR LIFE DAY TO DAY LIKE HOW MY NEIGHBORSLIVE . WELL , I AM SAD TO SAY , I DO NOT WATCH TV ANY MORE NBC , BECAUSE WHEN YOU GOT A DIAMOND IN YOUR HANDS , YOU START LOOKING FOR A BIGGER DIAMOND . THERE IS A LITTLE DIAMOND ON MY FINGER AND IT MAKES ME HAPPY TO HAVE IT . NBC , PEOPLE NEED TO LAUGH , AND LAUGH SO HARD THAT THEY START TO CRY FROM LAUGHING . DO YOU NOT KNOW THAT ? WITH SO MUCH GOING ON IN THIS WORLD THAT GOD CREATED FOR US . THERE IS SO MUCH B.A.D . THINGS HAPPENING AND IT GETS VERY SAD . BUT , I AM THANKFUL TO AMAZON.COM FOR PRIME TIME , I CAN WATCH EARL AGAIN . GOOD BYE NBC AND GOD BLESS AMAZON.COM AND THANK YOU FOR BEING THERE FOR ME AND ALL THE OTHER AMAZON.COM CUSTOMERS . I LOVE YOU AMAZON.SINCERELY YOURS , GEORGIA A. MORRISON-FLORES	1
Being a fan of Betty White 's , I 'm happy that they brought my beloved Golden Girl to the show . She makes an excellent , crazy , and horrifying witch lady . I hope I 've seen all the episodes now . I recall a few months earlier when I was surfing TV late night when I saw Betty White in the description for this show . I 've been hooked on it ever since . TBS re-aired the episode , so hopefully I 'm now all caught up . Too bad that the show was cancelled fairly early on . I really did like the simple lessons that Earl gave.Honorable mention : I love Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop name . It always puts a smile on my face.Earl is just as naive as ever in this episode.Joy is just as bitchy as ever.Darnel is just as `` nice '' as ever.Randy is just as simple as ever.Kenny is just as gay as ever.Catalina is just as cuckoo as ever.and ex-deputy Mike is just as lackadaisical as ever.I love the creativity of the writers - this show is hilarious with all the funny flashbacks . Do n't drink the tea !	1
Comedy Night is n't gon na be done right any more because NBC canceled My Name is Earl ! I thought after all the hate mail for canceling Las Vegas on a cliffhanger in season 5 they would have learned their lesson , but no ! Hell I think they even canceled Scrubs in it 's last season as well when that show gave NBC a good 7 years . They were n't even going to give it 's fans a series finale . If a show was on more than 2 years , than the viewers deserve a series finale ! If Earl was going down in ratings they should have just gave it one more year to finish things up.Earl earned NBC a few nominations , you 'd think they would have respected it enough to not just cancel it . But if they did n't respect Scrubs and Medium `` yes they canceled Medium too '' after they earned NBC nominations too , then of course they 'd give Earl the same treatment.I do n't think season 4 was the best season but it did have it 's moments and I certainly did n't think it would get canceled or deserved to get canceled . With characters like Earl , Randy , Crabman and Joy and everyone that plays them in top form how could anyone just cancel this show just like that . It always bugged me when I tried to get a friend to watch it and they 'd just say `` it 's a hick show , why the hell would I watch a boring hick show '' . Earl was way more than just a hick show . It was a brilliant show about a low life jerk who tries to help people who he has done wrong to in the past so better things would happen to him . There 's not enough shows about people helping each other , hell I think Earl was the only one . In closing , do n't even bother getting into NBC shows since they do n't respect their shows or their viewers . I love Chuck but why even keep watching if that could get canceled in season 3 or 4 without even a series finale . NBC sucks !	1
I had big expectations because I love English TV , in particular Investigative and detective stuff but this guy is really boring . It did n't appeal to me at all .	-1
This one is a real snoozer . Do n't believe anything you read or hear , it 's awful . I had no idea what the title means . Neither will you .	-1
he 's OK. His humor consists mainly of varying between a Vietnamese accent and a smooth articulate presentation of ironic situations .	-1
This show is plain dumb and not funny . It is sad how much TV comedy has deteriorated . Gone are the days of fantastic shows like Seinfeld , Cheers , Frasier , Everybody loves Raymond , Tool time etc . And they are replaces with shows like this one , with 2 dimensional stupid characters , bad acting and idiotic writing , where sleazy behavior is supposed to be funny . It is not ! ! ! The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality ; all unlikeable , dumb , juvenile , infantile , sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities , and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme ; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands ( referred to as `` banging '' ) or getting quick cash without effort . And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything ; `` banging '' the other guy 's mom , selling alcohol to minors , threatening people with Jihad terror attacks , cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends , but all they ever do is screw each other over . With friends like these , who need enemies ? YUK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
maybe i just dont get it ... but crude not funny and irritating most of the time ... .guys that dumb shouldnt be on TV	-1
It was a disappointment . I gave it a few episodes to get into it , but it did n't get any better .	-1
hope they start changing the plot a little faster , never seen so many pole changes in one show in one week	-1
Ugh , I ca n't take it - making the presidents right hand man involved in terrorism ? ! The first lady clinically insane . Then making you think it 's the vice pres , then it turns out to be the president himself . Uhhh , yeah , right . I thought at first at least they did n't do another mole in CTU ( which they had done every single stinkin season ) ... ... .then , turns out they did have someone in there following the 'right hand mans ' orders ! But he 'thought ' he was doing the right thing . Either way , STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES . And they still have everyone respond to anything with `` I understand '' . Choose a different line once in awhile ! I give this 1 star , no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars . This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I 've watched . It 's more boring daytime soap opera than action/drama like the seasons before this one . Feel free to skip this season , I wish I had .	-1
I used to watch this as a kid . We could only get it when the atmospheric conditions were just right and the tv antenna was turned to just the right direction to get the one station that played this at 10pm . They would show this as a double feature with Dark Shadows . It is fascinating to see how much has changed in how we treat each other and how tv is made .	-1
Could n't even finish & # 34 ; Sky City & # 34 ; - it just feels like a sales pitch . Just get to the extreme engineering people .	-1
My 18 month old grand daughter loves it ! I guess she understands what Blue says when she 'speaks ' , I sure 'whoof , whoof ' do n't ! ! I just love that she loves it !	-1
When I was little , I used to despise watching this program , and I only hate it more now . Every episode , of course , is repetitive ( I know it is a nursery schoolers ' television cartoon , but there are more educational , entertaining series out there , such as `` Little Bear '' or `` Little Bill '' , that can educate children without repeating themselves continuously ) and predictable , even for a three-year-old child . When I was a small child , I understood that , whether you answered a fourth wall-breaking cartoon character 's questions or not , they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway , and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring , repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode . I know that many little children do n't realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her , but I did and hated to watch her . I also thought that the characters were ugly . I mean , Dora did teach me some Spanish , but most of the time she bored me out of my mind .	-1
I found this dull and unexciting . The graphics are very 90s ish and the soundtrack is so-so . She 's no Diego that 's for sure . Then again , she 's probably in the country legally ...	-1
What a morose way to end such a fun series . I always said that if they ever began taking this show seriously , it would come to a bad end , and I was right . It 's like , we 're ending the season with no sense of humor . In fact , we 're gon na off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we 're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc . This show succeeded through its sense of humor ( why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English ? Duh ! ) . Now it fades into oblivion without any sense of fulfillment . What a shame . Maybe that 's why this season is going for $ 29 ! I 'd rather buy two copies of Season 1 ! How do I pick zero stars ?	-1
Example : scientist walks into the bar where there is only 1 patron & the bartender . That patron , the pilot who shot down the UFO asks the scientist to his table & in his second sentence , he 's hitting on her . Unexplainable given he had just been on the phone with his girl friend begging her not to break up with him.Example : scientist shows credential at the gate to a secure military base holding the UFO . Guard does n't have it verified . Really ? Then , scientist does n't or ca n't go into the hanger & examine the UFO with the other scientists . Why does n't she verify what 's she 's seeing ? Then when she & the pilot go to the hospital , they are admitted without it being verified they can have access . Hunh ?	-1
The show is done in the 1990 's , but it looks older than that . I did n't relate to the characters and I do n't like to gross alien testing . I like my invasion stories to have characters I care about and watch them grow .	-1
I watched this because the Brits usually do a good job with good production values , casting and story lines . However , in this case it proved a waste of 5 hours . The writers , directors and editors should be ashamed to put their names in the credits . Important things happen with no apparent reason and the watcher is left scratching his/her head wondering what was the point . The American general is miscast and not believable . Lots of clicking of computer keyboards for solutions that never seem to work out . The ending stinks !	-1
ordinarily I love British comedy but there was really nothing funny that I could find in this sitcom . . .	-1
The first season of `` The Outer Limits '' was the best . Sure the second season had some classic episodes ( among them `` Solider '' and `` Demon with a Glass Hand '' which inspired James Cameron to come up with `` The Terminator '' . I 'd give the shows here 5 stars but 0 stars to MGM for this reissue . Why ? Because these are the exact same digital transfers as last time . They have n't been enhanced with any thing AND there are no extras . I 'd average that out to 2 stars for this set.Do n't get me wrong -- the first season was terrific for the most part . This set ( like the first season set ) features the moving `` The Man Who Was Never Born '' with Martin Landau as a scarred victim of a viral holocaust who is given the chance to go back in time and prevent the birth of the man who created his sterile world . Featuring a rich score by the late Domninic Frontiere ( among his best ) , this was `` The Outer Limits '' as its best . Also we get `` The Galaxy Being '' with Cliff Roberson who unwittingly brings an alien creature he has been communicating with from a world made of anti-matter into ours causing destruction and death . David McCallum in `` The Sixth Finger '' about the results of an experiment to push humanity to evolve to the next level but how , in the process , we lose the essence of what makes us human . `` The Zanti Misfits '' like much of Stefano 's work provides a neat allegory about human nature . We also get `` The Borderlands '' and many other classic episodes mixed with claptrap like `` Human Factor '' but almost everything here is terrific even if we 're only getting half a season at a higher price than before.Why not include a commentary track from surviving actors or David J. Suchow the author on the definitive book on `` The Outer Limits '' ? Because MGM is convinced that you 'll buy this set and the second one coming out in August AND pay more in the process because they 've split them up . Heck , the least they could have done was got rid of those dreadful dual sided discs . Nope . These are dual sided as well.So what do you get ? 16 episodes -- half the first season of the series . In August you can get the second half of the first season . I 'm at a loss here -- why release the exact same thing as before only in a different package ? The only reason is so that retailers ( such as Best Buy ) who return things after a limited shelf life will carry this again . If you 're going to do this at least give us some extras ( a featurette on the visual effects , vintage interviews with the late Joe Stefano or Leslie Stevens , commentary tracks with Suchow discussing the making of the episode.The show deserves 5 stars but Sony/MGM deserves 0 stars for this reissue . Get this instead.The Outer Limits - The Original Series , Season 1	-1
Did not like this one at all ... the actors lacked passion for the work they were doing ... camera work was n't that great either .	-1
Very slow moving story ... not very enticing ... sound quality not great . We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest . Unusual experience at best .	-1
It pains me to trash this show on Amazon , because seasons 1,2 , and 5 are truly great . This season feels like a made for basic cable action show that would air every Sunday at 2 AM . Every plot device , formula , etc. , is recycled here from the other seasons , almost to the point where they feel literally cut and pasted .	-1
Man , things were going great for the most violent prime time TV show ever ( less the killing of Curtis - one of those moments where clearly the writers simply wants to shock the audience or need to get rid of the actor for some reason ) . Things went downhill ( in my humble opinion ) after the Fayed plot was solved . By `` downhill '' I do n't mean disater , because a show of this magnitude , where each episode has so many differnt scenarios , shot on locatiosns cenes , special effects , etc , rarely is mediocre . You get the feel that the everyone involved is giving their best.What I mean by downhil is the above mentioned people ( cast , producers , technical guys , writers ) giving their best for a flawed premise . The Chinese / Russian plot was so farfetched , so forced , so unplausible . After all , the advantage of obtaining some secret technologie about your enemy is useful since he does not know that you possess his defense technology ! Also , to see Audrey Raines appears only briefly and as a `` zombie '' was a bad call.Well , that 's it . Anyway , I think the show still did not jump the shark , but this will happen soon .	-1
Just finished watching season 6 on DVD . ( I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already ) Dumbest ideas ever in 24 . Fox should definetely fire the writers ! There got to be more qualified people out there ? Don ` t buy it . Rather buy season 5 ( which was great )	-1
Based on a lot of the reviews that are already posted here , I do n't think there are a whole lot of people calling it like it is . So , I will take it upon myself to be the voice of truth about VERONICA MARS season 3 . There are 5 star people raving about it because they love the show and are unwilling to accept the truth and there are 1 star people who are n't giving the 3rd season a fair assesment.There is not a single show on TV , not a single one , that my wife and I do n't flock to week to week , other than VERONICA MARS and the 3rd season was no exception . As the 3rd season played out , we found ourselves completely involved as we had been the previous 2 season , all the way up to the midseason cliff hanger . A serial rapist . A murder on campus . All the suspense and mystery was in tact and juicy as ever.Then , when the show started back up , all the things that we had gotten involved in were solved in the first handful of episodes . The following episodes were , for lack of better words , UNEVENTFUL . All the way up to the odd and uncomfortable season finale that ended with the yawning cast of a vote.Even my wife was shocked at the abrupt and uneventful ending . What did they do ? What happened ? Did the writers lose interest ? Did the network pull the plug on the show before they wrote the final episodes ? This is what I think . Personally , I believe the only thing that explains the weak ending of the 3rd season would be that the writers and producers knew that the CW had given up on them . So , they in turn , gave up on the CW.All speculation aside , VERONICA MARS fell off the table halfway through the 3rd season . The charm and personality of the characters and actors involved was still intact , but the stories being told were in par with a fledgling show instead of a show that has given us some of the best television moments around over it 's 2 1/2 prior seasons.The CW just needs to face the facts . The ratings that they 're suffering are n't because of quality of show , but because of lack of STATIONS and lack of bribing the NIELSON and ARBITRON companies ... like the big boys do ... cause we 're watching ... and unfortunately , we 're not watching VERONICA MARS anymore .	-1
Wait , Veronica is a freshman at imaginary U ! Not being a fan of the original Veronica Mars series , I found this one hard to swallow and even harder to engage in . Maybe old fanboys and girls will enjoy seeing their favorite characters & # 34 ; aged & # 34 ; for this new series , but as a newcomer I found little to like or engage me .	-1
This is a first : An unusual number of five star ratings at a rate that surpasses all of this past years Academy Award ( Oscars ) nominated movies put together ( TOTAL ) . Also , interesting is that the same fanatic slasher types are hacking the heads off of any one who dares give it one star ( or less ) . Depending on date the same reviewers gave the one star reviews a : 0 out of 25 ; 0 out of 14 ; 0 out of 13 ; 0 out of 12 , 0 out of 11 . I 'm just happy they 're not all from Salem.The reason : A large number of people are making sure their Kickstarter funding for this movie proves rewarding.The movie : Simplistic dialogue that could only come from a cliche saturated Hollywood high school apprentice writer . Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind ; back and tediously back and forth . Scenes composed of 95 % dumbed down dialogue . Other 5 % of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to appear current e.g . tablets , internet video , Samsung product placement phones . Lot of formula characters e.g . dumb act cool cops ; surfer dude ; party people ; lawyer cutouts ; etc.Baddd : How bad ? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed . Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People ! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie ; if you want to see quality acting , storyline , sets , props and actually have to think , then watch `` The Best Offer '' . It may cleanse you of the effects of this film 's shallow banality . As far as the `` fanatic-obsessives '' I hope that VM series was n't a representation of lives ( un ) productively lived . Let me know .	-1
Great to see the gang again , sad to see them together in this . I 'm not sure which makes me feel worse , that I watched this or that I paid for it ( okay rented ) . It started well I 'll give it that , but that lasted maybe 5 minutes and then let the shlock begin ! The only thing that could have made it worse would have been having Harry Hamlin show up for a cameo .	-1
You know the plot . Trashy kids being trashy . The & # 34 ; good & # 34 ; ones are the & # 34 ; poor & # 34 ; ones . The rich trashy kids are just & # 34 ; bad & # 34 ; . Another movie to help the retarded careers of this TV show 's actors . They are all old and washed out . But they still try to be hip and cool with their texting and foul mouths , sex videos . Sorry if you ca n't route for the heroine of the movie it clearly is n't worth watching .	-1
There 's a scene in Misery where the author writes what he thinks his nurse/tormentor wants to read and suffers for his presumption . Her main problem is the fact that he cheated when he explained that his heroine was alive , but there was also the fact that he was second guessing his audience . Instead of writing something that he could be proud of , he wrote something that he thought that the audience wanted . In many ways , the decline in quality of Veronica Mars reflected this issue . In the third season of Veronica Mars , Rob Thomas veered away from the season long arc and the feminist context and chose instead to focus on shorter story arcs and one-off episodes that did n't tie into the arcs . Instead of making the show easy for potential new fans , Thomas disappointed the existing fans.There was also the issue of the heroine graduating from high school . The teenage detective angle worked better when the setting was high school and there was a great metaphor about tying in hard boiled mysteries with high school where no one really is what they appear to be . Buffy recovered from the same setback , but just barely.This movie tries to go in the opposite direction of the third season by making a movie that is solely for the fans but retains that same desperate & # 34 ; LOVE ME & # 34 ; vibe that wrecked the last season . A little fan service is nice . It 's cool to see Mac and Wallace again . Veronica working to solve the case and manipulating the police force to do it is fine . It 's even nice to see Veronica and Logan fall into their old patterns.Ken Marino has established himself in comedic roles in shows like Party Down and Children 's Hospital so why not bring back Vinnie Van Lowe.Yet , a little goes a long way and too much just becomes aggravating . Do we really need to get Piz again ? Especially when he is still the nice guy that Veronica basically ignores . Does Madison have to be a one-dimensional villain ten years later ? Weevil shows up to AGAIN end up on the wrong side of the law . Krysten Ritter appears and then reminds everyone who she was in season 2 . The only strange moment of restraint in the movie was not bringing back Adam Scott as the teacher who had sex with a student even though the movie revolves around Carrie Bishop who accused him of rape in the Mars vs. Mars episode from season 1 . When the ten year reunion has a tribute to the dead classmates , you almost expect it to take over the movie since there were a lot of dead high school students on the show.With all the fan service , the director and writer forget to tell a compelling story . It 's a two hour episode with references that require the Veronica Mars wiki to fully get . Unfortunately , as you are referring to the Wiki , you are getting spoiled for the rather pedestrian mystery - which should already be obvious since it follows the & # 34 ; really popular cult actor shows up in a minor role & # 34 ; pattern.This is n't a bad movie . It just is n't a very good movie .	-1
Once again TV Types get it WRONG Lying is Lying is LYING ... . and so the whole premise of a person becoming better TANKS ... watch the rest on the internet for free ... . do n't support these writers ...	-1
Ok , here 's the thing with this show..everyone in it is excellent..I meaneveryone..the story line is fine and the writing good for the set up.I love the parents and always have but the show falls short of evergetting in the least little bit close to what it could be..I do n't know whyit 's a disappointment but it is..it 's got all this gold and for some reasonit 's been cast in lead . Bummer man , because I would really like to watchthese people..and believe me I have tried more than once .	-1
This show is nonsense . The people being conned are too stupid to be believed and the main characters are n't much better - really , it 's almost painful to watch . The show gives no credit to its audience . I only made it through the first long long episode . Insipid best describes .	-1
I found these people to be liars , crooks , backstabbers and cons , yet they are portrayed as heroes , that just does not compute getreal they are crooks plain and simple .	-1
I tried three times to watch this series , but I can not get past the first episode , where the main characters ( who remember , we are all supposed to be able to relate to ) lie , cheat , steal , assault , bilk , pilfer , pickpocket , participate in vehicular homicide and then escape to a life of the super-rich . No , they all should have just been caught , arrested , tried and thrown in prison , end of series.I love Eddie Izzard as a comedian and as an actor , but this series simply crosses my ethical lines ; you do not make heroes out of villains , you just do n't send that message to the world , unless you make it clear that what you are promoting and supporting and suggesting EVIL as a justified way of life . Just because they are part of an even worse criminal element , that does not forgive them for their actions , which they never have to face , that does not give the producers the right to present an upside-down morality play as if it were OK to just kill someone , take over their life , impersonate them , and go about your business as if nothing evil happened , or that it was n't your fault.So I 'll just prop the soapbox up over here and quietly walk away , while you figure out why you want to watch bad people get away with bad things .	-1
This was at one time a free download . I downloaded it , but never had the chance to watch it . On the 31st , some weird power failure completely disrupted my computer . The unbox player had to be re-downloaded . None of my films or downloads was marked as downloaded , but they began to come back - over 90 % of them . The rest I simply re-purchased on unbox - though I had to buy Borat on DVD . When I tried to either re-buy or re-download this episode , I discovered it listed but not for sale . Why ? Can anyone at Amazon answer that question - several other episodes are also unavailable . ? ? ? ? I can not even seem to delete the useless episode . Que pasa ? I give it 1 star because you ca n't give something no stars - a rating deserved by lots of stuff .	-1
not funny - not silly - just stupid - really a waste of time if you watch this show .	-1
Do n't waste your time with season two . She could be fun if she was n't so hateful inside . Not good . Yuck .	-1
This programme surprised me as not veryy funny in lots of ways . By trying to be as offending and gross as possible , Sarah Silverman actually achieves the opposite : she bores us to death at times . There is a great lack in consistency in the writing which makes it very difficult to watch any episode in its entirety .	-1
A soap opera . Stupid script , bad acting , glaring tech flaws . It promises a lot and delivers a lot of boring stupidity .	-1
I love this genre but just could not get into this series.Girl leaves town with no gas in the tank , bar full of people ignoring the firetruck as it blasts out a warning that the radioactive mushroom cloud is coming in 45 minutes , the only two cars on the road within 10 miles and they run head on into each other ? Who writes this stuff ?	-1
I think Jericho has some great actors . Unfortunately the story really is n't as great or as accurate as the writers want you to believe.All these cities have just been destroyed , and yet , more often than not , the people are remaining extremely calm in the small town , and actually having unrealistic conversations about what their future would be like involved in relationships and whatnot.If over 20 cities had been destroyed , setting my sights on my future would be the *last* thing I would be thinking about- just trying to survive should be important enough . There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else . Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There 's some nice twists from some of the main characters , but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything , and understanding what 's going on can be a difficult enough task . Still , it 's not a bad show , but it 's not the best , and it 's kind of overrated .	-1
Yet another & # 34 ; apocolypse & # 34 ; show written by & # 34 ; big city dwellers & # 34 ; who have a total & # 34 ; city centered & # 34 ; view of EVERYTHING.Let me start by sayiing that the premise of the shows & # 34 ; disaster & # 34 ; is not too bad . We are drawn in by being left guessing as to the nature of what has happened.This is where it wanders off the path . The small town of Jericho is nothing more than a minature version of New York or LA from other movies . with the exception of one or two & # 34 ; farms , & # 34 ; EVERYTHING ceases to exist at the town limits . A character is either & # 34 ; of the town & # 34 ; or an & # 34 ; outsider & # 34 ; and that is it.It is plainly obvious that the writers have never spent any time in the real world , outside of a big city . Rural America does not work like this . Small towns blur . The town limits rarely really limit the towns themselves and they often sort of blend into nearby communities and they really do encompass surrounding rural areas . This is not europe and the local twons here are not , and never were , the local strongholds , complete with castle.No , while the initial premise of this series is well thought out , the mechanics of it are way out of touch with the reality of life in rural America . It lost my interest in the middle of the first season and I can readily see why it died so quickly . Big city dwellers would have no interest , whatsoever , and real rural citizens are just going to take one look and turn it off . It could have been done much better .	-1
The Jericho premise is fresh and interesting . But I just finished watching the pilot and I find that the story line is weighed down by the poorly developed characters and a lot of cliches about small town America . It is entirely peopled by `` aw shucks '' `` salt-of-the-earth '' folks . The kind of people you will never meet in the real world , not even in Kansas . Maybe the writers should visit fly over country to get a better sense of what they 're writing about .	-1
I just do not like the main character.The only person who seems to like him , is his Mother.His ex-girlfriend hates him , his brother is furious with him , his father is dissapointed with him.Nobody ( actors , seem to have a clear line on who they 're supposed to be ) .So far , after 7 episodes , for the first Season , I do n't know who , or what anyone is either.Is the owner of the general store , just a stone beetch ? Is the IRS auditor just a stone beetch ? There is so much good TV . I do not have time to try to figure out what the writers of this show were trying to get across . In my opinion , they had a dart board in their office , and threw darts at it , to see which ones stayed.I 'm definately , not willing to watch 18 or so hours of this floundering program .	-1
This could have been an interesting series if not for the turgid script and the banal soap operish love triangles .	-1
I started off liking the show , but it soon lost my interest . I found much of it to be rather maudlin . The series is just not very well written .	-1
I see now why TV is considered a wasteland . This TV show is stupid . These TV producers have a formula , then the produce a TV show , like Jericho . And where do these immature male leading characters come from ? The guy is 32 . He acts like he is 12 . Sad .	-1
I only watched one episode . It had too much nudity and sex in it . The story line was good but did n't enjoy the rest .	-1
If your into history you 'll love this ! ! ! ***** for all seasons ! ! It 's a must see . Not for younger children ! ! ! I love to see how people lived in the 1700 's .	-1
What show are the rest of these reviewers watching ? I was excited to see this after reading the reviews , but barely made it through the first two hours . Incredibly boring , like a lavish network soap with all that implies . The history is sketchy ; if you 're going to twist history , at least make it fun and appealing in some way that the truth does not.This is one of the slowest and most unpleasant tv shows I have seen in some time . Then again , I do n't watch tv , only tv shows on dvd that reviewers I usually trust found to be good . Guess that 's not the best way either ! Oh well , I found The Office ( the funny version ) and Arrested Development that way , so it ca n't be all bad . Did n't work this time , though.Pass .	-1
Yea , this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends ... Yea , this and Romney will ingratiate us with our friends ... there is that enough words ? Edit : Bad acting - oh my god ca n't they find an actor that can actually sit a horse ? Whenever they get on a horse it reminds me of those cartoons when I was a kid where the character was out of sink - the horse goes down the rider goes up - a jarring tribute to those who were raised in the saddle . I 'm sure that the 12 people that did not like my review live in their mother 's basement and keep a bottle of liquid silicone and a box of Kleenex next to the remote .	-1
Season 6 is a slap in the face for those who faithfully followed this series for 5 years.Something happens to screenwriters when they have to write those last 3 episodes -- they stop being creative and want to simply take the money and run . They write crap.This ending is even worse than The Sopranos ending -- would you believe it ? They should be ashamed of themselves.I bought Season 6 used , at a great price , and I now would feel ripped off if they had given it to me for free.If you liked the previous 5 seasons , and the characters , do not -- I repeat -- do not watch season 6 . They are stealing money from you under false pretenses .	-1
This was the worst show on tv . A bunch of cardboard characters , wooden acting , stupid cases and vulgar and tasteless jokes . This was totally repulsive garbage and the fact that TNT kept it on seven seasons shows they are a stupid network .	-1
This was one of the most mind numbing movies I have ever seen . Cary Grant did the best he could with this plot and his costar ... do n't waste your time or money !	-1
I watched this long after I should have quit hoping it would become redeming in some way but it kept getting worse . I would not recommend it .	-1
I do n't care for this version of BG . First , Boomer and Starbuck are women they should have made them men . Do n't get me wrong their should be women fighter pilots but because they were 2 of the main characters practically every episode was about sexual intrigue , jealousy , and who 's sleeping with who this week . Secondly , they use bullets instead of lasers . My guess is the producers did this to save money on special effects . Third , the society of this advanced culture still has people smoking and alcoholics and they have n't even cured cancer . A society enlightend and advanced as this ( at least 100-200 years or more advanced than earth ) would have cured the addiction of smoking and acoholism and/or outlawed it . Almost every actor was a drinker , smoker or both . I suspect tobacco companies and alcohol beverage companies paid the actors and probably the producers under the table to smoke in the series . They also would have cured cancer and almost every other disease . It looks like they were practicing 1940 's medicine .	-1
Season 2 through the first few episodes of season 3 which I consider part of the season 1-2 story line were great . Season 3 the writers missed the mark by a large margin . I just finished forcing myself to watch season 3 . The first two seasons I could n't believe I had missed this show when it was on , after season 3 I 'm speechless at the waste of time it was . All sorts of character development which should have been woven into the first two seasons , and only warranted being short flashbacks and segments of the better shows to fill in some blanks as to why certain characters where the way they were , but to waste a season on it ? The whole farce of a story around the man who allowed the original attack and became president only to have him walk free ? I 've wanted to personally put him out an airlock since episode 2 of season 1 and they finally get his butt on trial and let him walk ? Its not a letdown , it is maddening that I wasted the time . I understand Season 4 picks up and gets back on track thank god . Bottom line is except for the freeing from New Caprica the rest of season 3 was not worth watching . All the background on the Admirals marriage , and the character background should have been boiled down to 10 % of the first two seasons , not stretched through an entire season 3 . Oh , and let 's just have a season where the enemy just goes away and focus on labor unions and peoples dysfunctional childhoods . Frak them all .	-1
so i truly enjoyed the first two seasons of Battlestar ... truly awesome , military sci/fi show , insane sets , great plot , good acting and those Cylons . all great ... .the end of season two had some difficulties . alot ALOT less action and more crying . lots of crying . lots of drama . lots of forgetting the entire purpose of the show.season three is where ive ended my battlestar lust ... .i truly cant take Starbuck anymore , whiny brat ... could care less about her romantic interests nor her false bravado.entire spisodes went by with nary a mention of the Cylons ... ..which , lets be honest ... is the best thing about the show.it seems they lost focus or they changed course to appeal to the more 'dramatic ' aspects while shelving the 'sci/fi ' alltogether.terrible mistake ... . i fear season three is when i say frack off Battlestar ... .you had a AMAZING thing going .	-1
This is nasty pure trash . Humans should not treat others this way . It is thoroughly not enjoyable . please trash it .	-1
We only watched a few of the episodes because though we like what Glenn Close has done in the past , we found this series very difficult to follow with the confusing flashbacks and the subject content was not to our taste .	-1
Very depressing the entire time , yes it 's suspenseful and has a great cast , but there was n't a silver lining or even the smallest joke .	-1
This show has too much blood and killing ! I do n't like the fact that the show is always going back to the past which creates confusion at times .	-1
stupid show , stupid plots , some actors made it fun , sort of.who bought this thing for the network ? Are they still employed ?	-1
Based on all the 5-star reviews , I bought Season 1 . Watched it and holy bejemus was I shocked ! This show is horrible , people ! ! ! ! What the heck show are you watching ? ? ? First , the story is way way way over-the-top unbelievable . Chuck becomes a national security asset and CIA and NSA agents just randomly take up minimum wage jobs near him to , what , protect him ? And why would n't the CIA girl , Sarah , take a job INSIDE the Buy More ? Why is she all the way across the parking lot at a stupid hot dog shop where she ca n't even see him ? You take a job to protect someone you ca n't see ? ? ? ? And then Chuck just totally randomly `` flashes '' on people and things that he just randomly runs across and that randomly starts each super retarded and super lame random `` adventure '' ? ? ? ? The actors ( and characters ) are horrible across the board , all of them boring , unfunny and uninteresting . The show is not funny in the least . I mean Big Bang Theory , yeah , that 's a 5-star show -- great characters , great actors , funny as heck , witty , solid stories . Chuck by comparison has none of those things and is truly a bottom-of-the barrel 1-star show .	-1
I love Damien Lewis ; he was awesome in Band of Brothers . But everything else I 've seen him in since , has failed to win me over including this new show which I wanted to like . His character ( who gets out of prison for a murder he did n't do after 12 years , ) is a cop who is quirky and spouts zen phiolosophy to his gorgeous partner all day . Either you like the main characters 'quirky ' personality and will get into the show ; or you wo n't which is what I experienced.In addition the flash back storytelling style grew tiresome quickly ; Robin Weigert as his Captain and San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsome 's Wife ( Jennifer Siebold ) both good actors , play very unlikable characters . In fact only Adam Arkin as Damien 's ex-con financial advisor , is 'normal ' and enjoyable to watch here . A big disappointment as a summer replacement show ; get `` Burn Notice '' instead -- it 's great ! l	-1
I felt that the new show & # 34 ; Life & # 34 ; was interesting . The pilot episode offers some background on a cop that was wrongly convicted of a crime . He is released and after negotiating a multi million dollar settlement with the Police Deaprtment goes back to work as a detective in the Police Department . He has a very zen approach to life and is trying to solve the crime for which he was convicted . His partner is a young woman that is a recovering addict . She has little patience for him and is suspect of his methods.Still , I found that the show was not compelling . I think it went over the top and released too much information on the first episode when they should have held back a little . Everyone loves a good mystery ! Dani Reese 's ( the woman agent ) emotional responses were confusing . On one hand , she has little patience for her new partner ready to disclose everything he does wrong to her superiors and at the end of the episode , protecting him . She seems overly emotional in some scenes and then stoic in others . She is a recovering addict . I would have disclosed Dani Reese 's addiction history maybe a bit later . The show just needs better writing.Damian Lewis played his character well , if he was going for the quirky Zen guy . But , the way he speaks ( an attempt by the writers to make him interesting ) is not that compelling . He has no censor and that 's ok . But , the writer 's attempt is so transparent as to make every line that comes out of Crews ( the main character played by Lewis ) unbelievable.Claudia Black is a good actress , why they would recast her is beyond me .	-1
If Katie Sackhoff had been hired to play Jamie Summers and if the writers had all been fired and replaced by people capable of actually writing good stories , intelligent characters and compelling stories this might have been a great show . But she was n't , they were n't and it most certainly was not . I also sincerely wish Hollywood would stop casting pretty over talented or even suitable for the part . Very disappointing .	-1
All the parts were there for a truly fine series . Good actors awesome budget ... well ok maybe not all the parts . The story lines while interesting were executed poorly and the special effects just did n't do justice to the show . What really stuck out to me as unacceptable were the fight scenes . Jamie Sommers routinely injured people by accident when she forgot her new `` strength '' . In the fight scenes she could n't fight here way out of a wet paper bag . One super punch and the guy gets up not even a bruise , no broken bones nothing . When she gets hit in her non bionic parts pretty much the same thing . She can take a punch better than ALI ever could.They say the writers strike condemned this show to one season . I really doubt that . I would not purchase a second season .	-1
With so much real quality television around , I suppose it 's inevitable that some just do n't quite make the grade . And in an age when writing on television on TV is reaching such high standards , it 's a shame that in the end it 's the writing that lets this down.It 's also worth remembering that if you plan to purchase this , it is only EIGHT episodes - yes , that includes the pilot . So Jaime Sommers is in a car accident , gets her limbs , eye and ear replaced with superior bionic parts by a covert group who go around saving the world each week . Hangers on include her younger sister who lives with her and knows nothing of her secret life , and later , a boyfriend . And for character development , well , in 8 episodes , that 's all we have time for , folks . Think of it as Alias , with added bionics , minus any of the charisma.Acting is fine - Michelle Ryan hits the required notes of all American woman , and woman who you believe can throw a punch , but somehow never quite convinces of having the superior IQ of the character - again , mostly the writing and not her fault . Miguel Ferrer is the boss , to add Hollywood clout . Let 's face it though , If Miguel Ferrer is who you turn to to add clout.. well . Need I say more . One of the highlights is a story arc with Isaiah Washington who turns out to be the most believable character in the series , and a delicious cameo over several episodes with Katee Sackhoff , from Battlestar Galactica . Since the producer of this series also brought that series to the screen , it is especially disappointing that it is on story and writing that this series stumbles.So we have a fairly hum drum series which relies completely on its high concept , and lacks pazazz . All the same , it 's worth remembering that 10 years ago this would have been a welcome addition to the TV schedule ... it 's not a bad series - it just has such strong competition these days , that why wade through sloppy scripting and lazy character exposition ?	-1
PLEASE make the stupid laugh tracks STOP ! Every other word ... ah hahahaha . Unwatchable . Glad I only wasted my money on the first episode .	-1
TBBT is one of those shows that people do not stop talking about . After hearing all this great stuff , I thought I should jump in ! On a day off , I caught a marathon on TBS . I watched about 4 episodes , did n't find them funny , so I decided it was n't for me . Recently I won a season in my office 's white elephant . I thought I would maybe give it another try , because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch . I popped this disk in , I watched all 7 episodes on that disk , and I did n't laugh once . The problem I have with this show , is that it does n't really make you think , unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development , Parks and Rec , and Community you do n't have to think . The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes ' and none of the jokes & # 34 ; come out of the charecters. & # 34 ; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha , but the charecters just do n't really feel real. , How they portray Asperger 's is unbelievably off , they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone . I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is . If you wan na see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community . and how & # 34 ; geeky & # 34 ; they are . The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show , and the acting is just awful . I know some of you probably disagree with me , and that 's OK . This is just my opinion .	-1
this is the exact type of garbage which sends tv viewers like me away from the networks in general and nbc in particular away in DROVES.the creators of this show dont seem to know the difference between nerdy and prissy-effeminate . one character looks like a guy in a clown suit and the other is a recycled version of niles crane from frasier.the characers are retarded and this sitcom belongs in 1982 right between hello larry and the facts of life.the most offensive thing is the laughtrack which screams at you from almost the first moment.this show is an absolute insult to the viewer will be taught as an example of what not to do with a sitcom . the idea might have been a cool one if it wasnt written in giant crayons.if they are going for the youth demo with this one , people need to be fired .	-1
Where 's the humor ? I get this is a popular show and several people told me they liked it but it totally fell flat for me . I suffered through one episode and then tossed the DVD into a black hole . HUMOR : D minus ; STORY/PLOTTING : C plus ; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE : C plus ; OVERALL GRADE : D plus to C minus ; WHEN WATCHED : 02/08/2011 .	-1
The only `` bang '' in this series for me was the sound of my remote hitting the television screen in disgust . My bad , I bought into all the rave reviews for this abysmal , Erkel-ized comedy.Throw glasses onto Johnny Galecki and it STILL does n't make him funny . ( His casting as the weirdo , brooding idiot on Roseanne I always found strange , too . ) Are people finding this `` cute '' ? `` Smart '' ? All I can say if I am over 50 % similar to you , do yourself a favor and find some quality TV sitcom reruns to scratch your comedy itch . This will having you banging your head against the wall .	-1
Wow what a terrible show ... I had to turn it off and delete it from my tivo before I was half way through it so as not to infect the rest of my tivo with `` unfunny '' .It 's geeky and awkward but not in an endearing or funny way ... just in a bad way . Bad acting , casting , scripting and on and on .	-1
If `` House '' had an actor of lesser talent than Hugh Laurie , it would have been off the air after season 2 . By season 3 , the shows were becoming formulaic and themes were being recycled . Unfortunately , the solution was not to fire the writers but to back-burner the primary actors.If the writers and producers had a bit more imagination and courage , they 've got great characters and situations they could mine more deeply ; instead , they chicken-out , content to skim the surface.Season 4 pushes the viewer 's willing suspension of disbelief past the breaking point . Chase , an intensivist , becomes a skilled surgeon and Cameron , an immunologist , becomes a senior ER attending ? Really ? And they still want to work at the same hospital as House ? Really ? And then there 's the ridiculous `` reality TV '' style interviews to replace House 's team . Sure , it fits with House 's love of games , but really ? And , finally , while House nearly lost his friends , job , and freedom for Vicodin in Season 3 , his Vicodin addiction seems to have virtually disappeared in Season 4 . Really ? Vote this season of House off the island . It deserves NO IMMUNITY .	-1
The shows selected would stop and go with my system ; PC-DSL . LO is the show for me and why you might asked ? I once wore a & # 34 ; Badge & # 34 ; , I served with honor and respect and proud to have served .	-1
The best thing to happen to season 2 was the writer 's strike , it put the season out of its misery ! With that the producers decided to cancel the rest of the season and try again next year.The cliffhanger from season 1 was not even delt with until most viewers stopped watching.Oh , this second season was PAINFUL to watch ! My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes . I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through , hoping it would get back on track . It never did , I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great , never to be equaled by season 2 . Maybe season 3 will be better , if anyone is still watching . It is sad to see the hottest show of 2006 go down in flames in 2007 .	-1
First off , I 've enjoyed most vampire TV shows over the last two decades , and they 've all had some things in common , and they 've all had some differences . Most of them steal from the original ( Bram Stoker ) and all of them have liberally stolen from each other and from literary sources ( such as Anne Rice ) because vampire canon , such as it is , was limited by the original Stoker Dracula and re-invented imaginatively by Anne Rice . I loved , loved , LOVED Buffy The Vampire Slayer ( the TV show , not the movie ) because it was such an amazing dramatic TV show , as was its spin-off Angel.That said , I disagree with most reviewers who 've said Moonlight is a rip-off of Buffy or Angel . It is not . The only supernatural beings on Moonlight are the vampires , not the pantheon of assorted trolls , demons , and other evil beings from other dimensions and portals that Buffy and Angel and the Scooby gang so frequently encountered and defeated . Also , the only evils on Moonlight are committed by humans -- and occasionally vampires.So far the vamp TV show Moonlight most closely resembles is Forever Knight , the short-lived ( 3 seasons ) CBS `` Crime Time After Prime Time '' early 90s late night show set and shot in Toronto . Mick St. John on Moonlight is not unlike Nick Knight on Forever Knight , in terms of his longing to be human and his angst about the `` monster '' he perceives himself to be.Both shows featured the main character in triangulated relationships which provide conveniently built-in emotional tension for character and relationship development , plot devices , and historical flashbacks/backstory . Both shows featured the main male vampire character dancing around his attraction to a beautiful human woman , with both of them knowing that the relationship could never be consummated without danger , death , or some other terrible outcome ( the human being `` turned '' vampire and condemned to a life of darkness and undeath ) ; thus the two are therefore locked in a perpetual state of unresolved sexual tension packed with opportunities for jealous interference in each other 's lives ( plot device ) , and only half-heartedly able to pursue romantic attachments with truly available partners of the same , er , species ( living or undead ) ( also plot devices ) . And , like Nick Knight , Mick St. John prefers not to drink ( eat ) humans -- but where Nick Knight made do with cow blood , Mick St. John subsists on human donor blood . Moonlight , in those respects , is formulaically quite similar to Forever Knight . ( After this point , there are SPOILERS , so you may want to stop reading now ... ) However , there are some clever differences : Forever Knight 's big , bad sire vampire LaCroix , who used female vampire protege Janette to lure Nick into accepting his `` gift '' of eternal life ( and provided and amplified the delightful homoeroticism of the mentor/protege possessor/possessed relationship ) has been replaced by Coraline . Coraline is Mick St. John 's ex-wife and sire on Moonlight -- an apparently evil female vampire who 'd lived some 500 years , sired Mick ( made him a vampire ) on their wedding night ( in 1952 ) , and enmeshed him in an obsessive , addictive relationship from which he tried to break free many times but usually could n't . He never wanted to be a vampire -- he did n't even know she was one when they married . She made him a vampire against his will , without asking him or getting his permission . Now , of course , he has `` trust issues . '' She , from her perspective , gave him a `` gift '' of eternal life -- freedom from death ( sounds familiar -- like LaCroix on Forever Knight ! ) .Coraline crossed a fatal line , however , when she kidnapped a human girl to make their couplehood a little `` family '' ( sounds familiar , eh ? rather like Lestat , Louis , and Claudia in Anne Rice 's Interview With The Vampire ) . Mick , by this time ( 1982 ) , was using his vampire skills to do good as a private detective ( it is implied , though not directly stated , that he `` does good '' as a PI because he feels guilty about the `` bad '' he 's done as a vampire ) . It was in this capacity that the girl 's mother approached him to find her daughter Beth -- only for Mick to discover that it was his wife Coraline who kidnapped the innocent child in a demented ploy to win him back.Another re-invention on Moonlight is that wooden stakes do n't kill vampires , they just paralyze them . Only beheading and fire kill vampires in the Moonlight universe . Mick , in his PI role in the first episode , finds the distraught mother 's little girl , rescues her , stakes his crazy ex-wife/lover/sire Coraline to paralyze her , and sets the place on fire before locking her in . The little girl he rescues is returned intact to her family . Thus begins Mick 's distant `` relationship '' with Beth Turner , who grows up to be a reporter for BuzzWire , a mostly online magazine that 's not unlike the tabloid Courtney Cox 's character Lucy edits on FX 's show Dirt , except it 's less celebrity-focused and more local crime story sensationalism . Mick keeps an eye on Beth from afar until a new case in 2007 LA causes their paths to cross again.In the first episode of Moonlight , `` No Such Thing as Vampires , '' Beth , now grown into a beautiful blond with journalistic ambitions ( but news-whore tendencies ) , winds up working with Mick to track down what may or may not be a vampire killer so she can score a big win with her editor and online readers . Mick works with her so he can both protect her and eliminate this threat to the secret existence of vampires in LA ( with strong encouragement from his amoral vampire friend Josef , a 400-some year old vamp played by Jason Dohring , formerly on Veronica Mars ) .I did n't watch this episode on CBS . In fact , I did n't watch the first 6 episodes of Moonlight on TV at all -- I watched them on CBS ' web site of full video , Innertube . I was intrigued by Alex O'Loughlin 's eye-candy good looks , I 've always loved the vampire genre , and I dearly loved Jason Dohring 's dysfunctional portrayal of Logan Echolls on Veronica Mars , so I knew I wanted to catch the show . But I was n't about to be seduced by a show that had already had so many rumors of troubled production and bad writing . The first episode was as predicted : stilted dialogue , cliche-ish plot devices , utterly predictable plot and twists.However , what keeps me watching the show are several things : ( 1 ) the show has a beautiful , SoCal corrupt clarity about it , a noir look that is dark , decadent , sexy , and shiny ; ( 2 ) Alex O'Loughlin just takes over the screen when he 's on it because he 's got screen presence and , despite the poor material , seems to have a fairly nuanced set of acting skills , including tiny facial movements and slight changes in body position/language , which communicate volumes ; ( 3 ) Jason Dohring , who provides major competition for O'Loughlin when they share the screen , and plays his amoral , jaded vampire role to the hilt , practically eating up the scenery , and ( 4 ) Sophia Myles , who had actual vamp cred prior to Moonlight ( in the first Underworld movie ) and is herself not a bad piece of eye-candy of the female persuasion , and has some chemistry with O'Loughlin . She also is n't your typical stick-thin , anorexic-looking TV actress ; the girl 's got a little meat on her bones . So , unlike many of the women on TV , she actually occasionally looks like a `` real '' woman . Finally , ( 5 ) the show manages to have a sense of humor and sarcasm about the city it 's set in -- LA -- and the surface-obsessed tendencies of the majority of the people and the business that keep it going.The first episode , however , was straight out of B-movie ( or is that B-TV ) hell . I thought , `` Eh , that was was pretty ; I 'll watch the next ep on the web and see if it gets any better . '' I mainly knew I would come back for Jason Dohring and because O'Loughlin is pretty enough to keep me coming back , too . But I was n't expecting much from the show based on the first episode . I figured it would be my guilty pleasure , something I 'd watch as `` webisodes '' and not much else.Surprisingly , it 's getting really good . This has a lot to do with improved writing , developing backstory , intersecting relationship triangles , and the growing role of Shannyn Sossamon as Mick 's ex-wife and vampire sire Coraline . It 's still eye candy , but I do n't feel as guilty about watching it -- and now I actually watch it on TV . I even got suckered into buying it via Amazon Unbox . I credit mostly Alex O'Loughlin and Jason Dohring with this . But the most recent episodes ( we 're up to episode 9 now ) have ratcheted up the tension between Beth and Mick , while also increasing the tension between Mick 's happily-amoral and happily-non-human friend Josef ( Jason Dohring ) and the unhappy , secretly self-hating Mick , who longs for a cure for his vampirism , some way to turn human again.Adding the seductive Coraline ( Shannyn Sossamon ) in flashbacks to fill out the story of how Mick `` went to bed a happily married man and woke up a monster '' has only improved the show 's `` grab '' factor . The chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Sophia Myles is a nice slow burn , but it truly sizzles with Shannyn Sossamon . And there 's a nice metrosexual homoerotic chemistry with Jason Dohring as well . There are some very sexy ( though still network-TV-permissible ) scenes on later eps and I 'm looking forward to upcoming episodes.Make no mistake : like Angel , Buffy -- and Forever Knight before them , as well as movies like Interview with the Vampire and 30 Days Of Night -- what makes Moonlight , and all vampire TV shows and movies entertaining is not necessarily the vampires . It 's that their vampirism allows for extremes of behavior and emotion that dramatize the joys and horrors of being human , and provide a starker backdrop for portraying the sometimes excruciating choices we must make between the lesser of two ( or three or four ) evils , or when emotion overrules reason in our decision-making . They 're still vampire shows , and that will result in some people dismissing them outright -- just as some people dismiss science fiction as not `` serious '' literature . But as Battlestar Galactica fans know , it 's not the genre that defines the shows , it 's the characters and what they do in the extreme situations they 're thrown into that makes for compelling television.From that perspective , this early episode of Moonlight is not compelling at all , and neither is the second . But the show is coming along , it is definitely coming along.Watch this first episode , `` No Such Thing As Vampires , '' and the second Moonlight episode , as the contrived set-ups they are for the seven following ( more entertaining and less contrived ) episodes .	-1
While the first two seasons were very successful , the third season is awful . THe idea of changing the format slightly is understandable and the creators were probably aftaid of getting in a rut . The problem is that the show was really very good . Until , at first Earls goes to prison , during which time he stops crossing things off his list and then he goes into a coma and it gets worse , a lot worse . Also , while previously the storylines were funny now the want to shock also slightly and the whole concept does not work anymore really .	-1
The reboot of Battlestar Galactica was ultimately a failure . It is most unfortunate because the elements of greatness were there . The overarching story was a good one and I was interesting in individual plot lines throughout . The chief problem was characterization.More and more often as the series progressed , characters were written to do things both against their previous nature and against all common sense . Both of the Adamas became simply laughable with over-acting the norm and erratic -- unbalanced ? -- behavior expected . I would n't trust Bill Adama to rearrange my silverware drawer , much less command a ship . His always-to-excess drinking alone would have disqualified him from command , a trait shared by way too many of his crew.Mary McDonnell was the series best actor and I wanted to like Laura Roslin . While a better leader than Bill Adama , she was also ultimately unworthy of my trust . So , too , was I pulling for Kara Thrace and I really came to enjoy her portrayal by Katee Sackhoff . Ultimately , I have no freaking idea who and what she was and could muster litter care . And that was the problem in a nutshell with the series.I just ultimately did n't care whether or not they found earth or survived or lost to the Cylons . The characters on balance were not very likable and were certainly unworthy of my admiration . I said in another review of the series -- season 3 ? -- that the humans were so lacking in worthy quality that it might be better for humanity to be wiped away . Ultimately , I think that the only character I really would have trusted was Athena and overall , I liked the Cylons more than the humans . I realize that Ron Moore was trying to create a story where the lines were blurred as to which side should have been seen as the heroes and that is admirable . It sadly just was n't executed well . When you simply stop caring about the characters and a need to finish what you started rather than a burning desire to know what happens in the story drives you forward episode-to-episode , you know a story has gone off the rails.I bet -- I even hope -- that the concept of Battlestar Galactic will be picked up again in a couple of decades . There is a good story to be told . It just was n't this one .	-1
Good title , great cast with a sick story to tell . After reading several of the reviews , decided to watch this and evaluateSPOILER ALERT- If young male rape and its consequences is what you seek - then this is your movie ! Perhaps if I read more reviews I may have picked up on that . Shoulda passed on this one .	-1
It has a lot of dirty talk and sex scenes but it 's not funny . It 's like a cheap soft porn . The dialogues are over the top .	-1
I gave this series two stars to be kind . It has very little if any redeeming value to it . Those that like to see borderline pornography may enjoy he series but I am not one of those people . I am surprised that David Ducovny , who has played good roles would even consider this series . Well if I say any more I would cease to be kind.Knight68	-1
This weekend my wife and I tried watching First Season DVDs for 2 shows we missed out on when they first broadcast on TV -- -- - Californicaton and Mad Men.While Mad Men ended up being very impressive both in style and writing , Californication seemed to be nothing more than an attempt to get laughs and reactions thru shots of nudity , foul language and body function jokes.After 3 episodes it did not seem to get any better from our perspective , so we hit the EJECT button .	-1
To much nudity and sex with a kid involved . Story lines are weak at best . You know he 's going to lay the girl as soon as they meet no surprise there . The girls are pretty and built but a woman would n't really let her daughter be subjected to such a life . If you want T and A and lots of it watch the series . Other wise there are much better series to watch .	-1
not good for your children to watch too much sex and bad words and bad plot it has no learning of any good habits	-1
My mom who is 79 years old , loves this show and so does the rest of my family . It makes me depressed . I think the differene is , that my mom has always lived in the cozyness of the middle class so all this is new to her and frankly very far removed from reality as she knows it . I have on the other hand lived in poor neighborhoods most of my adult life . I have seen metheads , crackheads , tweakers , junkies , you name it and dealers on daily basis , the havoc it rages on whole communities . I have lived with this violence and seen it with a completely sober mind.When you live in a place like that , the saying goes `` that these people are quite the characters , but have no character '' . When you live with this you develope a strange mixed feeling of empathy and disgust for people in the drug culture . Sometimes you just become num . I remember one time , walking on my way home an involuntary thought struck my mind as I passed some crackheads smoking , to my shame it was `` human garbage '' . I was instantly horrified of how desensitized I had become toward my fellow human beings . The hard part is , that you get to know these people personally the longer you live among them so they are not just some strangers anymore . You run into them all the time . The dealers are not without a respect altogether , because when a new one comes around they say `` No she 's not like that , leave her alone '' . Sometimes they laugh cuz the new guy mistook a `` strait '' person for a customer . However you always have to let them know you are cool so it 's a better choise to let them know you a little , that you do n't judge them , so they will trust you and leave you alone . Neighborhoods like that are very dangerous and you do n't want enemies.I know all the scum bags , the little guys that are trying to make a buck selling dope , the corrupt cops , or more like the cops who are so sick of it , they do n't want to deal with it . Sometimes they ca n't do anything because the jails are full . Seriously . The sadness and ramifications meth brings are horrific . The ignored children . I have seen it all and some of the people in the show are quite real to me . I know all of these characters . I know for example , its supposed to be funny that they are cooking meth in the basement while the realtor is showing the house , but to me it 's not funny at all because it 's too linked to what I have seen in reality and its anything but funny . I think the 1st season was more than enough addition to my reality . I highly doubt that I will watch any more of it . Sorry mom , you and my niece can keep talking about it , I am not interested.I guess if I was a straight laced and pampered in a way where I 've never lived with this kind of reality I would find this funny and interesting . But I have n't and I do n't .	-1
I never got into this series . I was n't sure if this was a parody or a drama so I gave up on it .	-1
As promised , the acting , cinematography , and general production values are top notch . But like the Sopranos , I find the content toxic and depressing . There is already a pattern of a buildup of tension and a narrow escape . This chemistry teacher is going to have to come up with more complicated strategies to pull off this double life . But he seems to have a sociopathic disregard for the lives he 's destroying even as his own body is wasting away . I 'm simply not up for 40 more hours of covert drug manufacturers .	-1
AMC 's - what is this ? is a no sense or no nothing show ? this is fun ? i do n't understand , people do you like this ? no more words .	-1
I get suckered into a lot of lousy shows by the `` hype '' surrounding the show and all the glowing reviews here on Amazon and in the mainstream media . This show is another one of those `` con '' jobs . Sorry , folks , but this show is just plain lousy . It 's depressing . It goes nowhere . The characters constantly bicker and fight . Almost all the characters are a-holes , jerky , uninteresting , unlikable , unsympathetic . In short , this show was torture to watch . And still believing the hype , I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3 , hoping , praying , the show would somehow get better . It does n't . The premise is good . It could have been a good show . But it is just written so poorly -- unlikeable protagonists , cliched bad guys , a story that does not evolve -- so the promising premise is never developed into anything good . Even Bryan Cranston ( who is a truly outstanding actor ) seems bad in this . His character has two notes , he 's either bitter or angry . The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show .	-1
Season 2 just ends in the middle of the season leaving the viewer with a HBO Soprano 's ending . Purchased a prime membership so the family could have a movie night . Thinking about going to Netflix it is only 1 cent more and has CC for the hearing disabled . Like many Amazon rebroadcast television seasons are not CC or have a few of the episodes that are CC and the rest are not in the same series . So if a member of your family can not hear or has trouble hearing Netflix or Hulu might be a better option since Amazon carries little selection for the hearing disabled . Called Amazon customer support about CC their programming : i.e . Jericho , Falling sky , etc. , waste of time .	-1
In the not too distant future where George Bush has somehow fluked his way into another term as president , a chemo-virus has broken out in a small town . The Z-Squad is sent in to eliminate the problem , but a member of the squad gets infected and flees . He manages to to find refuge in an underground strip club , which has also been deemed illegal by the government of the future . The soldier takes a turn for the worse and finds himself a member of the undead only to take the club 's biggest star as his first victim . She continues to dance and the odd thing is ... the customers love it . Zombie strippers are the new sex appeal . As the money piles up , so do the victims . Will the chemo-virus continue to spread and if so ... how will it be contained ? First of all , do n't be confused . This is movie is one of the cheesiest films ever . I almost turned it off several times and I honestly ca n't tell you why I 'm reviewing this thing . The sad thing is it 's like a trainwreck in slow motion . You ca n't look away from it once you start watching and you have to see not only how it 's going to end , but who 's going to make it out alive . Not that you really care , but you wonder whose really deemed worthy of surviving said trainwreck . It is ludicrous , ridiculous , and absurd ... but it 's amusing as hell.How ridiculous is it ? Let 's see ... strippers being turned into zombies and becoming super strippers , zombies being sexy , having the most stereotypical Mexican janitor ... ever , the casts biggest names being Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund , special effects you 'd find in Xena : Warrior Princess , a Christian stripping for her nanna , Jenna Jameson shooting ping pong balls and pool balls out her ... well ... I 'll let you see that for yourself , angry dragons , and foamy chewbaccas ... the list goes on and on . I 'm sure I missed so many more . The sad thing is that despite being the cheesiest of cheese and being as bad as it is , there 's still a few good things buried under the cheese . It 's kind of like an enchilada made with cheap cheese . All the cheap stuff is on the outside , but there 's some good stuff on the inside . The most obvious being that there 's a lot of nudity in this , which is good because it 'll probably be one of the only things that 'll keep anyone watching . Robert Englund 's over the top performance as the germophobic strip club owner is pretty memorable . Also , the make-up effects are surprisingly good at times . The special effects are horrid , but the make-up is actually better than you think it 'd be.In a film as ridiculously cheesy as this , I ca n't blame anyone if they turn it off before it reaches the half hour mark . The thing is though if you stick with it , it 's actually enjoyable because it 's so bad . It 's cheesy , it 's amusing , the acting is so bad that you 'll be quoting it for days , the plot is pointless , and it even has a weak attempt at a twist in the ending ! My point is that it 's a bad film and I 'm not defending it , but if you manage to sit through the whole thing ... you may find yourself enjoying parts of it like I did.Rating : 4/10 ( most people will probably rate it a 1/10 ... if that )	-1
Jenna Jameson has no looks left and has n't for years , and ca n't spell the word `` act '' much less do any of it , and it shows beyond doubt in this movie made for teenage boys . Anything at all to stay in the public 's eye up to and including marrying a violent , egotistical drug head , so I guess it is true that birds of a feather stick together.NOTHING worth while in a movie my neighbor started watching , and we both agreed to shut it off after 5 whole minutes it was so bad..SAVE your time and god knows please do n't waste your money .	-1
the story is ok. only thing bad is all of the dialog . all of it . and the girls . not hot , but good for stripper quality i guess .	-1
Zombie Strippers ( released April/08 ) stars one of my fave actors , Robert Englund ( forever Freddie Krueger in my heart ) , as the only real star amongst this company of amateurs and up and comers.It has been my misfortune of late , if you have seen any of my recent reviews , to be watching movies lately with less than stellar value , shall we say.Add yet another one to that list . *sigh* What I thought would be a low budget indie film , with some real kick to it , turns out to just ... .a low budget indie film.The jokes and situations are totally lame , old and stereotypical.To give you an idea and a good example of the latter , a Mexican janitor is loading up his gun and with each bullet he carefully puts in the chamber he utters '' Pancho Villa ... .Montezuma ... Caesar Chavez ... Cinco de Mayo ... guacamole ... '' .Yeah , funny , funny stuff , right ? Mr.Englund does a fine job as the owner of the strip club , who is deathly afraid of catching `` something '' off of one of his girls and just loves his money.The strippers themselves I thought also did a pretty good job but the `` comic relief '' , such as it is , comes in the form of the opening act , the hippest but dumbest and street wise bunch of Marines you have ever seen.None of them had the acting chops to pull off a send up like theirs , even if they had tried ... oh yeah , they were trying.Sorry guys.The plot finds a laboratory become infested with zombies.The marines are called in to eradicate them.They do their job , but in the process one gets bitten and flees the building through a basement window ( great security ) .That Marine in turn heads into a nearby strip club and infects one of the dancers.That dancer/stripper infects another dancer/stripper , and so on and so on.Before you know it the ones uninfected WANT to become infected , as the infected ones are getting all the attention from the male patrons.And oh yes , the strippers , after their dances , each take a patron into the back and proceed to eat them.The remains , either heads , bodies without heads , bodies with heads , etc. , usually re-animate and they lock them in jail-like cells in the basement.Does n't every strip club you know have jail cells ? Owner Englund at first is beside himself with what is happening , but before you can say `` bite me '' , he sees dollar signs.The strippers are soon competing with one another and Englund is raking in the dough.Somewhere along the line , the Marine major/leader finds out about the zombies at the club ( he overhears a convo while reading a newspaper outside ! ) .Meanwhile one of the stripper zombies has gone down into the basement and voluntarily let the incarcerated ones bite and infect her.She also lets all of them out and they go a-wandering around the club.The Marines come to the rescue and exterminate the zombie menace.Poor Englund gets bitten and is to be taken back to the labs for testing.The Marines also find one of the lab personel in the club trying to pick a lock ( ? ) .He fesses that it was he who deliberately spread the zombie virus throughout the lab.He said there 's alot of money to be had in `` working for the man '' .The Marines leave going to do ... whatever they usually do , and the lab man has two of his unbitten cohorts come in to clean up the strip club mess.For a low budget film , the special effects ( heads being blown off , ripped apart , etc . ) are on the whole not too shabby , as opposed to those in Alien Armegeddon , another indie cheapie.The demographic for a film like this would be male,18-25 yrs. , because there is ALOT of T & A ; throughout the film , graphic at that ( I think they called it nudity , once upon a time ) .It is this group that would probably love this film , for that alone.Males of ages before , should n't be viewing this at all and those after , will , for the most part , see the film for what it is ... .bad.The only other person to stand out to any extent was Carmit Levit & eacute ; as the Russian Blavatski , who was directly in charge of the dancers.At first I thought her portrayal was a bit over the top , but as the movie progressed she seem to settle down and I actually did n't mind her performance at all.Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and looks clear and crisp.Extras include two featurettes , deleted scenes & commentary.All in all , despite having star Robert Englund on board for this project , it is an amateurish and lame excuse for a film and it 's satire , send ups and laughs fall flat.Mr.Englund does a good job , as do the strippers ( for the most part ) and their handler Levite ' , but it is not nearly enough to save this dud.Give it a wide pass .	-1
Rented on whim . Wished I had n't . Expected `` camp '' , funny , b-grade SYFY but what I got was just terrible . Nothing good about this piece of crap .	-1
Pay close attention to the film 's title . It is `` Zombie Strippers , '' not `` Zombies vs . Strippers . '' Silly as it is , `` Zombie Strippers '' is the title of the film starring Jenna Jameson and Robert Englund because here strip dancers become zombies and they dance on stage before the crowd of cheering males in a strip club . I mean it . It is a one-joke movie , of which joke could have been turned into something much funnier than as it is , by someone like Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright , creator team of `` Shaun of the Dead . '' I only wish that they have directed the film.Jenna Jameson plays Kat , a strip dancer . Robert Englund is a greedy owner of the club , who is more than happy to see the audiences excited over the un-dead dancers ( whose dancing gets sexier as the film goes on ) even though some of the `` lucky '' males have n't returned from the backstage.The situation is absurd , but I think it is exactly the point . Unfortunately we need someone who can turn absurdity into comedy here . `` Zombie Strippers '' suffers slack direction , especially its earlier part where Robert Englund does not appear . Clearly Robert Englund is having a good time , and watching him as the sleazy ( and cowardly ) owner is fun , but the film is only sporadically funny with too scanty supply of jokes or ideas . `` Zombie Strippers '' is a comedy in which Robert Englund 's club owner is named `` Ian Essko '' and his club `` Rhino . '' I confess I did n't at first get the joke playing on the name of the playwright Ionesco and one of his plays , and I still do n't know why it has to be named like that . I was impressed more with `` ping-pong tricks . '' I want more of them .	-1
This movie is in Spanish only and this director & his producer need to be boycotted on any movie they make . False advertising . They have the DVD cover and title in English ... but to watch the movie , you either have to read subtitles or closed captioning . It is a sham to use false advertising to sell to unsuspecting shoppers . They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies . This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me . I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English ... because he 's used up any trust we may have had . So when his career goes in the dumper in the US ... do n't blame the economy . Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English . If the cover and title had been in Spanish to begin with , we would n't be so irate because we would not have bought it in the first place . I have thousands of movies in my collection but this will be the last time this director ever darkens my viewing.I have nothing against Spanish . In fact I lived in Panama for 2 years.. but I do n't want my movies in Spanish and I certainly do n't appreciate the deliberately deceptive False English DVD cover and Title to make us think the movie is in English.If any of our US producers or Directors put a Spanish label and Spanish Title on a DVD cover and tried to pass it off to the Spanish speaking countries ... and then only had the movie in English or French ... I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They would n't like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English . If a movie is in Spanish , then the Title should also be in Spanish . And since this is an English website ... it should have a huge warning at the top of the page telling English speaking shoppers that this movie is in Spanish only ! And as an added note : This director does cheesy , immature camera effects . Near the end , he just goes nuts with his 360 camera rotating around the main character ... it seemed like 5 minutes of nothing but spinning . It got so monotonous I had to fast forward just to get away from it . This is something a 16 year old would do shooting a movie in his garage for a school project.And let 's not forget that the kid with the sack over his head was a cheap takeoff on Jason from the `` Friday the 13th '' movie series.Avoid this director and producer like the plague ! ! !	-1
There should have been some indication that the movie is in Spanish . ..very hard to follow . Hate subtitles . It 's tough trying to read and watch a movie at the same time . Did n't like it at all .	-1
Mindless show . Truly wasting your time . Not funny and nothing to learn from . Do n't let your kids watch this show .	-1
I am a fan of Tobe Hooper who directed the original `` Texas Chain Saw Massacre '' and `` Poltergeist '' but this episode does not live up to his reputation . The story is blurry , unoriginal and not scary at all . It is a tale that has been told many times before . An angry demon of the earth , this time oil under the earth , enters the body of a father and the son witnesses his father brutally kill his mother . Now years later it 's time for the evil spirit to inhabit the son 's body and cause mayhem and destruction throughout the town he lives in . The story has no real clarity , and there is a no suspense or thrills just mass confusion in the film and outside the film as a viewer . It looks like it was just thrown together at the last minute . If you want some originality and horror watch Hooper 's Season 1 contribution called `` Dance of the Dead '' and save yourself some time and money here .	-1
Half an hour into the series I was bored out of my mind . The premise of the show revolves around 2 U.S. Marshalls that work for the Witness Protection Program . The dialogue is forced , the voiceover is annoying , the domestic squabbles are comedic at best . Marshall Mann has zero personality . Bobby D ( Todd Williams ) is probably the best and only good thing in this show .	-1
Offensive , and I am not easily offended -- would be O.K . if not a prime time show . Main character coarse and vulgar .	-1
Really cheesy with really bad acting . Reminded me of one those terrible B- movies that play late night on cable Tv .	-1
honestly the costume is really cook looking for the time period this was made in.The flash is one of my favorite super hero 's ever since my nickname was Flash when I did track , so learning a little bit about him was cool but I really could n't sit for so long through these episodes like 40-60mins each ? the only way to watch this and stay sane is to skip threw a lot of parts , there is just too much story , if they re-made this into a tv series now a days and made it like the arrow , I would prolly love it if they made it , if they re-make this now a days I would love to watch it even at 2 hours an episode lolafter seeing how awesome arrow was , I never knew arrow before but once I started watching the tv show wow he is actually awesome , the story behind how he got accuracy and everything is awesome and he 's not one of my favorite , im even thinking about buying some green arrow comic books just to see more about how cool he is now . Flash I already got a lot of comics of him lol . but really looking forward to seeing a re-make of this in years to come	-1
I give the actors , makeup , & effects 5 stars . The writers get a zero ! ! ! Just another completely implausible scenario . Science fiction is one thing , unbelievable fantasy is another . The back to life and transformation cards are played way to often in Atlantis , probably why it died on the vine . Every episode was the same old blah , blah , blah ... ..	-1
I bought this season used and the second disc was actually the 2nd disc from season 5 , not season 4 . So , in other words the wrong disc was in the case . SUCKS ! ! Plus , the discs skip sometimes . So badly it 'll freeze up and you 'll have to either fast forward or totally skip the episode . Pissed me off ! ! ! I gave this 2 stars based off of that , not because of the quality of the show .	-1
Season 4 was almost as bad as Season 1 was good . I could easily write a 10 page review detailing the various issues I took exception with , but I will suffice with a complaint list.1 . The plethora of plot twists . Even M. Night Shayamalan would 've said enough 's enough.2 . Bringing people back to life . I know that they were never confirmed dead , but they were dead enough . I thought Prison Break was making a bid to be a soap opera.3 . The various coalitions . How many bad guys can you work with just because `` you need them. '' 4 . The sloppiness of The Company . Whereas the General would n't even say a word in season 2 , by season 4 he was a chatty kathy . He was equally careless with who he killed and how.5 . The slipperiness of T-Bag . T-Bag left almost as many dead bodies in his wake as did The Company but by the end of the show I knew one thing : if a nuclear bomb went off the only survivors would be cockroaches and T-Bag . He had more lives than a cat and the uncanny ability of always having just enough information to keep himself alive.6 . The Scofield boyscout act . In season 1 and 2 Scofield 's reluctance to kill was an endearing quality . It made you realize that he was no real criminal , he was only in his position due to trying to help his brother . By season 4 I was sick of the `` I wo n't kill '' act although he repeatedly faced immenent danger . Ultimately , that left others to do the killing for him or him accidentally killing people ( i.e . the man he hit with a piece of wood then fell and cracked his skull ) . The only time Scofield actually pulled a trigger ... surprise the gun was n't loaded . Heck , Sarah killed more people than Scofield did.7 . The resilient bodies . I finally began to tire of the amazing faces and bodies of the cast . I do n't mean amazing as in stunningly good looking , but as in their abilities to heal so quickly . Normally I afford a show a lot of leeway when it comes to suspended belief : manhole covers that weigh five pounds , concrete that easily crumbles , abilities to run long distances at top speed , etc . But , I guess once a show starts to go south every annoyance is amplified . From the beatings , stabbings , shootings and other abuse Scofield , Burrows , T-Bag , Bellick and Sucre took , they should still be hospitalized . Scofield did n't even have a visible scar from getting his brain tumor removed . Their abilities to take beatings and survive and make a full recovery free of any scars or lasting disabilities became unbearable.8 . My indifference . In season 1 I was at the edge of my seat . I was holding my breath with every close call . I was exhaling with every escape . I was enthralled by Scofield 's detailed planning . I was even quite torn up when Lincoln was taken to the electric chair . All of those emotions and feelings were dulled by season 4 . I was no longer at the edge of my seat , I was no longer exasperated by their capture or thrilled with each triumph . And that was the single greatest disappointment of season 4 . Each scenario was one that had been played many times before in a different format yet the outcome was always the same.The show lost its umph and lost its luster . There was a severe lack of imagination and hence a sharp drop in quality . It seemed like actions of Scofield and The Company were directly proportional to the writing . As the writing got sloppier , so did Scofield and The Company . It just sucked to see the show flame out the way it did . Even the ending was anti-climactic . The show would have been better off ending at episode 12 . But , being honest about the entire show : how sustainable can a show called `` Prison Break '' be ?	-1
I was shocked . Didn ` t even finish it.It was mind-blowingly shallow and infantile.Only FOX could ruin something as great as the original PB.Never in TV history have I witnessed a descent like thisfrom excellence with Season One to foolishness in Season Four.Only watch season one and forget they ever made 2,3 & especially 4	-1
The third season of `` Heroes '' was a complete mess . The season started off in a fairly strong manner , with the heroes targeted by the government and having to work together to escape . However , this compelling idea was abandoned after a few episodes , with the heroes once again scattering all over the globe with separate ( and uninspiring ) plotlines . What the producers and writers consistently fail to understand is that the fans of the show enjoy seeing the heroes work together , and not in the same predictable pairings ( Ando & Hiro , Peter & Nathan , etc. ) . By the end of the season , I really had no idea what the main plotline was and why I should care about any of it . `` Heroes '' started as a fresh , clever series filled with interesting characters , and the producers showed a willingness to add new characters to help prevent things from getting stale . Unfortunately , the producers and writers really lost the thread by the third season , stubbornly sticking with the same cast of heroes , long past their expiration date . Particularly frustrating was their stubborn insistence on focusing on Sylar as the main villian ; I enjoyed Sylar during the first two seasons but having a nearly unbeatable foe makes the rest of the cast look weak . Instead of introducing new heroes , each week brought new alliances between the heroes that quickly dissolved before they really could be explored . One week Noah and Sylar are working together , then they 're enemies ; the next week Nathan and Peter have reunited , then they 're enemies ; shampoo , rinse , and repeat . Keeping up with these shifting alliances was dizzying and tiresome . Likewise , all pretences of continuity have been abandoned in favor of ending each episode with a `` shocking '' conclusion.I 'll watch at least the first few episodes of Season 4 of `` Heroes , '' as I feel a certain obligation given the time I 've already invested in the series . Also , I do still care a bit about a few of the characters , despite being jerked around by the inconsistent writing of the series . However , I find that I can no longer recommend the series as a whole to new watchers , which is something I did prior to this season .	-1
I am baffled by 30 Rock . I bought Seasons 1-3 at a second hand DVD & CD store and it has been an utter pain to sit through every single episode of all three seasons . It 's like torture . I ca n't believe I wasted my time and suffered through them . This show just is not funny in the least . It 's hammy , stupid , utterly unrealistic in any possible way , the writing is bad , the acting is horrible . There are other similar `` loopy and unrealistic '' TV shows , such as Ugly Betty and Scrubs , that work ( I love both those shows ) . But 30 Rock is just bad . It does n't work . It seems like in every episode they are struggling to make the show funny and the show falls flat on its face every time . The show 's `` stars '' Tina Fey and Tracey Morgan are just not funny at all . Alec Bladwin is good and kind of funny , but it 's almost like you feel bad for him that he 's surrounded by such bad actors and given such bad scripts . And in Season 3 they resort to these super hokey `` guest star '' appearances by people like Steve Martin and Oprah Winfrey that are just super hammy and so painful to watch . Like I said , I 'm just mystified at how bad this show is and how it 's lasted so long .	-1
The life has really gone out of this show by the second season . Typical cop drama by the second season , even the Zen angle for the main character is gone .	-1
The stories are all still great , but they added a love interest for the partner and he killed any and all momentum the show had . He had to have known someone to get the part because he did n't fit in in anyway with the flow of the show or the rest of the cast .	-1
The first series was average with some interest however the second year the characters seem to degrade . The writer seemed to loose his direction and the stories became more unbelievable .	-1
If you like fake tough guys , moronic story lines and dialogue that could have been written by a chimp , then this is your show .	-1
I thought the premise of the series was ridiculous . These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers . The script throws in glimpses of male bonding , emotional depth , and odd paradoxical integrity , which comes off as absurd given that they 're just a bunch of middle aged wannabes caught up in an arrested development of their teens . If the storyline did n't attempt to be taken seriously , it could have been a good comic satire .	-1
Too much talking with irrelevant dialog . Not my kind of show . Did not see a point to the episode I watched.Will not watch agaian	-1
Casting for main character all wrong . Mediocre writing , very off base cop to gang relationship . It seems as if they cast MR. Rogers to be the bad ass , almost impossable to believer .	-1
This could have been a great show . But its not . What we get is a bunch of bikers presented as the defenders of small-town America . They get to be `` bad '' guys , but bad guys within real strict limits . Its another biker fantasy for rich guys in the suburbs . To undermine the premise even further they create real `` bad guys '' in the form of a white sumpremist gang hanging around the edges of things doing everything the `` good '' Bikers ca n't do.The show is also heavy on disfunctional family stuff taken right from the Sopranos . We have Jax Teller whose murdereded father apparently formed the gang as a utopian hippie experiment and would never have approved of the club running guns to make money . Jax spends half of every episode pouting about something . He just comes across as a total wuss.Ron Perlman has the presence to play the leader of the gang . But whatever presence he has is constantly undermined by Jax and the fact that every idea he has seems to fail or backfire . The show is at its best when Perlman is taking care of business for the club and showing how a small town like Charming works . Its at its worst whenever Jax gets whiny and they bitch at each other.Shows like this are good when everything is in shades of grey . When they show why someone like Clay makes the decisions he does and why idealism usually leads to trouble . But in Sons of Anarchy , Jax is always right and even if he takes a risk , it always pays off.One of the good things in the show are the law enforcement characters . There is far more realism in the show about them than the bikers.I really wanted to like this . And there were some things that I did really like . But the show is too tame and too much into biker fantasy .	-1
the plot is implausible , the characters unlikable , and the acting terrible . I 've tried to watch this show , but it ai n't no Breaking Bad nor is it the Sopranos . I think the viewer is supposed to be rooting for the SOA , but actually I just want all of them to go to jail for a very long time and take Gemma , the doctor , and all the other girlfriends and wives with them . Every episode repeats itself . The SOA do something wrong , the police suspect they are involved , it looks they are going to get caught , but then the police do something stupid and the SOA do something clever , and in the end they get away with whatever heinous criminal act they 've committed . It is the same for the next episode and the next and the next . Oh and often there is a shoot out between the SOA and another biker group , but every time no one from the SOA gets away unscathed and someone from the other group gets killed . Wow ! The police and the FBI/ATF are so incompetent or corrupt that it sometimes feels like I 'm watching a comedy . I 've made it over halfway through the first season and really questioning whether I should continue . Does this show actually get better ? Why all the rave reviews ?	-1
Not all that realistic . Loaded with profanity - well of course they are depicting 1 % ers . Everyone knows if you ride a Harley your a member of some outlaw gang even if your 70 years old and wear color coordinated nylon riding suits .	-1
soap opera ... like anyone needs that ? I didnt care for soaps when my sister was glued to them and I had to watch . I dont care what you put the people in , a leather jacket and motorcycles even cant make that cool . Katy is always awesome though so she save me from giving it a one star !	-1
This season stinks . It is preachy with no punchline . It seems tired and worn . I enjoy the Denny Crane/Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5 . The increased appearances by Melvin Palmer does n't help either . That character is best in really small doses . Seeing Jerry all the time is a bit annoying as well.All in all ... I 'd kinda like a refund . Maybe Alan Shore will take my case : - )	-1
Despite John Thaw 's acclaimed qualities as an actor , I find that he was only convincing when he played a character who was very close to himself . So , which ever of his later characters you take , you are really just left with John Thaw . Morse is very much John and , to me , the best part of the show was the views of Oxford University . The plots are incredibly complex which does not really produce a compelling detective story ; the viewer , or reader , really needs some chance of being able to solve the riddle . The character of Lewis is equally poor and boredom is never far from my mind . John had a British RADA accent overlaying his boyhood Manchester brogue and it often slips quite badly which is embarrassing .	-1
Why is it that no comedy show can go a half an hour with out making fun of Jesus or Christians ? American Dad started out great but now it seems they will take the road most traveled . All jokes revolve around Christians . This episode was no different . It started out really funny and I almost said `` see you do not need to bash Christians , but I interrupted by the show bashing on Christians . I have quit watching Family Guy and The Simpsons because of this . The only shows that I really like to watch any more on FOX was Futurama and it was canceled and then there was King of the Hill and it is being canceled . Oh well , after I stop watching American Dad I will stop watching FOX altogether . Which is not such a bad thing ? Almost all shows on FOX are garbage anyways .	-1
Not having any prior knowledge of Watchmen I thought this would be fun to watch . The `` motion comic '' concept is cool and i liked it all the way up to the part where the women speak . Apparently they only have one narrator . Multiple narrators would make this much better .	-1
There were actors from the first season that suddenly were not there and actors that were replaced with other actors - Super confusing AND much worse than the first season .	-1
Season 1 was not a master piece by any means , but it was entertaining enough . I could see why they decided to make a season 2 . However , they switched one of the main actors which was really weird . It also appears as they switched the writers as well . The story lines were just terrible , and the actors did not seem to believe in them either . I fast forwarded through each episode .	-1
To easy for others to use and children to get . Got credit and they told me how to block when gaming .	-1
come on people these are for kids ... I do n't care that Diego is & # 34 ; suave. & # 34 ; he needs to do something with his hands other than putting them all over Dora ... Is he in this country legally by the way ? i do n't want my 3 yr old exposed to an illegal immigrant or whatever they 're calling them these days ... enough .	-1
This is perhaps the worst Batman cartoon of all time . Whoever put this on TV should be beaten with a sock full of pennies .	-1
I love good caper shows , but the casting is almost a total disaster . Timothy Hutton , the black guy and the blond girl are not terribly engaging , likeable or compelling . The black guy , in particular , is utterly unconvincing as the stereotypical black computer superwhiz , and utterly annoying and bland otherwise , sleepwalking through the series . Timothy Hutton has a grandma vibe . But the tough guy is a good pick.I realize dissenting reviews of TV series are the kiss of death for a reviewer , but I have to be honest .	-1
Actuallly did n't finish watching it . Was not engaging enough . Slow moving and the romantic appeal was not evident well into the movie .	-1
i have contacted amazon at least three times now . the sound in this movie sucks . every fifteen seconds or so , there is a 'break ' in the soundtrack , making it impossible to watch .	-1
Buy the first 4 seasons , rent the 5th season . Not very good -- terrible scripts .	-1
I like Tim Roth as an actor but in this series his character is not as engaging as it should be for someone of his talents . There is nothing to connect on the human level - no warmth or even cold humor .	-1
Am I missing something here ? An entire season on one ( 1 ) disc and a running time of 60 minutes.No thanks , especially at $ 31.89	-1
and I find it irksome when a program , which deals with lying , begins it 's TV life , as it were , with lies . Intentional or not , it 's sad that most of Hollywood , if not all , portray Jehovah 's Witnesses as a bunch of frothing fanatics . This program would be case-in-point . It seems to me that the 'writers ' would and should make , at the very least , an attempt to get facts straight before portraying the beliefs of nearly 8 Million people . Clearly this was n't done , shame on them , and since they in fact DID lie to everyone the program looses any credibility it hoped to gain with me and many others .	-1
I 've seen a lot of the documentary footage before in other works . That part plus the fabulous interviews I loved . But it was impossible to watch because the camera technique is to jerk the camera around so much that it 's hard on the eyes .	-1
Stopped 15 minutes into the movie . This movie was n't so bad as it was irratating . The quips from the Satellite of Love crew did n't make up for it . There is a vast differance between a bad movie and a bad movie that is worthy of the MST treatment .	-1
Mystery Science Theater 3000 is always great for a laugh , but in this case the underlying film & # 34 ; Laserblast & # 34 ; is neither good , nor & # 34 ; so bad it 's worth a watch. & # 34 ;	-1
Not the worst movie , But it is very slow and boring . Lena Headey is a great actress , too bad the movie was boring and slow . You figure out the movie way to early . OK video and audio .	-1
Plot : woman is seen with her coworkers , family , and bf while creepy eery music is played . Everything kinda appears in black and white actually . . . although it may be the gray rainy London backdrop . Anyway , she sees a woman driving off that looks like her . She follows her . She has a car accident . More creepy eery music and people.Comments : This movie tries to heighten the suspense and horror aspect of it with cheap things like music and people showing up only to startle someone . But then the gore starts . Not much but some . You get to see a dead man . You get to see dead woman who has been suffocated with a plastic bag and bludgeoned to death . You get to see another woman in a shower brutally murdered by another woman ramming her fist down the first woman 's throat and all this blood pouring everywhere . So there is gore and weird music . Pretty much sums this movie up . I think it is an art flick trying to be cute with a simple morale message . But I do n't know . They did n't quiet achieve that . Maybe I am giving it too much credit . . . maybe it is just some stupid horror movie . Anyway it is a waste of 1.99 and your time .	-1
Loser . Expected something better from Whedon . Big fan of Firefly , the best tv series ever . Think he is desperate or strung out on drugs . Do n't waste your time and money here .	-1
I was a fan of Buffy , Angel , and Firefly , so I had high hopes for this.Well , we 've got lots of shots of scantily clad young women , no chemistry between characters , no endearing characters , and a story about a kidnapped and abused girl . Nothing like delving into a parent 's worst nightmare with characters we do n't care about . Oh well , that 's that .	-1
First , Eliza Dushku is not , by any standards , a very good actress ( although gorgeous ) . Her appearances in the Buffy and Angel universe , playing a great character ( Fatih ) , was always a little bit embarassing when she was confronted with the better actors around her ( Sarah Michelle , Boreanaz , James Masters , Anthony Stewart Head , Alyson Hannigan ) .Then , the show itself . Whedon fans will think everything he does is marvellous . But simply it is not . In this first season , there are some episodes that border on unwatchable ( my favorite `` worst '' is episode number 7 , `` Echoes '' . Its 49 minutes seemes like two hours ) . The concept of the show itself is strange : basically , all characters are despicable . Even Echo 's handler is evil . Why ? Because everyone in his right mine must be intrinsically evil to work in a comapny like the Dollhouse . Heck , the Dollhouse business makes even Wolfram & Hart seem like children playing ... The genius guy , Topher , the handlers , Adelle ( who coldly puts people in the Attic ) , everybody is obnoxious just for working for that kind of corporation . And that 's exactly what FBI agent Paul Ballard , theoretically the strongest moral person of the show , believes but , tcham tcham tcham ! ! For the sake of shocking plot twist , and nothing more than that , he begins to work for the Dollhouse ath the end of the season ... Also , we have all the usual Whedon trademark talking , trademark alternative rock songs at the end of each episode , trademark photography , etc.. After some time , this gets boring.How this show survived its first season is a miracle .	-1
Saw this on the 'Tube , pretty boring and usual envrionwhacko conspiracy type plot and bad corporation , good citizen defending the `` wetlands '' and nature.Conservationists ironically can only conserve Nature and nothing else in Human Form , The rights of The plants and animals trump Humans.Shame that Roberts and Denzel both good actors were in it .	-1
I was extremely disappointed by `` The Great Buck Howard '' .The Great Buck Howard ( John Malkovich ) is a stage performer way past his prime . A mentalist , he bounds up on stage and proceeds to astound his audience with mind reading , hypnotism and other mental games . The only problem is that he now plays broken down theaters in places like Bakersfield and Fresno and his audience , while still very enthusiastic , is aging and dwindling . In his heyday , he appeared on `` The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson '' sixty three times , a fact he mentions repeatedly , and Carson was so taken by the performer that he called him The Great Buck Howard , a title he has determinedly kept ever since . Preparing for his big comeback , his business manager ( Ricky Jay ) sets up a meeting with a potential Tour Manager . Troy Gable ( Colin Hanks , son of Tom ) has just dropped out of Law School and moved to LA to become a writer . But reality quickly settles in and he realizes he needs a job to pay the bills , so he interviews to work with Buck . He gets the job and heads out with the performer , making sure Buck 's every request is filled , that the venues have everything set up , stagehands are ready to go , and the like . The problem is that Buck still thinks he is a huge star and expects the venues to treat him as such . Buck is very bitter that Jay Leno has never had him on his new `` The Tonight Show '' and plans a big stunt , guaranteed to kick-start his comeback . He decides Cincinnati is the place and asks his management company to send a publicist . Valerie Brennan ( Emily Blunt , `` Sunshine Cleaning '' , `` The Devil Wears Prada '' ) shows up and begins to set everything in place . But she is bemused by Buck and attracted to Troy and her presence causes things to begin to fall apart.Written and directed by Sean McGinly , `` The Great Buck Howard '' misses a very key element to make the film successful and memorable . It lacks the right tone.John Malkovich is interesting as the fading star who feeds on his self-perceived fame and glory . Buck trots out on stage at every venue and shouts , `` I love this town , '' and he really seems to mean it . He plays in aging theaters and is barely able to fill them with his aging audience . But they also seem to genuinely enjoy his show . Buck enjoys performing and seems to eke a living out of it and we ca n't fault him for this.But Buck Howard is not very funny . We have seen this type of character before . Many times . And many of these performances have been more insightful , more daring and more interesting.For `` Buck Howard '' to work , we need to realize the character knows his career is fading . He does n't seem to . He enjoys the shows so much , you get the feeling he could perform for one person and he would be having fun . In fact , much of the time , he seems to be trying to make Troy 's life more difficult simply to have something to do and maintain his 'great ' status.But Malkovich never portrays Howard as being self-aware . If Buck never has any doubt about his ability or standing , are we supposed to either laugh at or with , or feel empathy towards him ? He is n't desperate enough and enjoys what he does , even on a smaller scale , too much.Colin Hanks is OK , but he spends most of the time standing to one side , observing everything.Its difficult to tell what Troy is thinking or feeling because Hanks rarely changes his expression . The only clues we seem to get come from his narration . And his narration never seems to stop , rambling on and on . Film is a visual medium , a visual art form , so hearing consistent narration throughout a movie is the equivalent of trying to read a book and having someone consistently shove a DVD player in your face to watch video of what you are reading . Narration is useful and necessary in some instances . It is n't necessary to provide an ongoing commentary about what characters are feeling on screen , when we ca n't tell this visually . At least it should n't be necessary.I can recall two recent examples of narration in film , both bad . In `` Vicky Cristina Barcelona '' , Woody Allen uses an omniscient ( and ever present ) narrator to tell us the feelings , thoughts , likes and dislikes of the characters we are watching on screen . It quickly grates on the viewer 's nerves . Worse , the narrator is n't even a character in the story . It 's like he is reading us a story as we are trying to watch the same fable unfold before our eyes . The narration in `` Buck Howard '' seems designed for a different purpose . In many low budget , independent films , a narrator provides a useful tool . They tell us about things , bridging the gap in the stories , saving the filmmakers some money and allowing the story to proceed . I generally overlook this , because it is n't quite so obtrusive into the experience and it often helps enhance the film . In `` Buck Howard '' , I get the sense the narration is designed for the same reasons , to help show things they could n't afford to film , but Hank 's descriptions go beyond this . They start to describe what he and other characters are feeling , thinking , want to do and accomplish . Why are n't we seeing this in the characters themselves ? Why do we have to be told this ? Hanks is not a very magnetic force in the film . He stands to the side a lot , observing , watching , rarely speaking . When he does , he always seems kind of flat , as though he ca n't muster up the energy to feel any real emotions . I ca n't help but think how much different his father 's career would have been had he done similar work in the beginning of his career.When Emily Blunt 's Valeria shows up , Troy becomes a little more energetic as they begin a romantic relationship . Troy actually smiles a few times and seems to enjoy the companionship.Emily Blunt provides a little bit of fresh air . Valerie arrives in town to help Buck navigate the press corps for his big presentation . From New York , it quickly becomes clear Valerie comes from a different world . She moves faster , registers faster , reacts faster than the people in Cincinnati and seems like a little tornado whirling through the town . As soon as she meets Troy , she begins to flirt with him ( she must see something we do n't ) and he picks up on it , relishing the new relationship . At one point , Valerie ca n't help but laugh at one of Buck 's statements , providing a little ray of sunshine among the group of people who are taking his every word so seriously.Steve Zahn and Debra Monk pop up as a brother and sister designated to be Buck 's official hosts in Cincinnati . It is an amusing idea , but the roles do n't really go anywhere and they end up simply disappearing.And there is an amusing ongoing joke about a feud between Buck and George Takei ( Mr. Sulu on `` Star Trek ) . But even this leads to what should have been a memorable moment and this moment just falls flat . It almost seems like everyone is playing the scene straight.I suspect `` The Great Buck Howard '' will enjoy a lifetime in obscurity , much like the fictional subject of this forgettable comedy .	-1
You 'll hear the phrase `` Total Package '' so many times that you 'll become immune to it . The fact that it 's being used in relation to a child does n't seem to bother either the parents or the pageant coordinators.From the get go , it 's obvious to everyone but the parents that the pageants are a scam . Everyone `` wins '' or `` places . '' The crowning system is some bizarre set of rules where no one really goes home a loser but where the `` Queen '' of each `` division '' is also not a winner . There 's a set of `` supreme '' crowns and a grouping of `` Ultimate '' crowns which is the `` winner '' of the entire pageant . Oh , whatever . It sounds like a set of prizes a couple of five year olds made up.You ca n't really compete in a full `` Glitz '' pageant unless you have a `` cupcake '' dress , the proper hair pieces , full make up , a fake spray on tan , glamour and retouched photos and other accouterments but your total prize will more than likely be only $ 1000 . Never mind that the cost of preparing for a pageant will more than likely run you more than $ 5000 and lots of prep time.The pageants reward and judge on beauty as it 's the only area that can not be dropped . Beauty is finite and transitory . The parents are both turning their children into monsters and leaving their children with no usable skills once their children 's beauty ages out . The most appalling thing here is hearing the parents justify the waste of time and excuse the emphasis on `` beauty . `` Furthermore , the `` modeling '' routines these children are taught are both cartoonish and ghoulish . It 's a sick , incestuous training wherein coaches teach them the same ridiculous poses they used as children that in turn make the children look almost clownish on stage and no one stops it . The judges who I can only assume are idiots reward them for it . I mean , who puts both their fists under their chin and shakes their head like an idiot and thinks it looks cute ? Or worse , draws a heart around their face ? No one and yet - every child does it.And then there 's the age inappropriate clothing . The less said here the better but these mothers really need to be hit upside the head with a large batch of common sense.And yet ... you keep watching because just when you think you 're going to stop watching , something worse comes along ...	-1
Surprisingly enough this show did not hold the attention of my two little ones . If a show is dull they move on within 5 minutes ... and that 's what they did . I however love this show !	-1
Wonderful show if you are an adolescent . If not then find something else to watch . The concept is funny but the show is not .	-1
Up until this episode I had not seen any of season 13 of South Park . To be honest I had kind of changed my perspective of South Park and apart from the odd chuckle , I was beginning to find the show less and less funny . I watched this episode with the hope that it would re-ignite my liking of the show and convince me to check out the full 12th season and what exists currently of season 13 . Unfortunately , the episode titled `` Pinewood Derby '' simply did n't allow for that re-ignition of my liking and I 'm sad to say I will not be jumping to the chance to watch the other season 13 episodes.The story focuses around what many South Park fans are constantly asking for ; an episode that has Randy Marsh as the main protagonist . This episode focuses around Randy 's passion for Stan to win the Pinewood Derby which they have yet to do in all the years it 's run . In order to win , Randy steals a magnetic piece of the CERN super collider and conceals it in the car . They win the race and inadvertently discover warp speed which is picked up on by an alien criminal who holds earth hostage while Randy struggles to keep his secret while building a new car.I suppose a lot of what let this episode down was the absence of the other 3 boys . I have never really been a fan of the Randy Marsh character . He 's good for a part in an episode , but it 's been proven in the past that an episode focusing almost entirely on him simply does n't work . The episode seems to fall flat in a number of ways . The humour did n't really get me and I only really laughed at the news report showing Randy stealing the part of the super collider , dressed as Princess Leia .	-1
An Austrailian import , it is a 'Splash ' for tween girls . In comparision , it makes power rangers look like high drama . Do n't waist your time or money here .	-1
I love southern gothic ( like Cormac McCarthy 's `` Suttree '' ) but this film is missing it 's only crucial ingredient ... truth . The symbolism is very clumsy and the adults hopelessly stereotyped . Like Bjork 's `` Dancer In The Dark '' it had me and then it lost me in an ocean of self-indulgent bitterness .	-1
Not since MONSTER 'S BALL have I seen a movie that made we want to conduct a nuclear strike on the Deep South and then hang myself.Since I 've been to the south , I wonder if anyting coming out of Hollywood ( or Sundance ) can be trusted . To filmmakers , the south is n't a region or a people or culture , but a genre that can only be pushed and mutated into exercises in human depravity and despair . I 'm sure there are people who live horrible lives ... but that 's everywhere . And I really do n't think another film about addictions , poor white trash , and rape is necessary . Just me.The acting is good . The film looks very professional . The writing ... well ... life really sucks east of Aspen and Hollywood .	-1
I have n't really watched it very much , just enough to make sure it was appropriate for my 7 year old granddaughter . She likes it very much and has watched other episodes on her mom 's account .	-1
Needlessly confusing and characters I did n't care about so the DVD was shredded after the first fifteen minutes . Next time have a better opening , movie creators . That is all.Rotten Tomatoes gave this film a low rating . Maybe you should , too.Based on a roleplaying game of the same name.The budget for this film was a bit over $ 25M and it made a bit over $ 2M at the Box Office . The prosecution rests its case.OVERALL GRADE : D minus to D ; WHEN WATCHED : April 2012 .	-1
It seems every year Hollywood dumps out a movie that is some combination of zombies , alien invasion , gory violence , gunplay and swordfighting all rolled into one . For 2008 , this was Mutant Chronicles , a movie about an ancient alien device that is re-awakened by WWIII and starts to turn mankind into zombies . An international crew of soldiers , both guys and gals , are teamed up to destroy , or at least turn of , the alien device . The movie has nothing special about its plot , dialogue , or even special effects . All in all , a waste of almost 2 hours .	-1
`` The Mutant Chronicles '' plays like a bad SyFy movie original film . In the 28th century the world is ruled by four corporate entities and nations no longer exist . When two warring factions face off and accidently destroy the seal that keeps The Machine a device that `` creates '' mutant soldiers that feel no pain and only live to attack and kill , these mutant soldiers start overrunning the Earth forcing people to flee the planet . Brother Samuel ( Ron Perlman ) recruits war veterans Major `` Mitch '' Hunter ( Thomas Jane ) along with a team of other veterans to delivery a explosive device to the heart of The Machine . The only problem is that Hunter and his team must find the key that activates the ancient bomb which is located somewhere within The Machine itself.A low budget for a movie would n't matter if it were inspired unfortunately `` The Mutant Chronicles '' written by Philip Eisner and directed by Simon Hunter , the script and direction are amateurish at best . While the cast is fairly solid it 's pretty clear to me that John Malkovich took his brief role in the film for the money ( as I suspect everyone did along with the idea of shooting almost an entire movie without real sets ) . It seems like everyone here had good intentions but they were undermined by a poorly written script , direction that focuses on the look and feel of the movie but not the performances or even assembling capable action sequences.Perhaps the element of camp and the stilted dialogue was intentional or this is meant to be a corny backstep to a 1950 's style of filmmaking . If that 's the case , you might enjoy it . I didn't.The image quality pretty good.I 'd suggest renting before buying to see if this appeals to you .	-1
I thought the plots were weak and the & # 34 ; humor & # 34 ; was not very funny . The actors did a good job but it did n't seem that they had much to work with .	-1
I was an elected official of a small , local government . This series & # 34 ; nails & # 34 ; it ! That 's why I hate it so much , it 's too real . Not fun ... very uncomfortable .	-1
I tried a few episodes . Nothing that interests me , Had the feel of the office , but in a worse way . Maybe I just did n't give it enough time , but I did n't want to waste any more time on it !	-1
Like many people , I can have my interest spiked by advertising and such was the case with this show . The advertising generated sufficient interest to get me to watch the `` pilot '' program , however , having done that , I will not be watching any of the other episodes ( despite one review which indicates that the second season `` gets better '' ) .In my opinion , the `` pilot '' should set the scene for what is to come . It should generate sufficient interest to induce you to watch another episode and another and so on . As it did not do this for me there is no logic in watching further episodes .	-1
This is a very strange movie . It is an Independent film shot on a very small budget , the characters are ultra quirky marginals , and there 's a sense of wonder if the two will actually get together or not , and what is really wrong with the 'woman ' , why ca n't she be in love ? But then the whole thing has this strange porn thread that runs throughout the film . And the ending is just plain flat out painful with Tom Arnold as the creep out father of the century . Tom Arnold has now hit a home run in the creep category.The director , writer , and lead female is Marianna Palka . Jason Ritter ( John Ritter 's son ) is the lead male actor . The film meanders back and forth between Marianna 's apartment , the video store where Jason works , and Jason 's car where he lives . In the opening montage , Marianna walks into the video store and goes sheepishly over to the erotica film section . She quickly chooses four movies . Jason tries to convince her that one choice was a bad one , and she should not take that movie . He leaves off renting her the fourth movie , she leaves with the three films . Jason then stalks her at her apartment building.The film is claustraphobic , the apartment is small , Jason over stays his welcome , the two end up just too close to eachother , the car where he sleeps is tiny . The only place that is somewhat open is the video store . Both of these characters have strange habits . She wears baggies over her hands to open the DVD 's , she hates to have her hair washed , she collects trash in her apartment , and likes to act out forcing herself on Jason . Jason likes to tell people what movies to watch , he has a regular job but ca n't afford a place to live , he is creepy about peeking through windows and shower curtains , and following Marianna around.I had a very hard time believing these two characters . It was as if the director / screen writer was trying so hard to make them both seem strange , like outcasts , outsiders ; but yet they were both somehow brilliant and deeply misunderstood . And then there was this annoying constant reference to pornography and Marianna 's distaste for genitals , male and female . The fact that the two of them are attracted to eachother , well that was reasonable.Technically , there were some problems . The audio was absolutely awful , the music was way overboosted and the dialog was poorly recorded . This is a film that relys heavily on dialog to build the craziness of the two characters , sadly the dialog was frequently muddy . This was a simple shoot , very few locations or sets ; the video store , the car , the apartment complex entrance , and the apartment . The director did not use framing to her advantage at all , Marianne changes fairly dramatically in this story ; but yet she ends up in random frame positions . There were many jump cuts that were too abrupt . Moments where incredible detail and slow paced filming , butted up against a jump cut to a much later time . The film had a hard time developing a decent rhythm . One moment the camera is in the apartment , the next in Jason 's car the next morning.The DVD includes a few trailers , oddly Confessions of a Porn Addict trailer is included . A gag reel that has the poorest sound recording I 've ever heard . This is a not so funny 10 minute reel.At One hour and 25 minutes , the movie is a bit long . The ending beats a dead horse a bit too hard . The film is definately R rated and not at all for younger viewers . Oddly , there is virtually no nudity in the film . Everything that makes this film R is verbal.It just seemed to me that Marianna Palka tried to do too much with this film ; write , direct , star in , and over play a not so bad love story . Just not a very well made film .	-1
Very stupid , i just did n't get it , maybe I 'm old school and epected something romantic to follow . 2 co-dependant people with issues , hard to grasps !	-1
We ejected this movie after 30 minutes when we first tried to watch it.Then we saw the mostly favorable reviews here on AMAZON.comSo we tried to watch it again.We lasted until about 60 minutes the second time trying to watch it and finally gave up.I think my wife 's exact words were ... `` OK , enough already . You have to put something else in to watch . This is stupid and I do n't care what happens to these losers '' .	-1
113 people on Amazon rate this show a 5 star , .. people PLEASE ! This show is so lame , .. I ca n't believe it is not on Prime.I am sorry I even paid for one season.Pathetic !	-1
I found this series opener full of the usual American empty characters and gratuitous emotion . No substantive plot . Plus , it was constantly interrupted by the Amazon downloading . I did not finish it .	-1
This is one of those shows that needs to grow on you . So far it has n't found any arable land here . I 'm being patient and maybe somebody will sprinkle me with fertilizer in the future .	-1
This series is just alright . The acting is good and the characters are good but it is just alright . It isnt overly funny and it is n't real serious- it is sort of in the middle . I mildly enjoyed to pass the time but I would n't pay more than the membership to watch it .	-1
I do n't know quite what I was expecting , but this first episode was ok , but not particularly entertaining . It was n't really bad , so maybe others will like it more than I did .	-1
This show is weird . They just get off on blowing things up and crashing vehicles . Thousands of dollars in every crash are being wasted that could be used for a good purpose .	-1
I love the high school kids , I love the music . . . so much I found my eyes misting up . Ya . . . and I want them to win the Glee Club competition sooooo much.I 've fallen in love . . .Hey . . . I 'm a vet , I love military history , The Alien Trilogy , The Terminator Trilogy and Battlestar Galactica . I want to see the wall pasted with the bad guys.Can this really be happening . . . : ) Note : At this moment I am pretty disappointed . I cancelled my subscription to Glee . . . the pilot was definitely a 4 star in my book . But the following series went downhill , IMO . The music changed , the plot seemed to get muddled and uninteresting . But especially the music . . . totally different . Mostly an obscure collection of semi-modern lyrical . Just disappointing	-1
Though I have not really seen very many full episodes of this program before , the ones that I have seen have bored me out of my mind . The plots are awfully dull , even though I do enjoy the music a lot of times . The performers are fantastic at singing and I enjoy many of the songs that they have covered , but the plots of the episodes are awfully bland to me . Other people might think differently , but that is just my opinion . I like the singing ; just not the series itself .	-1
I do n't like this show . I tried it but not worth my time . I know a lot of people love it but its jaunt not my thing .	-1
This show is a series of melodramatic storylines and overly-pop-styled songs that numb the brains of people matured beyond childhood and the tweens . These eye-roll-inducing scenes are punctuated by genuinely funny appearances by Jane Lynch . Her comedy is a raw , edgy , intelligent addition to a show that is basically the demons of American Idol possessing a school.If you are a fan of American Idol , Disney teeny bopper shows , and show tunes , watch this . If not , run for the hills ! Vapid melodrama run amuck with Jane Lynch injected to help you keep your sanity.AVOID .	-1
I love the Terminator Series . And it is FUN to have a bit more of the story to think about and enjoy . However , there is so little story , and so much video game action , that you really can never stop thinking that you are in a video game , and not `` watching a movie with a story and a plot . '' To be clear , this is NOT a video game . It is a fan-fiction type of story that was made with animation software that you would see in video gaming software . Everything caries that jerky animation quality common to older video games . Still , this is an actual story of several chapters and it is fun in the respect that you are engaged once again in the Terminator Saga.I would give it a C- for a grade for the story . : ( Slow , boring in places ... and it is hard to do that with an action film . The graphics are really not so good . Machima is NOT ready for Movie making in my opinion . The technology is n't there yet . So , graphic images fall flat.Still , it is fun to see more of the classic Terminator series ! ( even if there was no real story , and less visual interest.JJ	-1
Cheap video game quality animation even in HD format . The purchase of this series was a waste of money and time !	-1
I am just not a fan , and think of this along with many other & # 34 ; popular & # 34 ; shows like Sponge Bob as toilet humor tv . Mindless , check . Ridiculously irritating , check . Perfect for the dumb masses , check !	-1
Not real impressed with a cartoon that has an udder on a male bovine . Typical uninteresting and dull cartoon : snooze	-1
I stopped watching Royal Pains ; plots predictable , character development not forthcoming and sidekick brother too 'not bright ' and smarmy . It 's a pretty and shiny series with not much meat . Went back to watching `` Law and Order '' reruns and the new `` Chicago Fire '' . I like genuine characters -- who risk their lives protecting people , who grapple with serious ethical and moral conflicts . I like real heroes .	-1
I just discovered this little gem . I had been seeing that it was on the USA network for a couple of years now , however , I had not taken the time to watch . Today , I watched 2 episodes from season 2 I would guess and I absolutely loved what I saw . I am a huge fan of this sort of happy ending character driven ( though not to deep ) type of show . The stories are simple yet realistically believable . There is a certain continuity as well . The two stories that I watched also involved a much older Henry Winkler playing the father . I wo n't go into details of the story-lines , however , I will say this show is worth the time , if not the money . However , not for the price that is being charged here or by the manufacturer . There are only 12 - 13 episodes to these sets by USA as that is all they do to make a season . It 's the same with all of their shows . The shows are great , but the price is ridiculous . That is not to say that I wo n't purchase the sets , just not at this price . I will wait for a sale or get them used . I refuse to pay more than $ 10 - $ 13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes . The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales . So , if you can wait , it 's well worth your time and investment to own this show.wasitchuRead all my reviews here at Amazon.com , just look for wasitchu .	-1
Everyone was excited Futurama came back , but when the crew went through the black hole they lost all the wit that kept the show interesting before , and I ca n't get the crew 's corpses out of my head because this is what this season represents to me now , a defiled corpse . Really it 's just plain embarrassing to watch now from how stupid and forgettable the entire season is.Like the episode where Leela and Zapp were stuck in the middle of the woods naked , they literally do nothing but sit around naked . When I say Fan , you say Service ! FAN , SERVICE ! FAN , SERVICE ! I guess that 's supposed to substitute for jokes now . Anyone else noticing the sheer amount of cartoon nudity stuffed in each episode ? It 's like they think the reason people love watching the show is to see the characters naked , which is maybe for some of the people who gave this abysmal season 5 stars , but I liked Futurama for the storyline and jokes , which this season is severly lacking in . Instead of story , we get political campaigns ! There 's also the prop infinity episode which is nothing more than the writers getting on their soapbox and telling everyone what to think about Prop 8 . Thanks Futurama , I forgot you were synonymous with political rallies . I mean FFS I 'm not watching Milk here , I 'm watching Futurama ! I do n't CARE about the writer 's political opinions , especially when they have nothing more to say then their opinion on Prop 8 , shut up and get back to being a good show ! Oh and my personal favorite episode the season finale which is probably titled 'mutant pride ' , is an episode where it 's literally just Leela with a microphone yelling `` MUTANT PRIDE , MUTANT PRIDE ! '' . Then the mayor or whoever that 's against mutant pride turns out to be a mutant . Wow , real subtle , I could never connect the dots , thanks Futurama . I swear I 'll go out and vote for whatever you want me to as long as you shut up with the politics and get back to your good old self.What happened to Futurama , when did it go from space adventure comedy to some soft core porn/gay pride rally ? I 'm not against Prop 8 or gays , but LEAVE IT OUT OF THE DAMN SHOW BECAUSE I DO N'T CARE ! Or if you 're going to bring it up do it quick and with subtlety and do n't center episodes after episodes around it . What was once a well written love letter to old sci-fi shows is now nothing more than a corpse , taped together with Prop 8 bumper stickers and shambling around a strip pole trying to be sexy for it 's fans .	-1
i just could not get into this movie . I wonder why it was ever made . Do not bother watching it .	-1
Looking for an edgy TV police show , found a very slick , poorly written and acted show . Lots of potential , none of it realized .	-1
Boring dialog , bad acting , flat characters , and extremely tedious story line do n't add up to anything . I lost interest in the first few minutes , but I kept watching and hoping for something to happen . I was disappointed . It 's definitely beneath Dylan McDermott and Kyle Secor 's talent . I 'm surprised it lasted 2 seasons .	-1
After watching the first episode I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and watch the second episode . I made it through about 15 minutes and knew this was not for me . It seems to be a dark mafia type show . Some people may enjoy all the & # 34 ; shoot them up & # 34 ; but after watching The Glades and Justified Dar Blue just does n't measure up . I would not recommend it .	-1
Not a fun series to watch . Too much heavy drama . I guess there are no good people left in the world and these deeply undercover cops are the only blue line left .	-1
I have never watched this , but I know it eats dirt . How ? Cause I read every 5 and 4 and 3 star review . Is n't it sad how we are manipulated ? Ok. Say it is given 5 stars and you get all excited and and watch 2 hours and realize its a dog . Who gains ? ? Does Amazon pay something each time anyone watches anyepisode ? mmmmm ? I really do n't know but I suspect and so should you .	-1
It could n't keep my kids ages 3-14 entertained , it was a waste of time . watched different apposed and it was the same . it 's not like the old one	-1
Seeing as SpongeBob SquarePants has still remained so overwhelmingly popular after all of these years , I know I may receive a few negative votes from customers for my negative critique . But , before you press that unhelpful voting button ( which , please , do n't do until you have read my entire review ) I just want to let you know that I am not criticizing the whole series . At the beginning of its lengthy run , it was so phenomenally hysterical and witty that episodes were bound to generate at least a few chuckles from you , and the very best ones would leave you wishing that you had thought of some of the jokes featured in the episodes . Sadly , that spectacular quality has declined.In more recent years , the program has underwent a deterioration in quality ( I sincerely apologize to the makers of SpongeBob SquarePants ) . The negative qualities of a majority of the main characters have been enhanced ( stupidity , greed ) as pointed out by many other people , and the episodes and specials have a `` rushed '' feel to them . They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons ( which , albeit they may not bother many other people , enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series ) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid . The characters are all now more annoying in an attempt to make them appear funny , and I know lots of people have noticed the same changes and also can agree that the cartoon has lost a lot of its heart . If you want to watch SpongeBob SquarePants episodes , watch the earliest seasons if you want to be truly entertained . I genuinely apologize to anyone who may have been offended , but it 's just the way I feel . I 'm very sorry and hope I did not insult anyone .	-1
I hate it and I think its a horrible show . Makes me want to hurt the writers and the creators .	-1
I personally think there are better family and educational cartoon shows out there for young children . This is n't a program that is watched very often at our house .	-1
I usually love Robin Williams , which is why we started watching it . But it was so depressing that we turned it off about 15 minutes into the movie . It may say hilarious , but the whole time we saw it , there was not one funny line .	-1
I think this is the lowest rating I 've ever given a Robin Williams movie . Sorry , but I really did not like much of anything about it except Robin.Lance Clayton ( Robin Williams ) is a writer who has never been published , and an English teacher at the same school his douchebag of a son attends . The pejorative is Lance 's , and it is deserved . Kyle ( Daryl Sabara ) is a spoiled , foul-mouthed , scheming , brat who is obsessed with all sorts of sexual kinks , among them hanging himself while masturbating . I know there 's a technical term for it , and I lost a friend to the thing . It 's of course very dangerous , because one can accidentally kill himself.And that 's exactly what Kyle did . His father walked in on him doing this almost-hanging thing once , and was shocked , and told him how dangerous it was . Kyle blew off his father 's advice just like he blew off everything his father said . But one day he did indeed accidentally kill himself.So Lance arranged the body as if it was a real suicide instead of an accidental one , and wrote a suicide note for Kyle , so that no one would have to know how perverted the kid was . Then one of the students ( or was it one of the teachers ? ) discovered the suicide note in the police records and published it . They had all hated Kyle , but now it turns out he was a gifted writer and a tortured kid . He had only one friend , who was as much afraid of him as everyone else , was not doing well in school , disgusted all the girls , and had a serious case of the hots for his father 's girlfriend , the art teacher ( Alexie Gilmore ) .Inspired , Lance wrote an entire journal for Kyle , full of teenage angst , which Claire ( the art teacher ) encouraged him to publish . They did , and passed it around the school , and made a sensation , and Lance was invited onto a TV show to talk about it , and . . .Oh , I 'm giving too much away . It 's listed as a comedy , and I suppose it is in a dark sort of way , but I did n't find it all that funny . Robin Williams does his best , but I do n't think anyone could have given this film a focus that would hold up to the seriousness of the topics . Yes , troubled teens are a major problem , and everyone wants to try to keep them from committing suicide , but I 'm not sure this is the way .	-1
I do n't know why this movie was made . If you are expecting some funny Robin Williams bits , FORGET IT . The movie deals with teen suicide . The victim is Robin 's son . Robin is a father with zero parenting skills . While the son is a suicide victim , when you see how obnoxious he is , you would hope he becomes a murder victim . What a terrible waste of film . Do n't bother watching this one .	-1
Why did they make this movie ? It 's vulgar and not funny . The story is sickening and pointless . Promoting this movie as `` Hilarious '' is disgusting and highly deceptive . Avoid like a plague .	-1
( 1 . ) Dumb ; not a comedy no matter how bombastically distorted the characters were. ( 2 . ) No lesson or message to be learned in these absurd caricatures. ( 3 . ) Only the genetic abnormalities found in the world of Hollywood and it 's hanger-oners would find the perversions of romance a fascinating story .	-1
No , I did n't give this a low rating because I want to see Mork and Mindy . No , not because it has auto-erotica . No , not because I do n't like dark humor . I gave it a low score because ... well ... because it just was n't & # 34 ; hilarious & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; wonderful & # 34 ; , or & # 34 ; bold & # 34 ; . I gave it 2 stars because I 'm feeling generous , but if I go on much longer I will change my mind .	-1
The son of Williams in this film is so troubled and so rediculous he hates everyone and everything in life including himself . But the anti-homophobic [ ... ] he uses in the first 30 minutes of the film is nearly 30 times . It seemed to me it was a film about hating everyone and a kid so far out of control there was no help ... Williams must have needed the paycheck to pay for his heart surgery ... this film is a bottomless pit of insult and a whacked out kid who mistreats everyone including his dad ... and the dad seems to be caught up in his own selfish rediculous life ... . is this the way Americans are ? ? Sure seems it . What a let down . What an insult for an actor to take a role than try to tell us how genuis it was for a homophobic film to be put out ... would we say the same if the word [ ... ] was used instead of the fag word ... ? As a gay male this is something the Catholics would love to see and bigots are sure to give a great review . For me an open minded free thinker ... this is a waste of life and time . I gave it two stars for the acting BUT ... ( and butts come in all sizes ) I doubt Amazon will post it .	-1
It amazes me that such an amazing actor can star in such crap sometimes . This and the one where he works in the photo shop ... .crap ! ! !	-1
Robin Williams is good in this role , and it 's not the first time he has balanced a bit of humor with a serious subject . But , since I ca n't give it 0 stars , I give it what it deserves , because even though there is a laugh or two , in reality it is a HEAVY drama with tragic story lines . So do n't watch this expecting laughs like I did , and maybe you wo n't be disappointed . It is extremely depressing , and if I had watched this while depressed , this movie would have made it much worse.And , by the way , to the reviewer who said not to leave negative feedback because the movie does n't live up to expectations , I say this : It is described as a COMEDY . Not dark humor . Not black comedy . Not even `` intelligent humor '' as another reviewer said . If I had known this movie was going to be so dark and depressing , with ONLY a laugh or two , I would n't have been expecting one of Robin Williams ' comedies . I 'm fully aware of his amazing ability to do comedy as well as drama , but I do n't like to see a `` comedy '' movie about suicide , accidental or otherwise . ( and BTW who knows for SURE it was accidental anyway ? ? ? ) There is NOTHING funny about suicide . Chances are pretty good that I would have passed it by had I known it was so dark . And that may just be the point , right ? ? ? Make people think they are getting one of Robin Williams ' comedies , which are gems , and are MUCH harder to act than the dramas .	-1
Robin Williams is one of the funniest men to ever star on the silver-screen , but occasionally he does a weird dark comedy , that 's very hit or miss . In World 's Greatest Dad , Williams plays an English Teacher , who covers up his son 's bizarre and embarrassing death . The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper , making his loser son , an overnight sensation . Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this , but even he ca n't save this one . The story is just ridiculous , his son ( Daryl Sabara ) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead . No one would all of a sudden care , just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note . It 's also extremely unrealistic , since his son was as stupid as they come . That being said , with the exception of newcomer , Eric Martin , the rest of the supporting cast was awful , making the film that much more unrealistic . World 's Greatest Dad may have landed it 's star , but it 's a sloppy movie , that really does n't make a whole lot of sense . It 's an hour and a half of pure torture , with the occasional funny scene that 's all Robin Williams . This is one film that just starts out slow , never gets going and is anything but the `` hilarious '' , `` wonderful '' film that I was expecting .	-1
I rated the movie a one . I love Bobcat and Williams is an excellent actor . But , I saw no value in the movie except for maybe the last minute and a half . It is not a dark comedy , I adore dark comedy . I rented the movie `` This must be the Place '' and that was a good movie with dark comedy . There was also plenty of depth . This movie was about the human condition . Exaggerated maybe , but rotten kids are sometimes just a fact of reality . The actions of the father were pretty much unforgiveable so he was just as horrible in his own way . People can read what they want to into the movie to justify recommending it , but there was really nothing beneath the surface and there was nothing worth laughing at ; even in sarcasm . As a matter of fact , they were two people I 'd rather not know , and that includes the hour plus minutes I spent staring at them via the computer monitor .	-1
I generally enjoy `` north of the border '' movies and am generally generous with my stars . The antagonist has potential as an actor so keep going fella . The movie started well and had a good story going for the most part . For me , it all took a nose dive during that last third of the movie and never recovered . It was n't insulting so give it a rainy day watch and post your comments to calibrate mine one way or another ...	-1
I spent the whole time waiting for a point . There was none . Some of the acting was okay , but ultimately something was lacking . It just did n't make much sense and was not interesting . The whole concept had potential , so it was disappointing that it did n't deliver . It dragged on so much that I had the feeling that the story could have been better told in half an hour rather than an hour and a half . I 'm glad it was free to watch .	-1
While overall I found the series to be mostly entertaining there were a few characters who really grated me with their apparent lack of importance to the series story or their characters personalities in the show itself , mostly with the apparent uselessness of Claire and the conniving mother of the Petrelli brothers who you really wished the character Sylar would kill ruthlessly but which never happened . This season like with the third tried to give us a new foil to match the villain Sylar with dubious results but much better then the third season second villain who at the end was pathetically killed off easily , the fourth season new villain could have been better written but all in all was n't truly horrible . If you have the seasons 1-3 I would actually say just stick with those as while you can add on the fourth overall the episodes were pretty bland and though you 'll get some more heroes episodes to watch you 'll still probably feel a little cheated regardless .	-1
Just continues to go down hill . I can see why the network did not renew . A disappointing finish to a show with a great potential .	-1
They should have released this as a animated movie and not a motion comic . The story deserves that . I bought thinking it was a movie I had missed .	-1
I ordered this before I realized it is a video comic . I am not a fan of video/digital comics and this is the reason for the low rating . I did not finish watching it when I realized what it is .	-1
99 cents for 10 minutes or less , interesting concept `` what if superman 's ship had landed in Russia and he grew up under that type of totalitarian regime '' -- but you only get a few minutes of story and the rest in screen credits , not worth 99 cents	-1
episodes are only $ 1 but its pretty slow kinda hard to watch ... and for being only like 10mins it def is not worth it at all	-1
Welcome to the ADD format . The `` episodes '' are about three minutes long ; two per download . Just when the story is getting interesting the episode is over . Not to mention if you want to get really sick of a theme song listen to it forty-eight times more or less in a row . An interesting story butchered by the desire to squeeze every last penny out of it in this format .	-1
After watching this soapy , relationship-entangled space opera for five endless hours , I happened to glance at my watch to notice that only five minutes had passed.Award yourself the `` Purple Heart For Patience '' if ( like myself ) you somehow manage to stick with this turkey to its distant , disapopinting conclusion , for the purpose of finally discovering the nature of its ... '' UNIMAGINABLE MYSTERY , '' which the creators of the series -- from one grueling episode to another -- keep dangling enticingly before you.Perhaps the one and only redeeming feature about DEFYING GRAVITY is the immense sense of gratification and relief -- and `` lightness '' -- you 're likely to experience after recommending it to ( i.e. , inflicting it on ) your worst enemy .	-1
Other reviewers who have called this series 'Melrose Space ' have labeled it exactly as I would . I wanted to like the show ; the actors and set production on the space ship are really attractive to look at but ... its an empty shell when your all finished with the show . I like Ron Livinston from Band of Brothers and he 's fine here as is his narration that accompanies each episode . But these astronauts spend most of their time on earth pursuing the opposite sex and acting like stupid college kids when they go to the 'astronaut bar ' every night after work . I 'm just an 'average ' sci-fi fan so my view is when its good -- like Battle Star Galactica , its good . And when its not -- like Defying Gravity , its not . And one more thing , in sci-fi above all else , you have to get the `` alien '' whatever that is or looks like , you have to get it 'right ' , it has to scare you or blow your mind in some way . And in Defying Gravity when we finally get to the 'alien ' , the threat to the crew , its a 'dud ' , its about as 'scary ' as a piece of almond rocca candy , only in this case the candy is the most powerful thing in the Universe -- yawn . Get the first season of `` SGU '' ( stargate universe ) with Robert Carlyle -- I did , and it was WAY better than Defying Gravity and probably why its second season is showing on TV now !	-1
Same plot over and over again . My husband watches it but it seems very boring to me . Needs more plot variety .	-1
Boring , boring and boring . The script look like a recreation of a classic mexican movie but is not . This movie is worst .	-1
Even a bad movie can be good but this is n't even bad good . Not worth the bother no redeeming cheesiness .	-1
Trying to address mental illness is very tough in any context and I applaud the effort . The shortcomings ( in my opinion only ) are that not all mental health patients should disregard medications that may make them less stressful on the caretakers . I understand the husband agreeing to the absence of medication but I am not sure I like the idea of the children ( who were not asked their opinion before birth ) having to find coping mechanisms for dealing with a parent who is so obviously ill ; I speak from personal experience on the subject . If the character wanted children than the price of using moderating medication until they are adults ( and able to understand the consequences fully if the choice is offered at that time ) should have been paid . It is very complex situation and hardly fair to try to cover it in a one hour tv show but at least it brings the conversation forward and , as I said I applaud the effort . Thank you .	-1
Season One of Lie to Me was promising . The premise was interesting , the plots engaging and Tim Roth is a wonderful actor . However , by Season Two , the flaws that are inherent in a show about someone who ALWAYS knows when people are lying started to wreak havoc . ( Hey , why bother with a judicial system ? Just have Lightman ask , `` Did you do it ? `` ) The main problem with Lie to Me is that Cal Lightman is the only character who is interesting . I mean , what do the rest of them actually DO ? There are twenty or so people running around a fancy office suite that is called the `` Lightman Group '' but where 's the group ? They 've got an intern , Eli Loker , whose job it is to look scruffy . Although , later he gets promoted to `` vice-president '' after a year of being an UNPAID intern . ( I should only be so lucky . And who 's president anyway ? Who 's on first ? ) Torres is obviously window dressing . ( She does n't even have any training in psychology -- let alone acting . ) And Lightman 's partner , Foster , is there to say `` I feel your pain '' and stumble around on 6-inch stilettos . ( To be fair , all the women in the show wear 6-inch stilettos . And do n't get me started on the collagenized lips . ) And because Lightman is the only person with brains , the writers had to invent juvenile stuff for the other characters to do ( i.e . almost kissing , nearly kissing , finally kissing ) which did n't require any . Bo-ring.The other glaring problem is that by the second half of Season Two , it becomes manifestly clear that the writers have no idea what they are doing . First , Lightman has to pay off his ex-wife in order to keep her from taking their daughter to another state . ( That NEVER happens in real life . With joint custody , neither parent can move the child out of state . Did n't these people watch Boston Legal ? ) Having paid off his wife , his business is about to collapse . ( What is his business anyway ? Why does he need all those people ? And if all he has to do is stare at a person to figure out what they 're thinking , why does he need all that equipment ? ) So , he gets involved with Clara , who has scads of money but is dumb as a post . ( They eventually get rid of Clara because she really , really ca n't act . She just has these enormous LIPS , which they figured would distract the audience from the fact that there was NO PLOT . ) Then , Lightman does something stupid with some Peruvians ( who were n't from Peru , by the way . They were home-grown Latinos . You could tell by the accents , and the fact that the Sendero Luminoso has been defunct for about 30 years , give or take a decade . ) Now Lightman 's afraid of losing custody of his daughter ( When did he get custody ? I thought his ex had custody ) . So the FBI agent who hangs around the Lightman Group ( doing what exactly ? ) breaks the law not just once , but several times , so Lightman can keep his daughter . ( Although , frankly , I 'd give her up . She 's an airhead , and that `` deer caught in headlights '' look wears thin after awhile . And why is she ALWAYS hanging around her father 's office ? Does n't she go to school ? ) But the agent does n't get fired , because by now the Lightman Group has broken so many laws it would be ridiculous to fire an FBI agent for impersonating an officer , withholding evidence , obstructing justice ... you know , all those little things you 'd normally go to jail for.With all the inconsistencies , logic errors and contrivances , the plots got increasingly incoherent , until NOBODY could follow what was going on . Not even the Harvard grad who came up with the idea for the show in the first place . Even if you think you know what the stories are about , you really do n't , because nothing the characters do makes any sense ... not in this world or the next . ( Why get yourself admitted to a mental hospital to have a two-minute conversation with someone . Why not just go and talk to her ? ) And when you have n't got a decent story , the obvious thing to do is to keep transmogrifying your main character ( all you Buffy fans know what that word means ) . Now he 's a psychologist , now he 's a former criminal , now he 's Rambo , now he 's a gambling addict , now he 's an overprotective father , now he 's sleeping with that awful Clara with the LIPS god help me ... and then add enough bombs , terrorists , and psychokillers until , you hope , the audience will have completely lost sight of whatever it was the writers thought they were doing when they should have been WRITING.I have to stop , because the more I think about this show the worse it gets . . . and I really like Tim Roth . ( sigh )	-1
This show is terrible , shoddy acting , unbelievable storylines , the montages with awful cover songs , etc etc.1 . The supposed `` good guys '' are gun brokers to gangs and murderers in their own right , I could care less about them . That 's one of the main things that makes a series good is that you actually care about the characters but these guys are such scumbags all around it 's actually painful to watch . I 'm glad they lost overall at the end of this season . I was hoping for a better second season but this was worse than the first one and that 's saying a lot . I wo n't be wasting time on this series anymore . Glad I only borrowed it.2 . It 's a sad thing to see the cops in the back pockets of these gangsters . It 's embarrassing to see the Chief of Police following them around and even taking part in their crimes , a little todie . He even rats out his own `` brothers '' the FBI and ATF to this gang , endangering not just the informers lives but the lives of fellow law enforcement officers , awful . This is supposedly to protect some town from the real world ? As long as they kill outside of city limits its OK with the police ? I 'd be afraid to live in a town like this , who knows what 's next with the corrupt police and this biker gang . The cops even look the other way when someone is about to be killed ? Even if Sobel is a bad guy what self respecting police officer would do that ? The process of the law is one thing among others that makes us a society but this show seems to think it 's all OK if one set of bad guys kills another or you 're `` protecting '' a town , ugh ! Murder is wrong no matter who does it and who it is done to.3 . The constant song montages are so cheesy and overdone , ugh ! ! The covers are awful as well . Just a filler so everybody can LOOK so deep in emotion and to be pitied , etc . Weak minded people love this stuff.4 . Trying to make criminals into family men and righteous vigilantes etc is so terrible . I was sickened by all the hugs and love yous between criminal killers I wanted to gag ! This show is so embarrassing to watch . I 'm just sorry I gave this POS another seasons worth of my time.5 . A doctor turns into a helper for a criminal gang and even assaults and threatens hospital staff when she 's reprimanded for it ? Please . She needs to take that stick out of her a.. as well I 've never seen a character so constipated before ! The shallowness of it is so obvious , the characters are wooden ( Clay ) or miscast ( Jacks ) . Genna , mother Sons , is such a lowlife it 's another layer of BS that makes me dislike this show so much.If you want a realistic and well done drama you need to go to the premium channels . Boardwalk Empire , Game of Thrones , etc . For a decent but not great regular cable drama I like Justified . But this is just tripe.It 's sad to see so many weak minded lovers of this tripe , good maybe it keeps you busy watching the tube so you do n't do more damage to society by your idiocy .	-1
I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS SHOW IT 'S SO UPROARIOUSLY GUT-BUSTINGLY KNEE-SLAPPINGLY GOOD ! I ALSO LOVE DAVE 'N BUSTERS , THEIR FOOD IS SO GOOD I LOVE THE STEAK ESPECIALLY FROM DAVE AND BUSTERS ; DAVE AND BUSTERS IS GREAT LIKE THIS SHOW ! I ALWAYS ORDER THE COORS LIGHT FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS , IT TASTES SO REFRESHING DOWN MY THROAT AFTER I ORDER A DELICIOUS STEAK FROM DAVE 'N BUSTERS ! I 'M NOT SURE WHY BUT EVERYTIME I WATCH SEASON 5 OF IT 'S ALWAYS SUNNY I CA N'T STOP THINKING ABOUT HOW DELICIOUS DAVE 'N BUSTERS IS AS WELL AS COORS LIGHT ! BTW GO TO DAVE 'N BUSTERS AND ORDER THE STEAK AND A COORS LIGHT , YOU WO N'T REGRET IT !	-1
This used to be hilarious . Now it is simply obnoxious . The series is no longer funny at all . This is mainly due to Danny De Vito . This is a sad development for a series that was extremely funny .	-1
We live in Philadelphia and also like Danny DeVito . We do n't watch network t.v . comedies . SO I do n't know if this is what is considered good , funny t.v . these days . But this just seemed like going through the motions . There were a few laughs . But mostly it was just annoying to watch .	-1
Wow ... I ca n't believe I am saying this.. I am a big fan of this series ... but the 3rd season.. BORING.Feel like I wasted my $ 20 and I am not sure I even want to finish the unwatched shows.Just my .02Yawn .	-1
started watching this and just did n't feel like finishing . What could have been an interesting storyline was very disjointed , jumping back and forth in time , pretty graphic sex scences that do n't add anything to the story ...	-1
This is the second time I 've started watching this . I could n't watch it , too much suffering and sadness . Nothing that I would recommend .	-1
I guess if you like suffering and in dept turmoil you might like this movie . I thought it was very simplistic and shallow . How others thought it was deep is beyond me . I might have missed something , but from what I saw it was n't well scripted or thought out . More action and explicit explanations might have helped . I know these things happen it 's just the movie wants to wallow in the morass of confusion instead of anything deeper .	-1
Great cast - great acting , but ? ? ? ? ? ? Maybe after watching it another time it will make more sense and all the jumping around wo n't bug me as much the first time ?	-1
Movie lasts less than 2 hours . Seemed like 3 hours . Characters and script generally not believable . This is directorial debut of a screenwriter . Lack of directorial experience shows . Excellent cast wasted .	-1
Could not figure out what the story line was . Movie hopped around the lives of several different women and different time lines . I could not follow it and turned it and off after about 30 minutes .	-1
Started out decent . Timothy Hutton really loses his acting ability in this one . He delivers lines like he just read them or someone is holding cue cards off screen . Obviously just made this one for the pay check . Many of the supporting actors seem to have no acting ability either . However , Miguel & Aacute ; ngel Silvestre is very good . The dialog lets him down at times but have to give him a well done on his acting . Not familiar with his other movies but will definitely find more of his films .	-1
We stopped watching after the protagonist , played by Benedict Cumberbatch , and his brother 's spiky widow , with whom he had been edgily squabbling for a long time , and to whom he had whinged about feeling rejected , suddenly embraced each other passionately and lunged into bed .	-1
I read some of the other reviews before watching this and although they warned about the later parts of the series , I found even the beginning unclear and poorly developed . We watched the first episode only and could n't be bothered to follow up any further . It simply was not entertaining and that is all we wanted it to be .	-1
Not sure what is the point of putting things like this on the internet . Spend your time staring into the sun . You will have find it more fulfilling .	-1
I was looking for more of a sneak peak and not so much of an interview with the actors . Not what I wanted .	-1
This is clearly a Thai film ! You can tell Tony Jaa and crew got alot more money to make this film compared to the others but it leaves alot to be desired ! In most martial arts flicks the fighting barely borders on believavble but this movie goes way past that line . Mainly at the end . It 's like Rambo without the guns . Other than that the sequences are a bit jarring and the acting was kinda over the top in small doses . The costumes were fantastic though . I know it sounds like im ripping on this movie but im comparing it to Jaa 's previous movie `` The Protector '' ! Now that was amazing . This movie would definately appeal to younger viewers . Perhaps 12-18 years of age ? I cant wait for the day when Hollywood gets together with Tony ! That 's gon na be good ! ...	-1
Sorry , I like `` Californication '' , but something happened in this season , the whole thing was a like a bad parody of itself . Where it 's possible it might have been able to suspend one 's disbelief about this show before ... it is not possible any more , you just have to watch this season and try to enjoy it for the cartoon it is.Speaking of cartoons ... . I bought this factory sealed and new from Amazon , and the video is absolutely horrible . I thought I was watching this series on You-Tube ... back a few years . The resolution was terrible and the pixelation was unendurable . I checked the disks and they looked fine physically , so this must have been a mastering job done by a complete incompetent . Can anyone else comment on this ... I just really could not believe a brand new DVD set just out this year could be done so poorly.If you have to see this I do n't know what to tell you , all I can do is relate my experience . Very sorry I spent the money .	-1
If they take out the swearing and sex , there would be no show - thin , thin story line . I would not watch another episode for FREE !	-1
A guy shows up on the first episode in the nude joking about his dongle . I 'll pass . I do n't need this crap entertainment .	-1
It 's not you , it 's me ... The first two seasons were intriguing and a curiosity but as of season three , I am over it .	-1
This is about a father who is into substance abuse who seems to think it is ok to pass these traits to his kid . It shows how irresponsible the left coast is . We can say what a wonderful performance . Does n't anyone look at the substance of the show . If you try to live by the golden rule these folks live by the it 's all about me . If this is the real world.God help America .	-1
I have very mixed emotions over this latest entry into the long-running and much-beloved Stargate franchise . I fondly remember seeing the original movie at the theater and was immediately impressed by its imagination . As it evolved into a weekly series I watched as my sons grew and became enthralled in the story line with me . And yes , we even liked `` Atlantis '' .The Syfy channel promoted this show as an `` edgier '' Stargate . I found that this did not work for me . The very elements that made the original movie and following 15 seasons so enjoyable was now totally lost in this self-inflicted reinvention . Stories that were once fun , adventurous , full of camaraderie & humor were now jettisoned in favor of a grittier , darker , gloomier , smuttier and meandering approach.Some shows can evolve successfully . What we had here was the results of a very bad miss-calculation by MGM Television in canceling `` Atlantis '' . And then upon realizing their mistake the panic-ridden response to rectify this error by delivering back unto us a forced-format that was now supposed to be better because now it was `` edgier '' . `` Edgy '' can be a dangerous creative mixture with a show like Stargate . `` Edgy '' can mean daring , provocative , and/or avant-garde . But the nasty flip-side is that it can just as quickly turn into something unusual and unpleasant . And much of this `` Universe '' seemed forced and uncomfortable.Example : One early entry went something like this . `` OK , we have a room on board the Destiny that we are only now able to open and explore '' ... `` Oh look , its one of those Ancient 's Chairs , I wonder where this will lead ? '' We quickly find that it leads to an hour with an angry lesbian , a fist fight over infidelity , and `` Oh snot , my girlfriend is a stripper '' .As the second-season cancellation decisively proved , this new and `` improved '' model was not the way to have gone . Yes , this was not `` your grandfather 's Stargate '' but as it turned out it was n't my teenage sons Stargate either . Those of us who wanted `` edgy '' adult science fiction got it from `` Battlestar Galactica '' . Sometimes it is possible to `` break the mold '' and I feel this is exactly what MGM accomplished by hastily forcing this blend of science fiction together.And that 's a shame . First off , because the 15 seasons of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis were unique , interesting and fun . It should never have ended so suddenly . Lastly , the second season of `` Universe '' seemed to start finding itself and showed some promise . It was just unfortunate that it could n't survive the errors of the first season.I would have even accepted a couple stand-alone movies like `` Ark of the Truth '' and `` Continuum '' to have dealt with the season two cliff-hanger properly winding the show up . Though promised , I fear we will never see these . In a dorky way it would be cool to find a 10th Chevron that dialed the show back onto the airwaves.Note : You are right if you noticed that I did buy a copy of this DVD by `` Amazon 's Verified Purchase '' notation . I confess . I love the Stargate franchise so much , and even though these two seasons are woefully inferior , there were cameos that forever connect it and therefore makes it necessary to have in the collection . I just waited till Amazon had a crazy sale to buy them .	-1
This series has none of the draw of the two previous , mostly because the characters have absolutely no depth , nor does there seem much of a chance that any will be developed . There 's simply nothing to connect with . There 's not a single figure who is likeable , funny , worthy of loathing ... nothing . I gave it five episodes , and that 's it . Too bad ; `` Stargate '' and `` Stargate Atlantis '' ranks as two of my favorite TV shows of all time . This stunk .	-1
This is the soap opera of sci fi . One reviewer said it was Battlestar Gallactica mixed with Stargate : I think this was supposed to be Deep Space Nine . The first episodes were somewhat interesting , yet full of pretty speculative assertions and at least one enormous assumption . Yeah , the Air Force has put some kind of a puzzle into your video game and if you solve it , they just might kidnap you . Pretty sure that is n't happening , so put the controller down and get out into the sunshine kiddo . They also put all kinds of tired liberal clich & eacute ; s into the writing . The guy who beats his kid because of his Desert Storm experience ? Well , they do n't know much about actual abuse stats , but that is sort of the way an out of touch Hollywood writer type sees the world . And by the way , not all black soldiers are abusive , unless we 're talking Hollywood . The worst problem was bringing back O'Neill as some kind of serious bureaucratic jerk . I wish I could just wash this out of my brain .	-1
I really enjoyed the various incarnations of Stargate-until SGU . I hate to say it but SGU is just plain boring . The plots are sadly lacking and there is just no chemistry . The actors do a good job with what they have to work with but it is just not enough . I watched eight episodes hoping it would get interesting before I gave up . I would n't buy this series in any form no matter how cheap they offered it .	-1
I really liked SG-1 and I liked Atlantis even more . And after watching Atlantis for the second time I decided to go ahead and try to watch universe . I agree it is somewhat like BG although honestly I loved that series . This is almost work to watch . It complicated and annoying and dark . BG was dark too but it moved right along . Atlantis was exciting and fun and almost campy . I could watch it while I did other things and still enjoy it . SGU demands my attention and when I waste time just watching it it 's not fun at all . I 'll try to keep going but if they do n't get off that ship soon I 'll have to quit . I 'm up to episode `` Life '' and so far overall the series sucks . Half way through the season , there is no one moment of joy so far . I 'm going to skip to the last episode of season one and then hope season 2 is better .	-1
Did n't have the fun and quality characters of the original Stargate Series . These characters were too self-involved , too much unnecessary sex , very little self-discipline . Overall the characters were not people with whom I would choose to spend time . the plots did n't resolve themselves satisfactorily . Was disappointed .	-1
Not worthy of the name stargate . Mostly a soap about a bunch of petty egos . very little to do with good sci fi ... .. Got better toward the end of second season but I had to keep asking & # 34 ; who writes this crap & # 34 ;	-1
Do n't waste your time on this series . It 's like watching one of the stupid daytime soap operas that never go anywhere .	-1
Too much attention placed two male type major characters . I sick of them by the end of the season . Needed more plits	-1
This outta be the typical review the lovers of this show are probably used to by now ... surely enough , I love the movie , SG-1 & Atlantis ... but can not stand this one.Why ? Well , I ca n't put enough emphasis on the word BORING . It sums up most of the shows . The first episode looked promising . The SGC had discovered that dialing a 9th symbol on the Stargate could possibly take them somewhere even further than the Pegasus galaxy . There is a very large team from Earth on another planet at the far reaches of two galaxies , attempting to discover what dialing the 9th symbol leads to ? Out of nowhere the planet they are on comes under attack all of a sudden by aliens , and whomever was not beamed up by Scotty had to make a run for it through the gate to the mystery of where the 9th symbol leads to.Upon escaping through the gate , they find themselves on an unmanned alien space ship that is losing power and falling apart . From then on the first couple of episodes are up and down , sometimes they have interesting things going on , but for the most part it is a lot of boring dialog between characters I , and I know many other viewers too , just could not find likable.There is a stubborn scientist , a dork who beat a computer game and was asked to join the group to lend his expertise in being attempt at a non military or scientific perspective , a young girl who is irritating , boring , not in anyway any sort of eye candy , and certainly not a strong female role model like SG1 and Atlantis provided plenty of . The only thing noteworthy of her is her father eats peaces of BLEEP for breakfast . Being that she looks 16 , no normal hot blooded male over 18 is going to be watching her for other reasons than acting either ... so it 's a losing situation either way . Not to mention , she seems to be a BLEEP ( rhymes with bore ) and the crush the dork has on her is more annoying than anything , because I just do n't care if they end up together or not when he 's focusing on her during every waking moment he 's not being told to hack into the alien ships computer and do something life saving ... like unblocking the toilets.Many other characters are just as bad . In fact , no one is good at all . A blonde bimbo always doubting her medical abilities , Chun Li still trying to keep everything political by worrying about paper work rather than except the fact she is a million miles away from home and may never return , the colonel who is always being praised for how good he is supposed to be by his men , who always seem to be on the edge of insanity or blubbering like babies , which the colonel does himself when he 's not saying pointless dialog or switching bodies with Richie Valan 's and porking his missus . We had such great colonels in SG1 and Atlantis , O'Neil , Carter , Sheppard etc ... and now we get a guy who looks as threatening as Carrot Top flicking cotton balls at you . I would even take the last two seasons of Stargate SG1 's team over everyone in this show ! The rest of the cast pretty much mostly seem to be day players/extras and stand ins just to make it seem like there is plenty of more opportunities for more characters to come in later in the series , but i 'm at the end of the first series now , and overall I think I have been entertained by about 15 minutes in total during the whole running of the season . So I just do n't care if anyone new comes in for season 2 . It blew it 's chance by becoming a soap opera rather than everything we came to love about SG1 and Atlantis.I 'm not sure it even comes down to bad writing , I think it 's the boring cast and how the whole thing is being preformed . The biggest thing that 's making it boring is the humor ... or should I say , the lack of humor . This show has little to none at all . It 's mostly dark hallways and pointless dialog about their personal issues with each other or whether Eli or Rush should be the ones fiddling with alien computer programs to try and activate this and that thing to re-route power to shields , weapons or a device that can give the annoying chick a new brain . ( it happens , sigh ) . The rest is tedious dialogs of complaining , winging and arguments between them , taking most of the focus off of any sci-fi elements ... it clearly stands out this season did not have a big enough budget to design better sets , aliens , or interesting new technologies . There was something for everyone , old and young , sci fi fan or not in SG-1 and Atlantis , this SGU version , it 's the worst idea for Days of Our Lives in Space that could have ever been conceived.Excitement is too far and in between . Even when guys like Richard Dean Anderson , Michael Shanks and Amanda Tapping make guest appearances , it just does not make the show better . Everything about it is wrong . It 's not just the lack of humor , or adjusting to new cast members , it 's the entire atmosphere of the show . With SG-1 and Atlantis , you never knew what was going to happen in the next episode ... but watching SG-U , you know what 's going to keep happening , and the new things that do happen , all I can say is zzzzzzzzzzzzzz ... it was like reliving the end days of WCW Nitro . Repetitive , boring and no imagination . You know from the first few episodes it 's always going to be Eluid hacking this , Rush 's new theory on that , whats her name boring you to death with how pointless she is , moring interactions and dull emotions by the rest , and a sleazy scene thrown in now and then to try and attract 13 year olds whose mom 's put net nanny on their computers.I really ca n't say it enough about how boring I found the majority of this show to be . Nothing at all worked . I still hold hopes that a Stargate finale movie or season will get financed to wrap everything in SG-1 and Atlantis up . The word about the script that was written to do so mentioned it tied together and wrapped up all 3 Stargate shows ... quite frankly , if it does get made , I could n't care less if SG-U has anything to do with it , as it is the black sheep of the Stargate Universe , the actual universe , not the show with that name.And another thing ... the music and soundtrack . The film , SG-1 and Atlantis had amazing scores , full orchestras that provided music that even if you did n't pay much attention to it , it never interfered with the scenes , it built up intensity , set the moods for action , or made you feel emotional when it needed to be ... yet this SG-U show seems to have none of that . Not even a decent title sequence theme . It copies the dumb formula from Grey 's Anatomy and inserts some stupid , depressing song , and plays it in it 's entirety ... what where they thinking when they through that would be a good idea ? And the so called `` creative '' and edgy soundtrack turned out to be nothing more than irritating noises . One particular episodes music was actually giving me such a headache I ejected the DVD and threw it across the room , never wanting to hear ten minutes of what sounded like a spanner being smashed into a pipe every 7 seconds with a god awful dull slow humming noise ... whoever recorded that should be expelled from ever creating music for TV/Movies ever again.There is so much more I could point out on what I hated about this show , but if this information I 've mentioned already does n't convince you this show sucks , or you can understand why I 'm far from being alone on hating this show , then nothing will .	-1
I should just keep my mouth shut . But could not tolerate this show at all . Lame . They just recycled the Stargate saga , but out came trash . I love the Stargate stuff , but this was just lame lame lame .	-1
I 'm all for change , nothing wrong with changing the format up when it is for the better , but who ever thought this was for the better is crazy . It had a few ok moments at best , but all the will they wo n't they crap , angst and all that nonsense was just annoying as heck . Plus it was pretty much Battlestar Galactica 2.0 , as much as they try to deny it , that is all it was .	-1
YAWN ! that pretty much sums it up . I watched it on DVD after reading the reviews and it was even slower than I expected . No real science because what they presented as science was hogwash . Boring plots , boring characters . The main storyline could have been a really interesting one but they messed that up completely . Not surprised it got cancelled this show is a failure .	-1
Okay , `` we 're not supposed to be here '' ... we get it . Too bad the producers did n't take the advice of their own tag-line and reconsider ever creating this ridiculous show . I wonder how many devout Stargate fans would have been willing to make a monetary contribution to MGM for an episodic solution to SGU . Specifically , if the Wraith were to ambush the Destiny and life-suck these miserable characters right out of the Stargate franchise . Please be aware , this is not Stargate ; it 's Stargate trying to be Battlestar Galactica trying to be Lost and ends up being just more mindless drama except that it 's in outer-space.I 'll give ya a couple of examples how this series differs from the other two . In SG1 there was an underlying sub-plot through most of the series ' 10 years , involving serious emotions between O'Neil and Carter which tragically , they were unable to ever satisfy due to military restrictions against fraternization . SGU flippantly adds a scene in the first five minutes of the first episode with one of the principal characters shagging a fellow officer in a broom closet . That 's one thing about the two original series , having served in the military myself , they always tried to portray the airforce with dignity and as much realism as sci-fi can afford . Another example is that SG1 and SG Atlantis never really discuss the matter of religion however neither did the writers feel the need to casually insult it and at one time Teal'c even questions his team whether they 'd ever read the christian bible , which he had and apparently found to be rather profound . SGU , on an early episode , cheerfully shows a catholic priest in the role of an abusive , chronic alcoholic.I wonder if the producers ever considered for one second that just maybe , Stargate fans liked a more positive and upbeat universe and for their characters to be compassionate and kind of heroic while not taking themselves too seriously . Did they ever think that just maybe some people are n't interested in tuning in week after week to watch a group of angry jerks vying for power in a seemingly hopeless situation while being filmed by an apparently , paranoid camera crew. Gon na be completely honest here and say I only made it about halfway through season one because after watching this show for a few weeks I eventually gave up hoping it would all get better and just sank to the ground ( kinda like Charlton Heston at the end of Planet of the Apes ) and railed at MGM : `` You maniacs ! You blew it up ! '' etc .	-1
Interesting concept that suffers from uneven dialogue writing and stupid plots.A certain mad scientist gets annoying with his tantrum throwing . Sci-Fi dumbed down right before your eyes .	-1
BOO FOR PBS . I was very disappointed that only three episodes were free for Prime Members and the remaining were for purchase . American Experience was a broadcast from Public Television which the U.S. Taxpayers support , whether they like it or not , from their taxes . To have PBS peddling this program for their monetary gain is appalling to me . This program can rot on the shelf before I would consider looking at it again .	-1
It 's one thing to speculate ; it 's another to make a ridiculous statement : & # 34 ; Moses was the only person to ever see God. & # 34 ; Wow - hubris , move over ! a new low in standards of broadcasting . This entire series has been great to watch ( the Romans was excellent , and Martin Luther was too ) but I stopped dead in my tracks and hit the stop button on the intro to this one - reading the other reviews , there 's a lot to be avoided in this episode - I have no idea what they were thinking when they wrote this , but just bad writing ruined it . & # 34 ; One nation conquered over and over was the Israelites ; no people in history were more likely to be forgotten. & # 34 ; What ? Plain crap . Bad history . Not true , and it does n't end there , they go on and on , and do very little objective & # 34 ; history. & # 34 ; Do n't dump the series , just skip this clunker !	-1
Like I said do n't bother watching this show at all because the acting is so bad . The only couple good episodes are the Beast of Monteray , Dover Demon , Vampires , and the giant centipede one . Overall still bad but those I think are the best ones .	-1
I just watched the very beginning and decided that it was n't something I would like , so I did n't finish it .	-1
I enjoy watching shows with real evidence proof like forensic files . This show is created poorly with subject matter had to believe . Was deceived by the title .	-1
While `` Sanctuary '' is a clever science-fiction show , it 's never especially compelling . Much of the time , I find myself falling asleep halfway through an episode . ( If , at that point , I happen to switch to some other time-shifted TV show on my DVR or a DVD , there usually is n't any nodding off , so it 's not a question of fatigue . ) Every week , a wild not-entirely-half-baked storyline is thrown out , a lot of crazy business ensues and , by the end of the episode , the whole Sanctuary team is sipping tea in Helen Magnus ' office . While the show touches upon interesting topics such as giant abnormals living in the earth in some sort of collective Gaia-like symbiotic relationship , every week this sort of thing is being fired your way en masse . Sanctuary blends steampunk , religion ( Kali , for one ) , abnormal myth ( vampires , werewolves , etc . ) , historical figures ( James Watson , Jack the Ripper , Nikola Tesla , etc . ) , science and adventure together and then funnels the concoction down your throat . It 's all a little hard to swallow . **1/2 out of *****.That being said , I was glad to see the loss of one regular character this season ( hint : it 's the worst actor on the show ) and the introduction of a new one . The whole Cabal storyline is wrapped up entirely too quickly.Despite my issues with the show , I also watched season 3 , which introduces hollow earth into the mix and is an improvement over season 2 .	-1
As I wrote in my review of season one , season two was going to make or break Sanctuary . And it broke.Only watched the DVD set , so perhaps if I had spaced it out a bit , it might not have been so bad . Ms Tapping 's acting ability failed to come to work with her , effects did n't improve ( in some cases were worse ) , the werewolf guy is still a miscast ( it shows more in this season ) . And just before I started writing this , I see there 's a season three ! ? ! Poor sci-fi/fantasy fans . There 's so little really good stuff to watch , that some of us will take anything.No more Sanctuary for me . Ever . No surprise amazon has season two `` on sale '' .	-1
Tosh.0 is not for me . I find his humor pedantic and crass . I know many people enjoy this show . So if you like your humor on the bawdy side maybe this one is for you .	-1
Nice idea for this show -- a real comedian ( instead of a vanilla entertainer ) leading the audience through a clip show . But the producers spend way too much time on Tosh and not enough on the real content .	-1
Unfortunately , this show is going in the direction of most of the other fare on tv . It is shaping up to be the evil aliens ( who really look awful instead of beautiful ) against the good guys ( FBI agent , priest , etc. , as rebels ) . The entire show this time advanced that premise rather than developing other aspects . I wish the aliens were n't so unrelievedly beautiful on the surface and evil underneath too . It does n't leave much room for interesting stories other than good guys vs. bad guys . The only thing I enjoyed this time was looking at the beautiful alien Anna and the neat way she could try on outfits virtually . I doubt I will watch this next week . I think I will stick with FlashForward and Fringe as my sci fi of choice this season . Save your money .	-1
I 'm going to start off by saying that while I love and adore the original sets of V miniseries ( V and V : THE FINAL BATTLE ) , I absolutely loathed the spin-off weekly series . Waaaaay too soap-opera for me.With the advent of smarter and deeper television over the last decade , I was first in line to give the new V series a chance , especially since it had featured so many actors that I had loved from other shows I loved ( Elizabeth Mitchell from LOST , Morena Baccarin AND Alan Tudyk from FIREFLY and Laura Vandervoort from SMALLVILLE ) , and a modern sensibility brought to a great Sci-Fi concept is usually a good thing ( see BATTLESTAR GALACTICA ) .But where the old V miniseries succeeds is every place that the new V weekly series falls short.First , there 's character : After watching the first ten episodes , I found , and not for nostalgia 's sake , that I cared more about the original miniseries ' characters over the course of 3-4 hours than I ever did about any of the characters on this incarnation . There is just nothing there to connect with . Mitchell 's FBI/mom character is the only one that has anything to work with and it 's just not enough . Baccarin 's Anna has none of the gleeful devilishness of the original series ' Diana ; Scott Wolf 's Chad Decker is so much of a non-entity that I 'm surprised that he 's even credited.Second , the plot : It 's pretty much the same as the original , but the V 's seem to be bringing more with them . And certainly their weapons are more high-tech . And they 've been here before , developing `` sleeper cells '' which is a change from the original . But in a Post-9/11 America , we sure are awful quick to accept the V 's , which just does n't hold water . And conversely , we 're awful quick to determine that there has to be a Resistance against these evil V 's ... and this is all in the first episode.Third , the action : Where is it ? There was never a moment of tension that was more than barely palpable in all the episodes I watched.In the final analysis , I stopped watching not because it does n't match up to the original , but because it could be smarter and more tense , and it just is n't . I gave it chance after chance , but besides the few moments I thought worked , there were so many that didn't.I never thought that I 'd be yearning for the days of Marc Singer , but the new V series does make you more than just nostalgic . It makes you wonder why , when there have been great Sci-Fi shows like LOST , BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and FIREFLY , that this is a show that has been successful . It 's obvious that ABC is looking for its next LOST , but V is not it . Not by a long shot .	-1
The story of V does not adapt well . The dialogue is at parts very boring . The teenage love interest is very , well dry and stereotypical of a teenage drama . The teenage drama often detracts from the main story line . It tries to create a 24 sense of urgency at times , but fails . I could explain more , but bottom line there are far better choices out there . Season two barely made it from being canceled . Do not expect a third season .	-1
This show had so much promise . Sure some of the characters were dreadful in dialogue . Yes , you could tell things were off to a slow start . But when the V first hit Earth it 's all very exciting . Then the show was thrown into a pile of trash , and is generally not worth watching . I recommend watching the series until the V introduce themselves on the giant undership screens , then hit your foot with a hammer , and save yourself the time of watching anything further .	-1
I wanted to like this show , but it was just so incredibly bad . The story is poorly executed in the very crucial sense that there 's very little true drama , no intensity , no suspense , no humor , no heart , very little action . In short , the story lacks the absolute critical elements ( or ingredients ) that go into good story-telling and consequently the show was not entertaining . The only real story seemed to be the supposedly-friendly-acting-but-really-sinister aliens ( aka the Visitors or the Vees ) have some super secret evil plan that a handful of humans and `` truly friendly '' aliens are trying to reveal and stop . That single lone storyline takes up the entire season and it flimsily and boringly drags on and on and on for the entire first season with a few vapid sub-stories thrown in . So the season was really boring since the story never seemed to progress , mature or truly go anywhere . Watching it was frustrating . And making matters worse is the fact that all the characters are boring and uninteresting -- the FBI agent , the Priest , the hammy over-the-top Mercenary-type , the friendly `` black guy '' alien -- are all boring . The writing is so weak on this show . The acting is bad . The SFX are bad -- I 've never seen worse green screen SFX shots on any TV show . For a truly good SCI-FI TV re-make , check out the re-do/re-make of `` Battlestar Galactica '' ( Seasons 1-3 ) . That was an excellent re-make of an older SCI-FI TV show . This remake of V is a colossal disappointment .	-1

This account of her life seems quite sanitized , almost like the Hollywood press releases of old ; in the days when the studio painted their 'version ' of a star . There were certainly contradictory remarks made by different 'associates ' of Crawford , you were never sure if they were friend or foe . Certainly interesting stories about her early days in Hollywood , but not a lot about her personal life . Only one of her children commented on Joan as a mother , and she was one of the twins adopted later than Christina and Christopher . Did the abuse occur ? I think it did . I 've seen and read the accounts of Crawford 'insiders ' who were witnesses to what went on behind closed doors . So , all in all , I guess this is n't a terrible 'Bio ' , but I would like to have seen something a little more than a fluff piece , but one that really dug in .	-1
I really liked this movie and wanted own a copy , what I got was a press release . I am a little annoyed that this is all I got . I 'm currently looking at how I can delete it from my library .	-1
i do not know who in the family was watching this one no one will admit to having watched it .	-1
I liked Jeff Dunham on his TV appearances but was disappointed in this show . I guess he thinks he has to have some crude content to be funny .	-1
I used to like this guy . But the show is not funny not funny not funny . I did not bother seeing more than one episode and I doubt I will see another one . I could not even finish the first one . Really surprising .	-1
I have always enjoyed Jeff Dunham on variety shows . He has created some great characters and is very funny . Unfortunately the concept just does n't work .	-1
This is what happens when a comedian burns out . Dunham 's entire thing is his puppets , with which he insults his audience and gets away with it . On a personal comedy-club level , this is acceptable . Once commercialized with music and fake laugh tracks , this show went to hell . In Dunham 's case , since his entire show is based upon puppets , to come up with new material , you have to come up with new puppets . The scenarios that he has come up with ... visiting real people and businesses and warping out obnoxiousness for humor 's sake ... is NOT funny . Let 's not forget Dunham is JNew W*rld Ord*r and his denigration of and overt racism for the White Christian and Muslim races is nothing short of criminal ! You see what his race of people REALLY thinks about other races on the planet ! His stuff is NOT funny and he 's reached the end of his rope ... perhaps he 'll hang himself with it !	-1
`` The Jeff Dunham Show '' is a Comedy Central offshoot of Jeff Dunham 's live shows using the familiar characters Walter , Achmed , Bubba J , Sweet Daddy Dee , Peanut , and Jose Jalapeno . In this seven episode season , Dunham introduces his characters onstage in front of an audience and then goes to a clip of them out in the real world trying to interact with other people.Watching the show , the format is VERY similar to the Dave Chappelle Show where he would interact with the audience and introduce segments and then go to the clip in a sketch comedy sort of way . However , the difference between Dave Chappelle and Jeff Dunham was that Chappelle was really good at this . When Dunham takes his characters out in public , the audience is supposed to believe they are real people and other actors and celebrities talk to the puppets . For example , Brooke Hogan is set up with Peanut on a date until Peanut `` eats '' some guacamole laced with nuts that he is allergic to and Achmed intercepts the date to put the moves on her . We see the characters ' feet , dancing with other people , shooting guns , all sorts of things.If you like these characters and think they are funny on their own , than this show will probably work for you and you 'll enjoy it . The magic of the previous live show format was that everyone marveled at Dunham 's ability to DO these characters since ventriloquism is n't easy and there was always potential for him to start cracking up too much or making a mistake or Achmed 's arm falling off which would increase the hilarity of any given bit . Taking the `` live '' quality out of the format with everything being pre-taped in these segments means they could have used as many takes as they wanted to finish a scene , so it just is n't as impressive as when it is done on the spot . Also the scenes themselves just are n't written that funny anyway.The concept of Jeff Dunham having his own show sounds great , but this format does not work for his brand of comedy and talents effectively.Bonus Features : Behind the Scenes shows the making of sketches of Achmed joining the Marines and also Achmed 's funeral . Jeff Dunham is smart enough to know that Achmed is one of his most universally liked characters due to his talking in a wittle cute voice and varying inbetween that and temper rages . These segments are n't more than a few minutes and include some Comedy Central Promos.The unaired sketch is with Sweet Daddy Dee , a character I do n't even remember from other specials I 've seen from Jeff Dunham . He apparently gets to wear lots of chain bling and slang . His cut scene is Sweet Daddy Dee helping Germans get rid of an acapella group singing in the attic . Yes , the attic . He turns them into a Bavarian singing group to save them and when the Germans still do n't like them , Nazi and `` The Sound of Music '' jokes abound . A good choice to cut.The bloopers show that his live bits introducing scenes often had to be retaped , especially when he starts coughing . He often forgets his lines and starts laughing and stuff goes wrong with the puppets getting their hands stuck on walls .	-1
I guess I 'm the odd one because I found it to be rather stupid - sorry , could n't think of another word to describe my feelings about it . I decided to fast forward through , hoping to come to something that would be interesting , funny , good ... . Just when I thought it could n't get any stupider , the girlfriend shows up and voila , it got stupider . Even the ending , which was supposed to be a `` gotcha '' I guess , just did n't have any juice . Was also difficult to see Meg Ryan , whom I 'd always enjoyed , with the beginnings of messing up her face . A pathetic and somewhat creepy story .	-1
When she is informed by her husband of thirteen years that he is leaving her for another woman , Louise does what every self-respecting woman in her position would do : she conks him over the head , duct-tapes him to a chair , and threatens to hold him prisoner till he comes to his senses . Thus , for an hour-and-a-half , we 're forced to watch as two self-indulgent crybabies - one a cheat , the other a raving psychotic - thrash out the details of their relationship in a tone so grating and mean-spirited that before long we 're ready to send in our own hostage-negotiating team just to bring an end to all of our suffering.Despite the presence of Meg Ryan , Tim Hutton , Kristen Bell and Justin Long in key roles , `` Serious Moonlight , '' directed by Cheryl Hines and written by the late Adrienne Shelly ( both of `` Waitress '' fame ) , is a hopelessly contrived , endlessly off-putting dark romantic comedy ( a la `` The War of the Roses , '' albeit without the courage of that film 's ending ) that , I guess , is supposed to be every cheated-on spouse 's idea of the perfect wish-fulfillment revenge fantasy ( even if the fantasy winds up going awry in the end ) . But the claustrophobic setting , the sadistic tone , and the sheer unpleasantness of it all make it an excruciating experience to sit through . At one point , Hutton seems to be speaking for the audience when he states , `` It 's like torture . '' That 's about as astute an example of built-in self-criticism as I 've ever come across in a movie .	-1
This is a comedy that is too slapstick for my taste . It 's old and it shows its age with juvenile humor that is past its prime . Shirley Temple is one of the students of the teacher , not a main character . Watch it if you want to see Shirley as a tiny waif , but you 've been warned .	-1
SPOILERS WARNING ... .J.J. Abrams has a huge slap coming from me . The reason is simple : I swore to my wife years ago that if I should ever discover an actual name behind the 'pioneering ' camera shake , I 'd slap him ( or her ) . No one needs to see a film that looks like a frightened tourist 's film of an erupting volcano while fleeing it.That is perhaps my biggest beef with this film . Abrams is shown in the mini-documentary actually shaking and/or slapping the camera as he is shooting key scenes . This , along with `` the glare '' ( from stage lighting ) is Abrams ' big innovation . This camera quivering and vertigo-inducing swooping is why I have wanted to slap him for so long.As to this film , let us speak as we find : this is not even a remake , much less a homage . It is a highjacking . Though the actors are flawless and talented beyond description for their performances here , it is en evil waste . By starting the film with a history-shifting time traveler , Abrams has cheated everyone who sees this , everyone who retains the love of the original series.Having said that , it is a bloody brilliant move . The so-called Star Trek `` franchise '' was at an apparent end . The TV series `` Enterprise '' had failed miserably ; no one seemed to be in control of the intellectual property of Star Trek itself ; fans felt a sort of dying era taking place right here , right now . This film saves us from that fate ... or does it ? In the distant future , an elderly Spock gets embroiled with angry Romulans since he apparently is responsible for their home planet ( Romulus ) being destroyed . A surviving faction of Romulans -- especially nasty leader Nero -- go flying backward in time , and Spock is forced along behind them . They appear 25 years before James T. Kirk is born , and they wait.Kirk 's father is captain of a starship . The nasty Nero destroys the ship ... and James T. Kirk 's father . Here is the bloody marvel and the disgrace : this event has offered us a parallel universe-reality , and from thence the film takes off , going boldly where I wished it had n't . The elderly Spock is now on a mission to see that Nero is destroyed , which task can only fall to Kirk , of course . Meanwhile , the alternate reality trick goes stale rapidly . Vulcan , along with Spock 's mother Amanda , is destroyed ( and so is the screen time for Wynona Rider ) ; Young Spock is entangled and enamored with Lt. Uhura ; Chekov is a little faerie who is damned good at beaming people anywhere ; Kirk himself is a rather gay-looking idiot and part-time drunkard ; the rest of the clan is essentially ignored.Abrams and all involved are truly innovative and brilliant . But this film can not pass without further comment . The ghosts of De Kelley and Jimmy Doohan will never rest now . Too many people still remember them with happiness and the pain at the loss of them . Yet here they are , along with the others , being mimicked or parodied or whatever one wishes to call it . I can not fathom how Nimoy could agree to star in this , but he did . Who else could play `` Spock Prime '' as he is credited ? My advice is that if you are a purist , do n't see this . If you are a curious , adventurous and sacred-cow-kicking fan , see it . Do n't miss it if you are a fan of lunk-head director J.J . If you like cinema for its own sake , see it by all means . I for one felt a bit robbed by it all . I can not begin to imagine what Rodenberry might have thought of this desecration .	-1
Mind you , this review is coming from someone who could care less about the STAR TREK series and films . I went along with a few friends to see this , and while I really enjoyed the first forty minutes , the rest of the film was rather weak . I did n't care for any of the characters . Maybe it 's just me . Science fiction is my least favorite genre . I can say this : the acting was well done . I was surprised by how good they were . Bravo to the actors . As for the rest of the film , well , lets just say I wo n't be seeing it again.See it if you must . Trekkies will get a lot more out of the film than I did . In fact , I 'm sure they 'll have a blast .	-1
Not what I thought it would be ... name is a little misleading . Perhaps I should have thought about it before selecting it for review .	-1
Not much to look at . A straight ad . Some pretty sights but not worth the time it took to watch	-1
Very disappointed would n't recommend it at all ! It downloaded good but other than that it is n't worth any ones time !	-1
I was disappointed in that it is a travel advertisement dressed up like a movie . The movie is okay , but I would have not downloaded it had I known .	-1
This looked like an advertisement and not a movie or entertainment . I simply could not watch all of it as it seemed a complete waste of time !	-1
Too long to get going I did not watch it completely through to long to start up , these are seals let me see some action	-1
Meant to be a tribute to our troops , ... I think . That it does , but it jumps all over the place blink and you will lose the plot . Really , there are better films out there do n't waste your time on this one .	-1
Seal Team VI is like all other war films supported by the Department Of Defense . The story line is pretentious as is the dialogue created for the characters . There is way too much chest pounding and too little action in Seal Team VI , which relies more on DOD supplied war footage than action scenes created by all involved in making this movie . I was really embarrassed for the producers , the director and the writers , who in their mind 's eyes made a homage to the Seal Team program . This film is as bad as & # 34 ; The Green Berets , & # 34 ; starring John Wayne , which was a homage to the Army 's elite unit , the Green Berets . People with service backgrounds should stay away from being creative , and leave it to the professionals . The DOD influence just muddies the creative waters . Only Oliver Stone served up a film depicting his Vietnam experience that proved to be Oscar worthy in his 1986 film , & # 34 ; Platoon. & # 34 ; These other wan na be film makers fell on their face in their attempts and Jeremy Davis , in my opinion , is one of them .	-1
Just did not work for me . The action was weak , unbelievable . Writing was not very strong . Maybe the actors are very popular over seas and that 's what carried the movie . But I would not recommend it to anyone .	-1
I was able to see this film in my home as part of a sneak peak preview this month . Luckily I was able to see the original first as if I had watched this disappointing sequel first , I may never have bothered to watch the vastly superior original . The film is bogged down with a tedious plot that only slows the action down . The stunts are still impressive , but it just does n't deliver like the original film . Too bad ! : - (	-1
Wow , what a pile of trash this show turned out to be ... I guess obnoxious , sexist , chauvinist , offensive , disgusting , neanderthal humor is not my cup of tea , I would call this a guttural deeply embedded teenage boy fantasy goop comedy wannabe . I regret even watching the single episode of this trash . If you like this kind of show , have fun , but be warned it reaches way under the gutter of impropriety for its kicks ... you 've been warned . The series is rated `` M '' for mature of audiences ... what demographic are these folks pushing for ? Definitely not `` Mature '' that 's for sure .	-1
I like action movies , etc . , how ever this attempt at launching another ( Batman ) falls real short of being believable . I tried watching several episodes but could not get over the feeling of it being ridiculous .	-1
I heard about this from my son , he said he just laughs and laughs . I do n't . I find the mom character the most amusing , especially when her son said he used to pretend she was n't his mother , she said & # 34 ; me too & # 34 ; ... much like the comedy Arrested Development ( I believe she is the same actress ) . Other than that , I have n't so much as smiled .	-1
How depressing . I 'm tired of all these unsolved missing person cases with no resolution . I 've seen too many of these sorts of mysteries and want a show about all the people that are found and how the detectives or whoever was involved went about it . The police should bring in a good psychic in some of these seemingly hopeless cases . They might be able to help . I feel terrible for the families and friends who suffer this terrible unsolved loss and it 's just too upsetting to watch anymore . My heart goes out to them .	-1
Not so good . A bunch of & # 34 ; smarmy , look at me & # 34 ; crooks and murderers that want to get a little bit more noteriety by bragging about their despicable deeds . Would not recommend .	-1
I LOVE the Poirot moves and David Suchet is Poirot embodied . However , since there are many other reviews that give better information on the content of these movies , I am simply commenting on the quality of the video.For some reason , this specific episode is really grainy . I 'm not exactly complaining because I 'm streaming them at such a little cost through AmazonPrime 's annual $ 79 fee which is a mere pittance . To use the language of Poirot : DJust saying ... I do n't know why this one is not very good quality-wise , and I just watched the previous two in this season and no prob . It almost looks like old fashioned film .	-1
This series was not as funny or interesting as I remember it to be . I was disappointed.Why is there a minimum word usage	-1
This series just tries to be witty by playing on tired old stereotypes . Dull , no insight , puerile . There are so many better things to watch these days .	-1
This work goes into how a free woman could marry and stay with a husband who has life in prison . To each their own . I wish the two of them the best . However , one thing did n't sit well with me.The wife wants to have a biological child with her husband . If Florida does n't allow conjugal visits , then why would they allow semen to travel across the prison walls ? I believe the Supreme Court said marriage is a fundamental right ; however , the same is not absolute about procreation . Let 's face it : most children raised in a house with one income with a parent that will never be free will likely face lots of poverty . Further , sexual violations and drugs are common in prisons . What if the man-goo has a disease in it ? What if a woman like Octomom wants to keep having children with an incarcerated husband . The money it would take to raise these kids would have to come from our state , aka our tax dollars . Further , I think criminologists could argue that in the same way that the punishment of prison involves not having contact with the opposite sex ; along those lines perhaps prisoners forfeit their ability to reproduce . There are already far more than 1 million children with incarcerated parents alive ; they face circumstances that are not easy . Further , Mrs. Bailey proves that she has a big heart ; a parentless child already alive could greatly benefit from having her as a parent , or foster parent.In short , this woman 's wish is just NOT going to happen . It would set a very dangerous and costly parent . I identify as a political progressive . I sympathize with the folk in prison . But this reproducing is just not going to happen and prison wives need to just accept that .	-1
boring . I did n't even watch the whole set . I relisted it , immediately . could not get into . the movie was so funny , not the tv show .	-1
I do n't really love Little Bear because it looks ok that was so very angry and I really hate this show	-1
The description for the Eclipse is 100 % completely *wrong* . This is NOT a suspense- it 's a romance with subtle elements of drama . We were all fooled into thinking this was some kind of horror story involving a ghost writer being tormented but it 's anything but . We were also fooled into believing there would be serious discussions involving what it feels like to actually witness a ghost for real and how the human mind feels after witnessing such a traumatic event.Instead it 's about a ghost writer who meets a woman who shares similar interests in ghostly activity and they gradually fall in love . Of course there 's another guy in the picture , who 's apparently a boxer . Well the two guys hate each other and are secretly jealous over the woman without actually coming out and admitting it . Instead we discover that the boxer basically believes the ghost writer is a stalker , while the ghost writer believes the boxer is a drunk.There 's only two segments that are worth your time . One takes place about an hour in when the ghost writer opens his bedroom closet and a scary event takes place in the floorboards , and the other is the fist fight between the two men above . That 's it . The rest of the storytelling is meaningless and painful to watch.It 's a shame too- this movie looks like it takes place in either Ireland or the gorgeous countrysides of England which are *perfect* locations for a horror setting . Instead it does n't even try for a supernatural setting . I recommend skipping it completely .	-1
Honestly , I generally do n't care for romances . This was a little different from the usual more like & # 34 ; Ghost & # 34 ; was several years back , but more of a wispy ghost than a felt presence guiding events ! Somewhat disappointed by the nuances of the characters feeling their way through loss and unrequited relationships ! The music background was not to my liking , but then we all have different tastes !	-1
There is no mystery in this movie what so ever ; there are no ghosts ; there is nothing supernatural . Just ignorance . Everyone has lost someone that they love but to randomly toss in a couple of fakey slightly scarred head shots in spots that make no sense ( e.g . in the car seat next to you ; under some stuff in a room ) or a couple of brief ghostly apparition scenes lasting a few seconds that do nothing - please ! That any of these mysteries are part of illusionary compensation for losing someone is beyond belief . Also , to intermingle and confuse the one story line with another with an artificial good guy - bad guy - cute girl love triangle seems to be added to appease a certain viewing demographic but has no other function in this supposedly `` spine-tinglingly '' supernatural thriller.Finally , what does an eclipse have to do with the fundamental plot/story of the movie ?	-1
The Eclipse ( Conor McPherson , 2009 ) After I hit paydirt with Outcast , the wonderful Scots urban fantasy picked up for US distribution by Bloody Disgusting not long ago , I figured I 'd see what else the British Isles had in store for me . Ireland has been a solid , if not necessarily prolific , producer of good horror films over the past fifteen years ( viz . Isolation or Dead Meat ) . The Eclipse , which boasts a cast headed up by Ciaran Hinds ( There Will Be Blood ) , Aidan Quinn ( Benny and Joon ) , and Iben Hjejle ( Defiance ) as the woman they 're both in love with , seemed like just the thing with which to pass a gloomy , snowy Friday night . Unfortunately , it fell quite flat.Hinds plays Michael Farr , a volunteer at a literary festival who is still reeling from the recent death of his beloved wife ( Hannah Lynch in her only screen appearance to date ) . He is assigned as a driver for two visiting notables , paranormal researcher Lena Morrell ( Hjelje ) and horror novelist Nicholas Holden ( Quinn ) . Holden , an American , is married , but the cat is away , and he 's got his sights set on bedding Morrell . Michael , on the other hand , initially sees Morrell as a possible gateway to understanding why he sees & # 8212 ; or believes he sees & # 8212 ; the ghost of his wife , but he , too , begins to fall for her.Ultimately , I believe The Eclipse is an attempt at the supernatural-drama subgenre that the Southeast Asian film market has honed to a fine edge , and that most of the rest of the world does n't really know exists . It is unsuccessful , though I have no way of knowing whether to blame the original story ( by Billy Roche ) or its adaptation ( by McPherson ) ; either is possible . Another rewrite might have made it a bit more coherent and turned a collection of interesting scenes into a full story , but that rewrite never happened , and we got what we got . You can feel free to give this one a miss . **	-1
I give two stars here only for the soundtrack and for Ciaran Hinds.As for the rest , it really is n't a ghost story . It 's a narrative mess , muddled and confusing , with the focus taken off of the main character and given to two others whose story is not interesting.Too bad it was so pointless . It could have been much better .	-1
No one could fault the production values . But this movie is confusing as hell . Character decisions , conversations and plot points appear incoherently , without enough explanation or exposition or motivation . It 's often hard to tell where things are happening , where people are , why they 're there , who they 're talking about ... All a disjointed mess . Jet Li does a good job playing a confusing character , though .	-1
I expected like a small prequel or sequel from the original movie but , it was more of documentary of the actors and their thoughts during the making .	-1
I have now seen the first two dvd 's of season three . It 's not good . I gave the first two years five stars . It now gets two . Even the music is bad . The theme over the end credits has changed to a fluffy piece.I see the show has been canceled . No wonder .	-1
What a horrible bunch of garbage . Did you read Julius Caesar in high school . Well , even if you hated it , this version of it is way worse .	-1
I did not get past the first 5 minutes . It is absolutely the worst acting , the worst script , , the & # 34 ; dirtiest filming by perverted camerament & # 34 ; and probably perverted directors . It is too bad that Hollywood can not seem to get its head out of the cesspool of degenerative morality . This is not recommended in any way , shape or manner . I suggest Hollywood come out of the closet and admit it is only interested in pornographic , tasteless , sophomoric scriptwriting .	-1
I 'll admit that I only watched a little of this but the violence was beyond my acceptable level so I quit .	-1
Only watched one episode . it was too political for my taste . but i 'll give another chance after I finish Game of Thrones .	-1
I agree with other comments about how this video is not good for the family to watch . Moral values of this film are very poor.I did not even get very far into the movie before seeing way too much sex and nudity . I would not recommend this movie to anyone with moral values .	-1
First program in series was OK but not great . Evaluation will depend on whether we watch other programs in series	-1
I really looked forward to seeing some of what looked like an epic historical series based on the Roman empire , but what I ended seeing was a lot of violence and sex , and that seems to be the major draw of the series . Of course , a genuine Roman history buff might appreciate it more , and this series does have a certain epic quality about it.I could even cope with Romans speaking with British accents ( what are British actors supposed to speak with ? ) if I had actually found a character or two to care about . It seemed like everyone was callous and brutal , and maybe that 's the way Rome was , but after sitting through the first episode of this first season , I found myself not wanting to watch any more.I 'm sure Rome will go on without me , and my best advice is to find a way to `` try before you buy '' and plunk down a lot of money to find it 's not what you expected .	-1
Corny plot , soap opera acting ! ! ! Very poor production , will not watch any further episodes.Do not bother unless you are interested in & # 34 ; Dallas & # 34 ; in different costumes !	-1
I could not have been more of the thought that & # 34 ; Well , there 's an hour or so that I 'll never get back ... & # 34 ;	-1
PRIDE AND PREJUDICE WITH KEVIN FIRTH WAS OUTSTANDING.. TO MAKE A COMEDY OUT OF A . SERIOUS DRAMA IN THIS CASE IS UNFORTUNATE . THE LEAD ACTRESS WAS NOT COMPREABLE TO THE ACTRESS IN THE SERIOUS . VERSION.. THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR BEASLEY WAS EXCELLENT , AND MR BENNETT WAS EXCELLENT . . THE ACTOR PORTRAYING MR DARCY WAS GOOD , I WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE FILM..	-1
South Park is wonderful ! Comedy Central 's censorship and cowardice is deplorable . Maybe someday Comedy Central will realize the importance of art and the first amendment . Until that day , I am sure as hell not giving them money for this blu ray .	-1
This was probably the best season so far . Luckily I saw 200 & 201 when they were aired on TV ( censored of course ) but the fact that they are censored on DVD is complete BULL**** ! ! ! ! I ca n't believe that Comedy Central released this DVD and still censored it.Usually I buy the seasons so I can watch them without commercials and UNCENSORED but I 'm content with watching this season online for FREE . I returned this DVD to the store the next day . Comedy Central does n't need my money anymore .	-1
Yeah , I know it is a cartoon but still it conjures up he real thing when I watch it . i only watched part of the first episode . Had to stop since I did not enjoy the subject manner and also the style of the cartoon was not on par with my other favorites . Just was not interesting to me .	-1
Slightly annoying ... the typical stuff you would expect from this kind of genre . I wish nickelodeon would put out more original shows .	-1
This tv show is so bad it is virtually unwatchable . The characters are horrible at acting and stupid . The plots are boring and uneventful . And it is not the slightest bit funny . This show is nothing more than the average boring generic sitcom trash that is on nickelodeon these days . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Okay , had to turn it off . I did start skimming through scenes , trying to find some shred of intelligence , originality or even just thought ... but all were sorely missing.AWFUL movie . Do n't waste your time on it .	-1
In ZOMBIE FARM , FBI scientists have developed a chemical agent that helps in their interrogations of suspected terrorists . Unfortunately , the drug has a wicked side effect . It turns people into -all together now- flesh-eating zombies ! Not surprisingly , zombies are created , go on a rampage , and eat the living . Then , the water supply is contaminated w/ the stuff , causing further murderous mayhem ! There 's even a zombie mailman on the loose ! Luckily , the local muscle-bound , psycho has lots and lots of guns ! Oh yeah , there 's a group of cannibal hillbillies running around as well . They eat rats . If only they had eaten the sole existing print of this & # 34 ; film & # 34 ; ...	-1
This movies was okay if you 're really into zombies and watch every zombie movie that comes out . I 've seen a lot better .	-1
Im all for low budget , b-movies but this one did n't even seem to try . Acting is poor . The sound and sound mixing is terrible . The premise is good but the execution could n't have been worse . With zombies ALL AROUND YOU , how is it that these characters never paid attention to their surroundings and were constantly caught off guard & # 8230 ; Theres a certain level of stupidity portrayed in these movies that 's forgivable and tolerable but this movie takes the cake & # 8230 ; can I give a rating lower than one please ?	-1
Because we do n't like it because it has rain because I did not like it did n't like that show no .	-1
Fresh water is polluted with drugs we 're putting in it , some on purpose and some flushed down . This movie explores that issue and lets you make the decisions as to how bad it 's become .	-1
This movie did n't strike a nerve with me . It seemed to drag . Others may enjoy it tremendously . Suggest you go ahead and watch at least part and make up your own mind .	-1
MST 3000 is often hilarious . This episode was slow and tedious with a smart and funny barb coming in at a pace of 1 every 15 minutes . Dull and boring , I 'm sorry to say .	-1
Apparently these Mystery Science Theatre movies all have a built-in front row of & # 34 ; hecklers & # 34 ; in them . they were n't funny , just annoying and distracting . if it had n't been for that I might have watched it , but kept fast-fowarding it thinking they would be gone but no luck . How stupid .	-1
I usually love these type of shows but this one is kinda of boring but it is good if you have nothing else to watch .	-1
This flick reminded me of 1984 and THX 1138 mixed . Same kind of story , but with animation , which was really good , but this one just did n't hold my interest and I fast forwarded through much of it . Maybe it was just the wrong day for me to watch this video , but to me it was boring .	-1
As a Jew I was shocked by the bigotry of this piece of trash . It 's been a long time since I 've seen such crude stereotyping of us . This is not a well-written finely observed comedy . The anti-semitism is n't strident , but couched in a series of lame jokes . At one point of emotional breakthrough , the muslim main character purposefully punches out a rabbi while he is praying . It 's hard to imagine that Muslims would be happy with this either , as the main character is certainly made out to be woefully uneducated about other faiths . What a piece of dreck . ( Look it up in an Yiddish dictionary ! )	-1
Both the film and the subject . I 've never seen a group of more dysfunctional and dangerous people ever . Not worth the time . Who wants to know about people of this ilk anyway . Yuk .	-1
My son recommended this film but warned me in advance of content . I should have stopped when I saw JACKASS was involved . However , I continued . To think one family terrorizing their own community , living solely on their terms with no consideration for others was glorified in anyway , kind of speaks to the state of our precious home - USA . If you enjoy JACKASS , you 'll like this too .	-1
It does n't get any better throughout the entire movie . The characters are so flat , one-dimensional , and I did n't care what happened to any of them .	-1
Neil Jordan 's Ondine starring the always dependable Colin Farrell and the enchanting Polish actress.The 1st 3 quarter of the film was captivating with the suitable Irish background and mystery.It fell apart at the final quarter . It became nothing but a routine eastern mafia smuggling alien to a foreigncountry plot which destroyed all the foregoing mystery and enchantment.A very disappointing recent effort from Neil Jordan .	-1
My daughter and I struggled all the way through this . . . movie . It was almost impossible to understand the dialogue . We had to look up the summary online to even know what was going on . We spent a good part of the time saying to each other , & # 34 ; What did he/she say ? & # 34 ; I love movies with character and plot development ; but if this movie had those , I must have missed it . We dismissed the review that said it was boring - need four more words - boring , boring , boring , boring . They were so right . The only good part that was noted was Colin Farrell 's lovely accent . If only the movie had had a good sound engineer !	-1
Background : A Selkie is a mythological sea creature that can become human.This movie consisted of the following stereotypic formula pieces tossed together to form the script such as : single divorced alcoholic fisherman ; disabled daughter ; dysfunctional mom and step father ; suspicious town folk ; homespun priest ; Selkie brings good luck to the fisherman and daughter ; criminal element added as a threat to the Selkie.Overall this Selkie interpretation seemed disjointed and shallow ; lacking emotional depth and mystery . Not as good as `` The Seventh Stream '' .	-1
I wanted to like this film , we do n't always get what we want . The cinematography was just so poor , under lit to the point I could n't see who was talking or what was happening . Dark bars and night scenes can be shot so that you can still see the action but that requires skill and knowledge that was not evident here . Then there is the audio , it sounds as though the microphones were wrapped in wool . Muffled dialogue in the dark gets real annoying in a very short while , especially when the local accent and colloquialisms are already a challenge to understand . I was beginning to wish for subtitles . So much for the technicalities . The direction was just as poor . the pace of this film went from a fast walk to an agonizing limp then fell to the ground and crawled..slowly , painfully . I really do n't care to see another scene in another film where our hero character announces `` I 'm an alcoholic '' at an AA meeting then goes out and sucks down a fifth of booze straight from the bottle in between lines of anger and self pity ! Can you say cliche ! The comic relief was..oh that 's right there was none . I hate to pick on child actors so I am glad to say there is n't one in this film . The young girl in this film sounded like she was reading and pretending . The woman playing Ondine , Alicja Bachleda , was sublime throughout . She was a living breathing complex creature on many levels . Colin was flat , a character without energy or dimension . I finally decided my evening would be more pleasantly spent trying to breath through a wet towel . Two stars , one for Alicja and one for what might have been .	-1
I 'm sorry , but I found this movie to be incredibly boring . Some friends forced me to watch it . Colin Farrell stars as an Irish fisherman named Syracuse who finds a woman named Ondine in his fishing net . He and his daughter , Annie believe she is a mermaid . I would n't recommend ONDINE ! ! !	-1
Are you f'ning kidding me ? ! this is an excuse for hipster parents to seem cool . I am sorry nothing in this show has every brought me , my kids or the world joy . I put this on the other day for my 1 and a half year old and my 5 year old . My youngest watched it for like 5 minutes and vomited , and the older one begged me to turn it off , HE BEGGED ! !	-1
my kid put this on , but i would not pick it myself , you do n't really learn anything from this show , just crazy characters doing goofy stuff . i rather my kid watch something where they learn , like dinosaur train or sid the science kid .	-1
Reason that I do n't like it : the character visuals -- there 's a robot and a cat , ok. No clue what the other three things are , but the orange one is WAY too much of a `` one-eyed worm '' and screams of inappropriate visual for a child . That said , the songs are fun , simple and repetitious , so my 9-month-old daughter breaks into a smile as soon as she hears them . I played some of the season selection for her one day ... because she liked the songs from their `` cameo '' appearances in other shows on Nick Jr . I 've since found some other shows with songs that make her smile and laugh that do n't have a phallic appearance -- such as Go , Diego , Go ! and Bubble Guppies . Edited several months later : I still do n't really like Muno 's appearance , but I developed the notion that DJ Lance is similar to Ronald McDonald ( I met a DC region Ronald ... very nice , keeps things friendly and non-threatening and upbeat for little ones ) , and his odd `` posse '' is akin to Ronald 's ( Hamburglar , Grimace , Mayor McCheese and Fry Guys roughly = Brobee , Muno , Foofa , Bot ) , but they are n't promoting eating at a franchise . I still pick other options for my now toddling child when I see them available , but the messages episodes portray are acceptable . Anyway , that 's my `` looking back '' update .	-1
So you want me to believe that all these animals live together ? and one is a 3ft ant ? Now my kid is like I dont want giant ants eating us dad , his grandfather was killed by ants ( in the war ) and his uncle was killed by his Aunt ( he does not understand ant/aunt yet ) anyhow he watched this and now he has begun to wet the bed ... thanks .	-1
not a fan . daughter didnt sit still long enought to really get a grib on what this is all about	-1
The content was more adult oriented and way over my kid 's head . WHy would they market this towards small kids ?	-1
Boring , bad production values , depressing story . I could n't stand to watch these young women 's lives being snatched away from them . Way too much blood and guts for me . Just awful .	-1
This sounded like a great series ... but the use of gore and blood in every scene was bordering on the pornographic . It seemed as though the close-up scenes of blood and guts were used to make up for a cliche , lack-luster plot . A waste of my Amazon Instant $ $ $ .	-1
We found it difficult to get into - did n't seem to be building the characters in an easy way . Also some of the accents were hard to decipher . Probably just not our cup of tea .	-1
London Hospital Season 1 [ HD ] -After watching Selfridges and Call the Midwives , I had high expectations for this series , but after 2 episodes I could n't become attached to it . To be fair , I should give it another chance , but I 'll give it some time between so I can start over with a fresh view . Take a look for yourself . I 'd be interested to know what you think . You might change my mind .	-1
I 'm sorry but I could n't get through the first episode . I was just too morose . The character development was hideous .	-1
This review has little to do with this mediocre , typical British film . I rate the video at two stars , max ... I lived there for two years , and this is de'javou . ( SP ? ) . This review is about amazon prime streaming video . I rate that 5 stars ... ..Anyone having issues with streaming video should look first to their internet connection/provider . Then , look at your computer system . I was having difficulty getting a good stream from anyone , ( Hulu , WB , and Amazon ) and I blamed them all for not providing the stream . Not true , the stream was there , uninterrupted and in HD . My provider insisted I was getting 1.5 meg , I was not , the max I ever got was 664 Kb . The liar was my internet provider , I should sue them for lying.I bitched about it for 6 mos , and low and behold , a few days ago I started receiving a 2.5 Meg uninterrupted stream . You ca n't imagine the difference that made.But that 's just part of the story , I also installed an Nvidia video card , 1GIG , designed for streaming , whoaaa night and day , especially sound quality . So if you are into streaming , hope this is helpful information.Only negative with Amazon , is they do n't encode CC ... . That would be a real plus , if they did ... ...	-1
The ideal of it is dumb in my opinion . One of those ideals that works for a game but not a series . Sorry , I watched two shows and I just could n't get into it .	-1
I only now just started watching Pretty Little Liars.While they are currently on something like season 4 I believe , I had trouble getting halfway through season one . What a ridiculous show . I started watching when nothing else was on . Even that is n't reason enough to continue . My complaints with the ridiculousness and inconsistency in this show are to many to list . The stupid decisions these girls make border on insulting to the intelligence of the audience . No matter what the target viewer is . The romanticized relationship between an English teacher ( whom would be at the very least 24 ) and his 16 year old student is just irresponsible . I ca n't image any parents thinking this show is ok viewing for their young teens or any adult finding this entertaining .	-1
I 'm willing to give this more of a chance , but I do n't want to waste too much more time on it . A boring pilot is all I can claim to have seen thus far , with a simply horrible , irritating sound track . I hope it picks up .	-1
Wait , there is an Asian character in the show ? Is she the main character ? No . Oh so it is like every other show about snotty evil white people . I 'm bored . Really really bored of this stuff . I do n't even see pictures any more . It 's just a blur of white people , credit cards , and soft porn . I keep hoping to see something different but nothing ever changes .	-1
Really wanted to like this show ; love the 4 gals they brought together ; Wendy Malik & Jeane Leves in particular from Frazier , and the amazing Betty White you figure it ca n't miss right ? Well , you can . Its the typical scenerio , bring comedy 'All Stars ' together and it SHOULD be awesome/hilarious , and it just is n't . Frazier , Just Shoot Me , and Wings were all 8 -- 10 comedy shows in my book , but this new show rated at best , a '2 ' for me . So bummed ! But just like when Kelsey Grammer went from Frazier to his next show `` Back to You '' ( which I thought was hilarious but was a `` 1 and done '' season follow up ) it takes more than 'Stars ' to make a great show . I bought this brand new and wish I had n't -- cause in a short time it will be for sale used on Amazon for less than half price cause its not very funny -- that 's my take .	-1
OK . I watched all 4 seasons that are available . This sums them all up for me.This show is about 3 LA women who find themselves in Cleveland , OH , and stay to start a new life . Well . . . that is what we are led to believe . But as the Betty White character states in one of the later seasons the 3 LA women actually are in Cleveland to get `` laid '' because there is too much competition in LA . The first season was fresh , original , and funny . There was the down to earth do gooder character . There were the supportive friend scenes as we learn of each characters ' past . There were the funny outrageous comments from the vain shallow character . And there were the laugh out loud tell em like it is comments from Betty White 's character . I mean she calls them out for dressing like `` prostitutes '' etc . You see all the actress 's former co-workers from other sitcoms appear in each episode which is fun.Then you get to the second season and beyond . These seasons plowed up the foundation laid in the first season . I guess they ran out of steam . Or maybe they wanted to sell out and just stay on the air by appealing to the trashy audience that definitely exists and eats up the garbage this show became . The second , third an dfourth seasons were nothing but people jumping in and out of bed with each other , sexual innuendo about everything , people lying and cheating and stealing , and Betty White 's character transforming into some sick person 's sick joke of a vision of what an elderly funny character would be . The show could have been set in LA for anyone knew at this point as it was just trashy Californians behaving trashy . The weird thing was there was even an episode to mimic Sex in the City . It was definitely Sex In the City -- 3 women casually sleeping around and then in the end of the episode whining and commiserating about how they have no sanity tho their lives and wonder why . also the 3 main characters just looked old , fat , and tired in the later seasons . One 's hair got so light she was almost blond . The others got so dark that they did n't look like themselves . Valerie Bertinelli looks horrible in season 4 . She looks like she is having a really bad pregnancy . Even her hair looks bad . . . . But we are supposed to think that all these young fit youngs want to bed her and stay by her side the next day . Not . They sit Betty Whit eon the sofa with her jacket or shirt riding up in the back like she has been propped up for the scene.The later seasons , to me , appeared to be gay centric in humor . Humor that I have heard from hardcore gays and you see in their tv shows and movies . And while watching the credits I saw who was actually directing it and knew immediately where this influence was coming from . I mean even 3 trashy straight women would n't go the direction this influence took them.There are these typical `` behind the scenes '' episodes that appear in each season . They are basically the same and make you think they just want to have a fun-day at work or something . But then again the people who are behind the scenes force their chance to appear in front of the camera . That is VERY obvious . And there are the sickening `` we love each other '' and `` we respect each other '' stock speeches . They are just goofy.Anyway the show is typical American garbage TV that can be skipped . Just a show about animalistic behavior created by trained monkeys .	-1
We seem to have mostly got past humor that belittles people of color , women , or gay people . But I guess it 's okay to make fun of older people , and to do so by belittling them . 'What 's your favorite medication ? ' says one older person to another . 'Better call him soon , since otherwise he 's likely to be dead . ' Etc.Ha ha . Not .	-1
Does n't have all the typical inconsistencies and mediocre dialog as most TV , but this is starting out as a very slow series . I fear an overly complicated puzzle conspiracy that will only be partially resolved by the end . That 's a big time investment for me .	-1
First one or two episodes were sort of interesting , but then , the sillies set in . If paranoia is your thing , then you will love this . The usual liberal plot of big bad greedy guys who control world events to make themselves richer . Of course the biggest bad guy is X CIA , who else ? The & # 34 ; good guy & # 34 ; , also X CIA , is gay ( is that saying something about the writers ? ) . The amount of surveillance portrayed would require an army of people to monitor and maintain all the bugs . Any intelligence agency would love to have the super small devices shown , that somehow seem to function without any visible power source . All in all , very stupid . Hope I do n't get a four leaf clover in the mail over this .	-1
Intriguing at times , but the smart people sure are dumb . Startied out liking the first couple episodes , but the lead analyst investigating the conspiracy is so haphazard , he would have been killed early on . And why would a filthy rich widow investigate her husbands death alone and continues to investigate even after a direct death threat . The show and plot were just very weak and unbelievable .	-1
Great story idea . Great ensemble of actors . Terrible script , editing , WAY of telling the story . Puts one to sleep , no identification with the characters , no backstory to justify hanging in to watch during the long mimic-BBC pauses with the meaningful looks . Yawn.A Gary Oldman or Alec Guinness or Ian X ( really , any of the 'Ian ' actors we all know and love ) , can hold the viewer 's interest , during long Brit-like pregnant pauses and silences , which alike baffle the average audience . Yet actors you rarely see on TV or film , need something more ; they need LINES , or at least meaningful blocking . Since these long pauses and silences do n't seem to add to the plot at all , and since there is no backstory to establish empathy with the characters , one is left waiting waiting waiting for something to be said or done to justify watching further.Some of the reviewers are all happy about the sophistication in the storyline . Yeah , but if you 're watching paint dry for most of each episode , the sophistication does n't 'pay off ' . We do n't need car chases and shoot-em-ups , we need MORE LINES . Shakespeare knew that . So why did n't the script writer , here ? Who messed up this good story ? So I forced myself to get through the series . So I do n't wonder why AMC pulled the plug . It 's bad scripting and bad film editing ; not the acting , and not the plot . WAY TOO SLOW , people . WAY TOO LACKING in lines , subplots unexplored , so of course the viewer will be bored . Were I a potential commercial sponsor , I would n't want my commercials playing during this show , due to its snoozy presentation . Not fair to the actors or the plot , either . A story which needs to be explored ( whether plausible or not ) -- just got wasted . Pity.FIX IT , please , and redo so the audience can follow along , cut all those long meaningless pauses with headshots , substitute meaningful dialog instead , so the audience can connect the dots . People like whodunits , that 's the most popular story format since the Garden of Eden.Then , you 'll get a good audience .	-1
This series just drags and drags____ i lost interest and have not watched the rest of the season . I got about 3/4 of the way through the season waiting for a big moment of some sort to happen . It never happened . I may try to finish watching it	-1
You do n't really care what happens to the characters - - everyone is so flat . The main character frowns a lot , looks at the same object over and over , no emotion at all . Somehow I watched the whole thing , waiting for something to happen . You never think & # 34 ; I ca n't wait to see what happens & # 34 ; because you do n't really get involved if everything is so disconnected . I ca n't imagine there being a second season for this .	-1
The series started out OK , but after three episodes , I lost interest . Hard to figure out just what the point is and how the characters interact . Not much suspense , particularly at end of episodes to keep the viewer coming back . Yawn .	-1
I was n't sure what to expect when I watched the pilot . The characters and plot appeal , but its so slow . I could n't help but think & # 34 ; get on with it already. & # 34 ;	-1
Potentially this is a great series , but after a few episodes I felt it was n't getting anywhere . There seems to be a lack of intensity , with story lines that just drift off . I am sure it will all come together in the end , but I do n't think I will stick around since I am not enjoying it enough to wait . However , the concept is fascinating and the acting is excellent .	-1
We like this sort of political/spy drama . We have been enjoying several Scandinavian shows , basically liked the new House of Cards , etc . However , after four eps . we decided to go back to re-watching Justified ! We were still curious what the deal with Miranda Richardson was , but otherwise zzzzzz	-1
I like these kinds of programs . This one disappointed.Confusing and slow . No build of like for any characters except Richardson and ... .. Why did n't he pick up the CD ? I should stop here .	-1
Series gets high marks in intrigue , character development , and acting . The path of its story is believable , even plausible for 11episodes . Then suddenly we are expected to believe that a handful of old , white males are controlling the fate of the free world by manipulating those who are sworn enemies to the & # 34 ; west & # 34 ; . Soooo , the world we see in Rubicon is in sharp contrast to that we see depicted in & # 34 ; Zero Dark Thirty & # 34 ; ( supposedly true events set to drama ) . Either it takes exhaustive intelligence resources , years of analysis , and unexpected good fortune to finally make breakthrough in finding the most high-profile terrorist in the world -- or , as portrayed in & # 34 ; Rubicon & # 34 ; , the whole material world is controlled-not by an industry , or a conglomerate of industries- but a few conspirators . Such an outlandish assumption REQUIRES adequate explanation . Otherwise , the story is an insult to those fighting our battles- and their loved ones . No wonder this series stopped production when it did . The storytellers wound themselves up so tight in their own trap , there was no way to continue with anyone to follow .	-1
I forced myself to sit through 5 episodes just to make sure that I was n't mistaken in my feelings for this show . The cinematography of the pilot was brilliant and was the main reason I gave the series more of my time than I ever should have , but even that paled quickly with the lackluster story line and turgid pace of the show . Five episodes in and there is nothing , absolutely nothing going on , there is so little happening that it makes it hard to point to any one thing that stands out as a problem , it is just so blah that I ca n't see wasting anymore time on it than it took to write this.Summation , I completely understand why the show was cancelled and support that decision 100 % .	-1
I do n't know where to start because it was that uninteresting . Save yourself the trouble and watch something else , you 'll be more entertained with anything but this show .	-1
Sorry writers , but this series is a snooze . I like TV that entertains and provides a mental challenge , but after the second episode I gave up on trying to make sense of the dialog and I was NOT entertained . I suppose if I had been in the mood to be the fly on the wall in the think tank , I might have appreciated the writing effort . Late at night I do n't want to have to sift through all the information presented .	-1
I used to enjoy Futurama , but not anymore . It is almost like Matt Groening is saying how far left can we go . It is amazing to me how anti-christian this show has gone . This eposide is just anothe rexample . I still watch the show sometimes , but only on TV . I will not pay for this show and I turn the channel when it starts to get to be to much.Sad to see Futurama destroyed like this .	-1
I REALLY HATE IT BECASUE I DO N'T LIKE IT THAT WAS REALLY SCARY AND WE DO NOT LIKE IT THAT WAS OK	-1
I do n't like it all it was very great that was for adults and was not beautiful and that is not pretty	-1
I loved Kevin Kline in Dave . It 's one of my favorite movies . I also loved him in the Cole Porter movie . I writing that to soften my criticism ; I feel disloyal when I say he is wasted in this stupid movie . He is usually wonderful in everything he does . Just my opinion .	-1
If you enjoy watching people be odd just for the sake of it - then you might enjoy this , otherwise keep looking for another movie to watch.Good cast - worthless story.Kline plays a prudish bachelor of almost no income , living in a total dump and having fleas - yet he acts like someone with money and sucks up to a wealthy old lady to be included in upper society occasionally . Paul Dano plays an extremely timid loser who rents a cot in Kline 's crappy residence . He experiments with cross dressing and has a little crush on Katie Holmes ( which goes nowhere ) . John C Reilly plays a nice but wild and intimidating looking man with a cartoon character type voice . There really is n't any plot to this story - or any story to this story . Just some odd characters who really are n't interesting at all - especially Dano .	-1
After enjoying & # 34 ; Wild China & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; Wild Africa & # 34 ; so much , I was expecting so much more , but unfortunately this was extremely disappointing .	-1
`` The Oxford Murders '' is one of the most delightfully bad movies of our time . It 's on par with `` Manos , Hands of Fate '' , '' Plan 9 from Outer Space '' and `` Troll 2 . '' It has the pretentiousness of The Room combined with the campiness of any Wood ( as in Ed ) B movie . There are talented actors whose hamminess is redeeming-John Hurt as the professor Arthur Seldom , Anna Massey as a former Enigma codebreaker , and Alex Cox , the director of the superb Sid & Nancy as an obsessed mathematician who suffers hideously from cancer . Hurt saves the movie through overacting -- then again , he did voice Aragorn in the Bakshi version of Lord of the Rings.The plot is obvious from the get-go : A grad student , Martin ( Elijah Wood ) is immediately pounced on by two fangirls -- I mean ladies -- as soon as he arrives in Oxford . There are a series of mathematical murders , not to mention some hilarious dialogue : '' I believe in the number pi ! `` `` Beth is not an electron . `` `` Only this room , you ... and the spaghetti . '' This movie contains in the notorious spaghetti sex scene . The voluptuous nurse ( the singer-songwriter Leonor WatlingPapito ) is making spaghetti wearing only an apron , and atop her , Martin slurps it off her bosom . Beth ( Julie Cox , who pined for Paul Muad'Dib inFrank Herbert 's Dune ( Sci-Fi TV Miniseries ) ( Special Edition Director 's Cut ) ( 3-Disc DVD Set ) as Princess Irulan ) pines for Martin . She does n't want to be his friend , she wants aBad Romance - The RemixesThe plot is preposterous , and the movie has as much unintentional laughs as -- -most anything MST3K has tackled . It 's a thriller/horror that 's been mislabeled . It 's a comedy.While it 's hilariously , uproariously bad , it gets 3 stars for these reasons-1 ) Great acting from Hurt ( who 's been in the great Quentin Crisp biopicAn Englishman in New York ) , Massey . Even Julie Cox and Leonor Watling channel fangirlishness as they throw themselves at Elijah . They probably read the Frodo 's Harem website to prepare themselves.2 ) The great Bach piece at the end . This movie needed more JS Bach , frankly . Beth 's character plays annoying modern music.3 ) Elijah 's frequently shirtless . Elijah spends most of the movie looking concerned , and widening his eyes . *SPOILER ALERT*The movie ends with him giving a blank , bland look . Thank goodness Elijah is frequently shirtless , even has a shower scene -- to distract from his bland acting . In a touch of irony , there 's a scene set at the Eagle and Child -- the pub hangout of JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis . `` The Oxford Murders '' is so bad , it 's good . As some tripsters listen to Pink Floyd 's `` Dark Side of the Moon '' while watching the Wizard of Oz , one could sync the music of the Davis-based psychedelic rock band Oxford CircleLive at the Avalonwith this movie . `` Oxford Murders '' is a magical mystery tour , a camp classic .	-1
Elijah Wood is repugnant in the sex scenes . He should stick to playing elfs . The script and plot are boring and badly executed . There are some fine actors stuck in this awful mess . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Wish I could say the same for the acting . Elijah Wood sounded like he was in a high school production . His lameness colored the entire production .	-1
My big problem with this film is that it simply does not flow . It 's like a composition that meanders all over the place and does not fully explore any thesis . Characters do things which one simply would n't do in real life . If I was a graduate student at Oxford , I surely would n't drop the `` F '' bomb on a Don whom I want to become my mentor . Romantic relationships appear `` out of the blue . '' Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time . It 's a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at , but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly , other than her looks , Ms. Watling does n't impress much either . Hurt spends his time pontificating and the whole thing is a jumble . Do n't bother with it .	-1
THE OXFORD MURDERS ( 2007 , U.S. release 2010 , dir . Alex de la Iglesia , based on the Argentinean novelCrimenes Imperceptibles ( Spanish Edition ) , `` Imperceptible Crimes '' by Guillermo Martinez ) . This cheesy made-for-television murder mystery is one of those all-too-arrogant , in-your-face , fall-down-silly errors that usually make audiences laugh in all the wrong places . Mission accomplished.Elijah Wood plays Martin , a mathematical prodigy ( you could n't tell from seeing this ) who travels to study at Oxford under the great Professor Seldom ( a brilliant , diabolical John Hurt ) . With some compelling music and cinematography that is a direct nod to Alfred Hitchcock - NOT to Brian De Palma as is commonly misstated - this is more like bad American 1980s TV than anything else.Aside from the endlessly stupid intellectual goofs in the mathematics and physics theorems referenced in the script ( Fermat 's Theorem is called `` Bormat '' or `` Doormat '' or something ; the number pi is confused with the lesser-known number phi ) , there is little to commend this thing . The usual gross-out sex scene ( even worse as half of 'the team ' is Elijah ) angered me as per usual . Eurotrash at its finest : with the help of a once-admired American falling star.What is saddest of all is the story is quite compelling , the villains are actually numerous - and not entirely evil . The real villain ( s ) will never be quite whom you suspect . One villain is idiotically exposed at the beginning of the film , but it does n't end with her . What I think is wonderful is the question this movie puts to us : is crime and villainy a driven act of desperation on the part of an otherwise innocent person ? As a murder mystery and as Anglophile-bait , it 's mediocre . As a general film it is all too reminiscent of shows such as `` Foyle 's War '' ( believe it or not ) , `` NCIS '' and `` NUMB3RS '' . It takes too many cues from other silly things such as THE DAVINCI CODE . The London Police cooperating fully with , even relying on , a weirdo student and a math professor in a major crime series ? An American nobody kid allowed free run and access to crime scene photos ? Are they kidding me ? ? Michael Caine and Jeremy Irons were both offered the role of Professor Seldom , and wisely refused . John Hurt can always afford to dumpster-dive in a thing like this and take it in his stride ; Elijah Wood can not , and this is one of a string of proofs that Wood 's career is finished . A solid ten minutes of absolute yuck sex between Elijah and a buxom beauty ( just to remind us how straight he is ) - that is the red flag of the ages . It 's all part of the ultimate sadness of bad film and lost careers.Cry for this , Argentina ! - the rest of the world may join in as desired .	-1
I did not enjoy this movie at all . It was boring from beginning to end . Not worth watching . Pass it up .	-1
Have you ever known someone that thought they were just the cleverest mind in the circle - that had that self indulgent , narcissistic belief that they and they alone could create or solve the most convoluted brain teasers . OK , well maybe some of those attributes . Well , this movie was the film incarnation of that person . Just a predictable boring studio 's pointless production of contrivance .	-1
Did not care for the story line . The series was too far out to be realistic . Just not my kind of movie .	-1
We opened this because the storyline sounded provocative - a mystery at Oxford . It was not very intriguing starting out , but ... willing to wait ( sometimes a story has to & # 34 ; warm up. & # 34 ; ) This one became purient-plus ( I realize that there is not such word , but how else to emphasize the content of this movie ) , and must admit we can not give a full review - we turned it off . Guess we were naive , for such an open sexual exhibition was not something we would have expected ( unless the movie were rated R or xxx - which this one was not . ) We would say that it was right up the alley for a voyeur . Suggestive is one thing , but this was eversomuch more.Therefore , can say if you enjoy visual sex , this is the movie for you . If not , would advise you to look elsewhere .	-1
I thought I was really going to like this movie and was very disappointed . Right away in the beginning there were so many things that were just unbelievable . Very shallow , just plain not good .	-1
After watching it for 15 minutes with my wife , I turned it off . It was just too confusing of a plot and I have heard enough of the new morality philosophy . ugh ! ! !	-1
THE OXFORD MURDERS is typical British cinema -- cerebral , pondering and tedious . While BBC 's WAKING THE DEAD is excellent , this movie does n't compare on any level.An interesting mystery is shrouded with mathematical mumbo jumbo which rises above the average viewer 's knowledge or interest ( like TV 's NUMB3RS ) .LOTR 's Elijah Wood uses his soulful eyes and little else in his wooden performance ; John Hurt is excellent as always , and Julie Cox chews up the scenery.The movie 's twist ending is surprising but gets anti-climactic execution.Primarily , it 's just all rather boring .	-1
Given the caliber of actors in this , I am so very surprised at how bad the acting actually is . I cant say if it 's bad directing or what , but truly unfortunate performances all around .	-1
I could n't watch past 30 minutes ... .actually , on the 15th minute I went to make some tea which did n't help , by the way . The acting is just terrible , not believable ... .skip it , it 's not worth it . I ca n't believe you had to pay 9.99 to watch it on demand when it came out originally .	-1
None of the characters appealed to me , and the mystery was more drama than anything else . I think the writer was trying to be & # 34 ; deep & # 34 ; but it ended up just dark ...	-1
It 's a snobbish clich & eacute ; to pronounce the book on which any film material was based as being much better than the film . But in this case , I 'm not trying to demonstrate my literacy with the recommendation . It 's my sincere opinion.This movie just does n't make the grade . It graduates from the merely pedantic to the completely far-fetched . Like the book , it posits a serial killer who is playing abstruse mathematical games with Professor Seldom and his prot & eacute ; g & eacute ; at Oxford 's Mathematical Institute . However , the film throws in all sorts of extra glancing mathematical references - to Fermat 's Last Theorem , to Fibonacci 's series , and to chaos theory . A lot of these references do n't exist in the book or else are more integral aspects of the book . So the movie is like a Koosh ball , sprouting all sorts of alien little rubbery protrusions that make it briefly tantalizing , but that ultimately just cause it to come off as silly.The movie reminds me of Tom Stoppard 's play `` Arcadia . '' While that play was acclaimed , when you thought about it logically , you realized that all its talk about chaos theory was completely adventitious and unnecessary.There are other problems with this movie . Scenes that were treated more realistically in the book become grotesqueries in the movie . The film tries to combine the most garish elements of `` The DaVinci Code , '' a CSI episode , and `` The Zodiac Killer . `` Whereas in the book , the protagonist 's Russian roommate is just a normal person , in the movie he is portrayed by an actor who inexplicably chews up the scenery like a rabid dog . In the book , Seldom 's former eccentric , obsessed colleague is indeed a hopeless case in the extended care ward of a hospital ; but in the movie the man is presented as a shocking mutilation of a figure . In the book , Seldom is an average-looking 50-year-old professor ; in the movie he is played by John Hurt whose already world-weary face is photographed as ravaged superannuation . The book 's brief , innocent sex scenes become rawly carnal in the film . In the book , inappropriate romances that are barely suggested or suspected are made explicit and decisive in the film . The film also adds a further twist ending to the solution of the murders that is sort of interesting and integrating , but that ultimately makes a triangle with 190 degrees of all the antecedent action.Not that the book is perfect . Author Guillermo Martinez failed to adequately explain a key puzzle and carelessly leaves some dangling plot points . But the book is more satisfyingly grounded than this hodgepodge of a film . This is one class you should definitely cut .	-1
This sounded good but it was bad . The gratuitous sex was unnecessary , and the overacting was n't pleasant . The story did n't seem plausible either .	-1
Unenlightened drivel , acting high brow . Full of foul language throughout , as far as I know ( I could n't finish the last fourth of the movie because I was so offended by the continued foul language and intolerance of religious persons ) . I was hoping it would get better s it went along , showing the professor and his students were mistaken in their beliefs . But alas they never learned the truth because they did not even want to believe there is truth . What kept me going for as long as I did was seeing how these atheists act and think . It did remind me of the bullying done at universities to Christians .	-1
Fell asleep ... ... Fell asleep ... ... Fell asleep ... ... Fell asleep ... ... Fell asleep ... ... You need to find and direct better shows . As a Harvard , Yale film student this is a C grade	-1
Very pedestrian . Not very interesting . Gave it up after first two episodes . Do n't recommend it . Watch something else . Not very good .	-1
Premise not totally believable but I 'll go with the fantasy but silly , tired , NCIS cute crap , turned me off . Seems the Brits make better spy TV shows .	-1
Listened to the authors , directors , etc. , and from what they were saying they wanted to achieve - well , perhaps they over intellectualized it . Clearly a farce - caught in a trap ? no problem , just fade out to a new scene . Get in a fight , get thrown around ? no problem , you arise without a scratch or your hair out of shape . C , mon , get real !	-1
I never made it to the first commercial break . This is a stupid vapid show . You can easily skip this one .	-1
Way too cutesy and not very intelligent . Not believable . I guess I need some grit in my tv watching . Watch Alias instead .	-1
If I could give this show a less than zero rating , I would . The lead character is obnoxious , rude and just made me want to hurl something at the TV screen . I ca n't beleive I wasted $ 1.99 I ca n't tell you how much this character annoyed me . I watched the entire episode because I thought it would improve . It did n't . Do n't waste your time or money on this junk .	-1
I found the lead character insufferably cliched , as were most of the others . The only thing I liked was the plot twist , but I figured it out just before it was revealed in the show . Wo n't be going back to this one . Your mileage may vary , as they say .	-1
I saw the reviews on here and read some internet posts about how great this show was , so I bought it . I 'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting , but the lead just gave me bad vibes . Watching the first three episodes last night , I just could n't take it anymore ! Callie , his love interest , is totally annoying . She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son . Jim is a know-it-all punk who always magically has the upper hand . There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone , he just does . The characters is very smug and unlikeable . Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types , but not me . Furthermore , Jim does n't have any depth . He is in jerk mode all of the time . He 's not even vulnerable . This is the worst written show on TV ! The character is just not believable as a cop . He acts like a rich prep schooler . I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class , but the writers probably ca n't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character , so they based one off of their own privileged lives . It 's almost like they could n't stand writing Callie as just a nurse , so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor ! Now she 's classy enough for the show ! I got bored during episodes . The shows I watched began with a murder , then just became disjointed as time went on . Jim would investigate , meet up with Callie , make sarcastic comments , then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly . The Carlos Gomez character is the only interesting one that comes across as human , but even he has no chemistry with the lead.I just could n't stand the show anymore and I put it up for sale . I really do n't recommend it .	-1
I did n't like this program , it is inane and a pilot that must be trying to boost the actor 's career , and he overacts his part in comparison to the rest of the show . The character takes life too lightly considering what his job is and acts the fool non-stop . I do n't think there is even a point to the plot .	-1
To start with , once again we are seeing some suspiciously polished five star reviews . This show , however , is not at all five star worthy by any honest stretch of the imagination . The show has low production values , low budget actors , and consequently poor acting . And for a crime show it makes leaps and jumps that make it impossible to follow , which means there is no chance that the viewer will ever figure out who the killer is . As well , there is a lot of product placement -- even more so then usual nowadays . The show also is something of a surreptitious pro-smoking cigarette commercial , with all the young hip , cool people conspicuously enjoying - really enjoying -- their cigarettes . That this show lasted four years is more of an indictment on our society and our exceedingly low expectations than any evidence that it was a `` successful '' program . Below are some sites you can check out about the very common practice of fake reviews . Small businesses are popping up all over who profit from full time fake review writing . Check it out , and inoculate yourself , if you have n't already , against this despicable practice.http : //www.forbes.com/sites/suwcharmananderson/2012/08/28/fake-reviews-amazons-rotten-core/http : //www.wikihow.com/Spot-a-Fake-Review-on-Amazon.Comhttp : //www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/23/new-york-fake-online-reviews-yoghurt	-1
Sometimes a little slow on the stroy -- cant always & # 34 ; like & # 34 ; the charactersThe story lines are sometime slow & then predictable	-1
This is a light weight but pleasant way too spend some down time . The thing I like most was that the episodes do n't end with a car chase or a gun battle , just the killer being knapped . Kind of nice to see Florida scenery .	-1
I really would like to watch at least one episode of this , but in my haste to get it , I forgot to check to see if it was closed-captioned . It 's not . So I ca n't give a review of it .	-1
I could only some much stand the commentary and then decided to turn it off . The cast of Mystery Science Fiction Theatre is good to a point but then ruined the movie .	-1
I could only sit through ten minutes of this series . I am a big fan of BBC comedies , however , this not on the same scale as 'The Last Of The Summer Wine , As Time Goes By , or Keeping Up Appearances . This is a waste of money . Thanks !	-1
Very humerous as expected , but a little flat at times . Dawn French 's character was way too over the top as usual . that 's the main reason I could n't make it through all of the episodes .	-1
I am a fan of British comedies & Dawn/Saunders productions . This cast includes too many big name English actresses to count . BUT : it was too annoying to continue watching past a few minutes . I could n't believe it , there were several of my favorite English actresses assembled with a potentially clever premise & they were irritating the heck out of me . I can appreciate the desire to capitalize on the small English village eccentrics angle but not to the point of being gross or making fun of physical or mental disabilities . Maybe it 's my own Texan sensitivities . I 'll just rewatch & # 34 ; Calendar Girls & # 34 ; for this genre .	-1
I bought this once 2 years ago and will never buy again I can only watch on amazon or with amazon software and could never burn this is not buying or owning this is rentingAnd I 'm not falling for it again this also why I do n't buy from iTunes	-1
I did watch all six episodes , and I probably will watch more if they make more . That main scientist shown in the picture is very annoying , I must say . As viewers we are somehow expected to believe that he knows more than he 's revealing , but he just seems to be too contrived . The show reminds me somewhat of Flash Forward , but it does n't come close in quality or scope .	-1
The premise of this program is simplistic and the writers do n't do much with it . A bunch of cops are given a few fragmentary , confusing clues about a crime , or something , in advance , and they have to figure out what the clues mean and stop the bad thing from happening . Only instead of getting these clues from a medium or a psychic of some kind , these images get downloaded mysteriously from outer space . The writer 's do n't do much of anything interesting with this idea.The characters are also poorly developed . The dialogue is mediocre at best . Bad British writers love to have their characters yell and scream and browbeat and insult each other and behave like incredibly annoying jerks . There is a fair amount of that in this series.I had high hopes initially and looked forward to watching the episodes I bought . But after wading through four episodes , I am not at all surprised that the series was canceled after only 5 episodes . I would have canceled it myself .	-1
I wanted this show to work..it has a good premise for some nail-biting moments , but the characters are all a bit ordinary . No one compelling role that drives you back to watch the next show.Quite disappointed actually . Acting not up to the usual standards of British TV and although the lead guy is decent , he is a little too low-key to work the & # 34 ; drama & # 34 ; in the show	-1
This show has one interesting character . The rest are freaking boring , which is a shame because the premise is pretty cool . Why cast such uninteresting actors ? And why are the characters so poorly written ? The plot line is quality work , but for what is basically supposed to be a police procedural the & # 34 ; cops & # 34 ; spend half of every episode complaining , and the other half fighting and sulking . The lead cop brings her ex onto the team , who sits through most of the pilot . ( Sulking . ) Then in a later episode they have a fight about her keeping things from him and for the rest of that episode he sulks and ignores her calls . ( The calls of the lead investigator during a case involving the possible murder of a woman . ) Because he is her ex she does not have him removed from the team , but tries to make up . So very irritating . I keep wanting to shout at the characters to grow the f up .	-1
The concept is engaging -- a scientist receives warnings from somewhere in space that catastrophic events are going to occur and a team of police and scientists set about attempting to divert these catastrophes from happening -- with varying success . The series would be more compelling if there were a gradual unravelling of the mystery behind the signals . This is a single , plot-line show where a dual plot line -- one that reveals an alternate reality beyond what is happening in real time -- would have provided depth and thought-provoking meaning for audiences . The female protagonist is excellent . The brooding male scientist comes off a bit creepy instead of troubled as he is meant to be , I believe . If you want something border-line sci-fi and still engaging , try Warehouse 13 , Touched , or 666 Park Avenue .	-1
I love Sci-Fi and this is not it . Silly not campy , and not nearly enough science . Ugh ! I sure hope they 're not making a season 2 .	-1
Just a little too dark to continue to watch . The first one was okay but then the 2nd and 3rd one were just too depressing . Too much psycho babble and know why it 's called touching evil	-1
I apologize to Nickelodeon for my poor critique of `` iCarly , '' but I just do n't like this show . The humor is composed of bad word-play that can barely inspire chuckles in anybody , along with funny words and speech . It just comes off as cheesy , and albeit a bit of the humor in this situation comedy is usually the sort of comedy that I would find humorous , for some reason it just can not make me laugh . True , a few times there have been a couple of gags that have left me rolling on the floor laughing , but for the most part this series just does not amuse me . There are a few episodes that I like to watch , but I really do not like `` iCarly '' very much . Although there have been some humorous jokes , a lot of times you will find more cheese in this series than you would in a Wisconsin supermarket . If you want a hilarious , entertaining television program , watch `` Rugrats , '' `` Jimmy Neutron : Boy Genius , '' or `` Hey , Arnold ! '' I 'm really , really sorry , Nickelodeon ; I just do not always like to watch iCarly .	-1
Centurion , a Roman empire epic set in Britain in 117 AD , has many of those qualities we see in the best of this genre : A plot line as empty as Gladiator 's ; self-polishing abs breast plates for all officers ; and Life of Brian 's attention to historical accuracy . It adds blood arcing for some distance into the sky when a lance meets an eyeball . And there are two feral lady barbarians , one blond with what looks like bad teeth ( Aeron , played by Axelle Carolyn ) and one brunette , whose teeth look just fine , as do her breasts ( Etain , played silently by Olga Kurylenko ) . The brunette fancies skins when she goes out hunting Romans in the deep winter forest and scanty skins when in a hut.Centurion , in other words , is as silly as they come . Briefly , it 's about an attempt by the Ninth Legion , led by General Titus Flavius Virilus ( Dominic West ) , to march north into what is now Scotland and eliminate the Pict threat . Evidently Virilus never read up on the fate of Publius Quinctilius Varus , no general but a good administrator . Marching deep into the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Germany , he and his three legions were attacked by combined Germanic tribes . Varus committed suicide in the middle of the battle . His three legions disintegrated . Probably 20,000 or more Roman soldiers died compared to a handful of barbarians.General Virilus , virile and confidant , who did n't read his history , marches his men into the thick forests of Pictland . Flash forward to the next day . Virilus is in chains in the squalid camp of the Pict king . Most of his men have been slaughtered . Later , a handful of survivors led by Centurion Quintus Dias ( Michael Fassbender ) try to rescue him . No luck . The Pict king 's young son is killed and the general dies in a forced fight with Etain . The seven Romans escape and head south with a handful of Pict hunters ( led by Etain and Aeron ) hot on their trail . Pict hunters die one by one ; the Roman seven almost die one by one.What 's good about Centurion ? The make-up and the set-designer . Picts look as dirty and flea-bitten as their filthy encampments . Most of the Romans look as filthy as the Picts . There are stunning , craggy , shivering cold scenes of the Highlands.What lacks in Centurion ? Characters we can give even a small hoot for . Most of the time we ca n't remember one from another . Fassbender seems to be a rising star , but all he 's called upon to do in this movie is fight , run monotonously and look tired . Only one actor in the cast stands out as tough and smart , and that is that fine actor Liam Cunningham . He 's made a lot of drek , but look for him inShooting the Past , Dog SoldiersandThe Wind That Shakes the Barley . The movie 's battle scenes , particularly Virilus ' march north , is shot only to show slashing swords and more spurts of blood . There 's no way to follow the battles . A plot also is lacking . The first third is an excuse for gore . The last two-thirds is an excuse for gore and long-distance running . The roles of Etain and Aeron are a sop to the 18-29-year-old audience the director seems to care most for.Centurion is not a movie . It 's a mediocre comic book for all those who love abs-enhancing armor , horsehair helmet crests and the inspiring National Geographic maps showing the Roman Empire at its greatest extent .	-1
It 's said the director insisted on shooting this on site and away from any green screens . He should have been more concerned about realism . First , no legion general would go down a narrow road in the mist ( or otherwise ) without thoroughly scouting it out beforehand . Rome did n't become the military power it did by being ambushed so easily . In the days of Agustus , three legions were ambushed along a narrow , wooded trail in Britain , but there was no way to scout it out beforehand . In fact , the general leading these legions reached a clearing and was on his way back , knowing he had made a grave tactical error and that he could n't reverse it . The Romans were a fearsome fighting force and small numbers of them routinely decimated much larger armies . The Brits loved to rush in and scare opposing armies by fearful shrieks , which did n't work against highly disciplined soldiers who had fought in many different campaigns from Parthia to Africa and even Germany . Look what happened to Boudica , with an army of 100,000 men when they threw themselves against just one trained legion which waited in a narrow detente uphill and situated between two treelines . Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was actually criticized for taking too many lives -- but it saved Nero from having to retreat from Britain altogether . It 's true that Rome caused most of its own problems by its brutality , and they did suffer losses , but not by waltzing down narrow roads in thick fog with no trained scouts to precede them . And BTW , if & # 34 ; the witch & # 34 ; knew about Etan 's identity , reputation and the reason for not being able to speak , chaces are the Romans would have known.Finally , the Romans did n't have to kill the Centurion if they wanted to keep the 9th Legion 's fate secret . If so , they would have had to kill all the soldiers in the room , as well as the slaves . And if they did want him dead , all they would have had to do was order him to report to the govenor and arrest him . Or , they could have always poisoned his wine . Attacked from behind in a relaxed and physically drained state , and having him kill both ... I want my money back ! Save this one for the five-dollar bin , then do n't buy it . I 'll never get the time I wasted on this nonsense.If you want to see a good Roman flick , see GLADIATOR again . Still not very plausible , but well done . Plus there were tigers . And green screens . Thank God for green screens , tigers and New Zealand ! And my recommendation to the Romans is , if you cut someone 's tongue out , do n't hire them as your primary scout !	-1
This review contains MINOR SPOILERS . The biggest problem in the logic with this movie is that it asks you to empathize with the Romans , after establishing that they are the imperialist invaders , crushing the native Picts by any means necessary , and delighting in their torment . At one point , they even murder a child , and you 're STILL supposed to empathize with them . One of the primary `` villains '' of this movie is a woman who was brutalized , had her tongue cut out , and watched her family get murdered before her . Yet , she 's not the character that the filmmaker chooses to create empathy with- nope , he chooses the Roman who 's trying to escape her justice.It 's also hard to lose yourself in the movie when there are jarring inconsistencies that were included either as an appeal to juvenile sensibilities , or as the result of some writing that 's so lazy it borders on the incomprehensible . As an example of the former problem , every woman who appears in `` Centurion '' looks like a supermodel who just waltzed out of a dressing room where she was pampered by professional hair dressers and makeup artists . I do n't know about you , but I find this pretty amusing , when the women in question are barbarian-hunters riding around on horseback , or an exiled witch living out in the middle of the woods . This glaring contrast takes me out of the fiction that has been created on screen , and makes me consider what was going on in the director 's head as he issued his orders to the wardrobe department.As an example of the latter problem ( lazy writing ) , there is one scene that is so absurd , it completely takes you out of the movie . It is established that the Pict tracker has such advanced abilities that she can detect the presence of her quarry a quarter mile away , simply because she 's downwind from them . That 's a bit silly , but I 'm okay with that . What makes it absurd is that just a few minutes later , she walks into a small hut where all three of the men she is tracking are hiding . Yet , despite the fact that they are only a few feet away , she can not detect them . Never mind the fact that they had only a couple of minutes to hide , and they 're sweating profusely and bleeding all over the place- nope , our superhuman tracker is completely baffled . What 's the explanation ? It 's simple- the producers painted themselves into a corner and they were too lazy to create a feasible solution.On the positive side , this movie does contain some great geography , striking cinematography , and good choreography ( although the gore is over the top , and again directed at juvenile sensibilites ) .	-1
This movie has gushing blood and lots of use of the & # 34 ; f & # 34 ; word and not much else . Not even the women were spared from punched out eyeballs and blood oozing everywhere . They had their lipstick on though . It could have been worse , but only with lots of effort .	-1
could n't hold my attention , overuse of graphic violence killed the storyline which might have been good given the era of the story	-1
Weak story line . Cinematography was poor . Sets , make up costumes none were well done . It was a cheaply made movie . And I love a good show that tells stories of times long ago . This is no & # 34 ; Rome & # 34 ; by HBO	-1
After watching the preview for this film I thought it looked promising . It turns out to be rather typical and generally disappointing . It 's really just a bunch of fight scenes broken up by A LOT of running . There 's really not much of a plot . If you 're interested in watching this movie I would just save yourself the $ 7 and read one or two of the favorable reviews ; you will get at least as much storyline as the movie gives . This is one of those movies that looks like it could have been good but it just fell short . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I watched perhaps 20 minutes of this movie because I like Michael Fassbender as an actor . Surely he would n't choose a second rate role in a second rate movie I thought . I was wrong . Though if you like a movie full of sword swinging but very little artistic irony and a predictable plot line you may like this one . For me however , after watching a little bit if this celluloid disappointment I gave up and clicked remove from list .	-1
I watched it to the end . Who ever wrote this had no insite into human behavior . The blond was good looking had a presence . And beat Hilary in acting but that was not saying much . the story line was extremely weak . The blond should have knowin his big mouth friend was talking . there was no other way they would know about him . I mean there are a hell of a lot of blond men with pony tails . lol And he had a big mouth . I also noticed that he had no gun shot wound in the pool scean > Bad writing Bad directing . And the minute a bad guy came on the scean you knew he was bad . The only knowen people where the bad guys as usual in a bad movie .	-1
Re-creation of east coast cop shows thinly veiled in a California setting . Every Actor has an equally thinly veiled to not veiled New York / Jersey mush-mouth that conflicts the geological location attempted thus the reality of the show . EXCEPT for Tricia Helfer , who can do no wrong ...	-1
To be honest the show is not half bad , I only watch because it 's free with my prime and it is not like I am not doing something also just to catch up with episodes . I started watching on a very early Sunday morning when the house still quiet and since I am a sucker for cop and medical shows I gave it a shot . The acting is ok , the story lines are ok and the cast is also ok . Nothing to write home about but entertaining for a free , no suspence , easy going cop show and the main charachter is good to look at . : )	-1
But I 'm not among them , especially . The acting was very creditable , and I enjoy dramas that play out in small spaces with few characters . But in this case , none of the characters was likeable enough for me to care what happened to him or her . There is no way to say anything more about this movie without massive spoilers , so be warned.The suspense of the story depends largely on the rate of revelation attached to our learning the interrelationships among key characters . Throughout the course of the story , we find out that not only is Alice romantically attached to one of the kidnappers , but that the two ( male ) kidnappers are romantically attached to each other . That puts one kidnapper as a pretty interesting corner of a triangle , and makes him pivotal to how the story eventually unfolds.There is a relatively high `` ick '' factor with a not-unrealistic ( but not terribly welcome ) focus on toilet functions , vomit , and awkward sex ( and no , I do n't mean the men kissing , although I 'm sure some would include that on an `` ick factor list '' as well ) . All the action that takes place within the kidnapper 's hideout seem completely realistic and natural , but once the locations start changing , it becomes hard to believe that events play out as they do . People do not seem to die , for example , until their full dramatic potential has been reached , which might make for all right entertainment , but in a story set apart by its attention to verisimilitude , it does strain credulity to the snapping point.I feel compelled to mention one aspect of the movie that was well , well above the standards for most thrillers of this type ( even the artier thrillers ) , and that 's the music , which was perfectly complementary , unobtrusive , but powerfully effective in evoking the appropriate feelings of excitement , stress , dread , and relief.If you like Hitchcock-style suspense and stories that turn very much of characters and relationships , there is much to like in `` Alice Creed . '' For my part , I did not find the ultimate destination much worth the travel ... but then , I never found Alice a very sympathetic character .	-1
Before deeming this review as unhelpful , I just want you to listen to what I have to say regarding this television program . And it is not COMPLETELY bad ; it is more tolerable than a lot of the other stupid children 's series out nowadays , so that is why I gave it an extra star . However , the humor is not the best.This is one of those programs featuring characters ( particularly Otis more than anyone else ) who are quite dim with bouts of cockiness and conceit that are very irritating . Sometimes that can be a good thing , but this series does n't do a good job of portraying that in a funny way . And he does get his comeuppances frequently after having someone else top him , but often through predictable but ridiculous changes or circumstances or idiotic plot twists . The characters are either dimwitted , cocky , saucy , or all of the above either simultaneously or during certain situations , and in a way that is intended to tickle viewers ' funny bones but is so dumb that it fails . Many characters are so moronically-obnoxious that it 's infuriating rather than entertaining . A shining example of one of these characters is Snotty Boy , who the writers try so hard to depict as obnoxious and bratty that they overdo it on his personality , and he comes off as so annoying and idiotic that it 's really not that funny . That is the thing about this show : when they try to portray particular characters a certain way , they over-dramatize the qualities that make them appear that way ( i.e . charitable , sweet , feminine ) to such a degree that it 's just downright stupid rather than laughable , like how they 're intending . ( for example , a character with an overly- sweet personality would sound like this : `` I 'll go pick flowers and frolic through the meadows riding on a unicorn 's back '' in those exact words . No character has used those exact lines , I believe , but often very similar ones . It 's supposed to be humorous , but it is so stupid that it is not ) . There 's a good degree to over-dramatize things and a bad one in comedy . If you go to the bad one , then it makes things seem stupid.Sorry that this review is so long . It is just difficult to describe what makes this program so moronic , in my opinion . If you are unfamiliar with the series and have not ever really seen an episode before , go online and watch a few for yourself and you 'll see what I mean . It is tough to explain things without far too many exact quotations . And take the words of my review to heart while watching an episode , too . Then you will be able to understand things better . But please do not deem me as unhelpful right away without very good reason .	-1
the show is to noisey and each episode is really the same if you have seen one show you have basicly seen them all	-1
American culture is no longer embarrassed by any kind of bad behavior so the quaint and stupid social faux pas committed by the characters in this program are likely NOT be understood or found funny in American culture.Laughing at other people 's embarrassment is cruel . Intelligent and kind people are charmed to laughter by clever irony or juxtaposition of ideas , not when someone else is hurt , as in slapstick , or stupid , or embarrassed .	-1
First off -- if no stars as a rating were available , that is what I would give this show . As some other reviewers with half a brain have noted , this is quite possibly THE WORST COP SHOW EVER . Even tho I purchased the complete first season on Amazon , the pilot episode was SO bad I could n't watch any others . Why is it so awful ? In the first 5 minutes of the show we see the 'Rookies ' ( everyone looking like a GAP model ) drinking & partying like total idiots , having their graduation in a bar . Then we cut to their first day on the job where they spend 90 % of their time with their guns drawn saying `` do n't make me shoot you '' . AWFUL , STUPID , HORRIBLE ! This show is an insult to anyone in law enforcement and to the public they serve . Mind you I have no problem with 'pretty actors ' doing soap opera/drama . But this show is like watching a bunch of adults run around 'playing ' cops & robbers but with real guns instead of toys . With all the great cop shows out their ( the new `` Southland '' is terrific , the `` Shield '' was awesome , Patick Swazey 's last show `` The Beast '' was great ) , you do n't need to waste your time on this poor excuse for entertainment .	-1
While a pretty period piece the pace is so slow interest fades fast . Ca n't figure out how this could have run for two seasons .	-1
This series follows the tradition of off-setting the less appealing consequences of the modernization of rural towns and villages with copious drafts of traditional & # 34 ; wisdom & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; old-fashioned common sense. & # 34 ; And there is no villager more & # 34 ; saintly & # 34 ; in imparting both the latter than the yeoman played by Brendan Coyle . Unfortunately the tensions created by modernity are all too familiar to most viewers hence the series struggles to maintain sufficient tension for us to care about the outcomes .	-1
I 've not been able to watch this as I keep getting error messages from Amazon ! I do n't have problems with any other movie subscriptions except for the Prime free . Very disappointing : (	-1
could n't watch it for long . Bad acting does not do it for me . I like good direction and really good acting . I do not really like method acting -being oneself just saying the words . This is not acting . however , even with method acting this episode failed miserably .	-1
I thought this was a series and did n't realize it was a reality show . For some this might be entertainment but not for me .	-1
I did not care for it at all , very boring and depressing , was greatly dissapointed , but to be fare it is not my Genere of tv	-1
I loved this show and even got my wife into it . Now she repels any other tv suggestions I may have . Why ? Because they canceled the series ! So now Ive got The Event ( which I would feel guilty if I said this was great and people went and paid the per episode price , I 'm a prime member so I its included ) . The Event , along with The 4400 to mention another great show that was canceled without any closure , had a lot of different story lines which had the potential for some great stuff . That is the reason for the hate it rating , producers and executives do n't deserve positive credit for shows with great writing and acting that they themselves cancel . I stopped looking to network or ad absed channels for good TV . Of course AMC has some exceptions as does FX . Oh well that 's my 2 cents .	-1
There is a big difference when you watch masterpieces like The Walking Dead , Sons of Anarchy , etc. , and this below par , Hollywood Formula , that from the script to the acting , to the editing of the already mediocre series , all it spells for the watcher is : `` I have no life at all , I rather watch the crappy premise of the show , than to participate in more meaningful activities . `` 2 Not so shinning stars .	-1
The previews/lead up to `` The Event '' were interesting and I was looking forward to a riveting , well thought out and well acted new series . Not so . This series is boring , the dialog is boring and the acting is double boring . The writers are trying to create an edge of your seat build up moment , but it falls completely flat and left me with not even a warmed over feeling.So not worth it . I will be very surprised if this lasts for more than 1 season . Flash Forward was way better and was n't on for more than a season .	-1
This episode is incredibly ludicrous . The showdown features 1 Apache helicopter that takes about ten minutes to destroy two out of three bus 's , get real ... There would have been half a dozen Apache 's , and the game would have been over in seconds ... . I ca n't believe anyone writing this would seriously believe that 's the way it works , lol ! ! ! ! ! If you are going to use the military as part of your show , you need to hire a military adviser . This is a cartoon . The only reason I gave it three stars is because the acting was , for the most part good , effects not too bad , and the storyline could have been great , but really fell short .	-1
It was mind numing . It had no draw for my atention atr all . sad really . blah blah blah blahza . did n't care for it .	-1
did n't care for the flick at all , in fact my whole family had me stop the show about 15 minutes into it .	-1
TV Series that are mostly predictable & dull conversations are the worst , and I think this show is a huge offender . I found myself wanting to skip through conversation after conversation . If your show is going to be so heavy on the conversation , it behooves the writers to produce an interesting & original line of discourse . This show is a rehash of a rehash of a rehash , and then rehashed . Do not watch .	-1
It is difficult to review a TV Series when there is no sound . We view Amazon on a Roku box which works fine for most of Amazon 's items , but the Event had good picture and no sound . Amazon refused to get involved and Roku were helpless . Bottom line is that our attempt to watch this on Amazon 's streaming service was a waste of time . We eventually watched on Netflix using our Roku box .	-1
Very slow start to whatever plot they are attempting to build ? ? Acting is sub par . Could not even make it past 30 minutes of the pilot .	-1
One of the few good things on this show was actor Stephen Dorf . Although this show had plenty of flaws , I kept watching primarily for him . However , this was his last episode on the show and with that , I had completely had it with this reincarnation of one of my favorite shows , the original LAW AND ORDER set in NYC . The problems with this show are manifold . The worst is that it is trying to be a hybrid of the original show with a CSI show . So instead of the excellence of a team which had Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston in the gritty New York scene , there is this technicolor mess of a show trying to infuse us with the coolness of the hopped up LA scene . All this is missing is the Horatio from CSI Miami with his sunglasses to cement it as a truly unbelievable show . The CRIMINAL INTENT version of this show was also ruined by constantly reinventing a concept which worked . It too became unwatchable with Jeff Goldblum at the helm . My recommendation is to skip this show and stick to the reruns of the original , especially the ones with Waterston and Orbach in their primes .	-1
there was n't anything that made me have any empathy for the victims . just a bunch of whiny people mad because their less than stellar behavior reaped bad results . welcome to the real world -- -oh and it does rain in southern California .	-1
There are no surprises in this Law and Order series with predictable plots and characters except for a little more sunshine , LA location wise . Now that `` Criminal Intent '' is off the air and `` SVU '' has become wooden , that is , everyone is phoning in their performances , I do n't see this West Coast version coming up with anything fresh . After a lot of years , I am crying `` Uncle ! '' . Not even $ 1.99 per episode can entice . I would rather be reading a good book .	-1
you are led to think you will be seeing the movie instead yousee some people sitting around talking about the move , whocares .	-1
Yeah , probably not gon na wan na pay for this unless you just ca n't get enough MARMADUKE in your life . My son was feeling like that so we bit the big apple . He was like WHAT ? Why is it so short ? ? ? Hey , my question indeed .	-1
FREAKONOMICS ( 90 mins. , various directors ) is a ramshackle documentary presenting various statistical theories , based on a book ( Freakonomics : A Rogue Economist Explores the Hidden Side of Everything ( P.S . ) ) by `` economist '' Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen Dubner . While I had a long-standing desire to read the book , I had n't heard of the concordant documentary and was anxious to see it when I did hear about it.Before I go on , let me regale you with the latest shill 's message to me regarding this film : `` It is your assertions of racism , etc . that are anti-intellectual . I could , in fact argue that YOUR discussion of `` Black names '' reflects a rather insidious degree of bigotry . In addition , your criticisms of the quality of the data are amazingly uninformed. '' WOW . Sell a lot of books this way , do you ? By insulting an honest reviewer , then demanding back-up evidence ? This is a REVIEW , not a doctoral thesis . The idiots who made this film have the burden - not I . Mine is onerous enough writing to audiences filled with readers like YOU . And the filmmakers are the ones who raise the whole issue of `` black '' names , not I . And that is what you can expect from a film like this.The film is a huge let-down ; it certainly steered me away from the desire to read the book . I 've come to the conclusion that the appellation `` rogue economist '' ( as Levitt calls himself ) is a big red flag with Sarah Palin 's silhouette on it.Full of somewhat interesting but ultimately useless and mildly offensive trivia , the documentary 's biggest mystery is why several directors were hired to film the various segments . Some of the segments are downright insulting to the intelligence.In a word , stupid . Or , in another word , Wallywood . So here are the basic parts of this broken machine : REALTORS ROBBING CLIENTS : Levitt and Dubner yammer about the way realtors rip off their clients in the good old American home-selling scheme . While I found it informative , it could have been done more briefly and a lot more deeply.CHILDREN 'S NAMES : This is about whether a child 's name will affect that child 's success later in life . It seems Levitt 's whole point is to show how certain names could lead white girls to a stripper 's life . I found this segment racist , aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names , and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs . I doubt that is only because of the names the black community chooses but this film insists it is . In any case , I do not need statistics to explain that to me : I am half black.However , Levitt ( the apparent heavy-lifter in all the fact-finding ) tells us more : did you know that among rich white folk , the most popular names for girls used to be Jessica , Lauren , Ashley , Sarah and Emily ? Among `` the Wal~Mart crowd '' ( their term , not mine ) , the most popular names were Ashley ( `` Trashley '' ) , Jessica , Amanda , Samantha and Brittney.I was having a hard time understanding how the white strippers relate to the problems of the black community and vice-versa , but there you are . Apparently , these two stalwart researchers also claim that the name Tyrone `` is a black name . '' I have news for you : it is not a `` black '' name . The only thing in the world that is `` black '' in this context is the skin of some people . And that 's not `` black '' , it 's `` brown '' .Gee , I guess pointing that out makes me the racist here.SUMO MATCHES ARE FIXED : Next we have a segment about Sumo wrestling corruption in Japan . Plus the exciting topic about Japanese police and their general incompetence . It 's really a segment about religious corruption because Sumo is a sort of extension under the Shinto religion . This was a good segment , but a totally confusing mish-mash if you are not already familiar with Japanese culture - which this documentary assumes you are.ROE V. WADE DROPPED OUR CRIME RATES : These dummies claim Roe v. Wade and the whole abortion issue might just be the answer to lower crime rates . How 's that ? - you may well ask . Levitt did a study of the evil Romanian dictator Ceaucescu and his draconian you-have-to-have-a-baby-NOW laws from circa 1989 . Levitt found that about 20 years later , Romanian crime had skyrocketed . Coincidence ? Based on this interestingly weak observation , Levitt decided to study U.S. crime rates dating 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision . He claims he found crime had plummeted . Levitt asserts 50 % of that total drop was thanks to Roe v. Wade and all the criminals-to-be that were never born . Allow me to explain why this is bad statistical use : Levitt freely asserts 50 % of the drop in crime to be thanks to Roe v. Wade . He presents no evidence that he delved into ALL the necessary statistics to make that assertion.What is freely asserted is freely negated - any critics of my review familiar with THAT ? If anyone expects me to quote statistical analysis here for the purpose of refuting these clowns , well , I do n't have to do so . The burden is Levitt 's . And he fails.BRIBE THE KIDS TO GET GOOD GRADES : For me this was the most stupid segment : an experiment in Chicago to bribe 9th graders to get good grades . The authors of the experiment believed bribes can and should be used to get these kids to do their schoolwork . As opposed to getting out on the street , joining a gang and possibly making several thousands of dollars a day doing whatever it is the gangs do.This type of film pains me . It is the usual pseudo-intellectualism camouflaged as something I can only label as 'significant trivia ' , and it has more to do with arrogant researchers who are full of themselves than it has to do with facts . Naturally , it deeply moves pseudo-intellectuals . This film tries to be light-hearted and humorous , but it falls flat.These `` experts '' are offensive idiots : they manage to insult the poor of all colors ( is that funny ? ) , the black community ( oh , that MUST be funny ) , struggling parents ( definitely not funny and most unwise ) AND kids in dire need ( just plain horrible and psycho ) . We can safely add that the authors/film narrators in some odd way have made pro-abortion people feel weird also.Imagine how they have offended cinema and the art of documentation.This certainly put me off reading the authors ' book . Since I have a little bird who tells me things , I have had it brought to my attention that Levitt and Dubner `` read reviews '' . Well , gentlemen , I hope you learned something from my review . The public has a right to know all balanced criticisms . Apparently , some strange enemy has read my review already anyway.Please know : my review is a great deal more fair than the documentary .	-1

While I found a lot of the subjects interesting , I thought the film was seriously slow and boring . I like documentaries and even though this one starts out promising , it quickly gets old and really does n't give us much insight on the subjects at hand . In other words , it does n't do what it set out to do . Instead of raising awareness , interest and answering questions , it just has you reaching for the off button on your remote ! Read the book , you 'll be much better off .	-1
I have no opinion of the video , since I could n't get it to play on my pc . sorry ! I 'm still trying to resolve whether it was a wireless issue , a spooling issue , or a video streaming issue .	-1
The movie was half done before I ever saw one of the & # 34 ; creatures & # 34 ; they 'd referred to only about twice by then . Very boring . The ending left me wondering , what was the point of the whole movie . I did n't get it at all .	-1
This movie is clearly intended to be a commentary on American 's fear of Mexicans , with a particular slant arguing for the irrationality of this position . I 'm tired of having movies and media tell me how I should feel about this issue . I 'm even more tired of the attempt to cloak social and political commentary within a movie that 's seemingly about conventional aliens . District 9 was at least a highly engaging film . I know Americans as a lot tend to expect fast paced , action-filled films , but we do and so what ? Right wrong or indifferent , Americans ' general preferences align to these core values , with some exceptions here and there . This film , unfortunately , does n't fulfill . While I appreciate its attempt to allegorically demonstrate the irrationality of Americans ' core xenophobia , I 'm sick of the message . Further , good satire , ironic or otherwise , derives its value from being a compelling story on multiple levels , including the simplistic , face-value story presented , through its underlying messages . This movie is just not that interesting on its face value/level . It does a good job of making the key actors interesting and relatable to the audience , but their journey is much more matter of fact and devoid of conflict , that is just drags on without eliciting the emotional response the film clearly thinks it should drag out . This is my principal complaint - the actual on-screen action is widely disconnected from the message the story seems to be trying to convey . I must say , however , that if you 're renting this film , you 'll likely not regret your decision , but if you buy , this will either end up on your ebay to sell list , or collect dust .	-1
For a film with so much buzz , especially for its director and his bag of tricks , ` Monsters ' is disturbingly ineffective . I should have listened to my Ammy buddy MKIA , but then again , even he said I may like this . I wanted to . While heavily clich & eacute ; d , I just wanted this to scare the pants off of me , and we all know that atmosphere is the scariest thing of all ; and this film supposedly had a lot of that.It doesn't.Okay , so the film takes place at a time when alien life forms are terrorizing humans . These gigantic squid like things have been contained in Mexico by a gigantic wall that runs along the Mexican border . A young photographer is in Mexico chasing after his big break when his plans are derailed by a sudden attack and the need to escort a young woman back to the States ( that young woman happens to be the daughter of the photographer 's boss ) . Their journey back to the States is littered with oddly placed emotional connections and a few scattered attempts to scare us with brief glimpses of alien creatures.Take away the fact that this monster film hardly showcases the actual monsters ; the film itself had major promise . I mean , I 'm all for a film about emotional growth and human bonding in the times of trial . The script itself , while heavily clich & eacute ; d , could have really proven deeply arresting , and the final scene is expertly handled ( and by final scene I mean just that ; the split second before the credits begin to roll ) . Still , there are two things that really prohibited this movie from being any good ; Scoot McNairy and Whitney Able . These two actors are atrocious . I mean , they probably put in the worst performances of the year ; period . There is no chemistry , and the dialog they have to suffer through is horrendous . I know that this film was done on a small budget , which actually says a lot for the crispness of the scenes ( the cinematography is especially marvelous ) but you can feel an air of ` cheapness ' in a lot of the voice over work ( I do n't know if the sound was n't good on the original shoot and so they basically dubbed all the dialog , but there are many scenes where the crispness of the vocals is distracting and phony sounding ) .The ` scary ' moments are few and far in between , but they are effective to a degree . The opening scene is pretty great and got my hopes up very high , but in the end ` Monsters ' barely registers with the viewer save for some beautiful cinematic shots and a shivery score .	-1
I felt thoroughly ripped off with this film . It was infantile , stupid , tedious and embarrassing.The special effects were laughable .	-1
I have issues with monster movies where the female lead is always dressed and looking sexy tousled , her hair and face just so , even as she sweats her way from one near-death to another . That was the funny part for me . I laughed . There is no chemistry between these two as they try to make their way home to the US from the alien-infected jungles of Mexico . Yes , the movie tries to make a social commentary about immigration and keeping the Mexicans out . Here , a huge wall is there to keep the aliens out , unsuccessfully , it turns out . I 'll credit the film with not overdoing the scares . There is more threat of scare than actual scare . The aliens looks like giant shrimp , and while not entirely believable , they look okay for cheap special effects . The other effects are better , such as the wreckage left behind where the aliens have been rampaging . The script stinks , and the two lead actors are bad . Should you watch ? Maybe . Just do n't expect much .	-1
Realistic characters , understated dialog , good cinematography and special effects all come up short in what appears to be an off-hand statement on current American Immigration Policies and the demographic shift in the southwest . If you 've seen the trailer , you 've seen the best parts . Disappointed not only with the money spent to rent it but the lost opportunity to make a genuine monster movie . Watch Cloverfield or Alien Raiders instead .	-1
I fell asleep ... that says it all . Another movie where you want to see the monsters , but they 're just barely visible .	-1
Not even worth while renting . All the reviews seem to be written by those who have some vested interest in the film . A lot of cheap movie shots of Mexico somewhere and homes still not repaired from Hurricane Katrina event . Standard boy meets girl who is already engaged but ends up not wanting to getting married to her husband to be , but falls in love with the guy she has the adventure with . Like the last Titanic movie disaster . I waste a lot of time watching movies , and this was very much of a waste of time . The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms , which could not exist on land . The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land . And these monsters were not all that distinct . The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds . Very stupid . At the end you have the two main actors staring at these monsters with mouth open wonderment .	-1
Although the premise of this movie was somewhat intriguing , the characters , editing , pacing , and acting were not . I 've heard of slow , but THIS was slower than a 3-legged turtle . It seems that aliens have landed and occupied earth six years ago , there is now an `` infected '' zone where you can not leave , and a wall has been constructed in keep people in/out . Yeah , I get the symbolism there , but this movie becomes an exercise in a very lame excuse to tell a love story . I did n't care for either character , the monsters look like floating octopi , and I never felt the characters were in peril of anything -- except their own insipidness ( if that 's even a word ) . So go ahead and watch ... BORE yourself to death ...	-1
The storyline & premise had the potential to be really interesting but to me it was a rambling movie that was hard to track the intent of the characters and the bordering countries . Also the monster 's seemed to have their own agenda but that was n't clearly defined . Not a fan of the production values or editing either .	-1
i watched this because the director is behind the new Godzilla movie . This movie has a lot going for it : nice directing , it 's beautifully filmed , great cinematography , creative settings/backgrounds , excellent use of the aliens - goes to show that 100+ million dollars is not necessary . BUT , it just plods along . it is not about smash and destroy aliens - they serve as the push for the interactions of the 2 lead characters and that is fine - i had no trouble with that . what i did have trouble with was it moved so slowly with little if any character development - i never really learned anything more about these people . and 80 minutes into it i just didnt care , then poof 5 minutes of intrigue and THE END . as a prime member , try it , but don ; t pay for it .	-1
How to tell when a movie is below budget cheap. ( 1 . ) No subtitles for either English or people with hearing problems. ( 2 . ) Intro that makes no intelligent sense to anyone with a high school or above educational background . NASA finds alien life forms in our solar system which have been identified as `` the writer 's of this movie '' . NASA decides to bring said alien life back to Earth who start out looking remarkably like common wood decay fungi ( e.g . Trametes versicolor ) but then acquire the anatomy of an ocean dwelling cross between a jellyfish and a squid . Unfortunately for our alien writers who never passed 10th grade biology or 9th grade physical science the physics of this anatomy is mechanically unsustainable walking about on the surface of Earth. ( 3 . ) Handheld cinematography that looks like something your Neanderthal relatives took while touring deteriorating industrial , trash and natural disaster wreckage in Central America . Really really bad/cheap CGI on our poor stranded jellysquid . The jellysquid 's agent should be fired or eaten. ( 4 . ) Actors with the emotional impact of the above mentioned fungi and the dialogue capacity of seven monosyllabic words per edited scene. ( 5 . ) Props in the movie consisted mostly of road signs that said `` Infection Area '' ; fungi on trees ; army surplus gas masks ; a crane to lift a truck then drop it which is edited to make it seem like the aforementioned jellysquid did it. ( 6 . ) Whale sound effects that unfortunately for our alien writers , had they spent $ 10 to hire a marine biologist they would have found out , that for the most part are of a frequency pattern that works primarily under water . Which brings up the question of what planet in our solar system did these creatures come from ? ( 7 . ) It takes 45 minutes into this handheld travelogue before anything interesting happens and another 45 minutes to hope it ends quicker .	-1
I watched this because I was in the mood for an alien movie . This is 95 % about a man and a woman who gradually fall in love , amid a journey from Central America to the US border , made difficult because of travel restrictions due to an alien invasion . I 'm making it sound better than it is . For one thing , a lot of Spanish is spoken , with very little translation . For another , this felt more like a three-hour movie , with the man and woman gazing at each other , alternating with looking out for the monsters , who conveniently only appear in the dark . There 's about five minutes of monster activity , not counting the ending . There 's even a & # 34 ; War of the Worlds & # 34 ; ( the one with Tom Cruise ) ripoff scene with monster tentacles investigating a building while the woman tries to be quiet . Things happen with no explanation or purpose for the story . What a waste of time and what a misleading title .	-1
Story had no suspense . Direction was not entertaining . A dud . Do n't waste your time . I could n't watch it . A dud .	-1
THE MOVIE WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE . TO ME IT WAS MORE A LOVE STORY . THERE WAS SOME INTERSTING SIGHTS . BUT ALL IN ALL NOT MY KNID OF A MOVIE .	-1
Time i will never get back , you know what im saying ? There are good creature movies and bad ones , even some of the old 50 's rubber suit movies were better .	-1
I gave it 2 stars because I liked the concept -- alien life purposely brought back to Earth , accidentally let loose -- so I decided to give it a go . So not worth it . Nothing happens . Nothing . It is boring . No , let me correct that . It is BOOOOOORING ! ! ! ! Way too many areas of the plot left unexplored ; way too much meaningless conversation that does nothing to advance the plot ; way too little character development ; way too many unanswered questions ; and the & # 34 ; plot twist & # 34 ; at the end was incomplete .	-1
So , the monsters are giant , walking , glowing , octopus , from outer space , and towards the end of the film you get to see them have sex . Oh no , I am not kidding . Despite its original title and awful special effects , Monsters , is not a bad story . It is however another example of a writer , using science fiction , to promote his own agenda and bigotry . The infected zone is Mexico and you 're safe once you get to America . How about the largest man made structure in the world ? A wall to keep the aliens out of the USA . As for the acting , it was two newcomers who actually were pretty good , but whom are easily overlooked . It 's because Monsters is one of those movies , where you keep waiting for something to happen and it never does . It had good potential , but was just painfully boring ... unless of course you enjoy octopus sex .	-1
After aliens invade Earth , a photo journalist agrees to escort a tourist back to America . After paying for safe passage around an infected zone of Mexico , the tourist finds her passport stolen and is not allowed passage . Together her and the journalist must make thier way to the border through the infected zone . This movie is much like `` District 9 '' . Aliens have landed and are now living among us . While `` District 9 '' was original at the time I did not like it at all . This one I thought was worse . Its hard for me to find anything good to say about it , so I 'll make this review short . The effects were good , and it was another good idea for a movie . But the main problem with the movie for me is that it 's sooooooo drawn out . If you took all the action out of `` Cloverfield '' you would have this movie . I had to struggle to get through it . Very boring . I did n't enjoy it at all . I give it a D-.Would I watch again ? - Not even if real aliens invaded and this was the only way to avoid them ! !	-1
I picked this one because I am into syfy , but this just did not fill the bill . I would not reccomend it to anyone .	-1
When this TV series keeps the action where it should be , i.e . on the Destiny , and in space it is a 4 or 5 star showUnfortunately , this episode spent half the time on earth showing the domestic issues that a couple people had .	-1

As we all know , the best Gordon Ramsay video is an uncensored video . From what I 'm seeing in these reviews , this DVD is censored ! No way ! I 'm not buying it if it 's censored . Why would his first seven seasons be `` raw & uncensored '' , and now season 8 is censored ? Nope ! I 'm not buying this DVD .	-1
I do n't like that Amazon charges me a monthly charge and yet I am not able to watch streamed shows that I expected to be able to watch with the my monthly subscription .	-1
This gives procedural dramas a bad name . If you 're expecting something akin to Law and Order , you are n't going to get it here . Basically it is mundane and repetitive in the worst way . The way the storylines are annoying because it goes back and forth showing the prosecutor 's side of the story and the defense 's side . Plus there is no police investigation of the crimes.Bad formatting , storylines have been done to death on other shows , predictable endings . All around it could have been so much better but whoever came up with the scripts and format is an idiot . I only gave it a chance and watched a bit because I like Maura Tierney .	-1
excellent acting but do not like such fast moving dialogue and switching back and forth between different scenarios . looked like excellent story line though .	-1
Although I like the concept and the premise of this program , I find the execution to be a turn-off . It 's much too busy for my taste . They do n't let a thought develop without interrupting it with another speaker and another thought . It becomes a challenge to the viewer , a challenge which is not rewarded .	-1
Clich & eacute ; after clich & eacute ; after clich & eacute ; , does not deliver . Not even randomly . The procedural is just so bad that it could have worked as a joke , but it instead tries to be too serious . The writing is painful Of the two main characters , she is as stiff , boring , and sanctimonious as the worst parody of a career woman attempts to be . He is a clown disguised as what I guess was meant to be a New York yuppie with suits and sneakers , bear , and hat . The love story is without chemistry . Naturally . The episodes plots are lame .	-1
Lisa Scottoline is salivating over a human drama and murder , telling what kind of exciting story this made for her book ( did n't mention her pocket ) for a full hour . Her excitement over a tragedy was unbearable . She maybe could have faked some sadness.This show has boring stories ( except the first episode ) that goes on forever .	-1
This is a rehash of the dreadful & # 34 ; reality TV & # 34 ; junk . Just terrible . Why any published author would participate in such a venture is difficult to conjure .	-1
This is for the Episode One Night.This entire series just barely holds my interest . it has just the bare minimum of explanatory material to take it to a high school mentality level , for those in high school , instead of a 6th grade mentality . However , episodes like this one are lazy writing , inane , and intellectually annoying.So , Will and his new girlfriend ( Abby ) are accosted by gang members in order to save their leader 's life . The writers of the episode could n't think of anything else , so they wrote in the leverage that if Will did n't save the gang leader , the second in command would kill both of them . Really ? So let me get this straight . The second in command , wanting the leader to be saved by Will , threatens to kill Will , if Will does n't save the leader ? I mean it looks like she does n't have any leverage at all . Will could simply say he wants this or that ( safe passage after the fact , for instance ) or she might as well shoot the leader herself , since that 's the logical outcome . ( The second in command wanted Will to kill the leader by making it look like an accident , but she still had to make it look that way . Killing Will remains an illogical way to achieve that end. , and so the evaluation I offer is valid . ) What 's more , the gang will probably kill them anyway ( Will and Abby deduce this ) . So , in fact , the second in command has no leverage at all.In the mean time , Will concocts a plan whereby Abby gets free , and while free the first thing Will instructs her to do is call Sanctuary . Abby does get free , and runs back to Will . Her explanation is that she did n't want them to kill Will because she escaped . Again , if they kill Will , their leader dies . Two things here : ( 1 ) Why ca n't she make a simple 20 second call to Sanctuary before coming back and ( 2 ) Killing Will is the same as killing the leader , so until all avenues of Will saving the leader 's life are exhausted , Will is safe.Very poor deductive thinking and thus poor writing . Of course if you 're a sixth grader with limited mental capability , you probably wo n't notice the fallacy . For the rest of us , we do , and I wo n't be purchasing the next season . I purchased the entire 3rd season , so I will probably finish it . But then is see ya to bad writing and an insult to average intelligence .	-1
I saw one of these episodes years ago about a ghost siting of a solider on a battlefield and it was interesting.I only got through one episode , it was bad and boring . I am not sure this series is still on the air but if its not I can see why.Id pass on this .	-1
Criminals able to talk about their crimes is not interesting . I enjoy the forensic part of the ID shows , not the emotional story of a criminal .	-1
I often have to watch what my child is watching and usually its entertaining but this was like torture . It was so boring I was very glad it stopped after 4 episodes .	-1
This is a really terrible movie . Let me describe it by splitting the film into two sections . Let me explain the first half first.The first half of the movie is totally fitting for the Lifetime Movie Network . It 's about a woman who lives in an apartment building and , while a man is fixing a plumbing problem under her kitchen sink , they fall in love . Little does she know the man who has a history of mental illness . Well she DOES eventually realize this but not until she 's already committed to the guy.Let me state that what the guy does for a living is completely meaningless . He works in real estate and it 's a family business , hence the constant sarcastic bickering between him and his father about `` making the right choices for the sake of the family '' . None of this matters though . The focus here is on the man and woman attempting to hit off a relationship.Well for the entire first half of the movie , the man and woman go through the routine ups and downs of being in a relationship , however since the man has a mental condition due to him having to tragically witness his mother jumping and killing herself when he was a child , this problem interferes with his ability to want to have kids with the woman and ... now things get worse- MUCH worse . Apparently the woman brought back personal feelings that were n't meant to see the light of day . Now these mental problems have been unleashed . Sounds fun so far , right ? Read on.Let me mention that everything about the man and woman falling in love is flat out *boring* because I 've seen an identical build-up of typical relationship highs and lows in several other films , so nothing different was done here at all . I mean it was written in such a predictable way here that it 's totally pointless to watch . In fact the one and only scene that made an effort to stand out and be different is when the man gets furious at his wife who 's simply minding her own business at a dinner party and he comes storming in the room , grabs her by the hair and pulls her out of the house . Nobody at the party seemed to think this was unordinary behavior or stood up for the woman . What ? Even worse is that whenever something good happens such as this , the writing completely falls apart so the very next scene shifts in another direction , thereby destroying all suspense that could have occurred . Terrible . It 's obvious the man is crazy but nothing really suspenseful other than the guy destroying a book shelf and making a few threats ever seem to come out of it.Now the second part of the film . This is when the storyline completely falls flat . This is when the amount of confusion will probably leave you speechless . Well apparently the wife disappears , so we flash several years into the future with the husband as an old man , in a courtroom , and attempting to explain his innocence but ... now the storyline is completely focused around the characters as OLDER people so suddenly it 's like watching a completely different movie , and ... get THIS- now we 're seeing the man accused of murdering his wife dressed up as a woman *himself* and involved in conflicts with other older people that do absolutely nothing but confuse the living heck out of me.Suddenly MURDERS are now occurring , which is odd because you 'd think growing older would mean becoming wiser and less violent . Suddenly as an old man , he 's doing drugs with a friend in a car and wearing make-up like a woman . Whatever ( or whoever ) is responsible for these murders being committed when it would seem these characters do n't have much time on the planet anyway since old age has creeped in is beyond my understanding- WAY beyond it.Bored by the generic writing of the first half and confused by the second half makes this movie an absolute failure . A double dose of failure in fact because `` bored and confused '' is the worst of BOTH worlds when it comes to movie storytelling . Ugh ! I strongly recommend avoiding this hogwash !	-1
Not a great film by any means . It is , in fact , the same old cliche ' based on true events story . It does n't really go anywhere . The characters , all of them , except the dog were flat and boring . Actually , the dog was pretty flat too . Based on the film , the marriage was doomed from the beginning and only got worse , but I did n't feel anything for any of the characters . The story and it 's depiction was just sad and pathetic . But maybe that was the point .	-1
I should have rented this confused , disjointed hodge-podge from Netflix , rather than having wasted the miniscule amount it cost me to purchase from Costco.Utter junk ! Although `` trooper '' me had to stick it out to the very end , hoping for a simulacrum of improvement.Which never manifested .	-1
This was more of a comical depiction than a more serious show regarding the people that were portrayed in it . I really do n't have any more to say about this as I was disappointed with the series .	-1
This series is awful . If you like looking at very faint dots of refracted light taken in photo , or Blankets that were obviously tied to a string in a manner to move them then you might like it . Everyone claims to see a ghost , but their footage is so poor that a ton of other explanations could account for what is presented . Like Bigfoot and UFO 's ... When real concrete , scientific and fully documented proof is discovered then all this is just non-sense .	-1
Both my 4 year old nephew , and 5 month old son did n't want to watch this show . Not meant for entertaining small kids , that 's for sure .	-1
Swamp People was an ok show . I chose to watch this show after seeing it pop up as a recommendation here on Amazon . I love the show Mountain Men and I love the show Duck Dynasty and Swamp people seems to try to capture some of the same feelings from these shows . You have the & # 34 ; redneck & # 34 ; feel from Duck Dynasty and the & # 34 ; tough guy & # 34 ; feeling from Mountain Men . While it was definitely interesting to get a peek into the unique lives of the people on this show , I didnt feel like any of the characters really had that appeal or charm that a reality show needs to keep viewers interested . Plus , there are really only so many times one can watch people catch crocodiles in a swamp . & # 34 ; Meh & # 34 ; is my overall opinion of this show . I would n't recommend it or choose it again .	-1
What a disappointment ! I was an avid Nova viewer 10 years ago so thought I 'd give it a try . It has changed from a serious program for intellectually curious adults into a program for school-aged children . Even the narration has changed from a serious , deep , masculine voice to a metrosexual male with a non-threatening , elementary school teacher 's speaking style .	-1
Watched this expecting some decent acting and some decent action , not because of the user reviews but because of the stock Amazon review , but all I got were some pointless brutal killings over small potatoes . The so-called & # 34 ; great reviews & # 34 ; are also misleading . You probably might watch it anyway , to see for yourself , but believe me , you 'll wish you had that time back . This film is boring , has a convoluted storyline and seems pretty disjointed . All in all , a waste of time . Really , just a story of different mobsters jockeying for position and pointlessly and carelessly beating and killing everyone and each other along the way . But do n't expect any martial arts , there is n't any . There 's some bitch-slapping , some beatings ( that you do n't really see all that well ) , too many point-blank gunshots , stilted dialog . In this film , everyone is corrupt , even the cops . Predictably boring finale as well . Just a bunch of grown men acting like punks . Pass this one by .	-1
A fair amount of well executed ( so to speak ) violence in a well made but routine yakuza film . Takeshi Kitano makes so many movies they ca n't all be great . This one is n't - but it 's not terribly bad , either .	-1
This is your typical organized crime film where competing families play & # 34 ; King of the Hill. & # 34 ; You get the feeling of deja vu when you watch it.It includes , paid off cops , hits , drugs , prostitution , betrayals and an odd scene where they force the ambassador of Ghana to open a casino in his embassy . This film does n't bring anything new to the table , except the Japanese & # 34 ; honorably & # 34 ; cut off their own finger rather than have someone else do it to them . With the film being run of the mill crime action , the English subtitles was a big negative as it was apparent they were lazy and did n't translate everything.Parental Guide : F-bomb , token sex and nude scene .	-1
Only the first episode is included with Amazon Prime , so I 'm only rating that.This series , despite its intriguing title plays on sensational claims that are not supported by evidence . I would n't consider it worthy of a channel dedicated to & # 34 ; history & # 34 ; .	-1
The show makes it look like they 're going to reveal mysteries but then they choose the most mundane conclusions for every & # 34 ; so called & # 34 ; mystery they examine . For example , the missing cornerstone of the white house is dismissed as a mystery because it 's to big and heavy to move . Really ? ! That 's pretty obvious from the beginning is n't it ? Yes , it 's a big heavy rock . It 's missing . Well it has to be there because it 's a big and heavy rock . Mystery solved ! That 's pretty much how this show goes . Very boring and no fun to watch .	-1
This show is about as phony as any ghost hunting show . First , Brad Meltzer . Why does he need to stand in front of a field of mathematical formulas as if to suggest he is a higher order of intelligence when nothing anyone does has to do with math ? The onset of the stories sounds interesting that Brad gives in the set up . The problem is that Brad does nothing ! ! He sits in front of a green screen and does no investigation himself . He has this team of `` experts '' who are totally laughable go out and `` discover '' the truth . One guy is writing notes the whole time ( scribble scribble ) . The chick usually has nothing to do . The other guy is the driver who seems like he is still learning his job.Most of the time in their investigation , they take some red herring and find themselves out in left field from where they began . So what they find ends up being irrelevant and has no solid relationship to the initial conspiracy . I am watching the Lewis and Clark episode and whether or not Lewis committed suicide or not . In the end , there was no real information brought to the table that was not already said in the beginning.Much of the show is already set up , even before the so called investigations occur . There is no real inquiry , its just published information . As the case with Lewis , clearly the idea of whether he killed himself or not is not a new one as there are a bunch of books already published . In fact , they go and talk to an author and gets lots of `` yes 's '' .The show in general comes off as series of smoke and mirrors . Lots of flashy editing , zoom cuts , sound effects , and incidental music to create the effect . Brad chimes in saying nothing important , but usually either retelling what has happened , or foretelling what his `` experts '' will find out . So everything is already figured out.I watch the show out of curiosity and to see how many holes are in the episode . I really dont find him convincing or that the show brings out any secret history that might already be written elsewhere . I have never read his books and can see he has some reputation in the field . But like Dan Brown - they are fiction . No matter how real the facts are by themselves , they are linked by fiction.The show has one philosophy : `` Proverbs for Paranoids # 4 : If you keep them asking the wrong questions , it does not matter what the answer is . ''	-1
Not much to say except this is proof of the dumbing down of our country . I did n't finish the program .	-1
Gold rush season number two was a complete wast of time , and I did not enjoy this program at all .	-1
A waste of time and money . Theatrical exclamations and much head shaking by the author of a `` book '' on the subject . Apparently he saves the `` Interesting '' details for his book , ( if there were any at all ) .	-1
It 's been a while since I viewed the program but it is deceptive in that a family was supposed to have found these documents in an attic and there is no info on what they thought or who they gave the docs to except for a very short mention somewhere in the program . I think the story was with this family ; did they lose any family members to the death camps ? A repeat of what went on in the death camps is really getting to be old stuff . The story needs to be redefined so the young generation of people we have now on the planet know what really happened .	-1
Story made no sense , the writing was terrible , the dialog was wooden , and the monsters ( Snowmen ) were silly . I do like Clara , interesting character , and I like the new TARDIS . I wish Steven Moffit would explain more about the Lizard woman , their are too many questions about her character . I mean really a Lizard woman walking around 1892 London and no one says anything or is trying to hunt her down , the only one who was realistic was the Maid who fainted .	-1
$ 1.99 for this a 2 minute trailer of the 2011 Christmas episode ! ! . What up with that ! ! charged for a two minute preview for the episode .	-1
I do n't know . Scary snowmen ? I suppose after all these years it is difficult to come up with new stories . I paid to watch this one and wish I had n't . Really miss the writing of the first couple of seasons of the 'new ' Dr. Who .	-1
DO NOT BUY THIS ! ! ! ! ! This is NOT the episode.It is the under 2 minute `` prequel '' that is available FREE at the BBC America website.Someone at Amazon is either incompetent ( at best ) or greedy ( at worst ) .I OFFICIALLY ****PROTEST**** BEING CHARGED FOR THIS .	-1

I got the pilot episode of The Cape for free on Amazon Video on Demand . I watched it . I 'll try almost anything once.Once is too much.The story is about a good cop who gets framed by the evil owner of a gigantic corporation/crime syndicate . Since he is assumed to be dead , he can not go back to his wife or son - though , in a maudlin moment , he visits the boy while the boy is sleeping . There should have been a puppy and some kittens.At the burial service for him , the cop watches from behind a tree , about as difficult to spot as the Washington Monument in DC . Somehow , though , all the police , whom one assumes to be alert and vigilant , miss his presence.Anyway , somehow , and I really do not understand how or why , he gets involved with a circus that seems to have about six members . They seem to perform before a similar number of people . Sets are not a strong point . He performs by battling a small person ( ok - dwarf ) of extraordinary fighting ability and numerous tattoos.The circus is run by a large black guy whose overacting is great enough to be the converse of Keanu Reeves , if Reeves were actually trying to act . The black guy is a master magician , and he trains the ex-cop to use a cape formerly used by a now departed magician - the magic is fake , but it is allowed to seem almost real to the audience in the course of the episode . Since he used to read a comic called `` The Cape '' to his son to put him to sleep , the ex-cop assumes the identity of `` The Cape . '' This might put you to sleep.The bad guy has a British accent and occasional not human eyes , and he has been committing crimes in costume , even though he is the head of a huge conglomerate . For sheer fun , one presumes . These are the crimes pinned on the ex-cop . They are designed to force `` the city '' to privatize its police force by turning it over to his corporation , which the city promptly does . Global domination to follow.The circus members are either committed to destroying the bad guy or become immediately so dedicated , and the Cape and they rob banks belonging to the corporation.The evil overlord 's head henchman turns out to be the Cape 's former best friend and police partner , who framed him because Mr . Evil threatened to harm his family . He is , however , not a happy henchman . In these sorts of bad movies/shows , having a family is a definite no-no.I do n't know who any of the actors were , but none of them were very good , except for the little person who has some comic flair.The show is half serious and half camp/cartoon and occasionally funny . It is not a good mix , and the bad acting , silly plot and low-budget production values seal its fate . It becomes boring .	-1
I always like to watch movies with Judy Dench . The part she played in this film , however , did n't seem to be something I thought did justice to her acting abilities . I did n't care for Cranford so I did n't watch much of it .	-1
Boy meets girl . Each is on the wrong side of the tracks for the other . Things get passionate though a number of details seem out of character for each . Enough it kept this from seeming plausible really . Plot is too thin , and story is too choppy . The middle and ending seem very poorly worked out . Like someone just gave up rather than finish the story . I have seen worse , but this one ends up moving too slowly and tepidly . This could have been a riveting , moving , and important story . It unfortunately just was not .	-1
I do n't think this film is worth the cost . It moved too slowly and never captured my attention or interest . Something was lacking in this film . I do n't think it is worth the cost . See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr .	-1
First of all angelina never was hot and this mvoie needs a plot . Totally lame done over a weekend hunk of crap shown in big theaters . LAme lame leaaamee	-1
This is just a trailer ... Stop putting spam in my prime , I will NEVER BUY THIS MOVIE now that you 've stooped to this deceitful way of advertising .	-1
i love anjelina jolie- she is a great actress and she was in the movie- i didnt read the whole description and its not the movie salt so really disappointed	-1
that it was the movie it was only a clip an run for only a few seconds and ended quick	-1
There was a lot of action , as well as twist and turns . Angelina Jolie is a tough ass , as usual , but while salt was definitely entertaining to watch , the storyline was a dry , done , and out-dated . I mean Russian spies in 2010 ? ! ? Come on ... It left a lot to be desired .	-1
Folks , there are no aliens . *Nobody* saw any aliens before the 1930 's . I believe Guy Ballard on Mount Shasta was the first . Why the 1930 's ? Why in the United States ? Because of SCYFY PULP MAGAZINES , that 's why . Sure , people have seen strange stuff since time immemorial , but nobody specifically saw `` aliens '' until the 1930's.Why do n't the aliens tell us anything terribly important which we do n't already know ? When people were afraid of a thermonuclear war , the aliens warned us about ... surprise ... the perils of the A-bomb . Thank you . When people began to worry about environmental destruction , the aliens started to sound like Al Gore . When Barack Obama was president , a particular alien faction revealed that *he* ( Obama ) was an alien . Yet , during the primary elections , when Obama was just one of several candidates , the aliens were silent ... And , good people , if the aliens are so damn sophisticated , WHY DO THEIR SAUCERS ALWAYS CRASH ? HA HA HA.But OK , I admit that none of the above definitely *disproves* the existence of 57 breeds of aliens , visiting Terra for no better reason than mutilate some cows , drop a Bigfoot off in Pennsylvania , or make a fool out of Jimmy Carter . Planet Earth *could* be the fun house of the Galaxy.I mean , it certainly LOOKS like it ! : -D	-1
I feel compelled to watch it because it is so bad . The theories have more holes than swiss cheese and the & # 34 ; authorities & # 34 ; have no credentials whatsoever . It is like the campiest thing ever filmed .	-1
I love alien stories , as I love all things science fiction.This is just stupid , though . If we made a drinking game centered around the words & # 34 ; ancient energy & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; gateway , & # 34 ; this show might have some value .	-1
This is quite a departure for what we used to know as History Channel programming . I am open to new ideas , but this series often goes so far off the deep end as to be unwatchable .	-1
I was really disappointed in the 3 shows i watched in this series . It was totally all speculation , made up scenarios that did not even make sense . I gave it 1star only because you can learn a little about some cultures and their history somewhat . Though I did not like it , it is free with your prime account . Perhaps take a look for yourself and decide ... .	-1
I love Dr. Who and I really am an avid anime fan , I tried this on a whim but the stop motion choppiness and the audio matching was just too horrible . If someone were to fix the animation it might be fine but the hole is too big as it is now . Now to mention the quick wrap up of the plot line , it was extremely rough holding it together in parts and the ending was just too rushed . Perhaps this is a nice experiment ? I say keep experimenting , this could have some potential , but you need to get better from here , just a quick point or no-one is going to watch further episodes .	-1
I may sound harsh during this brief review , but I feel that this show does not deserve praise in any way . I watched the first 2 episodes and was bored the entire time . Well , I was n't bored , because I was laughing at the terrible dialogue . Kids should n't even watch this . It would rot their brains . It is that stupid.That said , the show has some funny moments and a few good characters . I question why someone would act the way they do in this show , but if you overlook the bad acting and terrible writing , it has some small hint of merit . It has an interesting theme , which is a British private school with lots of mysterious disappearances . They could have explored the disappearances from a more scary or eerie perspective , but the writers apparently do not want to freak out the kids . Give kids more credit ! My 13-year-old brother has watched horror flicks all his life . He would never watch this show.Now , I must admit that I was tempted to just skip a few episodes and go straight to the end of the first season . It may be one of those shows that gets better in later seasons . I honestly have no idea , because I lost interest after 2 horrible episodes .	-1
I just can not get into this ! I thought it would be as funny as the Simpsons and Family Guy but I just could n't get into it .	-1
I SAW this lame movie in pre-screen in HD-MOVIESBah , where to begin ? The film starts off strong with a good scary set up , but the story of mass disappearances of people when they are in darkness goes nowhere . We waited all 90 minutes for some explanation ; even some guesses by the remaining few who have found one another , but none came . The characters are completely uninspired and even when they learn that they will die if it goes dark , they dont take even the most basic steps to survive ( candles ? gas lamps ? ) . Frustrating , as this could have been an interesting movie , even scary , but its as if the writer & director had an idea for a piece of a movie , but never developed the plot . Its ninety minutes of whispers I exist and dark shadow creeping up on people to take them away and pretty much nothing else . i recommend as just STUPID & WASTED MY TIME ! ! ! ! ! D	-1
The only Horror thing about this movie is the story-line and meaningless vapid plot , that takes you no where in the slowest cadence ever struck ! I ca n't believe Leguzamo would agree to appear in this bomb !	-1
I initially watched this movie because the general storyline seemed to hold some promise . Once started I continued to watch the movie hoping that eventually something would happen that would pull it all together ; I was , however , doomed to disappointment as nothing ever came to its rescue . The movie just plods along with darkness threatening and people disappearing with no effort at an explanation or resolution.It has an interesting premise where people disappear and leave clothes , shoes , glasses , jewelry and false teeth behind but the implementation of that premise is a sorry disappointment , the devil is in the details . One keeps hoping that some sort of reason will be revealed but that never happens . The problem , whatever it might be , involves not only 7th Street but all of Detroit.As a Christian I see the resemblance to the Christian doctrine of the Rapture of the Church but whereas this doctrine has a cause and an explanation and is fundamentally good ; the disappearance of those in the movie is never explained and is represented as fearful , threatening and evil.When the movie stops the story is continuing but the movie is n't ; that 's sort of a relief really , one has the feeling whew , it 's finally over . This is definitely one I suggest watching before you buy ; I 'm quite sure I 'll never watch it again .	-1
Vanishing on 7th Street 's trailer looked decent enough . Unfortunately , that 's ALL it had going for it . I have stated many times before that the audience in ANY horror/thriller movie sometimes is asked to suspend logic , but I think ANY audience deserves a few answers -- even fleeting ones . None exist in this movie.It begins with four different main characters coming to the realization that they may be the only people left in this City because everyone else has vanished . All that is left behind are piles of clothing . That brought me to question one : why did they survive ? They then spend a good amount of time stumbling and mumbling through various and sundry situations , which brings me to question 2 : was this the ONLY city that had experienced a `` vanishing '' ? You are then treated to more and more scenes of utter stupidity and the constant chanting of `` I exist ; I exist '' until they all start to be picked off by the `` shadow people . '' This led me to my next set of questions : why could n't they find some generators at a local store and have all the lights they wanted ? Why could n't they light ( and keep lit ) a fire ? Why did they STAY in that City ? And last ( but certainly not least ) WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME ? Other reviewers have hinted at this movie 's potential . I 'm just not sure that it ever HAD any potential . I did n't really care for the majority of the survivors and they all continued to make such stupid , moronic choices I was actually rooting for the shadows ! Rated R for , hmmmmm , I do n't know what for .	-1
I tried to like this movie but I just could not totally get into it . It had a nice premise for a story but 99.99 % of all of the people vanish at the start of the movie . You are left with 4 or 5 characters that typically do stupid things to protect themselves and the one who is the most on the ball is a little girl who appears in the movie for 5 minutes.This post-apocalyptic movie could be more scary but is totally filmed in the dark they saved a lot on special effects and actors . No electricity worked , batteries failed , no cars worked , and the remaining characters do the typical dumb stuff like not seeking out a more viable light source to protect them.The plot is weak and does n't develop as the characters have no idea what has caused this mass ending of the human race . There is no sense of possible rescue and the movie just ends strangely . It could have been scarier with a better sound track and some more shocking flashes that make people jump , but they were not there.I almost gave this movie a 3 until the ending and then my opinion faded like the lights in the movie .	-1
The time I spent watching this movie that I could have spent doing something else . It actually takes real effort to make a movie this bad . First and foremost this movie is mainly about a backup generator and how long it can stay running . Apparently that 's the best plot this movie has to offer . There 's also a locked room ( that 's the sub plot ) but maybe they are saving that for the next movie because no one ever bothers to find out what 's behind the door.Other than than you have a bunch of people running away from shadows and looking for flashlights that work . You think that with an entire city gone they could have stopped by Radio shack and got a cart full of flashlights and batteries to haul around . Maybe even stopped by Sears and got a new generator ? If all else failed the least they could do is stop at the supermarket and get some matches and lawn torches . Sadly hour main characters are n't that bright . Probably the worse survival group in this history of survival horror ( I think that 's what this was trying to be ) *spoiler here* no wonder none of them survive.The monsters in this movie are shadows . They were creepy for about the first 5 minutes than after that just plain boring . No scares , or real sense of danger to be found in this movie . Only if your afraid of your own shadow than maybe just maybe . For some reason I remember another movie about people running around trying to find lights to keep on so they did n't vanish in the dark . I forget what it was called but it was n't that old . That movie was a yawner as well ( probably why I forgot it ) . I know this movie will soon `` vanish '' from my mind because there is n't anything worth remembering from it other than I need to pick up some batteries just in case the power goes out . Last time the power went out I had to bump around in the dark looking for matches and luckily I found some old birthday candles.This movie was such a waste of time it should have never been made . The characters are pointless , the movie has no plot , it never goes anywhere , it carries on to long , and nothing about what 's taking place is explained . I 'm all for these weird sci-fi no explanation movies but if you 're going to do them at least do it right like War of the Worlds . Throw in some action , and controversy to skip over the fact that no one knows why the creatures are there or where they come from really.This movie is a fantastic waste of time ! Ca n't imagine anyone owning or at least even bothering to watch this more than once unless they are trying to use it as a sleep aid .	-1
VANISHING ON 7TH STREET is a dark , dreary look at what transpires after an enigmatic catastophic event that has unexplicably resulted in the vanishing of all forms of life -- and not just on 7th street.As expected , there are five survivors : a young TV anchorman , a distraught mother , a teenage boy whose vanished mom runs the cafe where most of the action occurs , a lonely movie projectionist and a mysterious little girl . And lots of menacing shadows and whispering voices . Early on , we 're given hints of the lost colony of Roanoke ; `` dark matter '' and the approach of a strange storm . Are any of these responsible for the vanishing ? We do n't really find out -- that lack of resolution annoys me -- I 'd like SOME kind of resolution.Director Brad Anderson ( THE MACHINIST , SESSION 9 ) evinces some minor atmospheric chills but not much true terror . The cast is adequate : Hayden Christensen is a stalwart hero ; Thandie Newton is strong as the mother ; Jacob Latimore is a fresh change from the usual badass streetwise teen , but John Leguizamo 's surprisingly good in his low-level performance . Similar territory is covered in the lamentable THE HAPPENING , but at least they offered `` SOMETHING '' as a reason for the occurrences , albeit pretty lame.Ultimately , the movie never catches fire and seems longer than it is .	-1
This movie is take of the Roanoke Colony disappearance from American colonial history . Meant to be a horror movie , I did not find this movie scary in the least bit . In fact , the essence of the story ; i.e . shadows stealing people away , is quite ridiculous . Add to that is a lot of bad acting from all the adult actors and actresses and we have a movie that flopped at both the theaters and on DVD . Stay away viewers .	-1
This movie could have been great if they had more production money . The actors probably took 80 % of the budget . They kind of set the movie up in the first few minutes with a book title about Dark Matter and the disappearance of the Lost Colony then it was like the Energizer Bunny it just kept going and going with no real plot development after that . Was it extraterrestrials controlling dark matter ? Was it a supernatural force like vampires or aliens that are sensitive to all forms of light and discovered how to make it dark so they could swoop down and take their prey ? Was the dark sentient and literally consumed people to survive ? Was this the end or the beginning of the end ? Was this just a way for the producer to make a quick buck ( it bombed worldwide ) without much substance ? Was this a waste of 92 minutes ? Tune in for the sequel . OK folks you can breathe now there is no sequel planned..at least not yet ! ! !	-1
vanishing on 7th street is on of the worst movies I 've forced myself to set through in YEARS ... ... .. it starts slow and strange , moves in bits & spurts and ends terrible with two young kids riding a horse to their death ... ... ... ... .. I guess they 're suppose to be the last two people on earth	-1
Vanishing On 7th Street had a lot of possibilities , but it was done so narrow-mindedly , that the film just becomes a complete waste of time . First , we are rushed into the heart of the story , without any background or character development . Then , within twenty minutes , we 're thrown ahead three days , leaving us with many questions that are never answered . Finally , after an hour of typical frantic people stuck in an impossible situation , we get an ending that just does n't fit . I was attracted to this film by its clever title and by Hayden Christensen , who I believe to be a very underrated actor , but I was highly disappointed . Vanishing On 7th Street is rushed , sloppy , predictable , and full of plot holes . To me this seemed more like a rough draft than a full length feature film , it really just was n't very good .	-1
How can you run from the dark ? After waking up to an empty city Luke ( Christensen ) and a small group of survivors try to find a way to escape . When they realize the darkness is what is causing the vanishings can they find enough light to survive ? Based on the previews I had pretty high expectations for this movie , it was very slow moving . The idea was pretty creepy , and it is tons better then `` The Happening '' , although the story line was pretty similar . This movie seems like a really good `` Twilight Zone '' episode , but it does n't really work as a full length movie . It gets repeatitive pretty quick . It begins as a pretty scary movie , but runs out of steam quick and begins to drag . This is not a bad movie at all , but after the `` last man on earth '' type movies like `` I Am Legend '' this one does n't really compare . Much , much better then `` The Happening '' , but not one to rush out and see . I give it a C.Would I watch again ? - Probebly not . *Also try - Skyline & The Happening	-1
This is a review for Video on Demand . This , in no way , is meant to say that the service is lacking . It is a great one . this is reviewing the movie.In the city , strange things are taking place . At first it seems like nothing more than some shadow play and a bit of urban migration , but that turns to panick as the numbers go up . Overnight , people literally leave their homes and vanish , taking nothing . As the mystery here deepens , so too do the reasons to why this is taking place.When I first saw this advertised in the pages fof Fangoria , I was immediately shopping for a venue to watch it . That was a couple of weeks ago and I should have written a review then , perhaps saving some people money . I apologize for that but I normally do not do the negative route . Still , this is a terrible way to fleece peolple with a good idea and terrible execution.What you have here is a tale of two proverbial cities , with one going off greatly in the storyline department and then taking a sudden turn and going down boring Street . I know - I have been there before and recognized the signs . I watched it with two other people as well , and they concurred . A lot of things went wrong and made this awful.You start with people going away in a weird way and people asking why . The main actors hang in there through this , and it all seems good . Then you have some of the scenes that try to keep people out of the shadows , some that made it seem as though the world is really hard to understand , and even when the vanishings start to make sense it hurts to watch it progress . The writers are at fault in a lot of this , and the direction hurts as well . What you have is an `` o no , avoid that shadow '' story mingling with a really boring output from the actors . Overacting is a theme as well as trying to make you scared of the nothing that is really not menacing , and it gets old fast . Really fast.I wish I could say something better but , in the end , I do n't know how . What I do know is that you should not et this and , for 10 bucks , you should heed all the warnings out there . This is about a 1.5 , with the .5 coming from the beginning . Hopefully that says something aobut it , and hopefully you feel safe and avoid it.It is n't the dark you should be afraid of , after all . It is a movie about it .	-1
[ The review contains minor spoilers . ] '' Vanishing on 7th Street '' starts with a bang and slowly descends into something dull and formulaic . The thriller drama ( directed by Brad Anderson , much better `` The Machinist '' ) begins with a great premise , building up the tension in the first fifteen minutes until it suddenly loses steam , having nothing new or interesting to add to the thin story that goes nowhere.The opening sequence is just brilliant . Paul ( understated and effective John Leguizamo ) is a projectionist working at a packed Detroit theater . Then , suddenly the light fails . The next moment Paul finds himself alone ( well , almost ) in the silent theater - everyone is gone , perhaps everyone in the entire city . The fact is , Paul - and a news reporter Luke ( Hayden Christensen ) , a therapist Rosemary ( Thandie Newton ) and a young boy named James ( Jacob Latimore ) - are among the `` survivors '' of the mysterious blackout.In this kind of suspense ( like `` The Birds '' ) you do n't have to explain everything , as long as you can keep the viewers interested in what is going on . Unfortunately this does not happen in `` Vanishing on 7th Street . '' Information is given bit by bit - long nights , a man in Chicago , the Roanoke Colony , and most importantly , rules for survival - but they add up to nothing . Characters attempt to theorize about the meaning of total `` wipeout , '' but what they talk about is just dull . Some ideas are directly borrowed from other apocalyptic horror movies . An airplane scene from Kiyoshi Kurosawa 's `` Pulse , '' one of possible inspiration , is just one of them . `` Vanishing on 7th Street '' starts well , but fails to live up to its initial promise .	-1
Normally I have an appreciation for ID type television but this one just is not for me.I managed to sit through the first episode -- but only after trying to watch it three or four times.I sat through the second one -- but ( I am glad ) the same thoughts kept coming to me ... Namely that , despite the disclaimer at the beginning , there is something `` unclean '' about this production ( or just about me -- watching it ) . I am always left with thoughts of , `` How can the family/friends watch this when there are so many depictions of the blood of their loved ones ? How would I , COULD I do it ? ? ? `` Furthermore , as someone who has an active imagination ( and tries to be careful in what I watch/view ) , the style of voyeurism I pick up in watching this , is disturbing as I begin to wonder if people who DO appreciate murder , sorrow , pain , etc . ( and we should not kid ourselves -- our nation is subconsciously becoming increasing enamored with killing ) are lapping up the feast that ( perhaps unknowingly ) has been set before them.All in all , what I watched just `` feeled '' like entertainment ... But who ( except the weak ) want to be entertained on the suffering of real people ? ? And what does it say about us ( as individuals ) if we do ? ? ? So ... I just can't.And I am glad .	-1
Trite , disrespectful . Dishonors the dead and the people involved and affected by death ... including the audience . From the first minutes it 's as if we were watching an episode of Desperate Housewives where murder is a joke . We all deserved to seen life treated with reverence and value . Shame on whoever presented this disgrace , must be a sociopath . A death is not merely an inconvenience in an otherwise sunny day . The question is not , will the cop ever be able to have his anniversary dinner with his wife . The folks involved in the show should be ashamed but they must be clueless to do this .	-1
The other reviewer of this show said it perfect ; Sarah Shahi gets to 'shine ' in this show as opposed to her rather 'dour ' character presentation in her cop show `` Life '' . And her 'shine ' is awesome -- she is gorgeous , sexy and has a spunky character to work with , but ... the show seems to say `` Mediation '' is the second coming and that just did n't 'win ' me over . Sarah 's relationship with her ex-husband the DA is ok and I like how she interacts with the other characters in her short skirts but the 'meat ' of the program that Mediation results in a 'win , win ' situation for folks headed to Court with lawyers is just not that interesting or believeable . So I found Sarah a '10 ' and hope she finds another series that matches her dazzling beauty and personality , but I found this show just too 'dumb ' and 'light ' to continue watching after about 6 episodes . And for some reason , I got this show at Target a month ago 6 weeks before you could buy it on Amazon .	-1
The premis sounded great but after a couple of episodes , I found that I did not care for the main character . She was too pushy and manipulative . I found all of the family drama a bit overboard .	-1
I am a Drop Dead Diva fan . I also enjoyed Legally Blonde . This however , I could have slept through . Even at free , it was n't really worth the time .	-1
Raw ... not what I expected . I was surprised this was accessible by anyone . I am not a prude but was offended .	-1
Ca n't figure out how this show made it into seson 3 . Stupid , stupid , stupid . This show deserves no more attention	-1
I wo n't watch this or any other series from Sy Fy until they come out complete on DVD . SyFy is unreliable . They get you hooked and cancel . They move their series all over on different nights and even different seasons . You will watch a few short episodes before the series will take a long break after which you will have no idea if the series is going to continue ... .The network was once my favorite . Now I consider it the worst network on Television . Other networks produce far better programming that can be called Sci Fi than the channel that once had it 's name.Pathetic.So , I do not advise anyone to watch any programs produced by SyFy . Apparently they have no way to tell who is watching their programs online and must only get their numbers from broadcast/cable numbers . They do n't have a clue and unless they undergo a radical shake up in their upper management and program direction posistions , I know more like myself who will not be bothering with this network .	-1
campy and often juvenile . actors are not believable . storyline is foolish and overplayed , could not get beyond a few episodes .	-1
I 've been an avid fan of the BBC show Being Human for several years now . I love it , love the actors and acting and feel it is a great show . It was with some trepidation that I finally decided to watch the U.S. version . Needless to say I was underwhelmed . I already think it 's weird and more than a little creepy that apparently there is so little original material floating around on TV and at the movies that anything that reeks of any success is snatched up and copied over and over again ad nauseum . I hate the word `` reboot '' for anything but computers and this TV show , which I dub a complete ripoff is no exception.Yes , they do n't exactly copy the BBC version but there 's still plenty of similar enough plot lines for me to wonder about the ethics of whoever is writing the show . Ca n't come up with something original ? Fine , watch the U.K. version then alter the plot lines a bit , rename the characters and call it a brand-new endeavor . Riiight . And part of what I love about the U.K. version is that the people actually look like real people , men and women that I know and would actually talk to -- even the pretty and handsome ones . In short , they 're real people and I love that since it gives the show an added depth of reality that keeps one believing in the plot no matter how outlandish it gets . The US . version however again gives us Ken and Barbie Doll perfection with people who look like mannequins grabbed off a runway from Paris or Italy . Honestly they could slap those same characters into an episode of Beverly Hills 90210 or The OC or Dawson 's Creek and no one would even notice the difference . Whereas if George , Nina , Annie , Tom or Mitchell found themselves on one of those shows the first words out their mouths would likely be , `` Bloody hell , what 's all this nonsense ? Do you people even know how to hoover let alone stake a vampire who 's trying to kill your mates ? `` Where the U.K. version actually manages to say something intelligent about the human condition in all its facets and at the same time pack in some very funny , touching clever little moments the U.S. version is just another pale bloodless version of pretty people with problems -- or in this case pretty supernatural people with problems . And that 's never been done before now has it . ( Sarcasm intended )	-1
The American Being Human is n't nearly as good as the British version . The writing is similar , but `` cheesier '' . The acting is not as good . The British actors were more authentic and fit their parts better.This is not just because I saw the British version first -- the American version is lame .	-1
we laughed , a little , at first , but it just isnt Danny DeVito , rolling in your seat funny . it is a little funny and thats it .	-1
The egg and I would have done better . here is a nerd who obviously wants to be a murder dog . ( give me a break ) With his ingrating voice and his nerdy ways giving us a blow by blow of his own mother ? How sick can you get ? ? ? A voice man might have made this fly . Did this man view this before putting it out ? Did anyone advice him to hire an actor with a good voice to do the narration ? Guess not or he thought he was this sexy detective type . Grand elushions a n't the word .	-1
Look up Bubble Guppies in Webster 's and it will say & # 34 ; See also : unwatchable ... & # 34 ; The writers are obviously from either Colorado or Washington and too stoned to get a story together .	-1
My two year old daughter really likes this show , but I find it hard to watch with her . There are plenty of better options out there that are both entertaining and educational . ( Sesame Street , Curious George , Caillou , the Leapfrog series )	-1
I thought this was a series of movies not the actual show . This was a mistake I was expecting a movie .	-1
I think there may be some value here . I did n't watch it to the end because of the strength of the tension in the show ... . not for me .	-1
There are other movies you can waste your time and this one would still be a looser . A typical end of humanity world that is based on some distant future to our own . Gets convoluted .	-1
I can not even begin to explain how bad this was , but I will try to explain.The movie began with a LONG , LONG , LONG monologue about the origin of the Nephilim species , one word & # 34 ; Neanderthals & # 34 ; . A human-nephilim war breaks out ( atom bomb style ) , and humans forget all of their advancements . The Nephilim do not , and we worship them as Gods ( with mandatory shots of Egyptian pyramids ) . The Nazis rediscover all of the lost advancements , and humans are a violent and imaginative race , and we come to the attention of the nephilim again.So finally , we get a shot of fighting ( space ships in the sky firing down on building with big explosions ) . It looked like a cartoon with no people , but hey , this was obviously low budget . We have a bad cast with a few more poorly done shots of the captain , the only human besides the breeder woman . They breed . He dies . All humans/hybrids are dead with the exception of the pregnant breeder and her teddy bear filled with DNA , and the five pod kids we never see . A few shots of nephilim killing . The movie is over with a final spiel that the woman , who did n't know she was a machine , just wanted to be loved.It was so bad that I almost did n't review it .	-1
I 've really got nothing good to say but since I have to fill this space with something I 'll just reiterate that I have nothing good to say about this at all . Good luck to those of you that partake .	-1
After viewing the amazing series , `` The Killing '' I was looking for an extended series that would have the same level of realism and intensity , the same depth of character and plot . This series was recommended and foolishly , I bought the series without watching the pilot.This is crime drama at it 's worst . The characters are such stereotypes it 's almost laughable . The lines predictable and delivered with all the skill of a 4th grade school play cast.There 's as much grit and realism as Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood without the catchy title song . It 's not as much about the money I wasted as the two hours it took me to view 1/2 hour of the pilot . The only plus is for Jennifer Beals first class mortuary make up job . She almost looks like herself ... ...	-1
I really tried to get into this one but it just was n't for me . I did n't think the writing or acting was bad or anything like that , but it just was n't for me .	-1
While I liked the show , I did n't like the people in it and that made it uncomfortable to watch it .	-1
Its like in the 70 's when short movies by unknown homedirectors started to come out ... all associated with the films think their movieis great caused its so different but i always saw them as wan na be home movies.this is a quality wan na be ... .some will love it cause its different and more willlike it cause it does'nt follow the same protocol as most movies today.The only good thing about the version i bought is the 3d cover on the dvd.Instead of CGI to give the Tire better life , all we get is good angles at rollingaround and the tire shakes when it gets mad ... and ... Bottom Line ... Boring . Eventhe exploding heads cant save this DVD.Use as coaster after view .	-1
this was an odd movie , it was okay not one of the best films i 've seen magnet did better with Black Death . when i saw the trailer to this i thought what the hell i 'll try it . and it was horrible . i did not understand the motive to this film at all . except that there is a killer tire . it was weird i 'll give you that if the director was aiming for that he did a good job . but all in all i wo n't see it again . if you have not seen this movie i recommend that you do n't	-1
I understand the existential concept of this movie . That 's not the problem with it . The problem is simple , while concepually it has merit , the whole thing is so slow and boring that it was next to impossible to sit through . The film appears to have been made by people who were sleeping through it , from the mystery woman , who was stupid enough to leave her motel room door wide open while she was showering ... a cruddy motel too no less to the Greek chorus watching the tire villain . The film plods along like an 18 wheeler goin through the gears . I 'll never watch it again and that 's for sure . It was a waste of 1.5 hours of my life .	-1
On one hand , the editing and the cinematography ( by Quentin Dupieux ) are fabulous . On the other hand , the screenplay and the direction ( by Quentin Dupieux ) are dreadful . Someone should have been fired.This is a movie about a gimmick , played as a gimmick , that does n't succeed because it is a gimmick that 's stretched to its limits and beyond . Once the premise is set down there 's nowhere for this movie to go . It 's a joke that tells you it 's a joke . In fact , it informs you of this straight off and just in case you `` did n't get it , '' they repeat the explanation during the closing credits . It 's been my experience that if something has to be identified as a joke and you do n't laugh , repeating it as such is n't going to help.The best parts of this movie involve the tire ( Robert ) on its own . The worst parts are when they involve people through a faux audience watching the proceedings and commenting on what they 're watching , and a squad of police trying to stop the tire from its reign of terror . It 's sad to say , but the tire gives the best and most realistic performance .	-1
In a world full of ironic comedies ( Repo Man , etc ... . ) This one was just too much . I get it did n't care about anything beyond the entertainment , but it was not entertaining .	-1
If you 're going to parody American horror films there are only three requirements : be funny , cover a variety of situations , and keep the pace up . This mostly fails on every count . The `` audience '' gorging themselves on poison is too literal . The main characters are far too bland . Insomniacs should buy it : watching this tire roll is very sleep-inducing .	-1
RUBBER tells the story of an abandoned tire that abruptly comes to life . Not only that , but this tire has the ability to kill with the power of its `` mind . '' There is NO reason that this tire comes to life , nor is there a reason it has homicidal tendencies . It just does . In fact , the conceit of this movie is so random that we are told ( literally told ) that the movie is an `` homage to no reason . '' And it certainly is.The idea of the film is undeniably amusing . That someone even came up with the idea is worth applauding . And the method in which the story is told and the film is crafted is undeniably amusing . Writer/director Quentin Dupieux has made a film that is bit more theatre-of-the-absurd than it is a horror movie . The main character ( a sheriff played by Stephen Spinella , a great stage actor who looks just a little surprised to be in this film ) frequently talks to the audience , and the `` audience '' is a character too . Randomness is the order of the day , thus virtually no character behaves in predictable ways.RUBBER is a terrific 40 minute movie . Sadly , the movie is actually 80+ minutes , so it is a shaggy dog joke that quickly wears out its welcome . The natural lengthy of this amusing but slight concept is stretched past the breaking point by either a ) too much effort to be clever , which finally comes off as just TOO random or b ) endless shots of the tire rolling across the desert . Not surprisingly , the tire has little personality and little it can do beyond roll or stand still ... and watching it do these 2 things is not terribly exciting ( I was amused when the tire took a deliberate dip in a swimming pool ) .The film , which I watched on blu-ray , has some lovely desert scenery . But other than Spinella , it has a Grade-Z cast , which might be okay in a straight horror movie , but here it just adds to the level of oddness . The film is a joke on the audience , but with this cast , it also appears to be a joke on the performers , who have no sense of motivation or purpose . `` Just say the oh-so-clever lines ... do n't worry about why . `` If you 're in the mood for a strange but exciting , bloody , gory or scary movie ... RUBBER is NOT it . If you are in the mood for one of the flat-out oddest films around , you might want to check it out . But I warned you ... it 's a fun idea in search of far better pace and execution and just a bit more logic .	-1
I usual enjoy movies with Uma Thurman but Ceremony tried to be a romantic comedy yet failed . The tempo was slow and the actors mediocre . Ceremony is simply a movie not worth watching . I 'm glad I did n't spend the extra money to purchase this movie . I would n't watch it again and would n't recommend to anyone .	-1
Thought I would pull through it but dumb got dumber with the actors and the plot . Once liked the actors now I think they had and off day or off plot	-1
This indi-film opened recently with a thud , and is now available on disc . I 'm not sure what has happened to Uma Thurman 's career but this adds to a list of her clunkers . The set up is n't a creative one . Twenty three year old geeky children 's book author Sam Davis ( Michael Angarano ) is n't having much success and he 's recently dumped by the statuesque Zoe ( Thurman ) . Now right there we have a problem . Sam is about 5 foot nothing and Zoe is about a foot taller , not to mention well on her way to 40 . Do n't get me wrong , the problem is n't there physical differences , it 's that there is no chemistry or attraction for the audience . Sam and his best friend Marshall ( Reece Daniel Thompson ) decide to get away to rekindle their bromance ( strictly hetero ) . They run into Zoe who is about to get married on the beach . Foolishness ensues . The film 's not sexy or funny so what 's the point ?	-1
But not good , either . I was expecting a romantic COMEDY as the description stated , but there is nothing funny about this movie . I guess the story line is n't too terrible , but really it 's rather sad . I would give it 0 stars , except that it 's unpredictable , which is good in a romantic type movie . Other than that , I have nothing good to say about it .	-1
This program is ridiculous ! Are employees and CEOs really that stupid ? I am sure the employees are hand picked to insure they tow the company line . How can that many employees have such sad sob story lives ? This program is just an infomercial for businesses that treat their employees poorly .	-1
I did n't watch very much as the subject of someone drowning in a trunk of a car made my claustrophobia scream . If that does not bother you it would be a good show ...	-1
I am no longer interested in watching TV dramas that victimize women and children . If this is the only story the producers have to tell , I 'm not going to give it a good rating .	-1
I wo n't `` spoil '' the series for anyone who has n't watched , but it promised a lot , and delivered only a little . Very disappointed . It 's going to take a lot for me to watch next season , especially if I have to pay for some of the episodes .	-1
There is practically nothing I could add to the other 1 star reviews - other people already said every single word I wanted to say about this show.In short , not to waste somebody 's else time like mine was wasted by those series : awfully slow , boring , a really dumb set of characters , truly inept plot twists.I watched with my finger on the fastforward button for the second half of the 1 season - does not look I missed anything considering that nothing happens for about 75 % of the time.The pilot was good and I had such hopes for that show.. well , those went the way of many hopes . Total waste of time , these series .	-1
Be aware , when you start watching the first season , you will not find out who did it . There is an episode of padding thrown in , instead of a resolution . I understand that season 2 will not show a resolution until the end of the season . I resent this type of manipulation of the audience . Starting a new mystery , before the end of the first one , would have been acceptable to me , but not drawing out the ending for so long . I will not be watching season 2 .	-1
I 'd like to say that this TV series had something going for it other than Mireille Enos ' winning smile , a nice sound track , and some pretty good photography . But those three qualities could not compensate for the astonishingly bad script , the relentless over-acting , and producers who had no idea where they were . This was Seattle , for godssake - not LA , not Chicago , not Philly - SEATTLE.The plot was stolen from Twin Peaks . There is a murder , and in the course of solving it the sordid underbelly of the entire town - its intrigues , its nasty secrets , its dirty laundry - is revealed . But unlike Twin Peaks , which had a sense of humor , The Killing takes itself seriously ... which was a mistake . ( I confess I did laugh at times , but it was n't a jolly laugh . ) You just ca n't have that much stupidity on screen without making your story ludicrous.And , boy , was this show ludicrous . Here are some highlights : cops run a plate but do n't know that the vehicle has been reported stolen , to interview a bus driver , cops have to get on a bus and ride around on it all day ( Hello ? The employer is the city , which has employee records ) , a former hit man for the Polish mafia has no police records because it was `` a long time ago '' ( like before the printing press was invented ) , the hit man takes revenge for his daughter 's murder based on a positive ID of his daughter 's shirt made by his incredibly , incredibly stupid wife , and so it goes , on and on , stupidity after stupidity . And to make up for the fact that the writing was abysmal ( what white guy ever refers to another white person as having a skinny `` white ass '' ) they stuffed each episode with so many red herrings you could smell them all the way to Denmark.At this point , I simply can not bear to watch any more . My son said he could n't make it past the pilot . I should have listened to him .	-1
It is riddled with detail . It was hard to seperate the wheat from the chaff ; intrigue that added up to a crime from chaff . Naturally since this drama can not focus , neither does it have any pace .	-1
If you 're looking to watch a action packed , thriller/mystery , this is not the show for you . The story line in this series is painfully slow and lacks the intrigue of most new shows of similar genre . If you do attempt to push through a show or two be fully prepared for the over the top characterization of the main detective and her new to homicide partner . It 's a cliche show with little to no creativity.I 'll usually make it through a full episode or two with little to no distraction , but found myself doing other things around the house while it was playing in the background . This show 's truly not worth your time .	-1
2012 : Apocalypse of the Dead ( a.k.a . Zone of the Dead ) is one of those flicks that is so horribly bad , it 's good . In a way , you almost have to laud the commitment and conviction presented by the filmmakers because it takes those traits to follow thru with ( let 's just call it ) their `` vision . '' Anyway , a good time was had at the movies by me and my snarky homies.But it 's not a good time to be in Pancevo , Serbia , not tonight . Pancevo is reputed to be the most toxic city in all of Europe . Legendary Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes ( Ken Foree ) and rookie agent Mina Milius ( Kristina Klebe ) are the principals in overseeing a prisoner transfer of which route will take them to Belgrave and then London . Did your eyes roll , like mine did , when Reyes reassured a nervous Mina : `` If ever there was an easy assignment , this is it . '' Oboy.But before they get to easy street , they have to pass thru Pancevo , just in time for that unnatural chemical leak at the railroad track and the resulting zombie outbreak . Cornered by zombie hordes , desperate to survive , the agents join forces with their enigmatic prisoner ( Emilio Roso ) who seems to be more in the loop about what the ef is going on with the walking dead.Later , the group crosses paths with a sniveling reporter and a berserker soldier ( fresh out the nunnery ) who spouts doomsday propaganda . Weird ? Surreal ? Creepy ? Offputting ? Yes . This crazed warrior would go on to say ( with gusto ) things like : `` Smells like the end of days . `` Oh , where to start , where to start ? I 'm tempted to give this a higher rating , only because I had ba11s of fun . But I wo n't . This is the first ever Serbian zombie movie , so congratulations , but it 's crap . The production is so low budget I suspect my 6-year-old niece was the money behind it . The acting - I 'm not sure if the English was dubbed for the Serbs or if the Serbian actors spoke their lines phonetically . Theirs is some of the worst delivery of dialogue I 'd ever heard . The intonations , the inflections , are weird . The body language is off . But I do n't want to cut slack on the other cast members who flaunts English as their native tongue . They 're also ridiculous . The entire cast is so wooden no one had better light a match . My main reason for tuning in was to watch Ken Foree , who was so badass in Romero 's seminal Dawn of the Dead ( and maybe the best zombie film of all time ) . Here - and , given , it 's some thirty years later - Foree seems comparatively subdued and worn down.The gorehound elements ? Are weak . The zombie make-up is passable . But there 's not much in the way of authentic scares . The zombie feastings are executed so cheesily . Neither are there memorable zombie kills . What 's more , the zeds ca n't make up their minds whether they 're slow shufflers or fast , hyperactive runners.The film is n't well served by its characters making moronic decisions ( given , most are there to engorge the body count ) . Or by that horrid shaky cam.The positives ? Yes , there are some , other than the happy accident of the film 's sucking so hard , it gets good . Three good things . The Serbian setting is appropriately moody . I liked the nod to Assault on Precinct 13 . The prisoner here is no Napoleon Wilson but he affects some of Napoleon 's cool under pressure and shaky allegiance . The other neat thing is the meta-reference to Dawn of the Dead : - Jan the d0uche reporter : `` Wait , maybe we should find some shopping mall or something . `` - Agent Reyes : `` It 'd be too hard to secure . And believe me , they would get in anyway . `` Best moment in the movie.Parting observations off the top of my head ( and , I guess , a SPOILERS alert ) : - In the midst of fleeing the zeds , folks will insist on having meaningful discussions- snapping necks should n't kill zombies because the brain is n't affected ( but it works in this movie ) - Yes , absolutely , a desk with some chairs on it shoved against the door will keep out the zeds- Until a girl has a panic attack and starts dismantling that desk and chairs because , quote , `` I need to get out ! `` - Lovin ' the prisoner 's dramatic but absolutely unnecessary midair leap while gunning down zeds ( who are still blocked by that desk ) - Living legend , ex-CIA , 20-years-in-the-field , Interpol Agent Mortimer Reyes needs to work on his stance when holding a firearm . Also someone needs to teach him the proper technique for holding a gun and flashlight together.- When the group encounters a bunch of zombies lying prone on the ground ( sunbathing ? ) in almost perfectly spaced order , Agent Reyes opts to walk thru them instead of , say , around them.- A professor decides to check if the area is finally clear of poison gas . How ? By removing his gas mask.- So what happened to that girl who was abandoned at the dock by the creepy reporter ? She gets saved by the prophecy warrior but then we do n't see her anymore.- Stick around for a mid-credits scene to see what happens to the reporter . It 's a lazy nod to the opening sequence of Lucio Fulci 's classic Zombi 2 ( 1979 ) .	-1
Poor original Dawn of the Dead alumni Ken Foree , he deserves so much better than this Z grade zombie flick..complete with old slow style and new fast running style zombies.. I like the genre , but it 's flims like this one that make me never want to watch another . It 's as good as the eastern Europeans trying to fake American English accents.. I would recommend it for a good laugh , but there 's other things to laugh at out there , this was just boring . Here 's just a sample of the type of dialogue that you will get : & # 34 ; This is probably the worst thing that has happened since.. the beginning of civilized world.. and I 'm a part of it , and I do n't have a care..Is n't that sh ! + just great ? .. What is it now , are you angry ? ? & # 34 ; As for the special effects , eh ... ( ( ( ( YAWN ) ) ) )	-1
I did n't like the movie . The acting was lame as was the script . It felt like a wannabe grindhouse gone wrong . There are some one liners said in the movie that were suppose to be funny but fell flat . The plot is that of a simple revenge movie with no surprises ... .spoiler alert ... ... ..if you have n't watched it and want to you may not want to read further ... hobo dies taking out final bad guy . I gave it two stars just for the amount of gore although most is blood splatters but not all .	-1
This movie was just a live-action cartoon that carried no real sense of peril or logic . I guess it was sort of fun , in a way , and Hauer is always worth watching . However , I just found the film to be like many movies that ape the glory days of grindhouse : these new grindhouse films are more like caricatures of the real thing . They lack charm , cohesion , and restraint . I own this movie , it was fun in a shallow , forget-it-ten-seconds-after-it's-over kind of a way , but I really ca n't recommend it as good cinema .	-1
during the reformation , the great schism ignited by martin luther between roman catholicism and the new protestantism of the north , luther compared rome to sodom , and scaled sodom as the runner up ... the war that ensued included every atrocity that could be imagined , such as the impaling of individuals on sharpened tree limbs , roasting them over a slow fire , and slashing open the bellies of pregnant women and flinging their unborn children to ravenous dogs ... in other words , it was a fairly ordinary war ... but i have little taste for such spectacles , and i find it difficult to believe that an actor of rutger 's stature would immerse himself to the ears in a slasher movie that attempts , however futilely , to outrevulse all contenders ... at least the trailer gives fair warning , but the high rating it is accorded by critics who have damned to near death films of real quality , with tedious cavils and faint praises , is entirely outrageous .	-1
I understand what they were going for , and I enjoy 70's/80 's grindhouse stuff , but this is n't it.. Okay , it 's a world gone wild , in all places , Halifax , Nova Scotia ? ? ( renamed scum town ) . My mother would be turning over in her grave . The scenes make absolutely no sense and the extras all seem to know they 're extras , because they ca n't act , especially the ones where the moms are with their kids ; it looked like were out shopping on a Saturday and were instantly begged to be in the movie.. The two sadistic brothers were as intimidating as Corey Haim and Corey Feldman ... This movie is n't fun , campy or witty , it 's sadistic , low budget and completely pointless . I 've seen a lot of bad movies , and most of them were Troma films , but I doubt even they would produce something this horrible .	-1
Non-existent budget , bad acting in a bad way even for this type of movie - I have seen the grindhouse-type movies before and liked them - this was just plain not worth the $ , do n't even bother renting it .	-1
I ignored all the over the top cheesy scenes and horrible horrible acting-but when they torched a bus of children- I had to quit.why are movies like this even made . a complete waste-was n't fun , funny , entertaining or interesting.just total wothless junk .	-1
Another nod to the grindhouse movies and based on a trailer in one of Robert Rodriguez 's grindhouse films . This action exploitation film has over the top horrible people doing above and beyond what you would normally expect . There 's a pedophiliac Santa Claus taking screaming children away in his car while nobody does anything , a corrupt police force that is in on the evil , an evil overlord with two violent sons who murder people wherever they go ( including using a flamethrower on children on a school bus ) . If you can handle the extreme violence there 's a lot of tongue and cheek references and moments that take some of the edge off . Naturally these evil people have it coming when the hobo pulls out his shotgun and goes to town on them all and we 're glad to see it . At times it feels like the scenes are more about the violence and very little about the story . I like to think you can blend both but this does n't always do it . Dialogue is bad in certain place and I am not certain if that was done on purpose as a homage to the old films of the past . Regardless I 've seen better films of said genre and this was way over the top for my tastes . STORY/PLOTTING : C ; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE : C minus to C ; VIOLENCE/EXPLOITATION : B ; WHEN WATCHED : end of of July 2011 ; OVERALL GRADE : C plus .	-1
I was pretty disappointed with what I thought was going to be a fun episode of Robert Rodriguez or Quinton Tarantino style retro-flick . I think that was the idea as this movie was hinted at in one of the `` Grindhouse '' trailers . While it 's nice to see Rutger Hauer again especially with the in-your-face title in hand , the film never gets past the raw carnage and bloody gore of the premise . Hauer is a railcar hopping hobo who stumbles upon a nasty town that for some reason nobody leaves . The population stays in spite of the fact that the police and politicians are controlled by the evil Drake and his 2 equally evil sons . They stay in spite of the fact that it 's acceptable to board a school bus and kill all the kiddies with a flame thrower ... and of course , for no reason . I found the movie pretty stupid without much to recommend .	-1
This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . I love Rutger Hauer , but even his talent is wasted in this totally stupid obnoxious gore fest . I love grindhouse cinema and I love really crazy twisted films , but this one simply left a bad taste in my mouth . I have totally hated every comical and silly troma film I have ever seen , and this film is very much like troma movies . Yet there were some interesting ideas in this film that I sometimes did like . But it got so rediculous and hokey that I simply could n't take it anymore . The movie is just a totally wierd ride that felt sci-fi . Sort of like Mad Max meets Japanese extreme novies . I do n't agree with other who thought it was better than Planet Terror . That movie just seemed to have this classic grindhouse feel to it , while this one just felt cheap and totally silly . I gave this two stars simply because Rutger Hauer deserves some respect for having the balls to even dare to be in this sorry mess of a film .	-1
not worth your time ... were Kennedys so absorbed and lack faithfulness as portrayed . Shame on the Kennedy men ! Poor acting . Could n't get past the first episode	-1
I was very disappointed in this production ; I suppose there are only so many ways to bring to film the events and tragedies of the Kennedy family , before it becomes simply a rehashing of commonly known facts . This in no way compares to the 1983 NBC Miniseries `` The Kennedy 's '' , for one 's money that is DVD to purchase .	-1
I have read extensively about the Kennedys and there was no new information in this series . It only consisted of the general info that is available anywhere . The acting was a bit stale . I am a big Greg Kinear fan , but he was n't impressive either , so all in all , I could n't recommend this series to anyone . And , Katie Holmes was very forgettable as Jackie Kennedy . So , disappointing all the way around . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Originally contracted for a cable network , it contained such massive inaccuracies that the network would n't show it . Seriously , though , Katie Holmes as Jackie Kennedy Onassis ? Greg Kinnear as JFK ? I like Kinnear , he does good light comedy , but that 's not what 's called for here . Do n't waste your time unless your ideology needs support .	-1
Kids like it . From a parents perspective I do n't think it teaches anything positive and is very crude . I actually wish there was a way to block certain shows from the Amazon app is not certain devices . If there were I 'd block this one .	-1
I seriously do not mean to offend anybody who enjoys this cartoon , or anybody responsible for its production . That is the last sort of thing that I would intend to do . I grew up watching SpongeBob SquarePants cartoons , and I was so familiar with the few episodes that were around back at that time that I was able to follow along with the dialogue contained within them . These episodes can still be quite funny , but they are lacking in the charm that helped to achieve spectacular fame for the series and a remarkable fan base . This is not the SpongeBob I remember . Buy the earliest seasons . SpongeBob SquarePants just is n't as loveable as it used to be .	-1
I truly enjoyed the Cheech and Chong movies but , find most that try to use marijuana as the focus fall extremely short of the target . This series does just that , fell short at the starting line ...	-1
I may have chuckled once during this episode ( Amazon Prime only includes the first episode ) .Basically , the episode relies on juvenile bathroom humor . Character development is poor and unless you 're a stoner I doubt you 'll find much redeeming social value in the situation or the characters ' approach to it .	-1
I thought this would be so funny , but I 'd just fall asleep and let my boyfriend watch it . He did n't think it was funny , either . The timing just was n't right , but the premises seemed like they SHOULD have been hilarious .	-1
Only watched a small part of the show but the dialog and content was not the kind that I was interested in .	-1
Do n't care for it but see how many people could like it . Just not into this type of show.they just do n't do anything and keep the stereotype going of the people not striving for anything .	-1
Dumbest series , not funny , cute or smart . Why watch such losers ? This is n't Amazon 's fault ; it 's the producer 's of this lame show .	-1
The show had a good premise , but it was unnecessarily vulgar . I thought it might be a good substitute for the IT Crowd , but I was wrong .	-1
The people on & # 34 ; reality & # 34 ; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television . & # 8203 ;	-1
This show should have been ONE Season only . The writing has become stupid whereas the producers think the public is gulable . For instance , they try to add drama to the scene when they have caught a gator and the hunter puts his hand into the water to pull up the rope . It is supposed to make you uneasy since a gator could bite him . Yet the camera is below his hand ( in the water ) shooting up.When they are wrestling with the caught gator , the people on the boat are yelling out different things to each other , such as : & # 34 ; Watch him ! & # 34 ; OR & # 34 ; Shoot him ! & # 34 ; OR & # 34 ; Oh ... he 's a big one ! & # 34 ; . But when you watch these people , their mouths are NEVER moving . It 's as if these comments are added in later for effect.Personally , I root for the gator .	-1
My Ghost Story is supposed to be a collection of true stories told by the people they happened to . There is nothing very exciting about the filming , special effects , atmosphere . Nothing impressive about the series in my opinion .	-1
I do n't want to say that this movie is snobbish but I 'm having a difficult time trying to see it any other way.Here 's the scoop . It 's set in Manhattan and all involved are upper crust professionals . Knightley is married to Worthington . She 's a freelance writer for magazines and he 's in commercial real estate development . She finds out he has a real hot co-worker ( Eva Mendez ) and is upset because he 's never mentioned her . Sam heads off on a business trip with Eva and another co-worker and while he 's gone Kiera runs into an old flame . Both are tempted and this deals with how they deal with the temptation.I could n't muster any real sympathy for these people . It 's not that I did n't like them but it seemed that there was too little at stake for any of them . All could make a living in their own right . There are no kids involved . None of the relationships have a lot of years attached and none of the relationships are without their blemishes . What if this were set in some blue collar town and the husband and wife were just scraping by and had a lot of concerns in their day to day and some number of young kids in tow ? This I think who mean more to the average viewer . And what is the writer/director saying here in that Worthington crosses the line in a big way where Knightley just tip-toes over the line . She was the one with unfounded fears and jealousies where he never doubted her for a moment ? Is she less guilty than he ? ! This is all very professional . All the acting and production values are top shelf . It 's just that there seemed to be too little gravity to it . Even when Mendez spills her guts it did n't want to hit home . Sorry . I ca n't recommend this .	-1
`` Last Night '' stars four gifted players Guillaume Canet , Keira Knightley , Eva Mendes and Sam Worthington . It also has Peter Deming 's nice , atmospheric photography and Clint Mansell 's mesmerizing score . Largely set in New York , the film has everything that would make a witty and insightful drama about loyalty in marriage , with a realistic look on married life , told in a romantic but not sentimental fashion . Sadly , well-acted as it is , the film lacks something emotional that would draw the viewers into the characters ' world . `` Last Night '' follows the story of married couple Joanna ( Keira Knightley ) and Michael ( Sam Worthington ) living in New York . While Michael is in Philadelphia for a business trip , Alex ( Guillaume Canet ) Joanna 's ex-boyfriend arrives from Paris to meet her . In the meanwhile , Michael in Philadelphia is alone with his co-worker Laura ( Eva Mendes ) , and he is clearly attracted to her.What will they do ? The unpredictable story has some touching moments , but after all , it is very hard for us to care about these characters , especially Sam Worthington 's Michael . His uninteresting character works against the film 's attempt at creating suspenseful romance . Knightley and Canet fare much better , but with barely enough chemistry to make us believe the flimsy back story of the characters they play , their romantic relationship is not very involving . `` Last Night '' is a drama that is sometimes pretentious ( see the ending ) but overall watchable , thanks to the compelling performance from Keira Knightley .	-1
I enjoyed The Sopranos so decided to give this a whirl in order to see if fiction and `` reality '' overlap much . It turns out that this is not only comparing apples to oranges ; it is also like comparing the Mona Lisa ( The Sopranos ) to an avant-garde exhibit that consists of a pile of poop ( Mob Wives ) . I am loathe to review an available season without having watched it in its entirety , but I just could n't get thru many eps of this ... there is only so much dim-witted posturing , backstabbing , lying , and general ugliness that I can handle in any given month ( when not balanced out by creativity and other redeeming qualities , as in a work of fiction ) .From a purely anthropological viewpoint , however , this show has some worth . It provides a small bit of insight into what a blue collar criminal lifestyle can lead to : material wealth , broken families , and a mindset of coming at problems shouting and predisposed to violence . Since Mob Wives is not without context , it also offers perspective on a broader ( societal ) scale . It is , more often than not , a sickening serial to watch , even if you are prone to being entertained by low culture . I estimate that two of the women are of very low intelligence , one is of low intelligence , and one is of low to moderate intelligence . Aside from needing the money , I ca n't imagine why these 4 would have agreed to do this show ( although if I remember correctly , one of them wanted to write a book , so this is obviously good publicity ) . They either are clueless about how pathetic they appear to the rest of us , or they do n't care ( laughing all the way to the bank ) .I skipped ahead to an episode titled `` Dumb or Stupid ? '' ( the producers probably would have liked this to be the name of the show , rather than just one episode ) because I wanted to see how far these women would go against their `` friends '' at a dinner gathering . Unfortunately , a guy on the set intervened before any blood was spilled . Mobsters just are n't what they used to be .	-1
no story line . not enlightening about life within the & # 34 ; family. & # 34 ; presenttion of women who probably as street as their husbands .	-1
It is okay . Same thing over and over . When you have seen one wives reality show , you 've seen them all .	-1
Petty fights and arguments all season long . Karen stinks does n't add any relevancy , just high school drama . Her dad was a mobster not her , no one is afraid of Karen . She 's delusional .	-1
This might be the worst reality TV I 've ever seen ! I do n't know exactly what I expected , but so much of the dialogue ( if you can call it that ) was dubbed , it was pitiful .	-1
I watched `` Burn Notice : The Fall of Sam Axe '' with a fair amount of expectation and anticipation . I have watched the `` Burn Notice '' series from its inception with my spouse and I think that it 's fair to say that it is one of our favorite weekly programs . Add to that , I have been a tireless devotee to the brilliant Bruce Campbell for more years than I care to recognize in print ( decades ! ) . So , this made-for TV movie seemed like a ca n't miss proposition . And , indeed , it begins on a decidedly whimsical note as Campbell faces a military tribunal for an escapade gone wrong . With his trademark bluster , Campbell challenges authority like no one else ! His character has become a fan favorite over the years due to his verbal interplay with his series 's co-stars Gabrielle Anwar and , most notably , Jeffrey Donovan . Donovan directs this tepid prequel and puts in a cameo , but its just long enough to highlight what 's missing from this incarnation of the Burn Notice saga.As much as I liked the comedic stylings of the present day military sequences , one would expect a terrific , funny and larger than life episode to showcase Sam 's outrageousness . In fact , the jungle exploits between a corrupt military junta and a ragtag band of rebel fighters just seems far too easy and conventional . In a set-up used in countless other films , Sam is sent as an observer to a third world nationality and discovers that all is not as it seems in their plight with rebel forces . Soon Sam is in the thick of things protecting an altruistic hospital ( sweet ) and its strong and dedicated American/Canadian doctors ( no language barriers here ! ) . But it is a sassy rebel orphan who really seals the deal in this film . Painfully unreal and contrived , the girl exists to personalize the story -- but is just one more example of a character construct as opposed to a real person . That 's right , the great Campbell 's principle foil is a precocious teen -- uggh ! The strength of Burn Notice , as I mentioned above , is in its verbal pyrotechnics . The characters play off one another with rapid fire dexterity , and Campbell is an integral part of that success . Here , the script lacks the savvy and the smarts necessary to make this must-see entertainment and Campbell 's big persona fails to have a match in the likable , if forgettable , ensemble of the film . Another part of the series ' charm comes from stylish adventure and a palpable sense of danger . Here , the action is straightforward and lacking the visual flair we 'd expect from the show . And as for danger , there 's never a doubt as to the outcome of this fairly generic tale . As a Campbell enthusiast , I prefer his campier film forays and as a Burn Notice fan -- this only hinted at the elements which distinguish the show . I watched it , it was pleasnat enough , but I ca n't imagine a second viewing . If you do n't watch Burn Notice , though -- you 're missing out . I suggest you start there ! KGHarris , 4/11 .	-1
Meh.A made-for-tv story with low ( ish ) budget values ... attempts were made to make Sam Axe appear younger but all this aside , the story was very weak and added zero IMHO to the overall series.If you enjoy the show then you *might* like this episode ... but Michael Westen barely appears and to me there 's little to elaborate on the Sam persona that might add value to the tv show itself.It all feels a little pandering and derivative . If you 're hungry for a meal , just take note that this is a light snack . And not tasty-popcorn-indulgence type snack either ... more like chip shards and leftover guacamole dip from last night .	-1
Do not bother with the HD episodes of this season if you 're watching on a TiVo . They play with a choppy stutter framerate that is terribly annoying to watch . The low-def versions are fine .	-1
I think Matt Smith will successfully kill this franchise after 50 years . Too bad old chap ! You just do n't emote the complexities of the Doctor .	-1
NO ONE smiles in this series ... at least not the first couple of episodes.We could only watch two episodes ... just too excruciatingly boring and grinding .	-1
Explanation For Lower Rating : I 'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year , but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction . When they released `` Pawn Stars : Volume Three , '' many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety . It was , in fact , only sixteen episodes . When they released `` American Pickers : Volume Two , '' it was the same thing . Season One had been released with all episodes , but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two . I know some people that preordered sight unseen , or just were n't paying attention , felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases . Personally , I did n't agree with the decision -- but , at least , the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included . Anyone who read the box knew what to expect -- how many episodes and which ones , so it was n't a blind investment ! Not so for `` American Restoration , Volume One ! '' I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside . Never mind that it does n't list them ( which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package ) -- it does n't even tell you how many episodes you are getting . I suppose I 'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics ? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I 'm overreacting , but I think the company owes potential buyers this information . My lower rating , therefore , reflects the History Channel 's ( or A & E ; Networks distributing ) apparent disregard for its own fan base . I do n't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I 'm paying for ! I , however , will tell you what is inside . The 2 DVD set has sixteen episodes : all four from the abbreviated Season One and the first twelve from Season Two . Really , how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were sixteen episodes on the DVD box ? Season One : ( 1 ) Hopalong Rock , ( 2 ) Ice Cold , ( 3 ) Lights Out , and ( 4 ) Buttered Up.Season Two : ( 1 ) Cooler Kings , ( 2 ) Knockout , ( 3 ) Duck and Cover , ( 4 ) Pumped Up , ( 5 ) Space Kowboy , ( 6 ) Jackpot , ( 7 ) Safe Keeping , ( 8 ) Suck Up , ( 9 ) Rev 'd Up , ( 10 ) Apples and X-Rays , ( 11 ) Hot & Cold , and ( 12 ) Secret Fan.Actual Review : I will be brief in my actual review since I already went on a tirade . `` American Restoration '' is an offshoot of the popular `` Pawn Stars , '' and fits comfortably into the History Channel 's stable of reality based programming . Its star ( Rick Dale ) made semi-regular appearances on that program , but now we get a closer look at what he does . Based in Las Vegas , Dale and team locate objects that might be of value ( or represent lost bits of Americana ) and figure out ways to restore the item to its former glory . It 's an easy show to like and fascinating especially if you enjoy antiquing or modern day treasure hunting shows ( Pawn Stars , Storage Wars and others ) . I found it very interesting to see the different techniques of this unusual art form -- and I do think Dale is an artist ! The program itself merits four stars . KGHarris , 11/11 .	-1
It seems since season 10 or 11 , each season has had really mediocre/bad episodes and one or two exceptional ones , rinse and repeat . I love all of Trey Parker 's works , ranging from Cannibal the Musical to the Book of Mormon , but south park is frankly getting lazy . Stop me if you 've seen this before : Cartman takes something to a whacky extreme , and when people see how depraved/whacky he is , they just stare at him with their mouths agape while he keeps doing his song and dance . Rinse , REPEAT . It seems like in each episode all of the characters serve as nothing more than the backdrop to the whacky shenanigans of Eric Cartman . Same applies to whichever other character decides to go apesh** in each South Park episode , everyone just mutely stares at whatever 's going on.It 's this predictability that 's made South Park stale and boring . In the first couple seasons it was less slanted at being a parody of the world now and more focused on the boys being boys , as well as having a sly commentary on the side , now it 's just all political commentary . After seeing Team America and hell even Your Studio & You south park just seems like a lazy crutch , where 's their punk rock attitude from the 90 's ?	-1
I rated it one star only because the review requested it . It started with great promise but the ending stank .	-1
The file is damaged or something , plays a few minute and then locks up . How do we complain about this ?	-1
Positives : Getting people to act as if they 're not acting but just being themselves is harder than it looks . If you do n't like reading , exercising , or contributing to world peace/health and therefore need to fill time then this flick will do it.Negatives : The most creative parts of the movie were the Norwegian mountains which , unfortunately for the Norwegian production crew , they ca n't take any credit for creating . They can take credit for copycat , anyone can do it , wobbly handheld mockumentary in the long line of Blair etc . redux . The computer generated trolls were pretty standard for today 's computer graphics software so if you find them amazing then you must just now be discovering technology . By the way , a note to the educated viewer , it 's anatomically impossible to have a creature of that size with that particular skeletal structure ( e.g . blood flow pressure ; stress forces on bone ) .	-1
An original concept is sabotaged by the never-ending mockumentary trend in horror movies . This dubbed Norwegian entry is becoming a cult favorite and I frankly ca n't understand its appeal . It 's not really funny nor scary . The troll effects are okay , and there 's a certain ingenuity in the various troll appearances . But the movie is incredibly slow and the jerky camera work is nauseating . The script is mundane at least in the dialogue department and the ending way too abrupt , not that I was sorry to see it end.I 'll be glad when the lost tapes fad fades and movie-makers rely on story and skill instead of tired gimmicks .	-1
It 's amazing to see how many people recommended this movie and give it a five star vote . Maybe it 's because I went into it after reading reviewers comments and they hyped the movie up more then it was , but I went in expecting something mind blowing , and all I found was disappointment in what I would hardly call anything more then a science fiction movie re-inventing what you think about Trolls . It 's definitely not a horror movie , nor a thriller.. it 's not scary , unless you are a complete wuss that is afraid of your own shadow , and the re-invention of Trolls as large monsters that the Norwegian Government do n't want people to know about is just plain silly . : :Plot : :3 College kids are out and about looking for something to film , as they have n't got much else better to do . They find a town where there is a dead bear that has supposedly been shot , but some of the people they interview beleive it was not shot , as no one has laid claim to the kill , and tracks around the bear look suspicious . The trio end up following a man who they think may be a suspect to the bear shooting . They follow him into the woods and end up running away from a strange sound caused by something big that is chasing them . They team up with the man who they where following , who just happens to be the # 1 and only Troll hunter in Norway who explains to them that he does n't mind them filming what he does , as long as they do exactly what he says . He also explains that the government know about the trolls and that he is paid to hunt them down if they go outside their territories nearer to human populated areas . He also explains that he does n't care if they film this secret , because the government pays him very little , which I found hard to swallow , but OK . The Norway leaders only need one guy to hunt these things ... sure . Okie Dokey then . Anyway ... The 4 of them go on a hunt of trolls , learn how trolls are tracked , their species , and how to get a blood sample of one for a veterinarian . : :End Plot : :With everyone saying this is a must see movie , and how scary it is , It makes me wonder what other movies those people have been exposed to so far ? Because this movie , it 's not all as great as it 's being hyped up to be . It 's kind of like Blair Witch style but they are on the hunt of large mammals that either explode or turn to stone when they are exposed to ultraviolet UV rays.Sure they CGI is not bad , but that does not make a movie brilliant . I was drifting in and out of consciousness by the end of the movie . I dunno , maybe I prefer my scary movies to make sense or have a more interesting plot going on , but I did n't find this movie as gripping or compelling as some others have been saying it is . I 'm not saying do n't see it , I know people have different tastes , and although this did n't appeal to me , I 'm sure other will . Like many of my reviews , it 's more here as a reminder to myself why I did n't enjoy it all that much .	-1
I watched this movie based on the four and a half stars ... The reviewers must have all been Norwegian family members of the film maker . This plot is so tired and the effects were so bad give me a break . No one on a film shot can figure out how to use night vision at night ? ? It 's just stupid ... the movie is stupid ... and I feel stupid for wasting my time watching it ...	-1
Yes , 9/11 was horrific and for those of us who were not there I 'm sure we ca n't imagine . I began watching this on 9/11/13 just to remember what had happened , part of the way thru I had to turn it off because the descriptions and so forth were so terribly graphic that it was disturbing . Do n't watch this movie if you are sensitive to very graphic descriptions of the horrors of that day .	-1
After watching a different ( and better ) version of this play , I was excited to see additional episodes listed on Amazon . I watched about 10 minutes of this Season 3 and was very disappointed . I was hoping this was a continuation of the TV series seen on Amazon . What I saw previously on Amazon were two series of a television show . This version of the show is a series of plays . It is not the same at all . This is just my taste . If you love plays , then you will probably like this . There are many more season on this version . The TV version , sadly , only has two season.Both versions are available on Amazon online free of charge .	-1
The concept of this show is good . The people in this show are not . It seems to me like they blame all of these & # 34 ; hauntings & # 34 ; on objects that would look cool in their museum . 'I believe this object is the reason why your home is haunted . What would you like to do ? I can take it to my museum for you and rid you of the haunting . 'Tools .	-1
I like paranormal shows , but this one seems a little more hard to swallow than some of the rest of them .	-1
I 'm 26 but I still enjoy a lot of the teen drama shows . Vampire diaries , PLL , al or of shows on The CW . But this show is awful . It has an interesting plot but the acting is beyond bad . The only decent character is Stiles .	-1
I 'm only watching this series because I 've run out of other things to watch . I 'm so tired of seeing women who chase bad guys in 3 & # 34 ; heels ! The intro to the show with the motorcycle is just silly . It 's ok but not great .	-1
I 'll just quote my review of season three : & # 34 ; I 'm a spy movie fan and I 'd like to go with the fantasy , but it 's just too contrived . It 's so predictable that it 's not much fun. & # 34 ; I jumped to season 3 without watching much of 2 or 1 thinking that if it 's been renewed for that many seasons , it must be getting better . Right ? Wrong . Slightly , ever so slightly , more polished . The writing is very amateurish .	-1
I watched about 30 minutes and realized it 's not for me . It is a good show but it 's on the line of White Collar . Their good but the acting is fair and the writing is C+ .	-1
This was not my favorite . Too much fowl language and degrading others .	-1
I did not appreciate the language . right from the start they were taking the Lord 's name in every sentence it seemed . We might have watch maybe 5 minutes of it . That was more than we cared for !	-1
It started off ok and then it became silly and predictable so my husband I decided not to continue watching it . The acting was ok but the story line well you can figure it out right away .	-1
I really do n't understand why this show was brought back . There are too many characters every one of them irritating , and none of them are sympathetic . There 's constantly too much uproar and turmoil among them and around them as the plots are confusing and uninspiring . The leader , a doctor , is a pompous and inept person with an agenda to promote specially gifted people he calls `` alphas '' but who are generally antisocial and even dangerous unless he alone can get them to behave civily for a few moments per episode . The special gifts are already boring -- example : the close up of the `` strong man 's '' arteries as he pumps up . I ca n't stand `` Gary '' the human fiber optic reader . He 's neither engaging nor cute , never funny , just a thorn in the side of all because he 's special but wait , they are all special ! He do n't care . He 's more specialer . Just that character alone is so annoying I do n't plan to spend any more time `` with him '' watching this . This show should have vanished along with `` 3 inches '' , a show about a guy with telekinetic powers but could only do it as far as 3 inches . At least that had some humorous potential . This show is as interesting as some car ads . By the time it 's over you 've forgotten what was being advertised . I do n't own this but I was requested to review the show .	-1
Great idea for a series but the plot soon evolved into the typical crazed murderer ( this one with an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ) motif and I lost all interest about two-thirds through -- and stopped watching . Character development was weak and stereotypic , acting was competent but not spectacular , and the script was clich & eacute ; -ridden and shallow .	-1
This show is complete nonsense . Children should not be treated in this manner . This is a poorly produced reality show .	-1
The children are spoiled rotten and the parents should have the kids taken away from them just because of teaching children the worst values on the planet . Please tell me how parents can spend 2 or 3 THOUSAND dollars on a $ 100.00 dress 24 inches in length for gods sake , and parade a kid that has no idea where she 's even at half the time , just to get a dumb cheap crown or banner ? ? ? How is this possible ? ? ? ? Do these people have any brains at all ? ? Yeah ... lets not spend any money on education for them or save for college as they do n't even seem to be able to speak properly ... .let 's spend $ 10,000.00 on a pageant to win $ 300.00 worth of trashy junk so the mother can live her life through the child.All I can do is watch a few minutes and shake my head in disgust and dis-belief , and change channels , even though my child wanted to see it , I convinced her it was so ridiculous , and these were all fools that make money off these moron parents and it was a waste of time.If you would have told me this kind of thing existed in this form I would have said no ... nope ... no ... ..no one could be this gullable and stupid , but no matter how foolish and stupid you think people can get ... .we seem to always set new records in this country as it continues to decline everyday.Just terrible program .	-1
I guess this was the Olivia show , with mom as her whipping post . I 'm nearly 60 and I do n't believe I 've ever heard a mother actually utter the phrase : & # 34 ; She 's still at the age where hitting is the cutesy phase & # 34 ; . Really ? ! ! I would love to see a show of hands as to how many adults think it 's cute when you see a child slap an adult ? This is one of the most extreme cases I 've seen watching this program , but 80 percent of these 'parents ' allow back-talk , snarky attitudes , tantrums , etc . Not all , mind you , buy enough that should concern us . These are the 'entitled ' ones who believe it all needs to be handed to them on a silver platter . It makes me ill to see how catered these children are , how foolish the adults are . I 'm not sure who needs a spanking more the kids or some of the moms.On the other hand , some of these young ladies show fabulous poise , good manners , and upbringing . I do think that pageants , when viewed and done correctly can benefit those involved . Maybe they need to test the mothers for maturity levels before allowing their children to enter , I like watching the older kids more , but it 's something only tolerable in small doses , Watch at your own risk ! lol	-1
I 'm speechless and horrified . All I can say is Thank God this world is very far away from my world . I feel sad for anyone who would want to subject themselves and their child to this craziness . But then again , if they are involved in this crazy sub-culture they must be certifiable themselves .	-1
The film says , `` 75 % of people believe in the supernatural . '' Do you know what that says about 75 % of people ? They 're MORONS ! What is the NUMBER ONE thing you NEVER see in ALL this `` ghost , these , and ghost that '' shows ... HMMMM ? Anybody ? GHOSTS !	-1
Roy looks like a mountain man . He 's earned a bunch of patents , but his property in the Redwoods has all kinds of beat up cars on it . He 's accrued 20 MILLION in local fees . Now clearly no one would be able to pay that . `` Hoarders '' tries to clear his cars and their equipment gets stuck in the mud ! If this guy is such the genius , why does n't he have a lab , rather than a heap of junk ! ? The show never says if his hoarding hurt the redwoods or was in some way anti-green.Now Loretta was a trip ! She looked like Marla Gibbs on crack ! She was pregnant and the show concludes by saying she had a healthy baby girl . Still , I 'm seriously worried that the mother 's nuttiness may hurt the child eventually . Loretta did n't wan na throw away nothin ' ! It was funny , and exhilarating , to see her sistah-gurl relative snap on her and walk off in disgust . Her husband stood by her side , regardless . He must have loved her strong , or just had extreme passive tendencies . Many of the non-hoarding husbands on this show threaten to leave , but this guy never once indicates that he 'd abandon his nutty wife . Good for him , well , in a way !	-1
Peggy Lee lives in Hawaii . She has four children and a second husband . She is an alcoholic.Peggy 's first husband abandoned her two sons , but they chose to live with him when he returned . This propelled her drinking , and her own mother was an alcoholic . This reminded of Toni Morrison 's `` Beloved , '' a book which begins by the main character 's two sons leaving her house.I related to Peggy Lee because she often talks and yells to herself , with no actual audience . Although I 've never been diagnosed with alcoholism , I do that stuff too . [ Place embarrassment emoticon here . ] Peggy Lee babysits her grandson and it 's a total accident waiting to happen . I think more than Peggy could be punished by Children & Family Services if something bad did occur.Peggy Lee calls herself a fifth-generation Hawaiian . I kinda wish she had stated what her ethnicity was . I kept asking myself , `` I wonder if they 're entirely Asian or a mix of Asian and Polynesian . '' Then again , Hawaiians of all kinds of backgrounds sometimes call themselves `` just Hawaiian . `` I thought the show would end on a down note , but it ended positively , surprisingly .	-1
All pretty much the same after you 've seen one . I feel for these families , but I can not believe they do n't know they are about to be intervened ! So much unreality to this reality show	-1
This series seems to be primarily a romance series with a little police procedural thrown in . And romance between co-workers ? That 's a situation so ripe for disaster I could not stomach the thought of enduring more .	-1
This show is n't what it used to be , but having said that , each week tends to be mildly amusing as the A-Team of this new millenium goes about righting wrongs and having some fun.What 's annoying is that for a long time now , NONE of the plots even pretend to have any meaningful obstacles ... countless systems are bypassed with the flick of the wrist and a punch of the keyboard 's Enter key ... villains are hoodwinked , authorities remain clueless , foes are outsmarted etc . This used to be a smart , sassy show but any similarity to the UK 's `` Hustle '' has long since been bypassed ... what we seem to have nowadays is a team of people who effortlessly con everyone , walk away smiling every time ... and if the episode can get away with sticking to one location ( ie . cheap for the Production ) then so be it ... at most everyone dons a disguise or change of wardrobe . Ugh.Episode 4.12 `` The Office Job '' however has to go down in the history books as *the* most tedious and boring example of a premise s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d beyond breaking point and well into SNAP territory . I actually believed the producers had lost their minds with this one ...	-1
Leverage is getting to be a gamble to watch . This one is slow and boring and I 'm sorry I spent money on it . I hope they figure out that when people are paying per show they at least need to hold the viewer 's interest .	-1
I 've enjoyed watching this show for three seasons but this third season is problematic . Hank and his cohorts are all over the map . Also , the medical conditions are getting more and more bizarre . This episode of the man passing out every time he gets in front of his new painting is a case in point . The answer became so complicated that I began to lose interest . This is also what is happening with the characters ' lives . Plus there are now way too many characters and plotlines . Someone needs to put on the brakes with this series before it implodes ,	-1
The movie never developed a `` feeling '' for the characters , wasnt very scary , wasnt a well made movie in any manner and is so forgetable I had to click on it to remember the basic plotline ... .what little there was of it.I dont recommend this movie ... ... at all	-1
The movie is about a girl who has the ability to see the evil side of the person ( they half-heartedly appear like those in Sixth Sense ) . After her mother is murdered , the girl and her father move from their apartment from L.A. to a house in a quaint size town . From there there the plot starts . She ends up making a mischievous friend and befriends her elementary teacher . She then begins to see a dead girl appear every once in a while and the mystery ensues.I was expecting a lot more out of this movie . At the very least I was hoping for a small amount of build up or a bit of creepiness . Both were lacking . The suspense and climax is thin in this movie . The story line is semi-obvious along w/ the prime suspect ( villain ) . I will rate this as a back-shelved Lifetime Network suspense movie.pjt .	-1
Season 1 was very entertaining , Season 2 was pretty good , but Season 3 demonstrates that Warehouse 13 has lost an indefinable something . Something has changed in the running/writing of the show that has lost some kind of synergy . Save your money , Amazon will have this on sale for 20 bucks soon enough .	-1
Ok , i took dance class for years as a kid and young adult and I havenever , never , ever had a teacher like that.. It is so unprofessional not to mentionterrible workouts and dance advice I ca n't believe that these women subject theirkids to it..they need to get out more and see what a professional dance school islike in the real world..This woman has no class at all and one of the major thingstaught at real dance schools is class , professional manners and respect . I wouldnever respect a teacher that talked to me like that because real dance instructorsdo not talk to their students like that nor do dance parents hang around like that.These women are nuts to subject their kids to this woman . If I could have given it a zero I would have .	-1
This is another example of terrible , awful mothers that will do ANYTHING for two minutes of fame , even sacrificing their children in the process . Often times guilty of out right child abuse , these looser 's are so desperate for fame , they even allow the human blimp named `` Abby '' to abuse everyone , in every show without ever thinking of anything close to love or pride or protecting those beautiful , talented , wonderful young girls that give so much trying to please everyone else . The same people that get out of the car at accidents to view the carnage , are the same ones that watch this god awful , disgusting program that clearly demonstrates just how low parents can sink for cash or fame.Just AWFUL .	-1
The dance instructor ( I 'll call her Bertha ) is a sadist of the first order . I cant tell who she enjoys torturing more , the kids or the mothers . The mothers who allow their daughters to be subjected to this abuse need mental health counseling , as well as some parenting skills classes . I 'd be willing to bet they started out in the Tiara wearing preschooler and baby contests . I would n't quite call it kiddie porn but with the stripper make-up dance routines and costumes its real close .	-1
Thought this might be entertaining and funny but it was just a too realistic view of people solely focused on themselves and the awful , hurtful behavior that goes along with those types of priorities . We found it rather depressing to watch , not at all humorous , more head shaking in disbelief that this was actually a show .	-1
Pretty much like a car crash in slow motion . Wrong on so many levels . The cultural value of cheesecake icecream shakes . Seriously ? I 'm watching this ? I hate myself , and I need to go read a book . Sigh . : /	-1
Not up to the caliber of most well done British mysteries . We tried to watch it but it did not hold our attention .	-1
I just ca n't get by the various English accents in this drama set in Italy , with supposedly Italian characters . And why , if all the men have British accents , do all the women have Italian ? ? ?	-1

We see it over and over again with Horror , a film with a decent storyline , starts out great , and quickly descends into a pointless mess of blood and guts . The Shrine was a film I really wanted to like . I was intrigued by the Netflix description , and had they stuck with that story , maybe this one would have been a winner , unfortunately they did n't . The Shrine starts out by telling us of a student backpacking through Europe , who goes missing in the small town of Alvania , Poland . Some reporters from his hometown get a whiff of the story and start poking around , only to find out that no one in the town is particularly interested in trying to find this kid , that 's when the reports decide the only thing they can do is go there and look for him themselves . With films like Saw and The Offspring , the gore was absolutely necessary and added to the story , in The Shrine , it takes away from what was already a pretty good story . The small town was creepy and the story really played to peoples fear of disappearing without a trace , while on vacation . The film may have been a little bit slow moving , but it was very intense and interesting until the last forty-five minutes . That 's when it goes demonic and becomes nothing but one bloody body after another . For me , films like the Shrine are the most disappointing of all , because the writers did n't believe in their story and ultimately destroy it in order to get more viewers . The demonic slaughterhouse may have appealed to a larger audience , but it certainly did n't make this a better film .	-1
If you have a smidgen of intelligence this movie will be sure to insult it . The stupidest characters + a stupid script = a complete waste of time . [ And I 'm an Ashley Judd fan but I sure would n't buy her facial products based on how she looked through this movie . ] Yes , there IS a little bit of a surprise at the end of the movie that will make some idiots think this was a real `` smart '' movie - but they 'd be wrong , and getting to that surprise end is just soooo NOT WORTH IT .	-1
Not appropriate to watch . Guess I am naive but this should be rated 'R ' for graphic scenes and language . Ca n't believe parents would say these kinds of things to their children . I do not recommend this to anyone .	-1
Plot is shallow , did not fimd this show to be enjoyable . The show is only 30 minutes long for the price of a hour long show .	-1
I thought it was going to be funny , but it was just inapropriate . The very first episode and I was like really ?	-1
Figured I watch the pilot and check out the movie ... what a joke . If folks think censoring is appropriate , why bother having the lines in the first place ? This movie is not some G rated Disney film so why is it getting bleeped constantly ? Just plain stupid.Thankfully with this preview I can avoid the series and look for some other adult rated movies who do not censor their content .	-1
terrible is about all I can say .	-1
OK , I admit it . Some of the episodes of this season were pretty interesting , including `` Aliens and the Old West '' , `` Aliens and Evil Places '' and `` Aliens and the Founding Fathers '' . But why do the producers blame everything on aliens ? ? ? Do they really believe that every paranormal happening on the face of the planet ( our planet , that is ) are caused by little green men from the Dog Star ? Egyptian zoomorph gods , the bizarre `` suicide forest '' in Japan , Thunderbirds , Joseph Smith 's meeting with Moroni , Serpent Mound in Ohio , the mysterious disappearance of a 19th century science fiction writer , even the founding of the United States ( ! ) ... everything is caused by literal aliens in literal , mechanical space ships . Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson , Ralph Waldo Emerson and Walt Whitman are squeezed into the scenario , since they apparently believed in extraterrestrial life , while poor George Washington supposedly encountered aliens at Valley Forge ? ! A series *seriously* investigating the real or perceived paranormal events touched upon in `` Ancient Aliens '' might have been interesting , even if some of the stories would prove to be tall tales . Instead , we are forced to endure Erich von D & auml ; niken 's super-silly `` theories '' ( yes , the old veteran is featured in several episodes ) , or watch long-debunked `` mysteries '' such as the Montauk monster ( clue : it was a dog , but not from the Dog Star ) .I 'm sure the sceptics reel every time they feel themselves forced to watch the `` History '' Channel , but why are n't the true believers up in arms against this pseudo-euhemeristic rubbish ? Talk about killing a real mystery ! Just blame it on the aliens ...	-1
Although I believe we may have been visited in the past , the so called & # 34 ; experts & # 34 ; have no credentials . I mean one is a boxing promoter or some such ? The leaps of fancy parading as facts is astounding . & # 34 ; See that round rock ? Ancient Alien theorists believe this was a stone placed here by Aliens and was used for their giant pool tables ! & # 34 ;	-1
This is quite a departure for what we used to know as History Channel programming . I am open to new ideas , but this series often goes so far off the deep end as to be unwatchable . This is season 3 . There are now into season 5 . 5 SEASONS of this .	-1
Somewhat overstated and it becomes trite if you watch a few episodes . A bit of this goes a long way . Perhaps there was contact with aliens ; perhaps not , but not everything can be explained with the theory that it has happened . I quit watching as it got rather boring .	-1
Wanted to like this show about multinational Doctors working in a 'MASH ' type hospital in the war zone of Afghanistan ; but did n't . The premise has tons of potential and the Actors are all fine , but it just did n't 'grab me ' and I 'm a fan of most medical shows ( House , Nurse Jackie ) . Sometimes its easy to think the networks are 'idiots ' cause they cancel shows after 1 season that are really , really good and I love finding 'gems ' like that on Amazon for purchase . And sometimes , they cancel a show like this -- and I can see why . Its not horrible , its just not that compelling to spend time watching in my view and somebody else might love it !	-1
Low Low Budget stinker . The special effects are terrible . The acting is ridiculous . The story is boring . I loved Nude Nuns With Big Guns but this movie is not even in the same league as Nude Nuns . Done waste your money .	-1
I can not believe that the 2 chicks in this movie are responsible for writing and directing .. American Mary ... . That was a good movie ... This is just a waste of $ $ and time which u ca n't get back when it 's gone . I warn anyone expecting somthing from this very low i mean low budget flick , bad acting , bad story , not funny at all , and the gore is laughable . STAY AWAY from this sticker ! ! ! ! !	-1
I saw the title and thought that this has got to be a well constructed satire on so-called `` exploitation '' films ( a deceptive name to make cheap seem respectable ) or it 's really a cheaply conceived and produced movie.The old storyline of a dead body suddenly showing up and some innocent people make a series of dumb decisions ( so a movie can be made and an audience can say `` Dumb decision ! '' . Briefly , two sisters , a girlfriend and some religious guy drive around with a dead body in the trunk trying to dispose of the body while avoiding the usual drug gangsta and true killer . His scenes add up to about 5 minutes and thankfully because his acting consists of wearing a hoodie.If you like dumb dialogue , poor acting and lots of scenes of an old car and a couple of rooms then this low budget movie is for you .	-1
Honestly here guys , overall this things getting 4 stars with an overall of 33 votes so far ? Come on , who are you kidding ? Every other site slams this movie with honest reviews , IMDB has this as 4 of 10 stars with 673 votes . Put two and two together here folks . You saw the trailer right ? If not , go see it , and you will know this movie is going to be horrible just from watching that . Horrible acting , bad editing , dodgy sound , ugly lead actresses , dumb plot , and made by two girls no one I know has ever heard of . What where they popular on a public access show they produced in a town that all 32 residents living their watched it ? So why is there reviews here praising how much they love them ? Sounds to me like one of the following possibilities.1 - One or both of the twins wrote a review or two here.2 - Some pervert just heard it was female twins and went nuts obsessing over it.3 - Friends of friends of friends ... you know , `` like my movie on facebook guys ! ! ! `` 4 - It 's just a bunch of jokers having a stupid laugh.5 - Drunk or mental conditions apply to the reviewer.6 - Watched the wrong movie.Add a 7 if you have any more thoughts : D	-1
At first glance , MAIN ST. would seem to have all the ingredients for an absorbing piece - a top-notch cast ( with two Brits doing very creditable Southern accents ) , a strong sense of place ( Raleigh , North Carolina ) , and a taut , spare script by veteran Horton Foote . Then why is the movie such a disappointment ? Its subject-matter is a pertinent one : the decline of American urban life and the schemes hatched by entrepreneurs to regenerate it , which might not necessarily please the existing residents . However John Doyle 's production is particularly slow-moving : the camera spends a long time focusing on tight close-ups of the protagonists , especially Ellen Burstyn as Georgiana Carr . This would be a perfectly acceptable strategy , were it not for the consciously showy nature of the performances : the actors are allowed to get away with the kind of theatrical gestures and facial movements that would not seem out of place in Victorian melodrama . As a result , we end up not really caring about the characters at all . Matters are not helped by the treacly soundtrack ( from the normally reliable Patrick Doyle ) that obtrudes itself on several occasions . Perhaps the material might have been better if another director had handled it .	-1
Despite the superb acting this movie just did not cut it.Here are some of my random thoughts after watching it.Is it just me or is that the most miserable and unhappy town in America ? Midway through the movie I was ready to stick my head into one of those toxic drums.The fact that a warehouse full of deadly toxic waste was being guarded by a couple of beer drinking Mexicans in lawn chairs was laughable.The scene where Auntie was suddenly overjoyed to move out of the only house she ever lived in was a mystery in itself.The weirdest part of the movie though , was when the toxic waste boss suddenly realizes that toxic waste is ... ... .toxic.At the end when the guy announces he was quitting , Auntie is overjoyed to be moving out and everyone is in love , I was expecting a giant Wizard of Oz rainbow to be there when she opened the door and announced `` What a beautiful day ! ''	-1

Horton Foote ( 1916 - 2009 ) ) was an American playwright and screenwriter , perhaps best known for his Academy Award-winning screenplays for the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird and the 1983 film Tender Mercies , and his notable live television dramas during the Golden Age of Television . He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1995 for his play The Young Man From Atlanta . His last original screenplay as MAIN STREET : it is fortunate that he did n't live to see it produced . MAIN STREET seems to have something to say - that the economic crisis has devastated small towns to the point of making questionable decisions out of desperation about improving their near ghost town status ; that lessons from around the world ( Chernobyl and Fukushima , etc ) about toxic waste too often go unheeded ; that flight of youth from small towns merely to seek change is not always emotionally convincing a decision : that family history and the accoutrements of same do n't necessarily guarantee survival for descendants . And out of these plausible concerns could come a decent story , but here the result is flatline . In his film debut as a director John Doyle ( known for fine productions of the operas Peter Grimes , The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny , and the musical comedy Company ) he fails to show a grasp of the use of film to tell a story and we are left with a stew of separate ingredients that seem almost immiscible.Durham , North Carolina is the setting - a town shrinking by the year because of lack of jobs and crumbling businesses - and the major ( Isiah Whitlock Jr. ) is desperate , deciding whether to schedule or move or cancel the annual parade from Thanksgiving to Christmas due to the town 's lack of interest and depression . Enter Gus Leroy ( Colin Firth ) who has rented a defunct tobacco warehouse from a town widow Georgiana Carr ( Ellen Burstyn ) to store canisters of Hazardous Waste awaiting transport to Vernon , Texas for burying : Leroy 's apparent Ecology informed company offers the Durham city council the opportunity for economic resurrection . Georgiana has misgivings about the rental and is faced with the fact that her trust fund form her wealthy father is depleted and she must consider selling the mansion in which she has lived since her birth . She seeks advice form her niece Willa ( Patricia Clarkson ) who at first objects but on meeting Leroy falls for the man and the project . As a sidebar another family faces changes : young Mary Saunders ( Amber Tamblyn ) is under the spell of her boss ( Andrew McCarthy ) but still loves her high school sweetheart Harris ( Orlando Bloom ) , a young cop who is studying law at night and living with his depressed mother ( Margo Martindale ) , urging Harris to 'go steady ' with Mary and forget law school to stay in Durham . The human factor enters : there is an accident of one truck hauling canisters ( and event that changes the outlook of the wannabe entrepreneur Leroy ) , Mary 's boss is married , and the concept of 'progress ' in the decaying town of Durham changes along with the changes in the folk involved in the story.Aside from failing to involve the audience in the story or the characters , the conundrum is why would such a stellar cast of brilliant actors ( Colin Firth , Patricia Clarkson , Ellen Burstyn , Orlando Bloom ) sign on for such an obvious box office disaster ( it is yet to be released ) ? One can only assume that it was an homage to the memory of the brilliant writer Horton Foote . It is a shame this screenplay is the last note of the legacy he left us . Grady Harp , August 11	-1

I 'm a big fan of a lot of British TV shows and I like Dominic West . But I could n't get into this show at all . I really wanted to like it but it seemed to be dropping breadcrumbs all over the place and never picking them up . I suppose I had the wrong expectations going into it .	-1
Ca n't think of one good thing to say about this production . Unless it we snore fest . As sad waste of time . Do not bother .	-1
I am just not a fan of `` iCarly . '' The gags are often focused on mildly humorous words or phrases used by some characters and often they are brought up several different times throughout the course of one scene or episode , or sometimes certain words that sound laughable are botched into nonsensical but bland phrases or are broken up and rearranged for humor . It just comes off as hokey and sometimes the jokes are something that I would usually expect out of a corny 1970s situation comedy . True , there have been a few jokes that have left me laughing uncontrollably , but they seldom appear and there have been times before where I have found it odd that I was not laughing at the kind of little jokes that normally are my sense of humor . Many people may believe that I am expecting too much of more recent television series to try and hold a candle to the quality of Nickelodeon programs that were broadcast during the 1990s and early 2000s , but I long for the nostalgia I feel when looking back on faint memories of those series . I sincerely apologize , Nickelodeon . I just miss your older series and wish that you could bring them back somehow .	-1
Honestly , I was confused by this episode and never figured out the point . It shows a mirror universe and that 's it ... nothing to tie it to the other universe or nothing to show how it ties to the rest of the episodes . I thought it would be like when DS9 had episodes for an alternate universe and they tied together but this was n't like that at all . It seems like there should have been a Part III to make it all come together and make sense .	-1
After cannibalizing nearly all of TOS series , they ran out of ideas . This one is so , so lame.Their fantasy of Trip-the George Bush-ish NASCAR like mechanic-that beds an exotic beautiful woman and has an immaculate conception . Whose twisted fantasy is this . Lol . And then of course it is back to the evil man and his evil machine to kill all other races , echoing the Nazis in the first episode of this year 's shows . This is new ? This show is so full of mish-mash tripe that I am so glad there are no more . This last season was certainly painful to watch . I did enjoy most of season three however , and the overriding story arch with the unusual harshness of the decisions Captain Archer has to make , making it a truly deep emotional engaging show . The first three seasons were good overall and this one is a plane going down in a ball of flames . This next to last episode is the crash with the fireball .	-1
Terrible . If you like bad jokes and bad language then you will like it . But I did n't like it at all .	-1
Basically , an android figuring out her place in the world , and if she can have emotions . In the end , she becomes quite possessive of her human male friend.Strictly low budget . The special effects are not that great , but then , not many are needed . For the most part , this is an android story that 's been told before ( think Galaxina , all the way up the new Galactica Cylons ) . The acting is not that bad , only a couple of sets are even needed ( a lot of the film takes place outside on an alien world ) .The female android is attractive in a simple way , wearing a bland black jumpsuit . Maybe by altering her outfit , the producer could have made the movie a bit more spicy . LOLAnyway , this film might be worth watching once , but that 's about it .	-1
This movie was worse than a B movie . The acting was terrible and it was mostly boring , boring , boring , boring .	-1
I started watching but quickly turned it off . A laugh track , really ? The 80 's called and they want their tv shows back . The jokes were n't all that funny .	-1
Oh , NBC . We 'll spare you the interrogation ( that one could last for weeks ) . Instead , we 'll let Whitney Cummings be your scapegoat , since she was bold enough to plaster her name and face all over your new series , Whitney . At best , a cross between Fran Drescher and Audrey Hepburn , Cummings is n't without charm . Her raunchy antics elicit the occasional laugh in the show 's pilot episode . Known for her recurring appearances on E ! 's Chelsea Lately , she is the least likely choice of Handler 's panel to helm her own series . This is especially so given a low concept like the one Whitney offers.It takes a whole lot of cool to rest solely on a personality for material . Unfortunately for Whitney , the cool points are obliterated by the laugh track that makes the show feel stale and dated . The episode begins with the disclaimer , `` Whitney is taped in front of a live studio audience , '' which feels like a desperate apology for the awkward format . Giving it the benefit of the doubt , the live audience might be present to poke fun at the traditional sitcom , or to capture the magic of Whitney Cummings 's stand-up skills . The intent is far from clear or successful , and we are left wondering if we are laughing with or at Whitney.Whitney is flanked by a horde of stereotypical female friends that do n't help her cause . However , the men in the ensemble redeem the show -- counterintuitive , given the women 's empowerment potential of a female-driven program . Maulik Pancholy ( Weeds , 30 Rock ) portrays a straight guy for a change , and he breathes fresh life into the show . As does the leading man , Chris D'Elia , who plays Whitney 's quirky-cool boyfriend , Alex . D'Elia steals every scene , exercising a quiet and unconventional magnetism . We vote the show be renamed Alex ; `` it all begins when Alex ditches his insufferable girlfriend , Whitney ... '' Now , there 's a hit show , NBC . Maybe Whitney will get better with age , but until she does , we 're tuning her out.For more reviews , check out enter-detainment on blogspot !	-1

I think Dick Wolf is spreading his talents too thin , both with CSI and this new season of SVU . He is a genius at writing all these tales based on real issues , but the end of Season 12 ( `` Wet '' } re : soda companies stealing/buying rights to limited water aquifers is too close to the idiocy going on now in NYC and elsewhere . Season 13 , Episode 1 did not entice me at all to watch the next episode , although I probably will try again .	-1
I only caught a few episodes of this while my girlfriend was watching it . It 's just not my thing . Weird spur of the moment singing with awful pseudo-adult drama .	-1
Zooey Deschanel is a real talent and the `` awkward schtick '' that she does in this series is funny . A show built around her would definitely have promise , but this falls way short . The writing is flaccid and the comedy is often too broad . And the co-stars are nowhere near as talented as she and it ruins what could have been a great vehicle . But that 's what happens when you choose a cast based on who 's Jewish rather than who 's the most talented . I 'm referring here to actor Jake Johnson ( Jewish despite the Anglo name ) and then most especially Max Greenfield who is not only awful and a total amateur , but is so homely it 's genuinely painful to look at his face .	-1

This is like sci-fi without the sci or fi . Few sci-fi shows that I know of really last on TV when the characters involve children IMO . Perhaps Lost in Space worked but not Earth2 , V or V2 , etc . It ends up always being the same ... .kids do something stupid or silly and the parents come to the rescue . It may work for a two hour movie like Jurasic Park , but not a weekly series . I predict this will last less than half a season.It happened in the pilot ( episode 1 ) and it will continue to happen . I could n't even watch the last half of the show . Next episode I 'm sure will be one of the kids takes in a friendly baby dino and the mother/father dino attacks the compound then the parents or kids hands over the baby and all is fine . kAnother episode , the kids get lost and have to deal with menacing dino 's until the parents rescue them . Another episode and a parent gets hurt and the kid must tempt fate by venturing alone back to the compound to look for help . Another episode , the kids find friendly dino 's who are being harassed by big bad dino 's and parents help rescue the cute , friendly dino 's . Blah , Blah , Blah.Heck , I was more interested in the world that they left rather than the world that they moved to in the time rift .	-1
Not understanding why they are selling a season pass to a show that they do not have rights to show to you . Why am I getting charged for the new episode when I ca n't even watch it ?	-1
OMG , this is almost un-watchable . I do n't understand . Big name folks involved . $ $ spent on effects and sets . You 've begun with an interesting premise . But the story is garbage . Recycled garbage at that . Pushed along by hopelessly cliched dialogue . How sad . Who is the target market ? Why is the leader doing an `` Aw shucks ma'am '' /Marshall Dillon impression ? There is no chemistry between the husband and wife . The sullen misunderstood teenager plot line has been done to death . Let it rest in peace ! I guess I answered my own question . The target market are kids who are too young to recognize the cliches . To them it 's new stuff . Okay ... Well , I 'm going to watch a Firefly episode to cleanse my pallet .	-1
The storyline is slow with many action scenes being simply unbelievable . I can not recommend anyone watch this show , which is sad because the show concept could be very fun .	-1
This program is really sick . You should n't laugh at or exploit a show that is full of people getting injured . It also should have been rated R for language and violence . I ca n't believe that MTV would put such a program on that is watched and revered by young adults.Even though they say do n't try this at home , impressionable young people would try these stunts and sub stain every lasting injuries . This program is trash in my opinion . MTV for creating this series should be ashamed of themselves for profiting from others pain . I fell that the companies who sponsored this program should hang their heads in shame also ... ... ... ... .	-1
One of my favorite random `` 30 Rock '' gags of recent vintage is that the show-within-the-show only got on the air as NBC 's way of apologizing for having aired `` Bitch Hunter , '' a misogynist action drama starring Will Ferrell as a hero who barks out dialogue like , `` Put the mimosas down , bitch ! '' Each time we 'd see a clip of `` Bitch Hunter , '' it would come with a credit listing the various writers and producers , which included eccentric former NBC president Ben Silverman , `` Mad Men '' creator Matthew Weiner and `` 30 Rock '' writer Jack Burditt.At the time , I just took it as a friendly dig at one of the series ' own writers . But having watched two episodes of `` Last Man Standing '' , the Burditt-created sitcom in which Tim Allen plays a sexist , homophobic , xenophobic sporting goods executive , I had the following thoughts:1 ) Allen 's character would probably be right in the `` Bitch Hunter '' target demo ; 2 ) '' Last Man Standing '' is Burditt participating in an elaborate practical joke to see how much of that ethos he can put into a network sitcom ; or3 ) That `` 30 Rock '' kept associating `` Bitch Hunter '' with Burditt was less a friendly joke than a veiled cry for help.Allen 's Mike Baxter has a cliched sitcom wife - always rolling her eyes at his foolishness but ultimately going along - named Vanessa , a trio of daughters and a job at Outdoor Man , a sporting goods company defined for so long by Mike 's real baby : a catalog featuring photos of outdoor men doing manly outdoor things in exotic locales . But as boss Ed points out , not enough people read catalogs anymore , so Mike 's globe-trotting lifestyle gets grounded while he tries to fix the company 's terrible website - and so he can realize how much his girls need a man around the house.The youngest of them is played by Kaitlyn Dever , who was so incredible last season as the orphaned Loretta on `` Justified . '' I know work is work , but it 's disheartening to see her here.Mike 's a guy 's guy who has no idea what `` Glee '' or the Harry Potter books are , is happy to be at the office because , quote , `` it smells like balls in here , '' and seems convinced that his family in particular and the world in general are going to hell in a hand basket because there are n't enough real men anymore . `` Men used to build cities just so we could burn them down ! '' he rants during a webcast that unexpectedly turns into a viral sensation . `` You ca n't even change a tire ! A tire ! Why do n't you get off the couch , you moron , and go outside ! ? ! ? `` Other jokes involve Mike being uncomfortable about other cultures , gay people and immigrants , among others.Allen played a similar character on `` Home Improvement , '' and while I was never a big fan of that show , I do n't remember Tim Taylor ever being this abrasive . I did n't like Tim Taylor , but I did n't instantly hate him the way I do within 90 seconds or so of being with Mike Baxter.And there 's humor to be mined from a prejudiced and/or reactionary character . See Archie Bunker , most famously , or Stacy Keach on `` Titus , '' or even much of what Burditt and company had Jack Donaghy say and do on `` 30 Rock . '' But those shows told those jokes with more style , and usually had an awareness of the ludicrous and/or offensive nature of those characters ' words and deeds . `` Last Man Standing '' doesn't.Allen 's a comedy professional , beloved sitcom star and the voice of Buzz Lightyear . These are all things that would lead me to assume that the studio audience - a species that tends to be generous with their laughter , anyway , by virtue of being physically present and encouraged by the warm-up guy - would enthusiastically respond to all of these groaners . Yet the episodes ABC made so far were clearly done before the laugh track was sweetened - a common industry practice where the studio audience 's laughter is augmented with pre-recorded laughs from older sitcoms - and you can hear crickets most of the time . `` Last Man Standing '' is the first of three new ABC comedies in which men struggle with what it means to be men in a world dominated by women . Each of them - `` Man Up ! '' and `` Work It '' are the others - are terrible in their own way , but given the presence of Burditt behind the camera , and Allen in front of it , the cringe-inducing badness of this one feels the most frustrating.Unless , again , the whole thing is a very expensive , well-disguised prank .	-1
Production values are good . I love even okay westerns . Struggled to finish this one . Rather slow , completely pointless , and the direction of some quite capable actors is either non-existent or awful . Real shame . Underlying it all is a terrible script . I do wonder what the makers of the film though was worth making about this movie . Do n't waste your time .	-1
I have delayed writing this review to let my pique cool somewhat . Flashpoint is a Canadian production which makes no attempt to disguise the fact that it is shot in Toronto.Season 4 has 18 episodes but the three disks in this set marketed on Amazon.com in the US has only 13 episodes 6 of which are repeats from Season 3 . This means the buyer is being cheated out of 11 of the 18 episodes . Calling this the Complete Season 4 is dishonest and frankly a rip-off.I 'd like a refund and I would encourage anyone really interested to attempt to obtain the Canadian Version which actually has the complete set .	-1
How can a season be released and not be complete ! ! ! That 's what happened here and I felt disappointed . This show was quite original and intriguing and to not know of the last episodes ( besides downloading them ) , it is very bad !	-1
this is the most idiotic thing ever to be recorded . Loads of fake drama by a bunch of fools that have no business being on TV . This is definitely for the lowest common denominator ( 2 year-olds ) . Where do they get these people . The most common phrase from this show is & # 34 ; come on ! come on ! & # 34 ; OOH the intensity of all .	-1
The pilot was good , but it was downhill from then on . It has turned into a soap opera what with the mediocre acting on the part of most of the actors . It 's a great plot , but well ... .too bad about everything else .	-1
I am a big NCIS fan . Excuse me , I WAS a big NCIS fan . I have seasons 1 through 7 on DVD . I may have season 8 also , but I ca n't find it at the moment . Starting in season 6 I noticed a falling off in the quality of the show ; the writing just did n't seem as good . Now with season 9 on DVD I see a huge falling off in picture quality as well . The DVD picture quality is blurry , and in no way compares with the sharpness of the earlier seasons on DVD . What ? Are they trying to get me to upgrade to Blu-Ray by deliberately selling me inferior DVDs ? Between the inferior picture quality , and the sub-par writing , I 'm sorry , NCIS has lost me as a fan . @ hg47	-1
out of the two episodes I bought of NCIS : LA this one would not play correctly . I have had that happen only once before ( Machine Gun Minister ) , and it was blamed on my internet connect . Unfortunately , that is not what I have come to find out . For I have watched many of the programs that I have bought back to back and out of all of them this and another were the only two I encountered problems with . So no I could not rate this a success because of the reloading and reloading I have encountered all three times I tried to watch it . I have bought two seasons all have worked fine , then two episodes and only one works fine . Two movies and only one worked fine too . So I am not happy with those two instances . I have tried to play the NCIS : LA Episode three times each time with the same results . So in some instances I think the streaming is very erratic . I do not have this problem when watching Netflix .	-1
I own BLUE BLOODS Season One on DVD . The drama is interesting . It 's a decent cop show . And I like Tom Selleck . What pisses me off with BLUE BLOODS Season Two is the blurry picture quality . My one star review is a response to the inferior video quality of Season Two compared to Season One on DVD . Apparently CBS wants me to give up on the DVD format and convert to Blu-Ray , and is deliberately delivering DVDs to consumers with flawed video.The drama , the acting and the writing seems as good as last season , but the picture quality is so poor I 'm not sure I will bother to watch the whole season.One good thing I can say is that the picture quality for NCIS Season Nine was slightly worse on DVD than BLUE BLOODS Season Two . Maybe TV studios do n't care about viewers watching on the DVD format , and just want it to die already . Well , NCIS is dead to me . And if BLUE BLOODS does n't get their video act together they will be dead to me too . @ hg47	-1
Another full year of Nikita and Percy playing cat and mouse . The ongoing chase becomes boring and predictable . If these folks are so highly trained and skilled how is it they can not finish a job ? This becomes laughable and greatly annoying .	-1
If you want to watch CSI Miami , season 10 , I recommend you avoid the DVD version and upgrade to Blu-Ray now as the TV studios obviously want . The picture quality of TV on DVD is on a downward slide for many series . The TV studios are deliberately shipping DVD discs with inferior video to kill the format and to make Blu-Ray look better than it is . Here , the DVDs are so blurry I ca n't watch them . I CA N'T SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING ! I own most , possibly all seasons of CSI Miami on DVD ; the early seasons are fine , 10 is a visual mess.SEA HUNT Season One on DVD 1958 *underwater* has sharper picture quality than CSI MIAMI Season Ten DVDs . I 'm not joking : if you do n't believe me , check it for yourself ! CBS wants us on Blu-Ray.I have yet up upgrade my viewing to Blu-Ray ; but there may also be another factor at play . Remember first generation STAR TREK , where the close-up shots of the sexy female guest star would be shot through a lens that made her look sexier by blur ? David Caruso would look like a wrinkled grandfather if Blu-Ray did a high-resolution close-up on his face ; and Emily Procter is also getting up there in years . I suspect a state-of-the-art optical lens during shooting supplies just the right blur for the Blu-Ray discs to obscure the age of the stars , knocking the actual viewing experience back down into the DVD realm ; but the studio ca n't ship the exact same viewing experience on both DVD and Blu-Ray discs , so the studio adds an additional digital blur to the DVD discs.Can you say , time for a Class Action Suit ? @ hg47	-1
Ok , so all the CSI sresies have wooden acting , dumb plots and poor writing . However this is even worse because of David Carusos lame overacting . Watching him take his sunglasses on and off and his pathetically delivered jokes at the crime scene are sadly funnier than most comedies .	-1
Like most of the comments say , there is no substance , just eye candy.Like my parents used to say , if you want to watch something , watch a show where you can learn something from/that has a moral story.Most shows these days are glorifying pre-marital sex.In the real world , there are kids having kids , different daddies.But to each her own .	-1
This show starts with a bratty , impolite and grating northerner coming to a southern town to be a doctor . It shows us ( southerners ) as hoop-wearing idiots with gators for pets . It stereotypically degrades southerners as nit-wits and incompetents . I could not stomach this show -- if I were from south Alabama , I would be tempted to sue the network for their portrayal . Silly show ( although I do have a gator in my pond but he is NOT a pet ; now that would be silly ) .	-1
real unique -- lead female wears spike heels ( women are grotesque to look at unless dressed 4 men , say the network execs ) -- that 's real different , a female lead in spike heels . u know what else is different ? the hair . real different . longish ( women 's hair should flirt with breasts , say the network execs ) . and eye makeup . lots and lots and lots and lots of it ( womens eyes ugly w/out pound per eye of makeup , say the network execs ) .but wait , get to the unique part u say ! ok -- unique part -- a woman goes to a town where she feels ( at first ) superior and says clever superior things . how unique is that ! ( suburgatory is n't that clever and superior . ) and wait , there 's more ... there 's the boy ... oh , he 's SO unique .	-1
Ingredients : many swoshy sounds , light flashes between scenes , many raised eyebrows when someone says something ordinary , over acting , staged meetings with the boss man calling in via telephone , incredible leaps of logic , ill-logic . Remember kids , it 's not what you say , it 's how enthusiastic you say it that makes something true ! Yaaaay !	-1
Amazon Prime apparently only includes the first episode , so I 'm only rating the first episode.Despite the intriguing title of this series , it is laced with inaccuracies and pseudoscience , backed by testimonials that are little more than rumors .	-1
This could be a really good show but it 's too Hollywood with loud music , zip by photography and they drag everything out . I stopped watching it after a few shows .	-1
These are worst bunch of goobers on TV . Brad stays home and proves Mount Rushmore is a racist plot and Lincoln was gay . The minions stumble around the country to try to prove his inane theories .	-1
Once again frontline takes a topic , that 's been handled in 60 different ways and tries to convince you that they 're doing something unique heroine is bad you will get addicted to it very easily and ruin your life . So now frontline tries to insert stories of collateral damage from Mr. brownstone my heart goes out to that girl and her family but could n't you say using her stories entertainment is somewhat depressing I would not recommend this documentary for someone withdrawling from opium or any opium derivatives it will only make you feel worse and you do n't need that at this juncture after two with three of these documentaries you 've seen them all respectfully Johnny Irish	-1
Great set of players but the introduction of former & # 34 ; stars & # 34 ; tainted it greatly . Boston Rob showed the world what true lies and deceit can do . This made me see the show no longer as a game but as real life played out .	-1
***SPOILER ALERTS***What starts out semi-promising as a young man inherits his grandmothers luxurious apartment , he is being video-blogged by some hot chick on the street . He basically dismisses her and requests not to be videoed . He moves into his place and strange things slowly happen . He starts to get suspicious that people are out to get him and basically oust him from the apartment , either because they feel it is wrongfully his or some other reason . He makes noises and disrupts the other tenants in the building , constantly challenging him to quiet down . The chick he met on the street , for whatever reason she felt she needed to see him again , finds her way to the apartment . He lets her and have a wonderful dinner and commence whatever relationship with some nighttime love session . She gets up in the middle of the night to video tape his apartment and all the things in it . Then , what we dont see , she gets assaulted somehow . What was it ? A ghost ? Another person ? We dont know what happens to her.Our mild-mannered tenant wakes up without really wondering what happened to her ( or so it seemed ) . The whole `` who is there '' premise escalates to the level of paranoia as he traps himself in his apartment with handmade weapons and booby traps of his own making . He has like 12 days to establish himself as the official owner of the apartment and it took a matter of 12 days to become completely insane . Not sure that is likely , but that is what we have here . In the end , he is ultimately undone by his own boobytraps and dies by a wall of nails impaled upon himself.The epilogue : a small boy finds a laptop . Certainly , when we open anyone 's laptop we go right to the incriminating videos . Right ? Happens all the time . So this little boy is watching and we see the previous tenant dragging the body of the chick , apparently he killed . And this is done all spooky like with chopped up frames and blurred motion , because hi-def video cameras on today 's market for some reason are able to do that kind of thing . Which begs the question - is he a ghost or is it just done for effect ? Probably the latter . Anyway , as he approaches closer to the camera , he turns to it and then does something that looks like he is attacking the camera . What ? ! ? Why is he assaulting the camera ? Anyway . Stupid film .	-1
The movie reminded me a little of `` Paranormal Activity '' in that it has some hand held camera shots as well as using things like `` DAY NINE . '' It reminded me of the classic `` House '' as there was a huge hole in the closet that apparently `` things '' were coming through.Danny Hill 's grandmother dies in the opening scene . Danny ( Van Hansis ) becomes a squatter in her apartment on the advice of Joe , the Doorman ( Thorsten Kaye ) and Joe 's lawyer friend . He wants the apartment for the same rent control price his grandmother had it . The landlord wants Danny out so he can rent the 3500 square foot , downtown NYC apartment for big bucks . Joe gets Danny everything he needs to stay there , unfortunately there are weird things going on in the apartment and Danny quickly develops cabin fever.The movie does n't have a lot of characters and is practically a one man play . The movie plays you along to the end.F-bomb , brief night time sex , no nudity . 2 1/2 stars at best .	-1
What is it with so many incoherent screenplays these days ? This guy tries to survive slowly going insane in a creepy apartment because if he lasts long enough , he can have it to live in . Okay ... and it ends ironically and rather predictably . What is the point ?	-1
A young couple ( Thandie Newton and Cillian Murphy ) take a retreat to a remote island off the coast of England to rekindle the flame in their marriage . There is a deafening silence between them and allusions to a stillbirth in the air . All is going unswimmingly until an injured British soldier ( Jamie Bell ) washes up on their shore . When he comes out of his unconscious state he relates a tale of an epidemic racing through Britain . He heeds the couple to take the necessary precautions or face the consequences . Is he angel or devil ? What do you think ? An eight year old could have written a better script . This thriller is totally bereft of suspense . It telegraphs most of it 's shocks ( Look , Dear . I found a rifle . ) rendering them meaningless . Completely wasted is a genuinely menacing turn by Bell . Just goes to show that the Brits can make formula garbage just like their American compatriots .	-1
Martin ( Cillian Murphy ) and Kate ( Thandie Newton ) are a married couple who go off and live on an island . She had a stillborn and the day after she came out of the hospital her husband was at work . In her blog she has a secret of her own she ca n't tell Martin ( one that is n't worth waiting for ) . The house is huge and they have plenty of food and even electricity from a finicky basement generator and Internet access . Kate is distant and aloof from the start as Martin is the more likeable of the characters.Kate retreats to the bath and does n't allow her husband to see her naked , as she appears extremely disturbed , blaming Martin for everything . Then suddenly a man in military fatigues , sinisterly armed with a pistol shows up on the island and passes out from his head trauma . Jack ( Jamie Bell ) the injured man recovers and informs Martin there is a deadly airborne virus killing off the world 's population and is headed `` our way . '' He wants to seal up the house which is on a cold remote island.The couple doubts Jack 's story but have no way to verify it or leave the island . They are prisoners in their own house in a slow developing home invasion film . Twist at the end makes the whole film a waste of time.F-bomb , no sex or nudity .	-1
Like many other long time X-Fans , I 'm afraid I found this one an immense disappointment . I know it 's easy to fall into hyperbole , but in all honesty , this may well be the single most boring cartoon I 've ever seen.On the plus side , on a purely technical level the animation is superb . About as subtle as a tattoo of a flaming skull , but technically superb . Oh , and almost all of the chicks are drawn with giant racks , too . And when I say `` giant '' , I really do mean giant . The kind that in the real world could only be achieved with truly industrial quantities of silicone.Actually , aside from the fact that everyone keeps their clothes on , the style of animation here is very much in the mould of high-budget R-rated anime . I 'm not just talking about the spandex-clad chests - there 's also the splatter and the gore . Measured purely in terms of screen time , the amount of violence in this show is probably about the same as you 'd find in any other superhero cartoon . However , the feel and the texture of that violence is very different from what many viewers will be used to . There 's something positively gratuitous about the way it 's drawn . Indeed , it could almost be described as erotic ... If that 's your thing.And yet , despite all the violence and the chicks with the giant racks , the truth is that this has to be one of the most profoundly boring pieces of television I 've ever seen . The problem is ... Well , let me explain with a story.I remember back when I was about seven years old and I thought Star Wars was the greatest movie ever made . I also thought that because the best parts of Star Wars were the space battles , would n't Star Wars be even better if it was just one long space battle ? Of course , I now know that it simply does n't work that way . However technically impressive , however visually awe-inspiring , those climactic battles only mean something when we 're emotionally invested in the characters . If we fundamentally just do n't care about Luke Skywalker or the world he inhabits , we also wo n't care that much when - or indeed if - he blows up the Death Star . The special effects are reduced to being _just_ special effects . An impressive technical achievement to be sure , but nothing more than that.Unfortunately , that 's the way it is with this show.In this series , in place of real character development all we get are emotional histrionics . In place of real storytelling , scenes of gratuitous violence are interspersed with lengthy and turgid exposition . And in those very rare , brief moments when things are n't gratuitously violent , histrionic , or even turgid , everyone suddenly becomes inanely bright and cheery for no apparent reason.The honest truth is that at no point did I find myself caring about the characters in this story even the tiniest little bit . The animators could have drawn us an episode in which every single one was fed slowly into a meat-grinder and it 'd barely have rated a yawn.Frankly , I would just have found it as unutterably boring as every other episode in the series.Theo .	-1

Early Bret Easton Ellis novels and their subsequent film adaptations were famous for portrayals of disaffected youth doing naughty things and contemplating life . Now , imagine a handful of characters in their forties doing the same thing , and you 've got I Melt With You . Rob Lowe , Jeremy Piven , Thomas Jane , and Christian McKay are old college buddies who meet up annually at Big Sur to celebrate a birthday , but with their own families and hidden secrets plaguing them , they embark on a week of drugs and parties until a tragedy forces them to face their past . Steer clear of I Melt With You , the film 's laughable script and ludicrous plot points do nothing to help the actors trying so desperately to make something of the material .	-1
The acting was great but the movie felt like it was dragging on . The drug use took away from character development and the plot was lacking . With such a great cast , I was expecting something better.The sound track was good though .	-1
There are two questions one has to propose after watching an overwrought parable of a film like `` I Melt With You . '' Is the movie any good ? And is it worth watching ? I know some who feel these answers are always the same , but I do n't . If someone asked me if Mark Pellington 's outrageous examination of middle-aged regret was good , I 'd have to say no . So over-the-top and patently ridiculous , the movie is an absolute mess tonally and thematically ( even to the point of morphing into a thriller for its conclusion ) . But is it worth watching ? There 's something to be said about the absolute madness of it all that makes `` I Melt With You '' sickly fascinating . Even as I was laughing at how inept the story line felt , the movie kept pushing into greater and greater outrageousness . And I must admit , there is an odd entertainment factor to be gleaned from this unpredictability . While it may not be a `` good '' movie , it patently refuses to back down and play it safe . I respect that as well . My rating , therefore , is divided . I give it one star on merit and three stars for its bold commitment to lunacy . Overall , I 'll make it two stars and predict that this is the love-it or hate-it proposition of the season.The movie introduces four childhood friends who get together once a year for a week of insane debauchery . Without much preamble or development , we meet the guys briefly in their everyday lives before they assemble at an isolated chalet . Thomas Jane , Jeremy Piven , Rob Lowe , and Christian McKay play the quartet and it 's clear that , as a whole , they 've been a pretty privileged bunch . But looks can be deceiving , or so the screenplay would have you believe . Each man is haunted by regret and the life not chosen . Despite being successful professionals ( some with families ) , the trip instantly devolves into a drug-fueled music video of bad acts and excess . The movie , in these early scenes , has so little plot momentum that it seems a repetitive ( and rather silly ) glorification of poor choices and a complete disconnection with recognizable humanity . As each man faces his supposed demons and idealizes a more innocent time , the movie slows down to hear their hard luck stories . But one tragedy and a childhood promise will forever change these men . I wo n't reveal any more than that , other than to say that the movie just gets systematically more loony as it progresses.With pulsing music , disjointed camera work , and absolute hysterics , the movie becomes a preposterous thriller . To their credit , the actors never waver and all serve up deliciously over-the-top interpretations of `` real '' people . I know some will consider the subject matter provocative and thought-provoking , but it 's so far out there -- you ca n't take any of it seriously . But by the time the film enters its final 45 minutes ( and the great Carla Gugino shows up ) , the movie has jumped a school of sharks ( not just one ) to enter bad movie nirvana . It 's so bad , it 's good ! I 'm not sure how anyone would get deep meaning out of `` I Melt With You , '' although its central premise is sound enough . If you do , however , good on you ! For me , it 's a master class of excess that takes itself way too seriously and thus becomes an absolute treat for lovers of bad movie mayhem . Without the slow start , maybe I 'd have rated this higher for the delirium ! As is , though , I hated it AND loved it ( but for all the wrong reasons ) , yet am hard pressed to actually recommend it . Despite those that will proclaim it some sort of modern masterpiece , there 's a reason its critical consensus on Metacritic is 26 out of 100 . KGHarris , 8/12 .	-1
This is actually a painful movie to watch and although the Richard character is truly disturbing ifnot despicable , the others are pretty well not worth watching at all . There is so much drug and alcoholuse that the humanity is erased from the film . Awful . Do not bother unless you yourself are part ofthis drug culture that 's being portrayed .	-1
Mark Pellington 's Sundance disaster , titled 'I Melt With You ' , is one of the strangest , incredibly maddening and tonally challenged films that I have seen all year . There are pros and cons - more of the latter than the former - and it is easy to see why so many critics have slashed it to bits . With that being said , it is certainly not as bad as everyone thinks it is , but it could have been a whole hell of a lot better.The film focuses on the yearly reunion of four friends who went to college together in the eighties . Every one of these individuals somehow failed to live the dream , and as a result , they have taken questionable paths in life . Over the course of a drug-filled week , the men reminisce on the past , proceed to wax philosophical on the present , listen to the music of their youth , party with girls , drink obscene amounts of hard liquor , snort mountains of coke , and pop every pill known to mankind . Between this foursome , moments of sobriety are extremely rare - the main characters remain intoxicated for at least two thirds of the running time.The 'Big Chill ' meets 'Scarface ' vibe comes to a screeching halt when one of the men , racked with guilt over the death of his lover , commits suicide - a tragic occurrence which is partially linked to a pact the four men made twenty five years ago , which all of them , save for one , managed to forget . You read that correctly . Twenty five years prior to this particular reunion , these boys made a binding promise to one another - a contract , signed in blood . When the film reveals exactly what the promise entails , it is a shocking discovery.This begins a downward spiral that neither one of them can escape . It is here that the tone of the film changes for the worse , and as a result , becomes more than a bit preposterous . The cast includes Thomas Jane , Jeremy Piven , Rob Lowe , and Christian McKay . The performances are hit ( Christian McKay ) and miss ( just about everyone else , especially Thomas Jane ) .The first half of the film is pretty decent , and I was disappointed to see it devolve so quickly . What could have been an extremely provocative study of broken dreams and arrested development becomes a hopelessly melodramatic pile of drivel.Rated R , 122 minutes , directed by Mark Pellington , released by Magnolia Pictures . Available on Blu-ray and DVD on February 28th from Magnolia Home Entertainment .	-1
This is definitely a weak series . It 's an interesting premise but I just found so much of it cliched and PC 'd out it 's hard to swallow . First of all the very silly idea that some ex-rebel soldier would chase various people , even be able to do that much after a chaotic war , in order to get revenge for his wifes death-GAG . The main character has such wooden acting it 's hard to care much about anything he does , even cold blooded murder in revenge . Some ex-slave owner part of the despotic South is hard to have much sympathy for . Oh and he 's a saint too he just pays the ladies of the evening for services not rendered because of his noble nature-GAG . This is all just blather.This IS a ripoff of Deadwood down to the 2 friends looking to make an enterprise in a dangerous place , the Irish film projectionists ( see Deadwood if you do n't know who I 'm comparing them to ) . I could care less about them too . Ugh the PC cliches just abound here . Everyone 's represented , the blacks , the Indians , the British heroin , the evil bossman and yes the wronged rebel so sad-GAG . Everyone gets their small piece of heaven in each episode here so we can all get our pre-ordained PC helping.For anyone used to watching the HBO/Showtime stuff this is just too weak and shallow . Now I 'm sure all you people who bought this will disagree , of course if you bought it you disagree ! Ever notice how that works ? It 's hard to be critical of your own choices or yourself is n't it ? This review is not for those who have bought this ( or are paid to give good reviews ) it 's for those looking for an honest opinion of this series who are thinking of watching it or buying it .	-1
I am a fan of historical fiction when it is done WITHOUT a political agenda . Good historical fiction sticks as close to the truth as possible to educate as well as entertain . Sometimes the writer needs to improvise to keep the storyline flowing -- but it also should be as close to the truth as possible.The writers REPLACED the Irish immigrants who were the majority immigrant population who built the eastern portion of the railroad ( along with Poles , Italians , Swedes and Germans ) with arrogant & # 34 ; in-your-face & # 34 ; Farrakhan blacks . The Chinese who built the western portion are barely mentioned . I am an advocate of giving credit where credit is due and to write a series given blacks credit for what others have done I find insulting.I will not buy the politically correct Hollywood formula & # 34 ; White/Black/Female & # 34 ; second season .	-1
Is it original ? Yeah . Is it poorly done ? Yes , definitely . Very bad show . It 's hard to care about any of the characters . The actors are just there for a paycheck . If you 're a dullard , you 'll think this is a great show . If you 've seen better , forget it .	-1
As much as Cullen Bohannon 's adventures are interesting , and Colm Meaney 's character is compelling , and Tom Noonan is just ... wacko , sadly the show does n't work as well as it should.The show , as another reviewer here pointed out , is DEADWOOD Light . It even uses many of the same tropes as that program did ( mysterious and violent yet forthright man ; naive yet beautiful recent widow ; SOB boss who runs everything in the surrounding area ; unconventional and troubled preacher ) , but that 's nothing revolutionary to a Western . These are pretty common all around.The story of the building and connecting of the Transcontinental Railroad is pretty darned compelling , but obviously , that needs to be dressed up a little more : The Black and Irish workers , the side-businesses in the camp , the little pieces of subterfuge and manipulation ; this is apparently the drama driving the show forward . Again , sadly , it 's just not compelling enough to maintain interest for those who have seen this show before and seen it better cough*DEADWOOD*cough.While freshman showrunners Tony and Joe Gayton ( who also wrote the somewhat-entertaining Dwayne Johnson/Billy Bob Thornton B-movie FASTER ) deserve props for doing their very best to make this look and feel authentic , the characters and the story are just too bland and too stock ( much like FASTER ) and the performances , with a few exceptions , do n't flesh them out further . I really wanted to like this show , too , since AMC has a few of the very best shows on TV right now . I DVR 'd every episode and watched the first four , but everytime I thought about watching a new episode , I just felt like it was a chore , and that is not the feeling you want when you sit down to watch TV . Oh , well .	-1
Is this show about nature or about man involving himself in nature . In episode 1 a terrible narrator who talks way too much throughout the documentary speaks for 15 minutes about how he is within 15 meters of the eagle and the eagle is staring at him . Episode 2 is about a lonely man that raises a dozen wild turkeys from birth . You never actually learn anything except that the man is sad when he loses his turkeys . This show seems more about the people filming them than about nature .	-1
For some writer 's block reason a skilled pickpocket does n't understand high school biology about reproduction and gets a girl pregnant and does n't understand how it was possible . Duh ! Anyway , tediously long script showing the pickpocket art of stealing cellphones to pay a debt to a not-so-nice fence while running from the cops . Stereotypes of coping with the girl 's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around . Usual stereotypes of dumb cops , double crosses and redemption . Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why , Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying , stealing , avoiding responsibility , drinking , bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses .	-1
Tossing bits of formula storyline into a box and shaking it does not produce anything but jumbled stuff . Just a few examples follow even though the entire movie is poorly edited , directed and the acting came across as actors just acting the roles and not understanding the roles . This potpourri strains credulity which for this type of movie you have to have. ( 1 . ) Pointless most of the first half hour showcasing partying at a climbing lodge . Helicopter scenic shots of hills , birds and the usual vehicle on a road . Overbearing drum and piano pounding sound effects to create tension when the acting and story is flat. ( 2 . ) Lots of scenes of Scottish Highlands at camera angles that made hills look like mountains ; streams look like white water rapids . Pointless time spent on a very small town pagan honorific festival with fireworks made to look like New York City July 4th , all through different angles of the same firework . Lots of scenes of climbing equipment being assembled with multiple camera angles ; turning a 30 ' drop into one that looked much further. ( 3 . ) People seem to repeatedly always show up at the same location despite the remote isolation . The first was our climbing group coincidentally finding a girl buried underground in a forest with only a small breathing pipe . The second that two hunters happen to be in the same spot . Then two more just walk up at the same remote spot and kill those hunters . then these two always seem to show up at the same location as our climbing party which has now split into two groups going in different directions yet all three groups seem to show up at the same location . Clever editing , in this case , made instanteous space travel possible. ( 4 . ) Buried girl is a kidnapped Serb Croatian - of course , since that 's a currently popular ethnic plot point in movies . How the girl looks clean and fresh after being buried for days and the 3 inches of forest ground cover above her box looks undisturbed is quite a burying trick . She could have just pushed the lid up. ( 5 . ) Same girl is swept downstream and ends up underwater for ten minutes yet is revived by just breathing into her lungs . Hello , she should be dead and besides her lungs should have had water in them which needed to be cleared out first . When she revives it 's as if she 's waking from a nap. ( 6 . ) Climber falls down a hill and severely breaks an arm but later he using it just fine , then he says it was his leg that 's broken so then he starts limping even though he was running previously when it was suppose to be his arm. ( 7 . ) Female climber is upstairs in an apartment that 's engulfed in flames . She passes out , but in the next scene firemen are carrying her away . Such fast firemen ( more editing ) yet when the gunmen ( who again seem to always know where to be ) are going through the town shooting anyone they do n't like , the police are no where to be seen.The ending reflected the movie in that it made little sense and went nowhere . Seemed like an afterthought finish . Great , and even good , movies pay attention to details and not just assume the audience is a bunch of not-paying attention toadstools .	-1
Five mountaineers in the Scottish Highlands inadvertently get involved in a crime when they rescue a kidnapped Serbian girl in the woods . Following the tradition of thriller genre that is best represented by John Boorman classic `` Deliverance , '' Julian Gilbey 's movie `` A Lonely Place to Die '' starts out promisingly , but rapidly descends into a series of nonsense.I can generally ignore plot holes as long as a film is good enough to entertain us . Unfortunately , `` A Lonely Place to Die '' is not good in most aspects . Action is mostly derivative with cardboard characters that can not make a sensible decision even when `` villains '' are not around . Melissa George plays Alison , a seasoned mountain climber who should have known that climbing down a cliff is not a very good idea when some criminals responsible for the girl 's imprisonment might be back in any minute.The film ditches its original idea of the cat-and-mouse thriller in the Scottish mountains in its third act , where things get even more ridiculous and confusing . Without spoiling much , all I can say is that a third party arrives in the climax that is padded out with drawn-out dialogues and unexciting action sequences involving guns.Obviously there is the potential for an intense thriller , which seems buried somewhere in `` A Lonely Place to Die . ''	-1

This movie makes absolutely no sense . It 's about a bunch of 19th century hookers . Thought it might be an interesting topic and go into other aspects of history -- but no . It 's just about the hookers . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Did n't hold my interest and turned off the film after the first five minutes . That 's my impression and not a slam on this film without viewing it longer .	-1
A really boring soft-core porn film rather than a French art film . As best I can tell there was no plot . if you 're looking for a god foreign film pass this one up ! !	-1
Just what we need . Another deeply depressing downer about dealing with the death of a child . This time we have Ethan ( Thomas Dekker from TV 's `` Terminator : The Sarah Conner Chronicles '' ) , a 20 something dad who has custody of his 3 year old son . He is divorced from his alcoholic , skanky sleep-around wife ( Lynn Collins ) . The film is set in the fictitious Angels Crest , Montana ( filmed in the Alberta Rockies ) , occupied by a small but close community of gorgeous people , at least all that are under 50.The town has a diner where everyone gathers and exchange gossip about each other . The diner is run by Angie ( Mira Sorvino ) , the sympathetic big sister type . We know we are in for rough sledding early on when Ethan takes his 3 year old out into the wilderness to build a snowman . The poor kid falls asleep and dad decides to leave him in the truck and track down some deer . I mean , there is all kind of wildlife in this mountainous region , but you would think this guy had never seen a deer . When Ethan returns to the truck 10 or 15 minutes later , the kid is gone . Somehow he had managed to escape his car seat , roll down the window and escape.Well , there is no happy ending and it is hard to not feel for the poor schmuck as you would anyone . No one in town feels anything but sympathy including the town lesbians played by Elizabeth McGovern as the former straight , married with-a-son one and Kate Walsh in all her butchiness . Then there 's Cindy 's ( Collins ) mother the Evangelical and Jeremy Piven as the D.A . who is going to prosecute Ethan . Jack ( Piven ) it seems has a past of his own . Something about losing his only child , but we never learn the particulars . Then there 's the best friend of Ethan who has also been sleeping with Cindy . Whew ! There 's more but you get the idea.In a tragedy play like this , the director got too involved with the numerous characters . In addition , some of the scenes are just ridiculous . In one , Jack the prosecutor ( Piven ) shows up at a potential witness 's house wearing one of those furry hats with the earflaps that tie ... and it never comes off . In another , Ethan decides to take Angie 's three year old daughter for a ride in his truck without telling her . This is after his son dies ! Are you kidding me ? Anyway , forget this film unless you want to go into a manipulated deep state of depression , albeit with some beautiful snowy Rocky Mountain vistas . A much better , but similar themed movie of this nature is Atom Egoyan 's `` The Sweet Hereafter '' ( 1997 ) .	-1
My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring . The acting was OK , but the author left something to be desired .	-1
Every show has interesting things that come into the Pawn Shop . However , I am extremely tired of the jousting , barbs and insults form the Old Man ( especially ) , and that Rick never has a good job or good word for Cory or Chum . I 've stopped watching almost . I do n't watch nearly as much as I did in the past .	-1
We love Pawn Stars and appreciate being able to stream it but ... Amazon 's responsiveness has been horrid ! ! ! They must improve on the responsiveness of the equipment serving up these videos . I essentially gave up after viewing just one episode ( which we loved ) .The problem is n't once the streaming starts , but it is getting the system to the point where an episode can be selected and then started . I 'm using a Roku3 box .	-1
The people on & # 34 ; reality & # 34 ; tv are fake and they encourage our youth to laziness and an inability to use their intelligence for anything but staring dumbly at the television .	-1
I really enjoy seeing trinkets and treasures coming out and the value put on them . But I can not stand the pompous attitude that pervades the show through the slob characters . It 's so bad that I just turn the program off midway . I 'll take American Pickers and the storage war people over the Pawn Stars any day any time .	-1
I think it 's boring but the Mr. likes it . Not much changes from episode to episode . It must be a guy thing .	-1
Explanation For Lower Rating : I 'm not sure what the History Channel is doing with their DVD releases this year , but it is certainly a step in the wrong direction . When they released `` Pawn Stars : Volume Three , '' many people assumed that the show would be Season Three as the other two seasons of the program had been released in their entirety . It was , in fact , only sixteen episodes . When they released `` American Pickers : Volume Two , '' it was the same thing . Season One had been released with all episodes , but this Volume Two was only eight episodes of Season Two . I know some people that preordered sight unseen , or just were n't paying attention , felt a little shortchanged by these smaller portions as opposed to what they had assumed were full season DVD releases . Personally , I did n't agree with the decision but , at least , the DVD packaging was very clear about what was included . Anyone who read the box knew what to expect : how many episodes and which ones , so it was n't a blind investment ! Now here 's a leap backwards for `` American Pickers , Volume 4 . `` I am sitting here with the DVD in hand and nowhere does it say how many episodes are inside . Never mind that it does n't list them ( which in my opinion it should if it is not a Complete Season package ) , it does n't even tell you how many episodes you are getting . I suppose I 'm supposed to look at the running time and do some estimated mathematics ? I know this may seem trivial to some or that I 'm overreacting , but I think the company owes potential buyers this information . My lower rating , therefore , reflects the History Channel 's ( or A & E ; Networks distributing ) apparent disregard for its own fan base . I do n't like to make purchases without knowing exactly what I 'm paying for ! It 's not the price ( which is in line with the contents ) , it 's the lack of information that bothers me.I , however , will tell you what is inside . The 2 DVD set has eight episodes , a chronological continuation of Season Two for just shy of six hours worth of programming . Really , how hard would it have been to include the fact that there were eight episodes on the DVD box ? Season Two : ( 1 ) Fairlane Fever , ( 2 ) Too Hot To Handle , ( 3 ) Trading Up , ( 4 ) The Emu Chase , ( 5 ) Keep Out ! , ( 6 ) They Boldly Go , ( 7 ) The Possum Trot , and ( 8 ) California Dreamin . There are no special features , but there are Spanish and English subtitle options.The premise , for anyone unfamiliar with the show , is that two `` pickers '' ( Mike Wolfe and Frank Fritz ) travel the country trying to unearth hidden treasures from the various people they meet along the way . Some of the items may have historical significance . That 's the angle the History Channel uses to tie the show into its lineup . In truth , the show has similar appeal to the classic `` Antique Roadshow '' mixed with the treasure hunting gamble of `` Storage Wars '' with a dash of `` Hoarders '' thrown in for good measure . It 's always intriguing to see what long forgotten gems might be lurking in someone 's garage or junkyard . Along the way , the boys chat up the locals and experience a different kind of Americana . An interesting show , but fans deserve some respect in these DVD releases . KGHarris , 8/12 .	-1
Why people should expect a movie to emulate a book makes no sense . They are totally different mediums with their own strengths to be taken advantage of and weaknesses to be avoided . They are separate stories that share a common bond . Example : I thought `` Help '' was better as a book ( actually what my imagination created ) than as a movie but the movie had it 's acting strengths.As far as `` Bag of Bones '' it was too formula driven and loaded with stereotypes . Usual writer searching for inspiration ; loses wife ; goes to rural Maine ( of course ) ; encounters murder mysteries ; has dreams ; has romantic affair ; things turn inexplicably on and off ; windows/doors/drawers open & close ; bad townsfolk are hiding a secret ; spirits appear ; spirits lose power when dug up . Help ! How repetitively redux.Acting was OK but dialogue sounds like it came from a too cloistered Hollywood writer - simply not realistic conversations . CGI effects of ghostly dead people was standard '40s movie making boring . Some effects were more laughable than scary such as lightning hitting a sign which happens to land on and kill some townsfolk ( cheaply shown as an old pickup catching fire ) and a tree that looks sort of human shaped that gives a jolt when touched , finally a CGI face appears on the trunk while a branch or two take a swat at our hero-writer ( the trees in `` Alice ... '' and in `` Wizard of Oz '' were scarier ) .	-1
This lost my attention ten minutes in . It was stupid , flat and boring and I never finished it . It did n't live up to Steven King 's other works .	-1
Not my cup of tea . Used as background noise while using my PC mostly . I really do n't think casting a British & # 34 ; pretty boy & # 34 ; as a Maine outdoors & # 34 ; man & # 34 ; fit the part either .	-1
That 's about it . He is engaging , but the rest of it is actually a dull slog despite the storyline , violence , and other characters . Too bad . I am sure the book was better ; I read it some time ago , since I always read King 's work .	-1
If you must watch this I would say watch teh first half and turn it off , as soon as you hit the horrorifying slaughter house footage , its downhill.This could have been a really powerful wonderful documentary but instead decided to be over the top Peta ad.All the hidden footage of animals in slaughter houses are not given enough context.Go watch Forks over Knives you will learn more .	-1
I thought this would be a nice little film about what to eat and how to get healthy as a vegan . Not so much . I should have known when they went to the grocery store and she was showing them what was and was n't considered a vegan product . Did you know Oreo 's are vegan ? Yep ! Wow , and so healthy for you ... That 's when I realized the film maker was n't so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan , but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty . Yeah , and do n't even get me started on all the soy crap they `` discover '' . Soy is not a health food , people ! ! Personally , I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated . I read `` Diet For a New America '' many years ago and it totally opened my eyes . I was not interested in seeing that again . I understand that she wanted to prove a point , but I do n't like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with . It felt like the filmmaker 's only justification for being a vegan was the fact that animals raised as food are treated badly . It was n't about health at all . The message I got was `` become a vegan so no more animals have to suffer '' .And , if you do n't know anything else , you 're going to watch this and believe that ALL food animals are treated inhumanely.I had to stop watching this movie about half-way through , so maybe it is n't fair of me to give it a review , but I think it 's important that other people know before going in , what 's in store for them . It was n't what I thought , and I do n't want that message forced down my throat . I 'd rather watch `` Food , Inc. '' I thought it was a million times better than this .	-1

I watched the very first episode but decided that enough was enough . Over the last 8 seasons I have watched as this show has went from interesting paranormal research to scripted reality . This episode was no exception . I have no words on how disappointed I am in Grant and Jason . When the show started they presented Ghost hunting in a positive light . With proper ways to investigate and going to real people 's homes . Now they just look like abunch of bafoons . Jason never believed in everything they heard/saw , but now he cops to anything . It use to be personable and watchable , now it 's just a joke . They 'jumped the shark ' when they brought in the ghost hunting dog . Thanks Grant and Jason for destroying something I loved all in the name of ratings !	-1
Too much fighting , too much he say , she say . These are grown woman in their 40 's . I can believe how they carry themselves . We all hate Karen and Ramona , these are terrible woman .

In all honesty , if I see one more cat jump out from behind a door , I 'm going to shoot my television . I just ca n't bring myself to understand why anyone , ANYONE , would think that that was a good idea . As a film director , how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort , but especially a cat , making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you 're about to see something really terrifying ? It 's beyond my comprehension.That being said , a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film . It happens so often in horror films that you 'd basically have to write them all off . What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just is n't scary . I 'm struggling because I honestly ca n't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously . Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof , you know , like ` Scary Movie ' , but I know that it 's not and that makes me confused . This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I 've ever seen . Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy . It reminds me of when I saw ` Darkness Falls ' and I laughed throughout , which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich & eacute ; s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business . The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up . God , none of this works . The performances are so affected and mannered and just bad and the direction is completely uninspired.I 've seen a lot of bad films this year , but this may be the worst .	-1
This is one `` horror '' that fails to deliver on all counts . While there was a brief period in the first half when I thought the film contained a substantial amount of atomsphere that I 'd probably be able to end up giving the movie 3 stars , unfortunately it never improves . The nonsensical communication between the two main characters ends up wandering WAY too long and thus , completely destroys all potential this movie had . I fully expectd an improvement in storytelling to eventually occur but , again , it never comes . Basically other than the surprise ending , the Innkeepers disappoints.It 's about the character of Sara Paxton roaming around a hotel with a haunted history . She apparently works there at night . A computer-obsessed geeky guy plays the role of the second biggest character and he works behind the counter ... I guess . He spends most of his time on the computer or sleeping upstairs so his job is really easy . He 's more like an arrogant know-it-all that never wins me over that 's for sure , whereas Sara is more of a curious almost jaunty teenager constantly on the alert and jumping around at the slightest bumps she encounters in the night . The other characters that occasionally enter the picture ( such as the old woman in the room upstairs and the curious old man that wants a specific room because it contains memories ) never accomplish anything meaningful and simply feel tacked on for the sake of character diversity.Well apparently this old hotel is haunted , so Sara spends all her time walking around exploring at least half of the rooms . Most of her time is spent in the main room downstairs . However , the problem is that ( despite a complete lack of atomsphere and horror of course ) on several occasions , Sara and the geeky guy basically mock the supposed hauntings taking place here , and the scene with the two of them pretending to investigate a real haunting only to hide under the sheets and rise like a ghost was the breaking point for me- the Innkeepers HAS to be 2 stars . If you 're going to mock horror *in* a supposed horror movie , you 're going to fail miserably . Simple as that.The little bit of blood and suspense during the final 10 minutes is n't the least bit frightening either . The surprise at the end *is* pretty good at least . Unfortunately by that point , you have to sit through over 80 minutes of boring , plotless nonsense so overall it really is a dud of a film . Avoid .	-1
For months leading up to my viewing of this film , all I heard was how clever and creepy and worth-my-time it is . Am I missing something ? This seemed like pretty run-of-the-mill stuff . I agree with many fans of Ti West that he is a talented director who knows how to exercise restraint ( House of the Devil was really good ) and give his films character . However , despite the good direction , atmosphere and acting , I ca n't get past the fact that the ghost story in The Innkeepers was nothing I have n't seen before . Unless , like I said , I missed something . I watched this with a good friend whose opinions are pretty close to my own , and he agreed with me that House of the Devil was much better than The Innkeepers . If you 're a fan of this type of ghost story , and you 're a bit older than the twenty-something set ( like me ) , then you 've probably spent a lot of time watching ghost stories just like this . Throwing a bit of ambiguity into the story near the end did n't do much to help its plot , either . I do n't know , maybe someone out there can tell me what 's sailing over my head because I just do n't get why so many people are rallying around this movie . I just felt it was n't that good even though I really , really wanted to like it .	-1
The first 20 minutes or so the dialogue and acting led me think that a creative , well written and produced haunted movie was in the works . Wrong ! They either quickly ran out of writing inspiration or money or both . It quickly fell into a cheap formulaic abyss . The rest of the movie moves like redundant molasses.Proof ? ( 1 . ) Well , lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over. ( 2 . ) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound . Duh , digital has been around for decades and , anyway , they have a limited frequency and amplitude range , so what 's the point. ( 3 . ) Usual , couple of guests that add nothing to the story and you 're left wondering why they were even in the story . Well , one guy decides to slit his wrists , in a bathtub , of course. ( 4 . ) Usual , mysterious sounds - well , they are in an old hotel ! ( 5 . ) The usual mysterious self-closing door . Actually , a prop person standing behind and pushing it . Scary ! ( 6 . ) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there ; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn . Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes. ( 7 . ) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows : ( 8 . ) Usual girl starts imaging ghosts and locks herself in the basement to subsequently die of fright complications thinking a ghost is chasing her but it 's her co-worker banging on the door .	-1
Too slow-moving when the climax is there it could n't get there soon enough and naturally predictable.Boring at times , and when the `` Horror '' did come it was gross in an bad and distasteful.The movie is more of an thriller than an horror movie , Glad I watched it on Netflix instant first than renting it or owning it.Not enough scares to be scary and not interesting enough for me to watch again .	-1
`` You 're just impatient ! Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere ! If you did n't like this movie , I 'm sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud , angry horror movie one of these days ! This is for TRUE fans of horror ! `` These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West 's slow-burn spookiness . I will grant , as others have done , that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story . I do n't watch movies for atmosphere . That 's why I buy lounge music , or candles , or fake cobwebs in October . If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it , then it 's no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story ? Is n't it scary ? Nope . Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn . With cheeky self-consciousness , they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there . It 's a fairly standard ghost story trope , and the addition of a psychic who has `` reverse deja vu '' does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new . There is , essentially , no story , which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film , The House of the Devil ( girl left alone for a long time , strange goings-on , some people are not who they claim to be , incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written `` chills '' ) .So the story sucks . Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone , even if the plot is confusing or sloppy . Unfortunately , Luke and Claire , while well-acted and realistic enough , are not interesting characters . They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they are n't sure what 's supposed to happen next in the film . Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene ; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy . On the very , very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy , the effect is numbed by Claire 's mopey mugging.I 'm certain it 's meant to be funny , as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music . West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror , though . The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy ! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash ! the coffee girl is socially awkward ! -- but even if they were , they contribute nothing to the story or the characters . All in all , it 's like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring . Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories . He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic . An excellent example is the final shot of the film . My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot , but I saw what all of them missed . I wo n't tell you what it is , but I will say this : if you do n't know it 's there , it 's almost impossible to see it . I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review , like this one , telling me to look for it . And that 's the thing : if your artistry is so subtle , so careful , so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film , then maybe you 're focused too much on the background stuff ( like West 's highly touted skill at creating atmosphere ) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie ( characters , story , conflict ) .Dialogue that treads water . Dull and annoying characters . Almost no story to speak of . Cliched plot . More than your average number of fake scares ( I counted three before the first fifteen minutes ) . Unsatisfying climax and conclusion .	-1
My first relevant question would be - how old was the person who wrote this ? My guess would be somewhere around 12.Good ghost films are rare to be sure , and some make a reasonable effort.This one does not .	-1
Wow , what a boring movie , the cover had all these great reviews of how fantastic this movie is and that it 's the best horror film of the year , what a let down , kept waiting for the horror to come , it did n't , my wife fell asleep it was the interesting , the characters were fine and the acting good , but the story was just not up to par , could not consider this movie as anything but a waste of time , sorry I bought it and paid full price , trying to hard , special effects were nothing special , no scares , they say old time creepy , not really , the old time horror movies that relied on atmosphere and story development are nothing like this movie , do n't waste your time , though the movie might bore you to death .	-1
I was looking for a good horror movie , that fell under the radar , to promote for halloween , and I was told that the Innkeepers was that film , but it was n't . This film is so clique , stealing almost everything from other films of the same genre . They had the nerve to give this movie an R rating and call it the must see horror movie of the year , but truthfully , its slightly more scary than a Disney movie ! An old hotel is going out of business and the two remaining employees decide to investigate the long history of ghost sightings at the establishment . There are only a couple guests , giving them the perfect opportunity to investigate . The only thing this film uses in order to frighten you is random things jumping out at you , which most of the time are n't what you expect them to be . There is also a creepy old woman staying there who can talk to the spirits and predict the future , but if that is n't bad enough , there is of course the investigations themselves . Using nothing but a s***ty old tape recorder , they go looking for EVPs , using every phrase and question they could steal from Ghost Hunters . Yeah , the Innkeepers really is that ridiculous and the only really shocking thing about this movie is that someone actually gave it an R rating ! Was the MPAA associate a little girl or elderly woman , because honestly , Monster House was scarier than this thing was .	-1
`` The Innkeepers '' is a thinking person 's ghost story . That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West ( `` The House of the Devil '' ) attempts to be . He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences . That is a good thing . Unfortunately , the premise of `` The Innkeepers , '' good as it is , ends up being poorly executed . In short , the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary , but all in all tedious . `` The Innkeepers '' centers on two hotel clerks Claire ( Sara Paxton ) and Luke ( Pat Healy ) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon . The hotel , it is rumored , is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley , a bride who died a tragic death many years ago . Claire and Luke , both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities , Claire and Luke , start investigating the legendary ghost , equipped with ghost hunting gear.Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so , keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms . That is not a bad idea . Then , while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax , he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination . The problem is , most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting . `` The Innkeepers '' takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn 's back stories . Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do , while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator . Besides that , not much is revealed about them . With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones ( Kelly McGillis ) as a guest , who gives a warning to Claire , the story finally knows where it should go.Even then , without a compelling storyline and teasing details , the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good . Until then `` The Innkeepers '' is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end , but the characters ' motives remain unclear and unconvincing , and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing . Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension , to be sure , but taking too much time to do so ( and saying too little for that matter ) is a different thing .	-1
This movie was so dull and plodding that I could barely stay awake . It took much too long for anything at all to happen and then the payoff was dissatisfying .	-1
The folks who made this movie were trying for a scify horror story that,1 , does n't show any understanding of science ( you ca n't clone a human from red blood cells-they have no dna ) , and,2 , tries to go for horror with a 'The Shineing ' rip off.What they do succed in is regurgitating anti abortion propaganda , and do the disapearing good christians in the rapture bit.A 'mad scientist ' wants to clone people , why his project is protected by soldiers is anybodies guess . A woman fertility doctor who ca n't have children steals one of the cloned embrios and implants it in her womb in the womens toilet . Cut to 'seven years later ' . The boy heals a dead mouse . Mother takes the boy to see the 'mad scientist ' who by now has had a religous conversion and kills his family so they can go to heaven . He smothers his wife with a pillow and smothers his little girl with a teddy bear . Their bodies disapear leaving only thier clothes behind , just like all the people in the church did . 'Mad scientist ' was trying to clone jesus ! Wants the boy to forgive him ! Shoots mom whos body disapears . But , oops ! , the boy is n't Jesus , he 's the anticrist . Movie ends with him asking satan a 'knock knock ' joke.Do n't waist your time on this ; theres nothing new or well done here .	-1
Excuse the cheesy line , but I 'm Not Jesus Mommy is n't a good film . The film is about Kimberly who decides to impregnate herself with a stolen clone because she 's not capable of having children . The film quickly jumps around from her impregnation , 9 months after that , then another 7 years after that to the apocalypse ; poor storytelling throughout the film may leave you lost . The story really does n't bother explaining much . It 's a slightly interesting story but the acting is terrible . Kimberly , the mother character , has no emotion in her acting and all of her dialogue sounds terrible ; no heart whatsoever in her acting leading to a painful-to-watch performance , she has some potential though . Also , if you watched the teasers/trailers you might be expecting a film similar to The Omen , but it really has only a few similarities.However , I did enjoy the music in the film a lot . Also , David , the child , was often genuinely creepy . I did n't dislike this film because of its scientific or religious elements ; I dislike this film because it 's simply a poorly executed movie.I do not recommend directly paying to watch I 'm Not Jesus Mommy . If you must watch this movie , it is available on Netflix streaming as of 6/17/12 to save some money .	-1
I 'm Not Jesus Mommy ( Vaughn Juares , 2010 ) For the first third or so of its length , save some subpar acting , I 'm Not Jesus Mommy is an intriguing little low-budget movie that , on many levels , makes perfect sense . Kimberly Gabriel ( Bridget McGrath in her first feature ) , an obstetrician , is haunted by her own inability to conceive . When maverick researcher Roger Gibson ( Living Arrangements ' Charles Hubbell ) approaches her with a fat government contract and some snake oil about human cloning , she resists at first , but eventually sees the opportunity in light of her own ulterior motives . The obvious question becomes : how far will a woman go to have a baby ? Then we skip forward seven years , and everything goes to hell . Earth is locked in the middle of a new ice age . The streets are dangerous , there is little food to go around , and Roger , Roger 's sister , Kimberly , and Kimberly 's son David are holed up in a small apartment , only going out when absolutely necessary to procure food . The entire remainder of the film takes place in that apartment.Sounds promising , no ? And perhaps in the right hands , the final two-thirds of the movie could have been turned into the kind of tense sci-fi thriller that Vaughn Juares obviously intended this to be . But , and is n't there always a & # 8220 ; but & # 8221 ; after a statement like that ? , it ... is n't . I 'm not entirely sure how to put this tactfully , so I 'll go with & # 8220 ; I 'm not Jesus Mommy rivals The Room for moments of unintentional hilarity. & # 8221 ; One-room dramas live and die based on the quality of the actors involved , so the & # 8220 ; some subpar acting & # 8221 ; of the first third , which you can gloss over with everything else going on , takes center stage . Add in a script that leaves out just a little too much to be impressionist and never avoids clich & eacute ; & # 8212 ; in fact , runs headlong into it as often as possible & # 8212 ; and you 've got something that ends up being a chore to sit through . Do n't hit play on this one unless you have prepared yourself for an overdose of cheese . *	-1
When I read about the film in Redbox ( Devil 's Angel ) , it reveals information that is not revealed in the film until the last 5-10 minutes . I wo n't do that per se , but the film is so bad , spoilers wo n't matter.Full figured Dr. Kimmy Gabriel ( Bridget McGrath ) can not have a child , but keeps on trying . She is very pro-life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson ( Charles Hubbell ) . She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself . The film jumps to seven years later as the world is thrust into a post apocalyptic nightmare as Kimmy and her son David ( Rocko Hale ) live in a run down tenement living off government MRE handouts.The film has heavy religious messages as both lesion faced Kim and Roger are very religious and frequently read from the Bible and listen to radio preachers . This appears to be a `` come to Jesus film '' except the `` good guys '' do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves . Indeed , if anything they appear to be part of the problem which is to make a statement about the condition of human existence.This film is very low budget . The sets are meager . The acting is bad and dialouge has a religious corniness to it . It fails to get interesting until 10 minutes before the final credits and by then you pray for the end.Knowing the `` secret '' of the film by reading the by-line I could n't help but think during the film ... '' Funny . He does n't look Jewish . `` Parental Guide : No f-bombs , sex , or nudity . Bridget McGrath cleavage .	-1
I 've been reading Norse and Greek mythology since I could pick up a book , and even when I could understand the differences between the two , I knew that for the most part , Thor and Loki got along . Unlike the Greek gods , the Norse gods could die , but they never grew old -- and even Odin retained his savage strength until his death at the battle of Ragnorak . So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive ; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing . Pass on this . True , Loki 's actions in regard to Balder 's passing did lead to Ragnorak and to his own death , as well as Thor 's , Odin 's and the other gods , but he was n't the cackling super villain depicted in these ridiculous cartoons . Buy the movies instead . They 're more entertaining .	-1
Rainbow flag men and boys have so many barriers and biases to face . Richard dealt with his dear sister 's death and being molested for years without others knowing . He 's had it tough , but he still ends up being a jerk here.He kinda reminded me of Andy Bell of Erasure , except I have nothing but respect for Mr. Bell . Richard did some activist/non-profit work ; I 'm guessing he had anti-drug resources that he did n't bother to access . Yes , his brother is/was homophobic , but he seemed more understanding of Richard than the other way around . He is sucking his mother dry of money . The work never mentions HIV/AIDS , but he engaged in lots of activities that I would imagine could put him in great risk.My favorite part of any `` Intervention '' episode is when the addicted person walks into the hotel room and sees their loved ones . Richard was n't even brave enough to stay . You never really see him for the rest of the episode.The episode ends by saying Richard is no longer on drugs . I highly doubt that . He just seemed very nasty and abusive . I ca n't imagine him staying sober . He really needs to do nicer things so he can get some good Karma . Otherwise , he 's in BIG , BIG trouble !	-1
and should not be on tv . There is little redeeming value to this -only shock value . Swamp people is better	-1
This British indy film had received a lot of attentions and favorable reviews , mainly from British film media.The film has a simple story about 2 semi-professional ( ? ) contractors received orders with a `` kill list '' .The first 3 acts are alright with a good cast but the last act is too slight to make it a good and satisfyingthriller and does n't justify the foregoing grisly violence .	-1
This film is a great example of what you get when you forget about the importance of a story . Watch the first scene and pay attention , because that 's exactly how the rest of the film will be . And do n't let all the claims of gore and blood and violence lure you in , either . It 's very tame and unrealistic . Too bad . Next time I hope this director will take the time to tell a story .	-1
First , get actors that can actually speak rather than mumble . Or use subtitles . I have to agree with the kitchen sink analogy . Because that 's pretty much what the writers did . Whatever was in their heads just came barreling out into a total mess . Or they were channeling `` Plan 9 from Outer Space '' . There is nothing coherent about this movie . It simply makes no sense . You can rattle on about Arthurian theories and some grand plan , but the bottom line is that it 's just a bad movie . It 's billed as the number one horror movie of the year . Perhaps my definition of horror is different than the producers of this dreck . Because there was nothing horrifying in this crap . Oh , it was gory and bloody alright . But horrifying ? I 'd call some of the singing on American Idol horrifying , but not this . Perhaps they should let someone with a Hitchcockian background redo this into what could be a very good movie . And just because a movie makes you think , does n't make it good . Actually , the only three thoughts you 'll have is 1 ) what the hell is going on ? 2 ) When will this crap end ? and 3 ) How can I get my money back ? . Go see Expendables 2 . It 's a bad movie too , but at least it 's entertaining . You 'll never say that about Kill List .	-1
got ta say the first 65 percent of the movie is a classic slow burn . wonderfully shot , written and acted . loved the dinner scene . loved the intrigue . loved the mystery ... ..again , slow burn ... that said : the movie , out of nowhere and at the worst possible time takes a complete change of course and ... im not gon na ruin it ... becomes way too symbolic and surreal to be entertaining . im all about having a deeper meaning in films ... but this one just rams its ideals down your throat and tries very hard to be intelligent.shame . the director has a good thing going and then decided to insult the audience by going back to film school and make a pretentious ending . if i wanted to rent Eyes Wide Shut i would have ... this movie could of been a game changer for horror movies for years to come but settled on cliche .	-1
Are you kidding me ! That is the only thing I can say after painfully suffering through watching one the worst non-horror films of all time . This was not scary and the concept was very poor ... watch this if you want to waste time and money .	-1
I could watch this movie three more times and still not understand it , no , I do n't think I could ever understand it .	-1
I 'll be stunned if a worse movie comes out this year . If you liked Wicker Man and thought it needed to be slower , mix more genres , and be a bigger waste of time , then this film will be right up your alley . It 's the kind of film that makes me rethink people 's recommendations because if they liked this then we 're most certainly looking for different things out of two hours of our time .	-1
I just like to listen to the theme song and then i turn it off . if you have seen three episodes you have seen enough .	-1
Reality TV is supposed to bring the `` real world '' to TV . If this program represents reality , give me fantasy any time . Here we have `` Dog '' and his minions prancing around in all their police/military style paraphernalia , followed by a TV crew and they are supposed to be `` sneaking up '' on some residence . Why not just get the local high school band out and really announce your presence in style ? But then again , with the outfit Dog is wearing , perhaps the band would be wasted . Honestly , he looks like a worn out old guy who works Fremont Street in Vegas , charging for tourists to have their photograph taken with him . Ok , so they find a car ( a Sebring we are told many times ) and we are besieged with shot after shot of each of the `` team '' in turn having a look through the car window . Now is n't that really exciting ? And if we are not seeing shots of someone looking through the window of the car , we are continually confronted with shots of Dog 's wife 's legs and her stiletto shoes . Now that is not a pretty sight.Yes , I am sure ( from reading some of the other reviews ) that there are people who really like the show . But from what I have seen , this program is certainly not `` reality '' , it is definitely not entertainment and it is absolutely not worth watching . The best thing that has happened is that this show has finally been `` pulled '' .	-1
Perfect Sense is perfectly awful . It 's about a chef ( Ewan McGregor ) and an epidemiologist ( Eva Green ) , two people who go for each other but who have major relationship problems . They find themselves in the middle of a worldwide epidemic -- after crying a bit people lose their sense of smell . Then taste . Then hearing . Then sight.What can the world do ? What can humanity do ? What can Michael and Susan do ? The answer , my friend , is written by a deeply earnest screenwriter and filmed by an otherwise interesting director : Love each other ... take care of each other ... trust each other . All this is accompanied with a deeply serious voice over that makes sure we understand the importance of what we see , along with a music score that drips with tragedy and then hope.To watch an infinitely better movie by the same director and also starring Ewan McGregor , try the excellent and unpleasant Young Adam .	-1
There are interesting ideas in `` Sense , '' and the performances are uniformly excellent , as is everything from the sets to the musical score , but I found it ponderous , pretentious , and ultimately unappealing . Another reviewer said it 's hard to categorize , and that 's true , although not necessarily a bad thing . Pressed to find a category in which to put `` Sense , '' I list it withChildren of MenandBlindness , which to my mind were both superior films to this one . I think what `` Perfect Sense '' might have been TRYING to be more like isNever Let Me Go , which is in every way better than `` Perfect Sense . '' If you have n't seen `` Never Let Me Go '' yet and have a choice between that and this -- do yourself a favor and go with `` Never . '' ( But if you 're in the mood for sluggish sensuality and diffuse prettiness , you could do much worse than `` Perfect Sense '' -- if you can stand being merely engaged rather than rapt , it will do . )	-1
This may be a promising , interesting series but the accents are so pronounced , it is irritating to try to watch since I do n't understand half of what is said ... .not a good idea on series needing to figure & # 34 ; who dun it ! & # 34 ;	-1
The stories are n't bad , its the principal character that 's the pain . Granted it is season 1 and everyone is trying to find their feet.But , Vera is bad tempered all the time and borderline abusive . The series is as much to do about Vera and her quirks as it is thesolving of crime . If you like police stories where the DCI is a misery guts , then this is for you . I prefer my stories with a lot more class like & # 34 ; Lewis & # 34 ; . You ca n't go wrong with & # 34 ; Lewis & # 34 ; !	-1
I do n't like it but the kids do and they learn to find things or put things together or count . it 's just annoying to me . the voices , the characters especially door mouse who is always negative .	-1
I love Pawn Stars and we do n't get that particular channel where I just moved so I thought I would watch this as a substitute . It is similar but just did n't have the specialness that goes along with their Las Vegas kin .	-1
This is show is on par with VH1 Surreal Life in which I had experienced three episodes due to having the flu and not being able to change the channels . People get very dramatic when the camera is present . Include Gold Rush in that same category.Yeah , why watch if I do not enjoy them ? The same reason I had to check why traffic is slowing down - to see the accident . Scenics awesome , at least on the episodes I had watched . But no more ! Amazon , thank you , for even if these shows are starring the worse actors in the world the picture quality is awesome !	-1
As we began to watch there was interest in the characters and various logging technics . It was the attitude of one boss inparticular that turn us to turning it off . A small big mouth , large temper guy who physically shoved down threatened and also choked co-workers . To serious an occupation for such an immature person . Done watching !	-1
Sorry , just did n't care much for this one . Truthfully did n't watch all of it . A complete wast of time , absolutely nothing there .	-1
I thought me , my mom and step father would like this show so I set it to record on our FIOS . It started out good . I was interested in what was going on . Then something happened . With every episode it got wortse and worse . Let me tell you why . First , every episode , a lawyer , his wife , lawyers brother and brothers girlfriend escape military trained killers . EVERY time . At first I thought , they could n't kill the people because they would get arrested . Everyone would blame them . But then I realized something . No body execpt for about 5 people know what is gong on . It 's not like thousands of people know who is after them . They could go on the street , shoot them in the head and run . No one would ever know who did it . Another thing that bothered me was when the lawyers wife would go talk to his clients about their case . Would never happen . Something else that annoyed me was a few episodes ago . They had the man behind the stuff , the judge saw things that showed he did it , then she said she could n't use it in cort because the lawyer acted as law . Freaking crazy right ? Then the last episode , the way it ended made everything pointless . It is as if they just said `` ok were done with this '' and ended it . What a complete waste of time . It 's not even worth watching the first episode.Oh , another thing , an episode comes on , builds up , up , up goes on commercial , comes back on and starts building up to something new . It is crazy . They need to build up the story through the episode and stick with one thing . They never solve anthing . It 's like you put a bunch of problems in a jar , stick your hand in and pull one out and that is whats next .	-1
This show used to be everything one could hope for in Reality TV . The characters were real , the setting was real , the & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; showed real process.Sadly , with this season , the producers rolled out a new over-wrought title block and a new production outline that has substituted fakey acting and dialog for the old idea of showing the process of & # 34 ; Restoration & # 34 ; at which they used to be so good.Now the show has devolved to be just another gabfest , and largely a waste of time.Its just sad .	-1
Remember Reggie Perrin ? Do n't be confused this is not the wonderful original but a poor and very unconvincing remake . Its terrible .	-1
I 've rated this once Nice voices but not a lot of change in plots Love the voices and the new	-1
At this shows VERY BEST it ` s a 4 stars and at it ` s least ? 2 stars and that ` s being Generous . Now.. if i was from NYC amd REALLY REALLY loved it then i MIGHT give it 3 1/2-4 stars but i am not from NYC . I did have to live there for 2 yrs but that hardly makes me a New Yorker , sorry : ) Decent Characters and Decent writing gives the show 3 stars ! I had it at 2 stars but at the last mnute raised it to 3 . It ` s certainly not horrible and I have gotten through Most of the shows uninterupted but i would not go out of my way or miss anything to make sure i watched this.NOW , mst of the Can ` t miss shows are the first few seasons of Nurse Jackie but Mainly ... ... .. SHAMELESS ! Now thats a show that is almost a crime to miss . I have NEVER EVER seen a show or movie that had so many great Characters , Young or Old ( I am 53 Years OLD ) and the writing , the City and Photography is unbelievavable ! ! ! It would be a `` SHAME '' if their were not 10 seasons of this show made . Not many 1 Hour shows can grab every second of your sttention but this one can.Thats why so may shows are 1/2 hour ones today ! ! These shows are Way different but put this up there with `` The Wire '' , most of `` The Sopranos '' , `` OZ '' and so far ... .. Most of nurse Jackie and Weeds in shows that have Great Characters of all ages , wonderful writing , Almost always Believable in some way , Great Photography ad wonderful all around entertainment ! ! My Honest suggestion would be to buy or `` Get '' the 2 seasons of Shameless already available and one of any of the others i have mentioned if you have not seen them and start watching . You will end up with all of seasons of all of them and wont be able to wait for the next seasons ! ! ! ! That is of course , if it is not finished already.WARNING ! ! ! ! This can end up taking alot of your time .	-1
I love this show . I watched every episode from season one and have watched every episode of season two except for the last one . It is still on my DVR and I want to savor it ; it ended too soon.Given the fact that season one is not yet available in Blu-Ray , I purchased the entire season at Amazon Prime only to find out that the $ 30.00 I was charged for season one in HD was not in HD at all . It was easy to tell by the noticeable lack of sharpness and detail in the picture and my A/V receiver , which even tells me what type of sound ( Dolby Pro-Logic II , Dolby Digital , Dolby Digital+ , Dolbt Tru-HD , etc ) is being provided by the program material indicated that the sound was only Pro Logic II . The was a blatant rip off , only compounded by the fact that it has all since become available free for Amazon Prime subscribers . This is what it is worth : nothing - nothing , that is , beyond the subscription price , a subscription I have made good use of and will continue to do so . I am just angry and disappointed that something was misrepresented in this way.And yeah , I am a crazy enough fan to purchase both seasons on Blu-Ray , once they become available . Amazon Prime , in this one instance , did me wrong .	-1
Is this a series with a story line that gets divulged through the episodes ? Or a drama in which each episode has a self-contained story ? I do not know and I suspect that the producers/directors do n't know either . In an attempt to promote a second season , the ending is totally unexpected and leaves you with a feeling of & # 34 ; job not done & # 34 ; .	-1
The basic idea for this plot is somewhat interesting and the acting okay . Personally , I am weary of women detectives who look like they stepped out of a fashion magazine but who despite their youth and beauty are presented as hard-as-nails veterans . Just not believable . Let 's get some mature , imperfect women in these roles .	-1
Revised April 7 , 2012 EPISODES 1-13The action is okay , the animation is pretty good , the effects and sound are good and the music is n't bad but in the end this hero 's journey is just too demoralizing . The story is supposedly about Blade search for vengeance for his mother 's death but while Blade has touching farewells with relative strangers , the farewell he had with his mother under similar circumstances was horrible creating an awkward comparison and severely diminishing the resonance of Blade 's mission.Blade is depicted as needing to be rescued so often he sometimes becomes a secondary character in the series . He is stomped emotionally , physically and even literally at crucial moments . Tough fights ? Great . Constantly getting beat down when it matters most ? Pass . Blade has some good points , but the first installments will only be entertaining to those who enjoy watching the hero being crucified and the thirteenth episode will be even more bizarre than it is without them.Hold your holy water and wait for the next story arc .	-1
The first season was the best , as it was more based on characters and the parts they played in the overall story . Season two became less about the characters and more about the gore and violence . We forced ourselves to watch the first three episodes of season 3 , but it was just more gore and violence for its own sake . We wo n't waste any more time watching more of it .	-1
First ten or fifteen minutes did n't hold my interest and so no reason to continue the agony , I shut it down .	-1
The story line is getting more interesting BUT way too much unnecessary gore ! Not sue why they feel the need to directly show all that .	-1
I was hoping to see some complexity to the issues and lifes that intertwine in this series , but was disappointed to see the same ol thing . The writers apparently are not willing to consider that other perspectives would add a & # 34 ; real-life & # 34 ; element and interesting depth to the obvious biases they have bought to the table that have already played out in the first two seasons . I doubt I will continue watching - a real snoozer now .	-1
i thought this was going to be way better but it was a fat guy eating then just loosening the weight but people still hated him because of ruinning a wedding so it was not worth watching	-1
I was hoping to find this inspirational health-wise but instead I was bombarded by foul language , particularly the f word over and over . I was very disappointed , I turned it off .	-1
My children , both teens , were very excited to watch this movie and both of them were barely able to finish it , and I do n't think they would have if it had n't been for putting down their own money to watch it . The story had promise , even with poor writing , but the differing levels of skills on the acting were at times distracting and at other times annoying . Simple not very believable . Unfortunately , my daughter ( 13 ) , noticed it on prime this week and she said , & # 34 ; What a complete waste of money. & # 34 ; .	-1
Predictable , production values average , acting the same . Perhaps it is the tennis theme that has the other reviewers so enthused . I , however , would not recommend this to others : the trajectory of the story line is so stereotypical of many teen movies out there with a lot better talent .	-1
This show is informative but extremely boring . It seemed to drag . We did not make it through the first showing .	-1
Start with a subject then add the top conspiracy theorists and you end up with a 'documentary ' on Puff the Magic Dragon VS Godzilla . Is the History Channel becoming the next Learning Channel - you know , where 'learning ' is discovering Honey Boo Boo ? Or how to have a litter of children ? Or extreme couponing ? Is n't fact based history important or interesting enough without having to cater to the lowest common denominator and IQ ? If I were the 'Woman Born With 14 Thumbs ' ( hoping for the next prime time slot on TLC ) all would be pointed down on this gobbly-gook !	-1
The moment you bring in a far right rabid dog and demagogue/fear monger like Alex Jones in as a contributor you destroy all you credibility you once had .	-1
This is typical psuedo-documentary style fluff . There was n't much information that was well verified or documented . Wish there was more hard facts instead of speculations . History is interesting , speculation is boring .	-1
We had such high hopes for the series , it became clear after a point that the writing like a lifetime movie . Some scandal and a few interesting situations but most of it lifetime movie . The actors can only do so much with the bad script , a few of the main characters are so self-sacrificing that it a bore . Still not sure what happen tot he grandmother . Watched many British series I recommend London Hospital , Downton Abby , Call the Midwife , He knew he was right , Upstairs Downstairs ( 1970 's version ) better written much more entertaining .	-1
I loved & # 34 ; Heroes & # 34 ; so I thought & # 34 ; Touch & # 34 ; would continue this writer 's success . However , while it does have some attractive carryovers from Heroes -- most notably realistic-seeming foreign locales and ( subtitled ) dialogue , it verges on self-parody right out of the gate . The excellent Kiefer Sutherland has to work really hard with a woefully underwritten part and ca n't get the character to be believable . Too many scenes of his following his autistic kid and yelling : & # 34 ; Jake , Jake , do n't go there ! Jake . Jakle , come back ! Jake , Jake , be careful ! & # 34 ; led me to stop watching after the third episode .	-1
I was trying to figure out why I do n't engage with this show - I enjoyed ( some of ) Tim Cring 's Heroes series and Touch follows a similar theme of extraordinary results from an everyday hero . I also liked the pilot but by the fourth episode had completely lost interest . I 'll also confess that I 'm not a fan of the 'network narrative ' genre where Hollywood can manufacture a story line based upon on the coincidental eventual meeting point of a handful of strangers.I think there are a couple of problems . The first is the mathematical theme - it just does n't make sense to extrapolate a Math 101 understanding of the Fibbonaci sequence and the Butterfly Effect to give a mute child near psychic powers to predict where the lives of a random bunch of strangers will meet . It comes across as really manipulative and far-fetched . The second is that Keifer has little to do other than act like Lassie 's owner , trying to make sense of cryptic messages from a child that wo n't speak , while filling the dialog gap with cries of `` Jake ! Jake ! Jake ! '' every other scene.So Touch is a sentimental show more along the lines of Highway to Heaven ( whoa , dig out the history books ) than anything particularly scientific as it pretends to be . And after four episodes the plot did n't move forward enough to really capture my attention .	-1
`` Touch '' has characteristics of a well-crafted TV drama ; namely , well-developed characters and a premise which is unique and initially engaging . However , once all the components of the story are assembled , the result is dull and contrived . Ultimately , everything will work out because the numbers say so . That 's about it . So the viewer is basically promised some sort of magical happy ending from the get-go . The numbers are little more than an omnipotent deus ex machina , and there 's no real mystery , wonder , or drama to the plot resolutions they achieve . All this makes for a boring and saccharine hour of television that really is n't worth investing in .	-1
This is a well-made Korean horror movie that had lots of potential but it does n't know when to quit . The idea behind it is n't bad , the setting is great . But it loses all its punch because of an ending that seemingly goes on forever .	-1
Francesca Annis especially was simply the wrong choice to play Tuppence . She looks more than 40 years old , rather than a young 20-something woman . Her partner , whose name I ca n't remember at the moment , was also too old . It made the shows leaden and ridiculous rather than light and fun .	-1
Everyone that suffered through any of this lame , idiotic excuse for a film should be paid $ 1,000,000,000 for every minute they watched . In my case I made it through to 7 minutes & 12 seconds . Probably a record . I want my $ 7,200,000,000 NOW ! ! ! Is this really suppposed to be funny ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?	-1
This movie was almost literally painful to watch . I waited for it to get better , but it somehow managed to just get worse . It is amazing that I ca n't even think of one good thing to say about it . Thank goodness it was n't longer . I think it could very well be the worst movie I have ever seen . It is n't just bad , but even in the weird and bizarre scenes it amazingly fails to be interesting . Absolute garbage pretty well sums it up , except that is probably being to kind to this movie ( or perhaps unfair to actual garbage ) . I really wanted to give it zero stars .	-1
I 'm not going to waste much of your precious time with this review . 'Tim and Eric 's Billion Dollar Movie ' is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen . Will Farrell and Adam McKay are credited as producers , and should have known better.The film follows the monumentally untalented duo , Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim , as they set out to make a film for one billion dollars . They end up wasting the entire budget , a fact which the film 's producer - Tommy Schlaaang ( Robert Loggia , obviously working for the paycheck ) - is not entirely thrilled about . The two idiots decide to renovate an old mall in hopes that they will be able to pay off the large debt . In the meantime , we are introduced to some of the most annoying , disgusting characters ever written , and are treated to insanely crude jokes involving pedophilia , feces , and body piercing.The writing is horrendous , the `` jokes '' are beyond disgusting and incredibly unfunny , and the two leads are headache inducing morons . Rarely have I ever been tempted to walk out of a film mid-screening . 'Tim and Eric 's Billion Dollar Movie ' is a waste of celluloid . I hated every single second of it.Magnolia Pictures has given the film the royal treatment on Blu-ray , which includes an audio commentary , deleted scenes , and a gag reel.Directed by Tim and Eric , Rated R , 94 minutes	-1
Personally I did NOT care for this movie , and would not recommend it to anyone . However . I truly hated `` Napoleon Dynamite '' and that did well with the younger crowd so maybe you have something here .	-1
my opinion of this trial movie has been requested ... i provide it here , and gratis ( amazon , be grateful ) ... no one this side of a death wish would even consider translating this abomination into a feature ... ciao .	-1
I applaud the effort put into this movie and am editing my review after further consideration . The uniqueness of the girl 's talent needs upgrading . I believe that would go a long way in increasing interest .	-1
2012NR : You could get just as valid predictive feedback from a well thought-out trailer ( aka movie commercial ) combined with an internet-based audience poll . Unless of course the intended audience are people who have nothing better to do than to watch a 1hr 37 min commercial about a product that does n't yet exist .

Not too funny to me , but my daughter lines Tosh .not sure what else to say here . Amazon is smazing .	-1
Not my kind of comedy . I think that the younger generation may like this more . The whole concept is very thin .	-1
It has n't been that long since I rented this movie and I have already forgotten the thing . That might provide a clue as to how good a movie this is . I streamed it via Roku after paying Amazon for the privilege and though I think I paid less than $ 3.00 to rent it I still feel a bit ripped off.I can not recommend this movie in any way .	-1
This could have been a really good sci-fi movie , but it attempts to be `` Dawn of the Dead '' at the end . And fails miserably . It 's more watchable than the Sci-Fi network 's wreck of the week , but not by much . Good actors hamstrung by an awful script . Actually , I may have to take that Sci-Fi statement back . At least you know what 's going on , ( and probably know the whole movie ) , within the first few minutes . This piece of dreck does n't seem to know where it 's going or what 's it 's all about until half way through this slog . Confused about the first 2 minutes of the film ? Do n't worry . It ties back in somewhere toward the end . Assuming you want to wait that long to find out . Even if it was free , you 're better off re-watching `` Night of the Living Dead '' . You 'll feel dead after watching this crap .	-1
I rented this film but did not have time to watch , but as soon as I am able to see it will review it . It has got some descent reviews since its release .	-1
Dr. Andrew Stanton ( Brian Krause ) Is a confident and successful ER doctor . He is also working on a cure for AIDS . ( I smell Nobel . ) He has a beautiful wife ( Sierra Fisk ) and daughter ( Islay Vermillion ) he needs to spend more time with . Just as when things are going his way , his life turn upside down as he accidentally creates a bacteria that makes people aggressive and is highly contagious.Now I know this sounds like a great zombie-type film and it would have been if it had n't taken up nearly the whole film to develop . As it was we had a slow moving drama/thriller with a touch of horror at the end that was n't worth 60 minutes of character development.Available on a 30 Horror Film Collection.Parental Guide : No f-bombs . Sex and brief nudity ( ? ) .	-1
This is a tedious slow boring movie of Scottish people trying to be funny ... .They are not . I made it 45 minutes before finally turning it off in disgust . I think the Director 's family wrote the rest of these reviews as the seem to have no concept of character development or an interesting story ...	-1
The director relies too much on shock , gore and camera tricks to create a sense of tension . However these effects as used in this move act as a distraction . The movies that are successful in creating a tension leave a lot to the imagination which is far scarier than fake blood poured all over the place . If this movie is in fact made by teen agers , koodos to them a very good effort . If however it is a professional production ... yikes ... not so good .	-1
This movie was not so good , acting was not so good , loud music throughout the movie could not hear the actors , this movie looked like a B movie so since of realism .	-1
Playback ( Michael A. Nickels , 2012 ) Playback has the dubious distinction of being the lowest-grossing domestically-released American film of 2012 ( it made a grand total of $ 252 , playing on one screen for a single week ) . It 's not the worst film I 've ever seen -- in fact , it 's only the third-worst film I 've seen today ( and you never know , it might get worse after this ! ) -- but that does n't mean I would suggest you get within ten feet of a streaming copy of it.We open in 1994 , with a young chap named Harlan Diehl ( Dogman 's Luke Bonczyk ) killing his entire family save his sister 's baby before being shot by police . Fast-forward fifteen years , and a group of high-school students , working on a project for their journalism class , are investigating the Diehl murders , headed by Julian Miller ( Purgatory House 's Johnny Pacar ) and his girlfriend Riley ( The Master 's Ambyr Childers ) . Julian enlists his stoner buddy Quinn ( Black Swan 's Toby Hemingway ) to `` acquire '' some information that only the local police have access to ; Quinn has an in to the police department in the form of Detective Frank Lyons ( Christian Slater ) , an ephebophilic detective who keeps Quinn rolling in dough -- or illegally-swiped evidence on the Harlan Diehl case , it would seem -- in exchange for hidden-camera nudie-cutie flicks of the local hot high school chicks . The problem is , when Quinn gets his hands on the tapes , he finds that Harlan Diehl 's legacy extends beyond the grave ... If you have n't figured out within ten minutes of this movie starting what happened to the baby from the opening sequence , you have n't seen enough horror movies . That sort of predictability , unfortunately , plagues this entire production . Once you know all the principal high school students , you should be able to pause the film , sit down , and sketch out a list of who 's going to die when . And you know what ? You 'd probably be close enough to right to be extremely disappointed in this movie . And you have every right to be ; Nickles , a character actor ( probably best remembered for portraying Jim Morrison in Wayne 's World 2 ) who abandoned the screen to go behind the camera , does absolutely nothing to meddle with the formula . This is depressing , because given some of the angles this movie adopts ( it would probably contain a host of minor spoilers to go into any detail , but I will say that my favorite character in the film , Wylie , portrayed by Galaxy Quest 's Darryl `` Chill '' Mitchell , is a video-store clerk and would-be film historian whom Julian finds himself consulting more and more as they get closer to uncovering the mystery of Harlan Diehl 's motivations ) , Nickels had ample opportunity to bend some corners , kick some sandcastles , what have you . And he took none of them.It 's not necessarily a bad movie , but it is an extremely frustrating one , boring , predictable , and full of potential that will forever go unrealized . If you do end up watching it , well , you have my condolences . *	-1
This is an interesting storyline set in an intriguing and potentially engaging environment ( the Amazon ) . The characters lack individual story motivation and seem one dimensional . What was lacking was a more thorough and realistic integration of the already intriguing elements surfacing in the Amazon jungle and rivers . . . these mysteries alone would have served as the seeds of some incredible plot points . I wanted this to be so much more than it was . I would recommend FRINGE and PERSON OF INTEREST or WAREHOUSE 13 as excellent choices for the type of intrigue , character development , and intrigue that cement stories in your imagination .	-1
2009NR : The fact that three times as many rated this as 'Loved It ' ( 27 ) , as did those who rated it as 'Hated It ' ( 9 ) , speaks , in part , to why organizations like this are so successful .

I 'm interested in Scientology , having known some members . I do n't consider it a religion ( far from it ) , and this video does illustrate that it 's better-described as a business -- even a brutal business , given the treatment of some members . If you 've read any books about Scientology and have followed reports about it in the press , you are n't likely to learn anything new by watching this , but it was interesting enough that I did stick with it all the way to the end . No big complaints ; just not enthusiastic about the informational or entertainment aspects of the video .	-1
An average season if survivor . After seasons with all returning players it 's hard to watch newbies thinking they have slick tricks .	-1
I 'm realy tired of so called cop shows that deal with 'alternate realities ' . This one lost my interest in the first five minutes . I just do n't care.Mistery and suspence should be based on real life . There is plenty there . Imaginary situations should be left to sci-fi and fantasy , not a suposed 'real world'.Thumbs down , all the way on this one !	-1
There 's nothing at all in the first 10 minutes to keep anyone interested . I bailed early because I was falling asleep .	-1
The first episode of any new series has the unstated obligation , both to its audience and for the sake of its own survival , to grab us viewers by the throat -- and never let go.If lackluster Episode 1 of AWAKE -- and that 's all I 've watched thus far -- is any indication of what 's on the horizon , then expect to see this poorly directed series aborted before the completion of its first term.What I found most irritating was the unsubtle ( unconvincing ! ) transition between the two alleged realities . They just seemed to pop up out of nowhere , adding to the already confused plot.After the first 40 minutes -- AND HERE COMES A POSSIBLE SPOILER , FOLKS , SO BEWARE ! -- I had an uneasy sense of foreboding ( so did two other friends watching this ) that it was our hapless protagonist himself who had actually died ( not his beloved wife or son ) and who now was destined to wander around LOST ( like that other series ) in an alternate realty between this world and the next ... or at least until `` The Redeeming Light of Truth '' -- hopefully not another contrived deus ex machina -- might set his hitherto unenlightened soul free .	-1
People alive in boxes whether buried or not have shown up in a few movies the past couple of years , e.g . `` Buried '' . This one had more techy stuff ( camera , phone , CB radio , annoying red LED clock ) and had the more elaborate plot of trying to extort information from it 's ( How did I get here ? ) occupant . Just like a person in a box not knowing what 's going on , this viewer felt like they were in a box in being mostly clueless and bored 90 % of the time while watching just a person in a box with only increasingly predictable dialogue to keep from dozing off . To make it worse the writer & director tossed in two twists at the end that not only were stupid-unrealistic but made the preceding 91 of 92 minutes seem even stupider .	-1
`` Brake '' is another in a recent string of claustrophobic thrillers set entirely in one small confined space . Instead of the `` buried alive '' aspect , though , the hero of this piece is locked into a transparent box and held in the trunk of a vehicle . And as he tries to figure out just what is going on , it seems that the outside world is alive with terror plots and conspiracies . Just why is this guy locked up ? Who is doing it ? And what do they need from him ? These are the questions that Stephen Dorff wrestles with as he remains the sole character on screen for the entire length of the movie . When the audience is trapped with the film 's protagonist in a stagnant space , there is a tendency ( if not done correctly ) for the picture to get monotonous . `` Brake '' does a serviceable job of keeping things interesting , but mostly because it adds dangers that are patently ridiculous.Slight Spoilers : I mean really , who would believe that ANYONE would be carrying around a load of bees ? And the box has the capacity to fill with liquid in the trunk of a car ? Where 's it coming from ? End of Slight SpoilersReally , though , I did n't expect too much from `` Brake . '' I just wanted to be entertained . The movie starts with an intriguing premise so I overlooked many of the wild plot developments because I was genuinely interested to see where this journey would take me . While not exactly riveting throughout , it made for a perfectly passable popcorn movie . Dorff seems to be taking on more and more of these direct-to-DVD type roles ( although this had a small release , it feels direct-to-DVD ) and I 'm not sure why . He 's actually quite good here as he becomes increasingly unhinged . And he is the absolute center of the piece . Although the movie boasts names such as Tom Berenger and Chyler Leigh , they get but a moment of screen time . No , this is Dorff talking on a CB radio followed by Dorff talking on a cell phone followed by Dorff talking through a tube . I think you get the idea , it 's all Dorff ! The principle storyline revolves around a political conspiracy and , never for a minute , did I believe any of it . Still , I 'd have rated this 3 ( possibly 3 1/2 ) stars if not for the ending . You think the rest of the movie is silly ? Just wait for the twists ( there are more than one , that 's all I say ) . Any goodwill I had toward `` Brake '' flew out the window with these nonsensical revelations . They turn this mildly engaging movie into one of the most frustrating experiences I 've had in a while . None of these last minute twists can withstand even the slightest intellectual scrutiny and the definitely put the brakes on my enjoyment of the movie ! KGHarris , 7/12 .	-1
All the other actors appear in the last few minutes of the movie . I guess if you are a Stephen Dorff fan and enjoy looking up his nostrils for over an hour then this is the movie for you . Tom Berenger is the size of a whale and ca n't find a tie long enough to reach to his belt . A copy of `` Buried '' and less interesting . An IFC Film so look for it on Netflix in the next 3 months or so .	-1
I started to watch the first episode and nearly fell asleep at the start ! The intro to the teams competing was too long . i think there were too many competitors too ! When the two brothers started their talk on their background , I stopped downloading/streaming and went to somethng else.This series main goal is to capture the competitors emotional up and downs for drama - same attention drivers give when passing a traffic accident . Slow and tedious .	-1
Bopper and Mark were the only redeeming characters from this season . I could n't stand how two of the couples treated each other all season long , and do n't even get me started on the whiny B**** Rachel . Just plain pathetic , I do n't even know how she won Big Brother , but I 'm sure I only need 2 guesses .	-1
I think it is wrong to say it was good for a woman to have a car accident and almost die , and that is a for instance . Overcoming adversity does not achieve a greater happiness . It achieves survival , which provides opportunity for more happiness . The happiness of a child is probably the greatest example of happiness . They feel safe , they feel loved , they know they have their needs taken care of . Look at the child who does not have those things - the child who may be fostered and feel out of place . The child who is abandoned . Those will never be good things in life . There are many layers to happiness . Some come from within and some come from being stimulated - by others who love you and by those whom you like and trust . Happiness is finding a stability you can count on in life . That stability may have to be one you are forced to create for survival ; it may be a greater good of which you hope to find eventual fulfillment if things work out the way you hope . And while you are waiting for that , riding the wave is not such a bad state of mind . As in this movie , the father devotes much time doing that literally . It is no one 's business to decide how happy you are with their own happy-meter . If they want to be your friend , they will care , listen , and certainly not talk behind your back . If that kind of relationship is achieved , that can bring times of happiness . Though ultimately , happiness is a decision , we do n't have to decide it all the time or have it as a goal . It comes and sometimes it goes for a while and we need to ride the wave .	-1
When they killed Mitchell ( Aidan Turner ) I was sure he would be coming back , resurrected . Then they killed George , Russell Tovey , and Nina as well . What is WRONG with these Brits ? They pull this s*** with Doctor Who every few years . Have a popular doctor or companion , who ( probably ) want more money , and kill them off or replace them . Like all the money has to go to the production company . No fair share to the actors . Replace them . Turner might have wanted out , but that is why you sign them to contracts , so they ca n't leave just because it 's convenient.What is wrong with these Brits ! ! I thought I had 2 more seasons to watch . Bad enough they call it a series instead of a miniseries . But just acting like the actors mean nothing , is very annoying !	-1
The new vampire and werewolf do nothing for the show ... did not enjoy it at all . Miss the other characters they were awesome	-1
This is the end of an amazing team . A show that started so strong , looses two of it 's stellar team in the last season and in this one George leaves rather early . So to fly the ship we have only Annie played by Lenora Crichlow . She and the Mitchell replacement guy are the only ones who have a sense of the world it seems . The new Werewolf guy plays heavy on the pauper to twin the vampire who is a prince . Personally I wish that they just said something like Daisy had a magic ring that she used to control Mitchell and George and that 's how she got Mitchell to kill the people on the buss and for George to bang her . I never got why George did that . He was never really a `` tool '' .Anyway here we are in the middle of WW `` V '' . For some reason no humans want to become werewolves even though it would improve their odds greatly . Only some people are aware of the the fact that Vampires have led the war . Also Nina and George 's child is the anti vampire Jesus but no one can find her even though she lives in the middle of England . I like the new vampire but that 's it . Other new characters aside from the sweet but dumb werewolf include the ghost of an evil young Tim Gunn from `` Project Runway '' , A child rapist Mary Poppins accompanied by the vampire boy from before but they chose to make him dumb now . There is a retro ghost girl who looks just like Kenley aldo from `` Project Runway '' but unlike Kenley she hates all things retro except her and Annie points this out after this ghost insulted her tea . Also there is a goth girl who is also dumb ( This season love people acting stupid for some reason ) who is made into a vampire by a sleazy ugly vampire and the go off to bang somewhere . I made it up to episode 6 and just could no take it any more .	-1
~Sadly , many will consider this is true history but it 's not ! It 's pathetic what is put into gullible minds as fact when the actual history is so much more interesting.Queen Mary was a Caucasian with red/auburn hair . That is an important part of true history because when the executor overheads her he had no ideal by that time in her life she was wearing a wig & when he went to hold up her severed head for the crowd her head fell out & he was left holding the red wig.Also , the good-looking Prince/king was no were near being the stud portrayed . Facts are he was very slight in size , had a deformity , & was always sickly.It 's no wonder our children ( USA ) are so behind in school compared to so many other countries watching this FICTION believing it 's true.Had this been a show with fictional characters I would have enjoyed it .	-1
This is a long winded narration of the history of the monarchy . although it provides alot factual information , there is little visual information to clue you in as to why the homes or areas being discussed are important . If you 're a history buff , this will be boring . If you want to learn , you may wind up fast forwarding thru some of it .	-1
A waste of time and $ . Do n't fall for this one . I did n't mind the waste of $ 1.99 as much as I resented the waste of time . = (	-1
Wow . I thought I was going to watch an interesting historical series and learn some new things about some historical figures . I tried to watch two different episodes , one on Ben Franklin and one on Abraham Lincoln . I felt like I was watching TMZ ! Honestly , sensationalistic poo ! ! I looked up the `` historian '' who narrates this program and discovered that names of 2 novels he had written : one entitled `` Gay Power : An American Revolution '' and the other entitled `` One Nation Under Sex '' which he co-wrote with ... wait for it ... Larry Flynt ! ! Yeah . That pretty much tells me what kind of `` history '' this man is interested in . This show literally turned my stomach . Very disappointing . Unfortunately , this is what some think of as entertainment in our dumbed-down , sewer-minded society .	-1
This is one of those movies that just does n't go and or do anything . It just lies there , dormant and motionless until the credits roll and your eyes readjust to the light . What is sad is that there is so much potential within the prose , and even the approach ( restraint as opposed to abrasiveness ) is welcomed and yet falls so flat it becomes tiresome . The base plot feels almost silly , never really feeling like a genuine plot and more or less like a child 's short story taken over by a screenwriter attempting to make it more adult themed . The characters are skeletons , the revelations are minute and the overall impact is barely a scratch . Dafoe sleeps through his performance and builds no depth between his character 's motivations and his eventual arc , but at least Sam Neill and Frances O'Connor ( she needs more roles ) offer up some great supporting performances that actually build a backstory . At the end of the day , two sharp performances and some beautiful scenery can not a good film make . This bore of a tale never fully gets off the ground , despite many attempts to do so . I understand that this is a more internalized film , but there never seems to be enough reason to care much for what is unfolding . At the end of the day , it says very little . If you want an internalized look at a life of regret and personal upheaval , check out 2010 's ` The American ' . This film tries to mirror the approach , but fails to nail it in any way .	-1
This Australian film moves from interesting ( a lone hunter out to bag the last Tasmanian tiger ) to so unsatisfying that a person might wish he 'd spent his time more productively , like washing the car.Martin David ( Willem Dafoe ) , an unhappy , taciturn loner , is hired by a mysterious corporation to go to Tasmania and take tissue and blood samples from the one remaining Tasmanian tiger . He 'll have to kill it first , of course . When he arrives he finds unfriendly men , a perhaps too helpful but cautious Jack Mindy ( Sam Neill ) and a conflict between those who want to log ancient trees for jobs and those who want to save the forests . His base is a broken down and eccentrically decorated wooden house with a mother passed out from drugs and drink and her two kids , one a precocious pre-teen and the other a young boy who does n't speak , only draws . They are cutely named Sass and Bike . The husband has been missing in the forests for a month or two.Martin David prowls through the Tasmanian forests seeking evidence of where the Tasmanian devil lurks . He sets steel traps ( illegal ) , gazes at the beautiful scenery , looks more and more conflicted , and eventually realizes that the corporation has more than one hunter after the animal.And then the movie goes flat , manipulative and becomes deeply unsatisfying . There are good tree huggers victimized by rowdy loggers ( there 's a message for us ) , predictable betrayal , the utterly unnecessary deaths of two sympathetic characters , and a conclusion that is sticky with sentiment on the one hand and unethical on the other . If we have to destroy a village to save it , Martin David , with a new , mystical appreciation of nature , is the man to hire . Dafoe , however , gives an engrossing performance .	-1
Interesting to read previous reviews . I ca n't say I agree with any of them . I like Defoe as an actor , but an actor needs something to work with . If you have a couple of hours to waste , or need something to put you to sleep , this will probably work .	-1
Thylacinus cynocephalus aka Tasmanian tiger went extinct in Aussie land , Tasmania and NZ in the early 1900s and despite rewards of millions up until quite recently , there have been only a few unconfirmed sightings.This movie is taken from a novel by the same name . Unfortunately , the characterizations seemed like someone decided to toss a bunch of popular stereotypes into a bag , give it a good toss , and see what story comes out of it.The stereotypic loner assassin with high tech sniper rifle is hired by the usual big bucks pharmaceutical company to kill off the last Thylacinus but not before getting blood and tissue samples so said company can be the sole maker of a resulting super drug . Not believable.Stereotype of `` greenies '' protecting old growth forests against the loggers . Pointless subplot.Stereotype of townspeople in bar showing in your face distrust of a foreigner , in this case the assassin . Not believable.One of the townspeople happens , coincidentally , to have a similar sniper rifle and tries to kill the assassin . Also not believable.Assassin lodges in the home of a researcher , who has gone missing for months . Home is occupied by a depressed wife who ca n't get out of bed for months while her two very young children take care of everything . Not believable and another plot digression.Sam Neill plays a part time guide along with other roles in the movie that just seemed contrived . Pointless subplot.No flow to the storyline , just a bunch of cutout stereotypes . The only acting worth noting was by Morgana Davies whose naturalness made her character believable . Similar to her performance in `` The Tree '' . So far she 's has n't been influenced by the `` Rubber Stamp Acting School '' or become a perennial stuck-in-a-rut actor .	-1
I hate to give a bad review but this movie really begs for one.No plot whatsoever , I kept waiting for a story line to pop up and all I could do was scratch my head.I enjoy watching Dafoe but I wish he had passed up this role !	-1
What a slow moving movie , very boring until the very end.SPOILER : I have a BIG problem with how this ended , being that he kills the endangered animal in the end , only to THEN decide to not give in to Red-Leaf and burn the remains instead of turning them into that company . Why not have just left it alone , he definitely was n't helping the animal by offing it . Stupid , Stupid , Stupid hunter . Movie would have at least made MORE sense if after killing the animal he turned the specimens over after all that happened . But then again , I hate hunting and people that kill animals as sport or leisure .	-1
William Dafoe is a great actor and is the only reason why this movie got 2 stars and not 1 star . The plot was flawed , unrealistic and the overall story did not make any sense.I am upset that I wasted almost 2 hours of my time and $ 9.99 to see this horrible movie before it was in theaters . I hope the movie studios learn from the poor rental results and do not waste their money promoting this film .	-1
Another Hollywood movie that features a big name actor that turned out to be total crap ! I ca n't imagine why such a notable actor would accept a role in this movie . Is he that hard up for money ? ? ? Movie is slow and boring and has very little to do with hunting a rare tiger . Are there no good writers left in Hollywood ? ? ? Boring and a total waste of time . Do n't spend a penny on this film . Shame on you Hollywood ! ! !	-1
This kind of movie the tv channel use to complete your schedule , boring , no action like in the trailer.Not interesting , need more action and less talk , 40 min is good , 1h is bad , 1:40h i ca n't saw this , sorry .	-1
W. Dafoe is surrounded by a bunch of no good antisocial idiots up in the mountains . Not sure why everybody hates him . He is coming to hunt something . Not sure what and why.He arrives in a house with kids where the mom is depressed because her husband has disappeared . He quickly connects with the kids . Not sure what is he doing there and what is the point . Sam Neil 's role is still not clear to me . Towards the middle of the movie we know what is he doing up there . Does n't make any sense scientifically . Not sure how the genetic material will help and for what disease . The whole thing is weird and disconnected.The ending is surprising , not predictable but totally stupid . I still did n't get the message ... if there is any ! Very poorly done . Expected better from the cast . Two stars just for the acting .	-1
one of the worst movies of all the time ... terrible movie..who wrote this movie ? ? ? the director must be shooooot himself ... this is a low cheap budget movie terrible ... stay away ...	-1
The movie is short , thank goodness for that . The plot was too silly ( over an hour stuck in a ATM ) . The acting was stiff at times , if I was a killer I 'd just stand outside the whole damn time ? ? ? ? The movie obviously has many flaws and if it was released at a Box Office it would have bombed . I expected something better but just like P2 and other junk films called `` Thrillers '' this movie was not that .	-1
ATM follows three co-workers as they make a late-night stop at an isolated ATM ; as they are leaving , they notice a strange person watching and stalking them . The concept is great , and could 've kept people from using ATMs at night , but fails to effectively use it.The bulk of the film takes place in a walk-in-ATM ( think : a very large phone booth ) in a parking lot . A chain of unfortunate and illogical events take place that leads them there ; for example , they need cash because Corey ( Josh Peck ) must eat at night and the place he must eat at only accepts cash . That 's slightly understandable , right ? Oh , but David ( Brian Geraghty ) has to park as far away as possible , then everyone has to get out of the car because Corey 's debit card is not working and Emily ( Alice Eve ) does n't want to wait in the car . Then , all of the phones are dead or misplaced . Unfortunate for this group , but very fortunate for the psycho outside . Other events like these are scattered across the movie , like a security guard with very bad hearing . Honestly , they could 've rushed the man that was clearly unarmed at the beginning or split up when he disappeared for several minutes at a time . As you can see , the movie is poorly and lazily written . I did like the concept a lot , and the feeling of helplessness was evident . The acting was decent , and the music was great . It also has a very fast pace , and has a runtime of 1hr and 20min without the credits , so it 's a perfect time-killer if you can get past the illogical events . The ending was also decent.Overall , ATM has an amazing and chilling concept , but it 's ultimately poorly executed . It has many flaws , but can kill time if you 're bored and want a couple of thrills . As of 10/13/12 , this film is available on Netflix Streaming , and you should stream or rent before purchasing.ATM has strong blood and violence , no sex or nudity .	-1
After a company christmas party on a cold winter night ( guess a Christmas party in summer would be kinda tacky would n't it ) we have three friends who decide to stop at an ATM . The simpliest of things often turn into a nightmare ( or at least they do in this film ) and as all of them go to leave some guy in a big winter coat with a massive hood is standing outside looking at them . Unable to figure out what he wants initially it becomes obvious this guy wants something from them and that seems to be to watch them suffer as he does things to get inside and kill them.Its a simple premise and a bit like Colin Farrell 's `` Phone Booth '' in that for most of the film its centralized to just the ATM location with the three panicking friends and the killer on the outside . The cast is also pretty typical as the three friends are played by ( Alice Eve `` She 's Out of My League '' , Brian Geragthy `` Jarhead '' and Josh Peck TV 's `` Drake & Josh '' ) as is the killer who really does nothing more than stand outside looking menacing and well of course kills.There are plenty of problems with this movie , namely one being the viewer constantly thinking `` Just run to the car , you can take him '' especially in the early going when the guy goes around the back of the building . It becomes clear what the motives are behind this game the guy is playing with the three people none of which is terribly shocking I guess . Its hard to do a movie from one location and while I give director David Brooks ( in his feature debut ) props for trying something different there really is n't enough tension to keep the movie going for a full length running time . *1/2 out of 4 stars .	-1
this movie was so bad ... .dont want to waste time explaining it ... good concept ? ! ? ! but ultimately really really awful.thank god it was free .	-1
The set up of a horror or thriller , such as ATM , is probably one of the most important parts of the film . You can expect a chase , gore scenes , some monstrosity 's , and if time permits , character development . So here we have two seemingly successful people working in finance who leave a party to bring home a good looking woman , who also works with them . One of the guys needs to stop at an ATM to get money for his late night munchies.The film seems to be set in the city . New York City ( or at least something like to NYC ) . But apparently the only ATM is on this remote street with no one around . Pulling up to the ATM , he parks , what seems like a half a block away . Why not just pull right up to it ? ? I do n't know anyone that does this , especially at 1 in the morning . And so , between the car and the ATM hut stands the killer . And yes , they all forgot their cell phones in the car.I just get infuriated how people find themselves in situations like this . It could be argued on the other side that what are the chances of some crazy guy looking to kill some people locked in an ATM hut . But err on the safe side when the chances are higher that strange people creep around at night in big cities . Ultimately , however , it just seems too convenient for the killer to get into place.The film does not offer much other than high tension . As the other reviewers mentioned , the question of `` why '' is never answered . Clearly it is not supposed to . I am not sure if thats the question the film is offering either . I think its more stating that `` it can be done '' . If we recall the opening credit sequence , we see maps and diagrams and coordinates . All of this for the killer as a challenge for technology.I am probably being more poetic than the film deserves , but its a measure of avoidance as the film has little substance to work with . Anything revealed gives away almost too much . I can only assume that the film was green lit based on a pitch and was n't developed further.Now that I have my gripes out of the way , I will say that the film is well done and the drama is exciting and intense . The acting is credible and well executed , so that 's a bonus . It is worth a rental , but not at the current price . I would wait for the actual DVD release . It was exciting and entertaining , but the lack of the depth the film has , I can not merit it more than 2 stars .	-1
ATM ( David Brooks , 2012 ) ATM , the first feature from director David Brooks , is a run-of-the-mill thriller . Really , that 's it 's major problem , and the reason it seems to have attracted so much vitriol . Sure , people are complaining about the script 's plot holes , but come on , The Island made , what , eight hundred billion dollars or something ? And it had plot holes large enough to swallow this entire script . And , yeah , the characters make some stupid moves , but again , this is a horror film . Horror films without characters who make stupid moves ? They 're not horror films , they 're something else . ( I 'm not sure what , because in forty years of watching them , I ca n't recall ever seeing one . ) All the other complaints I 've seen about the film are strengths , not weaknesses . But I 'm getting ahead of myself ( and would have to dive deep into spoiler territory anyway , so I 'll probably conveniently ignore them ) .Plot : three co-workers , David ( The Hurt Locker 's Brian Geraghty ) , his best friend Corey ( Josh Peck , the longtime voice of Eddie from the Ice Age animated franchise ) , and possible future love interest Emily ( The Raven 's Alice Eve ) , are headed home late from their company Christmas party . ( Goof note : early in the film , Corey refers to the fact that it 's three days before Christmas . Every time you see the security camera footage from the ATM , the footage is dated December 17th . Is Christmas on a different day in Manitoba ? ) Corey is both hungry and broke , so he asks David , who 's driving , to stop at an ATM . Through a series of misadventures like those you 're used to seeing in both horror movies and stupid teen sex comedies , all three of them end up in the ATM vestibule . ( Unfortunately , this is where the teen sex comedy similarity ends . ) When they go to leave the vestibule , standing between them and their car is a masked man wearing an anorak ( the anorak becomes important ) . They figure he 's just waiting in line to use the machine until a random guy walking his dog wanders into the parking lot , and is quickly , and brutally , dispatched . The movie then becomes a waiting game , with the three players inside trapped and trading recriminations , while the anonymous killer just stands there , watching , and occasionally disappears in order to make amusing thumping noises to scare the victims.I 'm willing to write off a lot in horror movies ( for example , what most people are thinking is the Big Twist part of the Big Twist Ending is a simple misunderstanding that will be cleared up by all the principal parties five minutes after the camera stops rolling ) without taking points off ; that 's just part of being a fan of the genre . And like I said before , it comes with the territory that you 're dealing with stupid people making stupid decisions . The problems arise when the script fails in its continuity -- for example , have one character being so close to cold-related death as to be delirious halfway through the film , and then , five minutes later and with no added heat source , having that character be the most lucid in the vestibule ( for the rest of the film ) . Annoyances like this , when it comes to movies like this , are absolutely legitimate , and should be criticized . But it 's not an awful movie , even if it is yet another entry in an oversaturated genre . If you can dismiss the silly continuity errors ( and get past the fact that while Brian Geraghty is a solid character actor , he may not be quite ready for leads yet ) , it 's good enough late-night Netflix viewing if nothing else looks appealing . **	-1
David ( Brian Geraghty ) is a shy stock investor . Co-worker Emily ( Alice Eve ) is perhaps equally shy . On her last day of work , David works up the courage to ask her out . She agrees and also agrees to let David drive her home . The problem is there is a third wheel , mutual co-worker Corey ( Josh Peck ) who needs a ride and is hungry . They agree to grab a bite at a unique all night place that only accepts cash . They must first visit a remote ATM . Time and temperature are flashed for us to set the tone : 1:18 AM , -3F . The three are in the ATM.Outside the ATM , is a man assuming the `` Jason pose . '' He brutally murders another man in the parking lot . The trio is afraid to venture out and I am thinking ... did they just remake an ATM version of `` Frozen '' ? For some undisclosed reason the killer does n't try to enter the ATM . You will find out more , or less at the ending.If you liked `` Frozen '' or `` Altitude '' ( and I did n't ) you might try ATM.1 f-bomb , no sex or nudity .	-1
The premise of `` ATM '' - three people trapped in an ATM vestibule - is created by Chris Sparling , writer of another confined-space thriller `` Buried '' starring Ryan Reynolds . In `` ATM , '' while withdrawing money from an ATM on the way home from a Christmas party , two young men and woman David ( Brian Geraghty ) , Corey ( Josh Peck ) and Emily ( Alice Eve ) are trapped in an ATM booth by a hooded stranger , whose intent is not friendly.Though the story itself is not implausible , the way it unfolds feels so contrived and unrealistic that most viewers would stop caring what is going on . Without revealing too much of the film , I can say that 30 minutes into the film things start getting silly . The more elaborate the story gets , the less thrilling the film becomes , making us think about simpler solutions for the three characters.With convincing psychological interactions between the characters ( including the stranger standing outside ) , `` ATM '' would have been much more entertaining . As it is , `` ATM '' is a typical case of a nice concept ruined by poor execution .	-1
kristin chenoweth does not look to be the same age as the star that she was supposed to go to highschool with . i got as far as the star getting a job at the restaurant called Boobies . I am not making up the name ! this show was stupid and did not make me laugh . I got it because i saw Kristin Chenoweth in some movie and she was really funny . not this tv show , that 's for sure ! 2 thumbs the eff down !	-1
Note : I saw this online with XFinity On Demand.This show attracted my attention , despite my having read about the name change the show went through from its disturbing original title , which is extremely disrespectful and irreverent . Based on ABC 's excellent track record this year ( though they were stupid enough to cancel the reboot of Charlie 's Angels , Once Upon A Time and Revenge have been major successes for the network ; they should have given Charlie 's Angels a shot at sticking it out ) , I decided to give this series a shot , but just for the pilot , as I also found out that there 's a gay character on the show . Why does almost every television series have a gay character on TV these days ? It 's nauseating . But I digress.Watching the pilot episode of this show was like seeing my cousin on drugs . Primarily , this series makes Christians look hypocritical and superficial . Granted , there ARE some Christians like that , but not all Christians are hypocritical , superficial , judgmental , and promiscuous , as this show strongly implies they are . Jesus saith unto His disciples , Go ye into all the world , and preach the Gospel to every creature . '' This series is doing exactly the opposite ; it 's spreading a bad reputation of Christians and ultimately blasphemes the Name of Jesus , our Lord and Saviour . And scenes in a bar with an extremely suggestive name ? Come on , Disney ! Why are you doing this ? You 're a FAMILY-FRIENDLY company . ( Thank God , the gay thing was only IMPLIED , but I do not want to know how far ABC will go ) .This series is another one I will definitely NOT be watching .	-1
I really did n't see it as attacking Christianity . It was supposed to be a commentary on how self-righteous the bible-belt frequently tends to get . And I think this is what had viewers ( particularly in the region ) up in arms . Hell hath no fury like somebody whose flaws are uncovered for all the world to see and critique.All of this said , I myself personally did not find the show appealing.First , it replaced my favorite series Pan Am . Strike One . So I was already naturally bound to come in with a bit of skepticism -- even when it says there is satire of my 'home region ' . They should have moved the series for a different night and/or time . And just kept the good show on.Go with what already works . Give yourselves time to workout problems with the new show and build up a 'new ' audience.Strike two . These women acted like my stepmother ! The big hair , holier than thou blond-bimbo-bombshell diva routine , just was not personally funny in any television script . The series main character is starting over after herself having been a you-know-what . So there was potentially room here to successfully build in audience . Most people like to see underdogs succeed against tremendous odds.But she still contends with 'the attitude ' from her peer group . I already get enough of this off camera . And television is supposed to be a relaxing escape from real life . It 's not supposed to ailenate the viewing audience ourself from -- yes , boredom . People are n't going to watch a 'sitcom ' rehashing reality . The odds which she was supposed to come up against were the wrong ones to successfully hold audience interest for a weekly sitcom-drama.It just was n't 'fun ' viewing . Sorry ABC .	-1
I am so tired of every show either having some sort of gay element or bashing on Christians . Are the writers just lazy or have they run out of ideas ? I know that `` shallowood '' puts out a lot , and I mean a lot of trash , but this is really something . Just in the title alone I do not know how women are not up in arms over it . Maybe it is a way to get people to watch the show . The free preview was enough to make me gag.I am up for giving a show a chance , but not this one.Update : Good for ABC . They canceled this garbage ! !	-1
The theme was boring . The actors/experts were boring . There was no story line . I left the movie after 30 minutes .	-1
It was already not the best show on TV , but at least with the original cast as the original characters the show could be good , clean fun . After most of the cast left , and the producers tried in vain to replace them with equally compelling players , the show clearly went downhill .	-1
The show is too scripted . A reality show is SUPPOSED to be off the & # 34 ; cuff & # 34 ; and spontaneous . This show is too scripted . And why is Roy Williams ( one of the dirtiest football players that ever played ) on the show ? He 's an absolute idiot ! Talk about scripted ... when was the last time YOU were able to walk right up to a famous athletes house and ring his door bell ? What a crock .	-1
NO way no more . how did it make it to a second season . never again . Dumb , just plain dumb . Paint drying would create more drama .	-1
There are a lot of reality shows that I enjoy . But not this one . This one is just not entertaining . I Watched the 1st two episodes and turned it off in the middle of the 2nd one.It 's scripted and stupid.i.e . - They really want you to believe that the one brother ( on his own ) flooded out their loading dock so that ducks would come and they can test out their duck calls ! ! ! Really ! ! ! Even though the opening of the show , shows them at a local lake hunting ducks ... with their duck calls.If they want to test their calls , why not just go to the lake ? Instead they flood their loading dock , with a hose . That had to take a couple of days easily.Dumb show .	-1
I just do n't get the appeal of this series . I watched some of it because of the hype , and as far as I 'm concerned it was like watching paint dry . I might have found it more interesting if it had been realistic : i.e. , if there was a depiction of this well-educated but 'country ' family who became wealthy though hard work and establishing their niche . All the camo and ammo panders to those who want to see southern religious families as eccentric idiots . These people are , clearly , good businessmen/women and the series left me ... literally .	-1
I only watched the beginning of it and then realized it was n't something that would appeal to me , so I stopped .	-1
This is typical American entertainment . Not really with it , but all that these great creators can come up with . Just watch the network channels and you will see the same crap .	-1
I know this is one of the hottest shows in cable but I dont understand what all the hoopla is about , guess you just have to be a readneck ?	-1
This is probably the most scripted & # 34 ; reality & # 34 ; show I 've watched on the net . The & # 34 ; good ol ' back woods swamp boys & # 34 ; are about as authentic as a woman who has had implants and other plastic surgery , and has enrolled in a natural beauty contest .	-1
I 'm not a big fan of reality shows and I do n't watch them regularly . I saw 15 minutes of one episode and it was too much . Scratch this one off the list .	-1
It had its moments , I admit . Watching the more sensible family members react to the less sensible ones was amusing , but only mildly . I like redneck humor as much as anyone , and I do n't regret watching one episode to see what all the fuss is about , but I 've no interest in seeing more . The trouble is , it 's not clever . It 's zany and a little perverse , but it has to be clever to keep me coming back . This show has a tremendous following , of course , so there 's clearly an appetite for this stuff , but I 've got better ways to spend my time . If I were more of a drinker , I 'd probably enjoy getting sloshed with some friends and guffawing at these real-life millionaire hillbillies . But I thought a lot of what I was seeing was scripted , or at least heavily edited to make it come out a certain way . But then , that 's my general impression of so-called reality shows , of which I 'm not a fan .	-1
I only looked at this program to find out what all the hype was about . This program is not for me personally . It 's good to have choices of what you can look at ; but this program will never be tuned in on my television again . Different strokes for different folks .	-1
Did n't care for it - just too stupid for me . Maybe if I watched more of it but so far it was n't worth my time .	-1
We really do need more shows about stupid white people because we really do n't have enough . I mean there in only 'The Real World & # 34 ; , & # 34 ; Jersey Shore & # 34 ; , half the shows on the history channel . I guess this is special though , it has hill billies in it .	-1
Admittedly we 're only 6 episodes in but sadly there 's been a big drop in comedic quality since season 15 . Something has gone sadly wrong this year where the normally sharp satire has been replaced with parodies of TV shopping networks , other TV shows and 'specials ' that do n't make any sense in the South Park universe ( Cartman becoming Jewish ? ) .I 've been a huge fan of South Park for years , often wondering how they manage to maintain quality for such a long running show . But unless things improve soon , it looks like season 16 may be South Park 's `` Simpsons moment '' , marking the turning point where the show loses its edge . Are the best days still to come for Stan , Kyle , Kenny and Cartman ? Please prove me wrong .	-1
If you have n't purchased this yet , do n't bother . As another reviewer wrote , Season 2 was probably the best , but it was slowly downhill from there . This season hit the bottom . Minimal effort on all fronts .	-1
I enjoyed the shows and now every time I try to access one it says c content not available this is not the show rather something with Amazon	-1
THE MOTH DIARIES looks nice , creating Gothic atmosphere in a modern setting . Ultimately , though , it 's a hollow and uninspired film . Is Ernessa a true vampire or does Rebecca create her fears to eradicate herself over guilt she feels from her father 's tragic death ? The movie 's failure to support either scenario results in an uneven film resulting in a disappointing conclusion.The cast does well , but the romantic subplot with Rebecca and the handsome professor has no real impact on the film . MOTH DIARIES is another example of style over substance .	-1
What can I say ? I like things from the I.D . channel but ( honestly ) -- even with the disclaimer -- this was far too raw for me.After 3 episodes , I must call it quits.Why ? Because while I understand that the world can be a wicked place , I do n't always want to know just how wicked/evil it is.Because sometimes ( and for some people ) the suffering of the innocent can haunt you ... Because most times ( if not always ) there is simply NOTHING redemptive ( or entertaining ) about sexual sadists and the pleasure they gain from subjecting others to their sick and defiled mental and/or physical wanderings ... This program ( while informative ) could not silence the voice inside my head that kept reminding me that it was not `` good '' for me . Nor could it help me not to think about the victims and their families.In addition ( particularly in this first episode ) it could not quiet the distress I felt in knowing that there are parents who , by their depraved actions , create a heart of depravity in their own children . ( For longer than I care to remember , I will be reminded of what her father told her and did to her on the evening of her mother 's death ... Having suffered another horrendous end , only by the grace of God would it be possible for her to end up being someone other than who and what she became . When it 's clear that the perpetrator is also the victim ? Nothing entertaining about it . Only fills my heart with sorrow which I really do n't need ... ) Finally it became too much for me to know that there are women who would be , could be , complicit in such acts . ( Episode 3 - allowing your husband to rape his own child and you being a part of it -- what more can be said ... ) Do n't get me wrong . I love forensic type programs but ... This program is about the utter destruction that 2 depraved hearts ( joined together ) can bring about against the innocent for nothing other than their own pleasure . In it the worst of what can be found in a man and a woman is lived out . It 's about fantasy 's becoming real , hearts becoming hard , and consciences becoming seared.All in all , the `` realness '' of it all is too much for me.Just too much ...	-1
I 've watched a few of these so far . Not sure I 'll watch the rest . They 're not bad , just uneven . The show on lightening was informative , but the blizzard episode was just lame . It should be titled & # 34 ; Do n't you people check the radar ? & # 34 ; The show covered people caught in blizzards . One guy decided to get away for a while in the Pacific Northwest , so he hops in the car and starts driving without adequate supplies or adequate clothing . Oh , and without checking the radar . So , he drives straight into the teeth of a HUGE blizzard and gets stuck . For 2 weeks . The moral of that story is to know what you 're driving into and prepare for it before you leave the house . With all the mobile technology we have at our disposal these days ...	-1
Low grade film not very interesting to watch . Story does not build up . Other shows like 48 hours has better interviews .	-1
Too much reality ... did not watch but 10 minutes ... .not my kind of show . There is nothing more to say . Really , really .	-1
Do n't like real cop or drama shows . If you do you would like this because it shows how the cops handle a homiside .	-1
I am a sucker that wasted my money by going with the cover picture ( the statue ofLiberty pounded by flaming meteors ) .

This movie rates as my all-time worst movie ever made . A third grader can make a more coherent and interesting movie.This movie is supposed to be about the end of the world , at 4:44am covering the last evening and morning . To sum up the movie there is : -overly extended sex scene . Willem Dafoe is gross . It 's not hot or sexy , but if you want a sex scene , do n't drag it out ... 30 seconds would have done rather than the 5-plus minutes of amateur shots.-painting . Lady , we get it , you paint.. and your paintings suck.-walking . Lots of walking for no purpose . In one scene , a stationary camera filmed the actress walking from one end of the apartment to the other ... for 30 seconds . No cuts , just one long shot.-lots of tv clips of interviews ... this is a good 1/3 of the movie and serves no point what-so-ever.-going out on the balcony and looking meaningfully at the McDonald 's across the street.-being shocked , absolutely shocked that you watched a person climb over a 4th story railing and jump off the building to their death ... and then Dafoe , a few seconds too late yells out like he wanted to help him . You watched him climb over the railing and said nothing . Are we supposed to believe you did n't know he was going to jump ? -Visiting friends who are partying . One of the wo n't do drugs because he wants clarity for the end ... are we supposed to believe that.-THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF ANY DISCERNABLE SCRIPT AT ALL . Everything was ad-libbed with a general idea of what to talk about.. and it shows . At least reality TV is fun and more scripted than this disaster.-Some asian kid delivers chinese take-out a mere few hours before the end of the world ... why ? Like anybody would actually be working ? -The movie is one long ad for Skype.I wanted EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER AND PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FILM TO DIE . Even the ending was messed up as it took about 5 minutes to pass 2 minutes of time ... . and the end of the world is a fade to white . You do n't even get to see these horrid actors burn which would have been the only redeeming characteristic of this travesty impersonating a film.I am shocked Willem Dafoe is in this . Him having made this makes him clearly not Willem Dafriend as the movie and his performance clearly show no respect for writers , cinematographers , filmmakers , directors , actors , the audience , the popcorn guy , not even the cockroach that eats your dropped popcorn . They should pay you to watch this movie but even that is cruel and unusual punishment.Watched on Showtime as it comes with my cable package .	-1
What would you do on the eve of the planet 's destruction ? That is the question posited by Abel Ferrara 's `` 4:44 Last Day On Earth . '' The answer , it would seem , is to live it much like any other . I 'm a fan of Ferrara as a filmmaker , I find him refreshingly unpredictable . I 'm not sure , however , that `` 4:44 Last Day On Earth '' conveyed and/or made the most of its intriguing premise . While I appreciate that not every apocalyptic endeavor has to be big , bold , and melodramatic -- at times this felt so underplayed as to be virtually non-existent . While the concept and images advertising the movie may make it seem like a thriller ( the word suspenseful is used in the description ) , this is a slow burn contemplation in which not much happens . Luckily , Ferrera had the wherewithal to cast Willem Dafoe as his central protagonist . Dafoe , as usual , makes for interesting viewing . This seems like an incredibly personal work for Ferrera and the intimacy that Dafoe brings to his performance is never less than fascinating.The inconvenient truth of the situation is that Al Gore and his contemporaries were correct about their dire environmental predictions . Catastrophe , however , is way ahead of schedule and the end of the world has been pinpointed with precision . How ? Do n't ask . Despite the fact that it is supposedly the last day on earth ( not everyone believes it , even though news broadcasts have ended due to the imminent game changer ) , nothing seems too drastically different in Dafoe 's neighborhood . Traffic and pedestrians seem normal , stores and bars are open , you can order Chinese food . There is never a real sense of doom . Most of the movie is spent in one apartment with Dafoe and his girlfriend ( Shanyn Leigh ) dancing , using Skype , painting , making love , or just hanging out independently . Ferrera 's point , perhaps , is that life goes on even if there is n't much of it left . While an interesting notion from an intellectual perspective , it does n't necessarily make riveting entertainment.I do give `` 4:44 Last Day On Earth '' a marginal recommendation ( mostly for the performances ) for the arthouse crowd , I 'm not sure the film will have a universal appeal . At a mere 82 minutes , I kept wishing 4:44 in the morning would arrive sooner . The film has a pleasing grittiness and rawness , and I appreciated the use of actual news footage ( constantly playing in the background ) to make the apocalypse seem tangible . Once again , do n't think this is a thriller ! It is a stagnant character piece with minimal dialogue . I 'm not sure what I 'd do on my last night on earth , I can only hope it would be more interesting than what is presented here . Ferrera 's vision is filled with shopping , Chinese take-out , and karaoke . An interesting approach , to be sure , but not as compelling as I hoped . Watched it with a friend , he bailed at the 30 minute mark . KGHarris , 7/12 .	-1
I am very open minded when it comes to movies in general and indie films . And I am a huge Willam Dafoe fan as he is a great actor , but this movie was a tragic waste of time , space and MONEY . I ca n't believe I paid $ 6.99 to watch this terrible movie ! The script was terrible , character development poor , acting okay and there were NO special effects for an end of war movie . Throughout this film , I could not help that this was a political ( global warming , save the planet ) infomercial.That said , save your time and money on this one ... not worth watching !	-1
A newscaster telling people to just be with their loved ones because it was all going to end - the scene is rather haunting in its own right . There is a sense of despair and giving up as everything is gone . That 's a great moment but it 's unearned . It 's unearned because it is coming in the middle of a movie full of these non-action moments that are supposed to be haunting and mysterious but ultimately just prove dull and uninspired . Whether Willem Dafoe is going on the roof and yelling at people or they are ordering Chinese food , nothing is really happening in this things.If these moments were part of an overall story , great . But they are simply scenes from boring people in a nice apartment sitting around and waiting for things to end.Never has a movie depicted characters that are so in tune with the audience .	-1
Not as funny , and Gibby as a grown-up is kinda sad . Carly 's older brother is not as cool this time around . He just does the same ol ' stuff . Sad .	-1
This show is unwatchable and horribly acted . It is also extremely boring and not funny in the slightest . Do n't waste your money on this crap .	-1
I understand that `` iCarly '' is a wildly popular television series , so because of my negative criticism of its quality I will probably wind up receiving a number of negative votes from customers . But , as we start , I just would like to politely ask you to please read my full review first before deciding whether or not my critique was unhelpful.When this program first started , albeit it did generate a few chuckles ( and at one point it left me laughing hysterically ) , for the most part I was not highly amused by it , and seeing as this is usually my sense of humor , I was confused as to why I simply did not find most of this entertaining . But as the years have passed by , I realized exactly why I was not amused : because it can be so amazingly hokey that it is a wonder as to why it grew to be so popular.And I realize that hearing about it may SOUND funny , and hearing about a few comedic elements featured in the series make it seem interesting , but to provide you with an example of what `` iCarly '' truly is like , I would like to ask you to think back to a moment where you tried a new food for the first time that you figured you would fall in love with or assumed would taste delicious , based on the fact that it looked delicious or that many people had described it to you as such before . Then when you actually sampled the dish for the first time , you found it so disgusting and foul that you could n't bear another spoonful of it , or , at first , you enjoyed it and kept going at it , but , little by little , you slowly and gradually started to realize how nasty it truly tasted and could n't handle it anymore . Or , maybe you just wanted to like it so badly that you had actually managed to convince yourself that you did , when in fact you did not at all or barely did . That is what `` iCarly '' feels like.Right away , someone may not realize the cheesy qualities of a majority of the jokes featured in this series . But , if you watch a few episodes and really focus on the little bits and pieces of dialogue and their content , you will slowly start to realize how corny it really is . Not to mention that the titular character possesses a few Mary Suish qualities ; she is pretty , sweet , `` funny '' ( or so the program labels her as ) and normally does what is right , albeit she is still prone to a few bratty moments . Not to mention that she is the object of multiple infatuations amongst boys and gets good grades , and she lives a teeny-bopper 's dream life ; raised by an eccentric ( but annoyingly childish and dimwitted ) older brother who is noteworthy for crafting the most idiotic art projects imaginable ( a Christmas tree decorated with fake noses instead of ornaments , for example ) , grouchy , ill-tempered teachers who are so mean and furious and over-exaggerated that they can seem stupid at times , and so many over-the-top , unrealistic situation comedy storylines . There is constant shipping amongst characters ( `` Team Edward '' / '' Team Jacob '' -type shipping ) and the problem is that the main characters almost NEVER LOSE . I can remember at one point where they did , but that is just about it , unless you count the episodes where everyone loses but everything somehow manages to turn out sunshine and rainbows anyway . Carly always manages to come out on top at the end , never comically losing , really , of course everyone loves what she does and she always winds up winning , everything turns out right . I once heard a reviewer comment that the program serves as an escape for children from reality . Yeah , it does , for spoiled teeny-boppers who think that the world revolves around them . `` iCarly '' would not last a day if we were living in a world of children 's television of higher quality , mark my words . A lot of times , it 's so corny it sounds an awful like the deliberately-horrible attempts at making a cheesy situation comedy you may find people watching on other shows and being bored by . NICKELODEON IS SLOWLY EVOLVING INTO THE DISNEY CHANNEL ! EVERYBODY RUN FOR YOUR LIVES ! !	-1
There are few touching moments in this film . But you have to wait to find them . It 's the waiting part that ruins the film . What I remember most is that none of the characters had any redeeming qualities . They were all weak , is some way or another .	-1
This movie was boring . There are some movies that brilliantly let the viewer experience violence , without the violence actually being seen , leaving the viewer to reconstruct the scene in his/her mind , and/or consider ambiguous plot details ( who is the actual killer ? ) . Pulp Fiction comes to mind , at least insofar as most violence was just barely removed from the actual screen . This film tries to recreate that approach , but it falls flat . There has to be a strong plot connection for the actual violence/implied violence to have an impact , and that connection is lacking here . In most scenes , we come to realize that someone has been killed , but rather than having a strong emotional impact , its a simply `` so what '' event . The viewer is never brougth into the antagonist 's or protagonist 's emotional sphere , so you never really care . You never feel like the protagonist ( Luke Wilson ) is actually threatened , so everything else has no impact . Further , Luke Wilson , while decent for low brow , college-level humor , is way out of his league playing this kind of role . The movie is just flat and dull , not recommended .	-1
Should be called `` meeting boredom '' , `` mistakes on a bane '' , `` djang-doh '' , `` brown snake moan '' , or `` proxy brown '' . Ok I 'll stop . I '' m saying this movie is poop and the world is less fun from having seen it . I think it was made so that Luke and Sam could race lamborghinis off a cliff while high-fiving ( lukes ' from the uk ) .	-1
I watched this as a Prime customer for free . It was worth about half of that . Very similar to stepping in dogcrap . Now I have to go bathe .	-1
Sometimes with Samuel L. Jackson you get him playing a hero or a villain and honestly he 's good at both . He did a good job playing his character in this one as an evil eyed killer that murdered people `` just because '' . His role in the film is one of the movies more redeeming qualities as I do n't believe it would have worked so well with a different actor . These `` I met a stranger '' type of movies really require just the right person with the right bits of crazy . The only other movie I think that pulled it off nicely was `` Blood River '' but that 's a whole different league.Meeting Evil is the story of a man who 's down on his luck with his job , his life , and his marriage . Everything that can go wrong did go wrong for him . He 's just a good guy trying to hold on to whatever positive he has left . What is unraveled in this movie is a much deeper personal look into John 's problems . The first of which starts as soon as he foolishly tries to lend a helping hand to a stranger that knocks on his door . Samuel Jackson plays `` Richie '' a sadistic killer that 's capable of doing anything and everything . John is at first very naive to all of this until he finally buts it all together for himself and finds himself caught in an even deeper mess than he ever imagined.What makes meeting evil good is that it brings up some interesting plot points and what makes it bad is that it never builds on them at all . It just sort of shows you one thing like Johns relationship with his female co-worker and then it never comes back to it . It 's sort of just left there when for the first half of the movie you 're basically watching the chemistry between the two characters . That 's just how `` Meeting Evil '' plays out . Good ideas that never seem to wrap themselves up . The ending to the film is a prime example of that as for the type of movie this is , it 's the type where a solid ending is needed but this one likes to leave on an open note.For those reasons I did n't enjoy Meeting Evil much . The majority of the show is watching people being senselessly murders ( although it 's portrayed very well adding mystery and allure to how Richie works ) but the movie never seems to have any uplifting moments or any point to it . It 's very dark and leaves you feeling kind of in a hopeless place watching the killer roam free and John dragged into it . There really are n't any heroes in this movie just victims . There 's no one to cheer for and Samuel Jackson with make you hate him by the time the final scenes come up . He just completely Evil in this movie and maybe that 's why I did n't enjoy it so much . Usually when Samuel Jackson plays a villain he has some trait that makes him likeable but , in this movie he is just sadistically evil.Without spoiling the movie which is easy to do as there are few twists in the shallow story , you really are just watching a movie about a pathetic man whose life turns upside down thanks to not only the killer that bumps into his life but the people that the man trusts as well turn out not to be on his side either.Overall I give the movie about a 2.5 out of 5 . I did n't enjoy watching it but , that does n't mean it 's a bad movie . I can see others watching it and enjoy it as it does have it 's good points but for me personally it 's just not my taste .	-1
This is one of those rare movies that I knew nothing about going in and frankly not much coming out . The film opens with a sinister stranger named Richie ( a scene chewing Samuel L. Jackson ) knocking on the door of suburbanite John Fleton ( Luke Wilson ) , despondent over the loss of his job . It seems Richie has car trouble as asks John for a push . One nit to pick is that Richie 's GTO appears to have an automatic transmission , so there is no clutch to `` pop . '' I digress.Somehow , Richie gets John to go with him after John 's leg is injured . This might be something expected in some teen horror movie but what kind of idiot is middle aged John ? Now I 'm still trying to figure out if this is some dark comedy , a horror film or just a by-the-numbers psycho-thriller . Richie and John travel the area , with several diversions by Richie that result in numerous deaths including at least one kid . John 's wife Joanie ( Leslie Bibb ) becomes involved after the murders are linked to her morose husband . One of the police detectives raises the issue of life insurance which of course , throws a possible murder-for-hire scheme into the mix . Ultimately we do n't get many answers in this poorly written disjointed mess .	-1
`` Meeting Evil '' is a movie of stupefying logic , inept writing , willful unpleasantry and a couple of good actors who are cashing checks and hoping no one sees them . To get through half the picture you will need to suspend your disbelief to the point of drooling in your popcorn . This is the sort of film recycled with parts from much better movies ( Collateral , Kalifornia , Cape Fear , Jackson 's own Lakeview Terrace ) , so surprises are n't exactly in store , the dialogue is painful to hear and the characters bear no resemblance what so ever to real people , they do n't even bear any resemblance to movie characters ; for example their is a small child and her dog who stand in the same spot for what must be hours in movietime , and it is for no discernible reason . Who this film exists for could be a study unto itself , but anyone with a working braincell or any self respect need not apply . This is more along the lines of audiences who wish not to be entertained , perhaps have never seen a better movie , or just like to say that they have sat through a film of near unbearable pain and lived to tell about it.The plot has timed , mild mannered real estate agent John ( Luke Wilson ) having a real sad sack of a day , he lost his job , his mortgage is in foreclosure , he has a stack of bills that read `` past due '' , and he fights with his wife ( Leslie Bibb ) for no particular reason . Then Richie ( Samuel L. Jackson ) enters his life , at first unassuming , but soon he reveals his very dark nature . Richie turns out to be a psychopath on a killing spree , a dozen in under an hour from my calculations , and he brings John unwittingly along for the ride . Richie 's motives seems to be nothing more than to turn John into a killer like him , or perhaps he believes it will turn him into a man like him . Obviously this will end up with John being mistakenly suspected of the crimes by the local inept authorities , of course it all ends at John 's house over dinner with Richie terrorizing the wife and kids.The film tries to work on a more psychological level , I guess , but it totally fails . The movie never actually explains any motives for the killing spree or any insight into the Jackson character , it seems as if he is supposed to be the embodiment of evil , possibly even the devil himself , but he is actually just a remorseless killer , or is he . The film leads to a dubious denouement , followed by a rather obvious cliched confrontation and then an unsatisfying anti-climax . This picture looks like it is under the inept impression that is supposed to be a character study , but it has no characters to study.Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors of his generation , but of late he has been stuck in something of a rut , he plays leads in terrible movies that go mostly unseen ( The Cleaner , Unthinkable , Arena ) and his successes of late have been cameos in superhero flicks . Here he plays a caricature of the Sam Jackson character , something else he has been doing a lot of lately , after just a few minutes of his shtick here the performance becomes unbearable to watch . Luke Wilson does n't fare much better , in fact he is unable to conceal his boredom with this trite , tedious material . But some of the supporting work is much worst , I suspect some of these `` actors '' were just friends , relatives , or investors . Supporting characters are portrayed even more dimly like the local police , embodied by Muse Watson as a cranky old veteran , and Tracie Thomas as his black stereotype female partner named Latisha.Directed by Chris Fisher , who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Thomas Berger ( Little Big Man , Neighbors ) , I had never heard of this filmmaker before so I did a check on him over at IMDb , I soon discovered why I did not know him . Up to this point he has been known for directing some pretty poorly received direct-to-dvd potboilers , titles like `` S. Darko '' , `` Street Kings 2 : Motor City '' , `` Dirty '' , `` Nightstsalker '' , `` Rampage : The Hillside Strangler Murders '' . `` Meeting Evil '' is Fisher 's first theatrical film , well sort of , you see it 's premiering on cable/satelite TV and then video on demand , before receiving a belated theatrical release in a few theaters . I suspect the limited theatrical release is an attempt to help Jackson save face , but they should n't have bothered , his career will be better served the sooner that this one is forgotten.I know , I know if you ca n't say anything nice , ... just one more thing , please . Add to this some of the most cloyingly pretentious cinematography , provided by Marvin V. Rush , a close collaborator on some of Fisher 's previously mentioned glories . Even at roughly ninety minutes `` Meeting Evil '' truly feels like an evening of unbearable torture . Yes , I believe that this the definition of torture porn .	-1
Perhaps the fact that `` Meeting Evil '' is written and directed by someone responsible for `` S. Darko , '' a pointless and confusing `` sequel '' to a cult classic `` Donnie Darko , '' would be worth mentioning . Yes , `` Meeting Evil '' is a mess . Well , it 's not exactly a total mess , thanks to the star Samuel L. Jackson and his mesmerizing performance , though I would rather be watching him in a superhero franchise or Quentin Tarantino film.Luke Wilson plays John Felton , a down-and-out real estate agent , who is visited by a mysterious guy , Samuel L. Jackson 's `` Richie . '' Richie seems interested in John , who , dejected and angry , barely controls his emotions . Richie follows John , even when it is obvious John does n't like it , and wherever Ritchie goes , strange things happen , like people suddenly disappearing.So who is Richie and what is his motive ? Without revealing too much about the movie , I would only say that the story does n't make much sense . The storyline is incoherent and illogical ( not in an intriguing way like a David Lynch film ) , and the subplot about a young woman Tammy ( Peyton List ) goes nowhere . You notice so many lapses of logic and so much inexplicable decision-making , hoping that they will be explained away before the film ends.But that does n't happen . ( You do n't see a big explosion on the DVD jacket , either , if I remember correctly ) . About 30 minutes in , the film gets boring as we come to realize that the film is nothing but a poorly assorted collection of clich & eacute ; ideas .	-1
OK series . Love Cieran Hinds though . He 's excellent as usual . Maybe I was just in a strange mood when I watched this .	-1
I 've only watched a couple of episodes , but it 's not for me . The violence and graphic murder scenes just do n't define what I consider entertainment . That being said , I 'm sure it will be very popular to many .	-1
Ouch ! Remind me to read the reviews and why it was recommended in the future . Perhaps the idea was to overwhelm the viewer with sensationalism to cover the qualities of the actors . The part of the 'actor ' ( Allen Daniels ) is the most convincing . The plot is reasonable but it seems to lose it 's way within the flashes of the past . If one watches part one , part two becomes almost inevitable viewing . Interesting for those who enjoy this genre . . . not recommended for those who are serious students of military history and wander into 'recommended ' without questioning why !	-1
No ! Watched 30 minutes and turned it off . Too edgy , gross , and dragy . Too many other good shows to fall for this one .	-1
This has been done so much better so many times ... . both in books and film that I found it to be quite dull and predictable . Characters are stereotypes . I do n't know who to blame -- producer ? writer ? director ? I watched 30 minutes then skipped to the end to see if I had figured out who did it -- I had , but anyone familiar with the genre would do the same .	-1
As a longtime Ciaran Hinds fan , as well as one who relishes crime dramas that shed light on the workings of tortured minds ( e.g. , Law & Order Criminal Intent ) , I could overlook the shortcomings of the first two-part episode ( Anna 's wobbly spike heels , the short skirt , the misty eyed but knowing looks , her thoroughly unprofessional demeanor , etc . ) , and gave it a rave review based on the strength of the final interrogation scene , dynamite , she showed what she 's made of , mettle-wise , matching the perp in intensity . His crimes made sense , though there were gruesome details galore , they struck me as realistic , not gratuitous or designed merely to shock . I also liked the promise of the attraction between the two leads , where would it lead ? Then I watched `` seasons '' 2 and 3.Gratuitous , preposterous . So many gaffes , overlooked leads and details , FOR EXAMPLE , ***SPOILER ALERT*** in Season 3 , they did NO background check on the perp 's brother ( ! ) , and they only thought to check on the whereabouts of the perp 's son at the last minute- gosh , he might have gone there ! And no reporting of the knowledge of the plane , no typing in of the plane 's serial number to see what/where it might be , absurd . The final scene wherein Ciaran and Kelly abandon the car and RUN down the runway after the plane was one of the stupidest scenes EVER . MANY plot points are left totally unexplained . It 's as though through some printing mishap every other page of the script failed to print and nobody noticed.RE : Season 2 , if you thrive on the lurid and the depths of human depravity , much the same way horror fans watch zombies eating people 's brains with glee , this may be your cup of tea , though I 'm sure you 'd like a story that makes SENSE as well . ***BIG TIME SPOILER ALERT*** A father who not only commits the most gruesome of murders , but forces one victim to eat excrement before dismembering her , also sexually tortures his son and daughters , operates on and removes his daughter 's reproductive organs , for FUN . I could n't overlook such blatant gratuitousness in any case , but there might have been SOME justification if we gained an understanding of such depravity , or the dynamics of the coppers ' interpersonal relationships , or what makes the characters tick , but no such luck . The leads and the other officers evince one-dimensional , erratic behavior that made NO sense.SO many errors , ludicrous ; for example , one of the daughters assaults detectives on two separate occasions , drawing blood , and no-one says a word ( they do n't even fight back , one just slinks away ) ! They do n't arrest people for assaulting police officers in the UK ? Also , they had the perpetrator 's voice on tape ( I think , or SHOULD have taped his calls ) , early on could 've matched the voice prints , AS WELL AS eyewitness identification of him , yet they do n't arrest him , simply learn more appalling details with each visit then go back to the squad room and look at the horrific crime scene photos again . When they finally do detain him , they sit him in an easy chair and serve him lunch , and , SURPRISE , he escapes . And a detective sleeping with a reporter , `` accidentally '' affording him access to her case notes ? And with no repercussions ? COME ON . Columbo or Inspector Morse this ai n't . Real UK cops must 've had a field day with this twaddle . I admit I was curious to see if things might improve in the final installment , but it 's not a Prime offering so that sealed the deal.For lurid and close to the bone that DOES make sense , ( to me , anyway ) , seeSingle Handed : Natural Justice , a VERY dark ( and profane , be forewarned ) , but superb Irish series available on Instant Video . And BOTH seasons are free to Prime members .	-1
This was really disappointing . As a long time Spiderman fan this show comes off as silly , and targeted at the youngest of children .	-1
With so much hype and talent on board , I was hoping for a much better product . Spectacular Spider-man was great and way too short ... I am still watching them every few months . Ultimate Spider-man has too many different styles , and too much story jammed in this , to makes it any fun . Shield , highschool , electric webs ? a spider-cycle ... c'mon ! The greatest hero in the world swings around NYC not rides a motorcycle ! Some of the fights have been good , but the quiet story parts are uninteresting . Marvel please look at Young Justice to see how a good cartoon is made or bring back Spectacular Spider-man . Spidey deserves a good cartoon ... .please , please , please ... .	-1
and spiderman uses it like a toy and that 's even the name of the episode like a toy..love to be able to watching it for free on Netflix , but very disappointed that I had to pay to watch it on amazon when I can watch it for free on Netflix , thanks again amazon for being to tricky sneaky and cheap	-1
I love this series and am a big fan but ... ..Giant robots ? ? ? Seriously ? ? ? All the other episodes are outstanding but this one is pathetic .	-1
There is no way to shut off the reply function on this review . If there were , I would.If you are the kind of person who is easily offended or wants to slam an individual for having an opinion that does n't follow along with the masses , then do n't read this . There are other reviews better suited to you . DeeLam and Lee make excellent points for how great they feel the show is . If you want that , then I strongly recommend you go there . Heck , Shinashi did n't even write a review of the first episode , but she felt so strongly about it that she 'll attack total strangers to defend it . I guess if you judge a thing by the company it keeps , then let your eyes be the judge and read on.Just to warn you , if you read this you will probably hate me for it . You will probably formulate ideas about my lack of intelligence and want to reply numerous times telling me how bad a human being I am . Likely , you will want to pick apart every word of my review . It may be an attempt to mirror how `` harsh '' one person called this review , or how `` brutal '' another dubbed its author . At this point , I do n't even care* . I wrote this to offer another opinion besides the hyperbole being showered upon this episode.Finally , this review is for this episode only . I have watched no other episode in the series . This episode was bad enough that I could not follow it any further . I 'm sure you 'll want to attack me for that too.I am not writing this to attack or offend anyone ... except maybe TLOK . If you feel like my perspective is faulty , ignorant , or just plain belligerent , I do n't care* . If you do n't even care what I have to say , but want to bash ME for making the comment , I do n't care* . If you are a parent just looking for a show for your kids to watch , eh , this will keep them entertained . It has lights and motion . Lots of bells and whistles . It 's either this or the Backyardigans ( although I think the latter is better conceived ) . Pick your poison . *When I say I do n't care , I do n't mean that I do n't think other opinions are valid . I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not-so-subtle inferences and implications of my indignity , THAT I do n't care about.The review:1 ) Aang 's epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord . There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc . Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal . Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off ? 2 ) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender , Zuko 's hunt for his exiled mother , along with the mysterious fate of Jet , the budding romances of Aang and Katara , and Sokka and Suki , and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season , a season that would never come.3 ) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant . This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine , but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that , other than providing latent back story , have no place in Korra 's story . The problem is , the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original , and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale . That was spread out ham-handedly over most of the show . It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcass . If you do n't like that analogy , pick your own to suit.4 ) Aang earned his powers . He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent , if basic , versions of the bending techniques , but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions . Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending . There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse . Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies , not adventure tales . If Korra is not learning , then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development , nor that of the story line . In fact , because she is so powerful , it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she ca n't learn what she wants exactly when she wants . Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No , Korra 's story did not need to follow Aang 's exactly , but she should not just have everything handed to her . If she had been a fourth generation decedent , that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next ... 5 ) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators . Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles . Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds . Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls , and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mass-transit system for people and cargo . In fact , there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it 's innermost source in bending . There is a reason why we have the expression , `` necessity is the mother of invention '' . If you do not need the improvement , it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden , Korra goes to Aang 's science city and finds microphones , televisions , cars , printing presses , guns , and all the other conveniences of modern society . Did everyone forget that Aang , Katara , and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires , bed rolls , and fish they had caught from a stream , as well as protect themselves with swords , boomerangs , and staves ? Korra is not that old , and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died . This means that the society 's evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime . This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between . Bending can not account for that , especially when this society seems decidedly anti-bending . If the civilizations that came before Aang , all of which had bending powers , had not come up with this super society , how now brown cow ? There were-what , 500 or so Avatars before Aang ? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about ? It makes no sense.6 ) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode , but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point , a sort of conspiracy theorist 's coffee table distraction if you will . How do you make such a crap-tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews ? Well , corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire `` Facebook Developers '' to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand `` likes '' to their brands to increase faith in their products . To me , it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra , Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous . If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion , it is merely that . I do n't care if it is true or not . I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice : Think for yourself . Watch the episode with an open mind like I did . If you think it 's the best thing you ever saw , `` like '' it on facebook ! If you think it sucked like I did , be careful should you place a review that states this . You may just be painting a target on your back , again , like I did . Do n't let people TELL you what to like , when to laugh , or to accept their hackneyed writing pell-mell .	-1
I found myself waiting for Ang to show up to brighten my day . The whole beauty and artistry of the original was downgraded in this . It shows that the producers wanted to make a quick buck by tapping into the children 's market . The original Avatar was actually beautifully put together . This is a piece of crap and destroyed most of my feelings about the original characters . Save your money	-1
I read the other reviews before writing my own . The interesting thing is the case was solved . It would be great if the episode was amended to include the rest of the case . The & # 34 ; psychics & # 34 ; were basically dead wrong , and the police were right all along . If the detective had found the lost tip , instead of wasting time with these & # 34 ; psychics & # 34 ; , the case might have been solved sooner . To read about the case , just google & # 34 ; Susannah Chase murder & # 34 ; .	-1
Reality check here ! Nothing is actually solved , no one is identified and there is no 'closure . ' Given the same information , what would your 'guess ' be ? Obviously murder lurks unsolved and foreboding , who committed the crime , where and with what ? Ah ! Perhaps it was Mrs. Peacock in the library with a candlestick . . . or could it be Colonel Mustard in the kitchen with a knife ? There would appear to be no doubt as to why this series was canceled or is there ? Have some funky fun and find your own answer !	-1
these women never discover anything . they 'sense ' things that have been in the news for months at one time . even tho they 've faded from public view , they never really come up with any enlightenment .	-1
I had a hard time trying to get into this story . Not something i wanted to spend time watching on .	-1
This series starts well , and for the first episodes promises to be a great Brit mystery / detective / serial killer story . The signs of the disaster are however there from the beginning -- overacted , over-analyzed personal issues and relations , too many conflicts for a conflicted smart detective and a bunch of bad bosses . Once the thing starts to go down , it simply becomes painful to watch . The plot regarding the investigation , which is good , gets diluted amid unappealing and impossible to believe piles of personal drama . Mind you , the wife of the good detective starts overnight hating her beloved husband because he can not solve a series of crimes in which the victims are women . This seem to clearly show her that he is a chauvinist who does not care about her . This silly plot line would have made some mild sense if it were not because the detective character not only seems not to be chauvinist but also is spending nights and weekends trying to solve the case , putting up with insufferable bosses , and ruining his career trying to solve the crimes . But the endless insane scenes of matrimonial fights are terrible and cut any mystery line . The fact that later the detective starts an affair with a female detective that , predictably , does not work and ends up involving more insufferable senseless relationship dialogues does not help . Neither does that every boss who is put in charge of the investigation is both and idiot and a bad police . I mean , of course no one will solve these crimes . The character are too occupied being miserable and boring to watch to get the job done .	-1
Sebastian Faulks ' novel is highly regarded . I 've not read it , but I 'll take people 's word that it 's good . Abi Morgan is a talented screenwriter whose work I 've enjoyed -- most recently , the series `` The Hour '' and the film `` Shame '' . So I should 've liked `` Birdsong '' . But for whatever reason , the potential in this project just did n't gel into anything particularly great . Perhaps the series needed to be longer : the love story feels rushed ; Eddie Redmayne 's compatriots in the trenches just seem like quick sketches ; and then it 's over . Well , it 's not over before we 're given the moral of story , delivered by a guy tragically dying in the trenches . `` It 's all we 're good for , '' the guy croakingly soothsays to Redmayne , while the strings weep in the background . `` To love and be loved . '' ( Hopefully this scene is not in the novel . ) But before we get to that pearl of wisdom , we must endure a lot of staring into the middle distance , mostly from Redmayne as he reminiscences about his lost love while in the trenches . The director was rather cruel to Redmayne , I should think . The guy is asked to look tragic throughout the whole picture , even in the pre-war scenes . He 's asked to break down and sob a few times . Actors hate that , by the way . Worst of all , he 's asked to whisper . A lot . Almost his entire dialogue is whispered . If you do n't have a decent home theater system with Dolby , you are well advised to turn on the Closed Captioning , unless you enjoy alternating your volume up and down between whispering and bombshells . I think some directors confuse whispered dialogue with Important Dialogue.The heart of the thing is the love story , but , as I said earlier , the story is too rushed for us to start really rooting for the lovers to come together . There is some nice intensity between them as they steal glances at each other and play some footsie on a rowboat ( for once , all the staring works to a purpose ) , but it 's just not enough . The lady is married to an impotent man , conveniently enough , and I think she 's supposed to be about 10 or so years older than Redmayne . But Clemence Poesy appears to be the same age as Redmayne , so it 's strange when she calls him `` my boy '' , and it 's even stranger when the 16-year-old daughter of the husband 's first marriage calls Poesy `` maman '' . Poesy seems like a fine actor , but this is a Casting Fail.As for the rest of it : there 's a Gallipoli-like futile charge against the Germans that fails because of incompetent planning by the military brass , but really , have n't we seen all this before ? In fact , we 've seen it in `` Gallipoli '' , a superior movie directed by Peter Weir . I could n't connect with the soldiers ' mission , and I could n't connect with them . One of them wears sweaters , sent from his mother back in England , over his army issue . Could n't tell you anything else about him , though . Perhaps Abi Morgan needed to spend more time on them . Perhaps the producers needed a bigger budget to expand the series.Or , and here 's a thought , maybe the original novel the series is based on is n't all that good to begin with , contrary to received opinion . All that I learned from `` Birdsong '' is that War , and French Ladies , are Hell . Tell me something I do n't know ! 2 out of 5 .	-1
A rating of PG is outrageous . The explicit overreach of sexual content is beyond the pale . This is not a movie for children , teens , twenties , thirties etc ... ... Movie studios need to wake up to their responsibility to the milieu . When Almighty God told us not to break the Commandments , He Meant It . A wink and nod has been given to the Movie studios and now we live with the consequences and spiritual cost of all of it . Must I explain the difference between love and lust or do most of you get it ? The acting was horrible , the story line was chopped up and the unredeeming end was a poor excuse for a movie . My Uncle fought in the Great War so believe me when I tell you that the men did not sit around the trenchs WHNING . They fought and died to win our freedom from tyranny by pushing the enemy back to Berlin . This movie belongs in the hall of shame .	-1
I never thought the war segments would be more interesting than the love story . Poor acting for the love story and so much dead pauses .	-1
I just could n't finish watching this one given the graphic portrayals of the sexual relationship between the two principal characters . While the relationship was central to what story line I could find ( and that in itself was a challenge ) I think it completely unnecessary to film the scenes in such graphic ways . I watch LOTS of British TV and drama but just had to turn this one off !	-1
I just could not get into this show . The characters were a little bland in my opinion and the story line was moving too slowly . If I had more time and nothing else to watch , I might have finished the first episode but otherwise , it did not hold my attention	-1
This video\series , wait I do n't know about the entire series , because I could not get through one episode . I have enjoyed many of the series that kindle\amazon offer , no t this . Wait is it possible to give a star- ?	-1
expected story to be much more real . male main actor always seem to be in a daze . horrible was going on and he 's in dreamland . I felt like shouting & # 34 ; snap out of it & # 34 ; did n't enjoy movie at all .	-1
I have n't watched the show in awhile . I just watch the end of the year reviews . What incredibly stupid people ! Nothing ever gets resolved . No one changes for the better . The most ignorant of them all , in my opinion , is Caroline Manzo . She needs to learn how to shut up . I also think that , as imperfect as she may be , Teresa is the most interesting and , in spite of the `` napalm '' error , she is probably the most intelligent of the bunch . I do n't understand why they are all ganging up on Teresa , but perhaps it is all a set up , in which case , we are fools for watching this garbage .	-1
I did n't really have high hopes for this apparent Paranormal Activity wannabe since I 'm not a fan of camcorder-style horror flicks to begin with , but this did n't even live up to my already low expectations . The first actor you see onscreen when the movie starts is Rick Gonzalez , who was a regular on the television series Reaper . I 've never seen one of these movies with a recognizable actor before because that ruins the illusion that what you are seeing is real , which is the main point of the camcorder-style format . But Apartment 143 turns out to be more like a bad episode of Sea of Souls than a Paranormal Activity knock-off , and the camcorder format is basically a misguided and unnecessary gimmick . The basic premise of the movie is that a team of researchers sets up shop inside an apartment where a family ( father , teen-age daughter , young son ) are experiencing what appears to be a haunting . There are phone calls with nobody there and ringing doorbells with nobody at the door and strange noises but even in real life this stuff would be more annoying than scary . Nothing remotely scary happens in the movie until nearly an hour in . The biggest problem with Apartment 143 , though , is that it has a very lousy script . The researchers are supposed to be experts in paranormal activity but the idea that a poltergeist might be the issue is n't brought up until nearly two thirds of the way into the movie -- but given the presence of an angry teenage daughter in the home that should have been one of the first things that occurred to all three researchers . Then in an amazingly laughable scene the head researcher suggests that the teen daughter might be suffering from the onset of schizophrenia -- because nothing says schizophrenia like furniture flying of it 's own accord across the room and characters levitating Exorcist style on their own . Ugh . There are a couple of decent shocks involving the daughter but otherwise this movie is a talky and poorly written bore . I would recommend pretty much any episode of the UK horror series Sea of Souls ( which has the same set-up of a trio of researchers investigating possible paranormal activity ) strongly over this film .	-1
the story is so cliche ; the acting is so rehearsed , forced and unnatural ; the banter between the characters is so annoying and stale- I made it 25 minutes before I called it quits.people who 've rated this `` movie '' 2+ stars seriously need to have their amazon reviewing privileges revoked !	-1
The film has some effective moments of tension . However , the filmmakers attempt a backstory explaining the source of the paranormal activity is weak , which is the main failing of the film .	-1
The primary problem with the found footage genre is that it blatantly violates the first rule of good storytelling , which is show , do n't tell . In my opinion I think this genre has run it 's course , it jumped the shark a Paranormal Activity or two back for me . And I actually fully enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity as well as the underrated The Last Exorcism , at least until it 's cop out ending . I even value The Blair Witch Project , more when it was first released than I do today , but it delivered what it promised , which may not have been much , but it delivered none the less.The latest crop of this genre , has nothing new to offer , the only interest can possibly be from people who enjoy the tedium of watching people do tedious things . These movies pretty well offer no surprises , one character in this film even states that he had figured out what was going on the moment that they walked through the door , amen . The jolts come from the surprise sprung on the drowsy half asleep viewer who has an hour in come to except that nothing will happen . I have even fallen pray to that.So is this some deep rooted grudge that I hold against the whole genre that has me lambasting the new flick Apartment 143 : not at all . This is a particularly bad example of an all ready dwindling genre that year after year continues to deliver ever further diminishing returns . Apartment 143 is the lamest , worst written and poorest acted that the genre has had to offer , yet.The story has three paranormal investigators , or more accurately as the syfy channel calls them , `` ghost hunters '' setting up cameras to help the White family find out who keeps ding dong ditching their front door . There are , of course , other signs of a ghostly haunting , the usual flickering lights , creaky sounds , prank phone calls , etc.The Whites it seems have suffered a lot lately , other than receiving disturbing phone calls from beyond , they have suffered a family tragedy . The mother of the family died in a car wreck , this leaves dad ( Kai Lennox ) distraught and guilt ridden , hot teenage daughter Catlin ( Gina Mantegna ) obnoxious and rebellious , and little Benny ( Damian Roman ) sad and talking to the ghosts that only he can see ; sorry audience , guess we 're just left out again.We get to watch father-daughter squabbles , with them and others spouting dialogue that is way too stiff to be spoken by real people . Then something happens , nothing special , but it happened . Finally some pervasive scares scenes , usually punctuated by a shaky camera movement , so that we ca n't really see anything , but know for sure that it is scary . This all goes on for an excruciating eighty minutes , but you will swear it was much longer . Oh , and the last shot is a total rip-off of the ending to the original Paranormal Activity.Found footage films try to follow in the noble foot steps of the great Val Lewton tradition by being about atmosphere and implication , well they can hope in one hand , and I will let you finish the metaphor . The only scares I get is when I realize that this is not the last of the genre , probably not even the worst : there is said to be a Christian themed film on the way about the horrors of finding some old VHS porno tapes , shriek . Well I guess there is an audience for it , at least we are past the torture porn cycle , but can someone please get back to making decent interesting horror films.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com	-1
Enjoy the dinosaur picture on the cover as this movie is really aboutanoying people wich will bring you to tears.There is absolutely no good value comming from this movie.The whole movie is seen through a camcorder viewfinder , the the camera girlis very very very annoying ... .It made me very very happy to throw the disk in the garbage ... as i donthave any enemies bad enought that i would give them this DVD .	-1
At the risk of tooting my own horn , I 'm comfortable admitting that I 'm far more forgiving of these `` found footage '' films than most reviewers . I 've no problem saying that I 've enjoyed the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise , even find them modestly creative in their own way . Also , that APOLLO 18 flick was n't all that much a failure , certainly not so much as the critics would have you believe . And , yeah , even THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT had some solid inspiration behind its formula to recreate an episode of ` The Twilight Zone ' on a very low budget . And as much as I wanted to give AREA_407 kudos for bringing that unique ` found footage ' perspective into monster and/or science fiction , I really wish someone would 've showed these filmmakers how to use a tripod or a track mount for much of it.See , AREA_407 - for all its strengths - I found very difficult to watch . The camera 's constant bobbing and weaving and shaking and climbing and arcing and dropping became nauseating by the second half . At 90 minutes , that 's a bit too long for the average viewer to stomach without a healthy dose of Dramamine to tide him over . The chief problem - unlike some of the other forays into ` found footage ' - is that quite a bit of AREA_407 takes place at night , in very confined settings , and under the tightly focused spotlight beam on a video camera . You do n't have anything to look away at , to momentarily refocus your field of vision , and , as a result , you 're forced to concentrate on a screen too intently for too long a time.After boarding a plane on New Year 's Eve , two sisters begin videotaping their encounters with fellow passengers . It does n't take long for the audience to realize that this plane is going down . Once on the ground ( and for reasons that really defy storytelling logic ) , the girls continue videotaping their continuing attempts to frustrate those bruised and bloodied around them by capturing it all on videotape . And , once it becomes clear that they 're being hunted one-by-one for what would appear to be dinner by some monster , they still maintain the presence of mind to keep videotaping it all , each and every painful second . Now , I realize some could make the argument that the girls did n't know the video camera was on - that maybe they were only using it for the light - but the problem that they keep admitting to videotaping EVERYTHING debunks that argument.And that 's what 's a shame about AREA_407 : I really WANTED to love it . Not only does it have everything a good ` found footage ' flick should have , it 's also composed of equal parts LOST ( the TV show ) and JURASSIC PARK and CLOVERFIELD . These folks are trapped - in the dark - and there 's a monster out there . No , they do n't quite know what it is , but they see it in fleeting shots of light , and , thus , they can confirm that it 's big , it 's scary , and it 's hungry . And it is n't going away ! It 's an edge-of-your-seat thrill much of the time ... but , creatively , it should 've gone the way of ` found footage ' films like DISTRICT 9 did . They should 've used ` found footage ' for only the parts of the film that needed it ; then , when it became a traditional monster movie , they should 've laid the handi-cam aside and used traditional film equipment . They still could 've preserved the ` shock ' ending by going back to ` found footage , ' and , in my estimation , they would 've had a modest hit on their hands . All of the right ingredients were here ... they just had them in incorrect amounts.AREA_407 was produced by Suzanne DeLaurentiis Productions and Cloud Nine Pictures . DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group . How does it look ? Well , I think I 've covered that in pretty great detail , no ? How does it sound ? For the most part , I had no problem with the audio . Sure , given the nature of the method the filmmakers decided to tell their story , there 's some predictable and deliberate problems with it . Sadly , there are no special features to speak of on the disc . Shame on you , filmmakers . Shame on you.RECOMMENDED with modest reservations . I 'm giving it a solid two-and-one-half stars based on the finished product , but I do so not without warning . As I 've tried to make abundantly clear , this is one of them there `` found footage '' variety flicks . If you 're not into the herky-jerky camerawork , then AREA_407 is probably not for you because the herky and the jerky are front and center throughout all of it . Still , there 's a great story here - with some truly great scares - all given respectable life through the magic of film . When someone remakes this , let 's hope they get it right.In the interests of fairness , I 'm pleased to disclose that the good folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of AREA_407 by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review .	-1
Area 407 is a found-footage horror film . A plane crashes in a mysterious area ; the survivors are then stalked and attacked by a mysterious predator . The whole situation is documented by two sisters and a fellow journalists ( two cameras ) . I enjoyed the intro and felt it was done well . We meet the characters through some decent dialogue and witness a frightening plane crash ( at least for those of us scared to fly ) . Sadly , the movie goes downhill from here . It uses some very generic found-footage scenes like the shouting exchange found in most : `` Please stop recording ! Now is not the time ! STOP ! '' ( then hit the camera and cut out , recording restarts in a new scene ) . Also , I felt a lot of it was illogical , more than your average horror film . They take an hour to get the first-aid kit after the crash , the U.S. Air Marshall does n't identify herself for hours after the crash , and the flight attendant and the Air Marshall do n't really know what they 're doing ( are n't there emergency procedures for this instead of sitting around ? ) For a horror movie , I was n't really scared , maybe once or twice . It had some tense moments , though . Acting ranged from good to bad . The ending was also decent , but not enough to complete redeem the film completely . It 's a time-killer , though.Overall , it 's not the worst found-footage film , but it 's far from the best . If you 're still interested , this film is available on Netflix Streaming as of 9/2/12 , I ca n't recommend paying directly for this film.Area 407 has strong violence and blood ( most of the violence is off-screen ) , no sex or nudity .	-1
Utilizing the increasingly popular `` found footage '' genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation , `` Area 407 '' is never particularly effective at establishing its intentions . It 's hard to discuss the flaws of the film without revealing too much , so I 'll be purposefully vague . The movie charts a plane crash and its immediate aftermath in a desert region of the United States . The survivors of the crash face two imminent dangers ( which I wo n't discuss ) but the two threads do n't really work well together . As the DVD cover positions the film as a monster movie , I 'll say that particular element is handled reasonably well . You get occasional glimpses of the terror , but nothing of a full reveal until the very end . The more human side to the threat is a LOT more vague , unexplained , and frankly lacking in logic . I did n't necessarily hate `` Area 407 , '' it just offers little new to this overused film technique . You 've seen similar movies and you 've seen them better.The movie begins on New Year 's Eve as a cross country flight from New York to Los Angles is about to embark . Two young sisters are among the passengers and the youngest is filming everyone in the most irritating way possible . Not to be unkind or personal , but the voice is like nails on a chalkboard . Seriously , I 'd have rammed a pencil in my ear if I had been seated next to her . But of course , she is super precious and charming to everyone else and they proceed to treat her like a two year old for the remainder of the picture . The plane crash itself is decent , and I loved the way everyone 's head was splattered with massive amounts of bright red blood afterwards . A small band of survivors now must face the ultimate challenge to their survival . Who will make it through the night ? What is stalking them ? And can anyone help ? The movie plays just as you would expect with people dropping like flies.I had two major issues with `` Area 407 . '' First , the logic of the `` found footage '' style is never adhered to very well . In one scene , for example , a menacing noise is heard in the woods . The young lady holding the camera never swings around toward the source of the noise like you would in real life , she keeps the shot firmly on the flight attendant 's reaction . In a normal chain of events , they 'd have been using the light to try to see what was making the noise and the attendant would have screamed `` get that camera out of my face , you bozo , do n't you hear that screaming ! '' But even more distracting , the film seems to lack a real screenplay ( although FIVE people share a story credit for this thin tale ) . The cast ( a couple of which are quite good ) seem to be making dialogue up as the movie zips along . Needless to say , quite a few awkward and ridiculous phrases and exclamations are uttered before the night is through . All in all , the entire endeavor feels slight , familiar , and relatively amateurish . My simple wish is never to see another `` found footage '' thriller until someone has something new to offer . `` Area 407 '' is not that movie . KGHarris , 8/12	-1
This is another hand held camera , so it must be real film . Two sisters are flying on New Year 's eve from NY to LA . The younger sister Trish ( Abigail Schrader ) is filming everything which allows some minor character introduction . It was so authentic , it was boring . It just so happens there is a professional journalist on board with a powerful light so he can shoot video at night . His ability to hold the camera still leaves much to be desired.Once the plane crashes ( description of film ) one passenger Charley ( Brendan Patrick Connor ) provides for the internal conflict . There is a woman marshal on board ( Everette Wallin ) so there is someone with a gun . Fear and terror are generated by shaking the camera real fast and having everyone scream and shout at the same time . This worked better than the occasional glimpse of the rubber headed dinosaur looking predator.They crash in the land of & # 34 ; it is always dark & # 34 ; and they keep filming with a light that would attract predators . Everyone has various amounts of bright red blood on them.This movie reminded me of & # 34 ; Chernobyl Diaries & # 34 ; in its basic formula . What you thought about & # 34 ; Chernobyl Diaries & # 34 ; will determine if you like this one . I did n't like the & # 34 ; Chernobyl Diaries. & # 34 ; PARENTAL GUIDE : F-bombs , no sex , no nudity .	-1
Always hopeful when finding new critter films , I made the mistake of buying into this pile of crap . We all know the SYFY channel is continuing to crank out godawful , unoriginal trash with abandon but even this falls below their `` standards '' . The creature `` effects '' may even have been lifted from an old SYFY flick - or a coloring book - not sure ... I gave it a star only because I could n't submit a review otherwise . My hand shook with the torment of having to do so.Suffice to say , if I were on a desert island with a magical DVD player that worked without benefit of electricity or batteries and only this film to watch , I 'd throw myself off the nearest cliff .	-1
The video streaming quality remained at `` very poor '' throughout this viewing of the first episode of this season , greatly diminishing the experience . It was as though I had smeared Vasoline all over my screen and then tried to view it . Usually , the quality starts at very poor but after a couple of minutes it improves suddenly -- not so this time . My DSL speed is 15 mps and usually allows excellent streaming quality so the culprit seems to be Amazon 's server . What recourse does one have when this happens ?	-1
I was hoping is was more like & # 34 ; flip this house & # 34 ; , and was disappointed . Mostly arguing with family members and not really showing great success with the home .	-1
If you are very new to the topics you may enjoy this series . And although there are some tiny portions of genuinely new and informative content , it is too little and too infrequent . It is frustratingly condescending and even silly at times for those who are familiar with the topics . None of the episodes are worth watching for veterans of these sorts of documentaries except perhaps the `` Is there a God '' episode.The `` Is there a God '' episode is surprisingly less condescending . The vocabulary is not dumbed down at all and the there are only a couple silly sidebar explanatory analogies . But the approach to the topic is brazenly insensitive , arrogant and potentially offensive to just about anyone who adheres to a religious Faith.From that episode , it looks like Stephen Hawking has chosen to join the `` there is no god '' crowd .	-1
It is a shame , very interesting topics , dumbed down to the lowest common denominator ( a retarded grain of sand ) . Science is interesting , you do n't have to create all of this fake drama , & use flashy editing techniques to try to make people think it is exciting .	-1
This show is a blatant rip off of Tosh.0 . And this show is just not as funny personally . I could not get into it , his show with his bodyguard was probably the best . He has tried to branch off into too much and it just is n't as good .	-1
Note to Hollywood and beyond : I 've really grown tired with trick endings . It is n't that I do n't like then because , frankly , I do . It 's that most of them are n't done all that well any longer . As a matter of fact , once you know you 're trapped inside a motion picture that undoubtedly will have a trick ending ( the first giveaway is that you can tell one 's coming ) , then you begin w-a-t-c-h-i-n-g the film yet you stop watching the story . You find yourself glancing at shadows . You listening for verbal clues to secret identities or dropped Easter eggs . You 're seeing that body over in the corner of the screen , and you 're wondering , `` Hey , why is it the director never shows me who that dead guy is over there ? '' At that point , it 's stopped being a legitimately entertaining experience and started being an exercise in cognitive reasoning ... and that 's not the reason I spun the disc in the first place ! ( NOTE : the following review will contain spoilers solely necessary for the discussion of character and plot . If you 're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free , then I suggest you skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment . If , however , you 're comfortable with a few hints of ` things to come , ' then read on ... ) George ( played nicely by the reliable Rupert Evans ) is a down-on-his-luck musician who - in order to make ends meet - takes a job as ` chef ' at the local insane asylum . ( Where did he get such a romantic background and why is it he can only find a job cooking at a virtual prison ? Ah , ah , ah ! Do n't start looking so closely so soon , viewer ! ) In order to make his existence a bit more palatable , he somehow manages to have all of the members of his band also hired at the said institution . ( Wait a minute ... how exactly does that happen ? Ah , ah , ah ! I warned you about thinking too much about the plot ! ) But before you can say ` twaddle , ' a freak electric storm knocks out all power to the normally secured building ( AND the back-up generators ? ! ? ! ) , and George and his friends are left locked behind bars with time running out on their own sanity as the inmates seize control ! ( Well , how in the Sam Hill is that even remotely ... FOR THE LAST TIME , DID N'T I WARN YOU TO STOP THINKING ABOUT IT ? ! ? ! ) ASYLUM BLACKOUT did n't make much sense from the get-go , but , to its strengths , it 's certainly grounded in some solid work by all the players , a wonderfully moody atmosphere complete with all of the usual ` locked box ' scenarios , and some fine dark'n'gritty filmmaking . Were that enough , I 'd probably be willing to give it more than a respectable two-and-one-half stars ( most of which is solely for some solid technical and acting prowess ) ; but , sadly , all of it revolves around a central conceit of the trick ending . I could n't tell you exactly when I started to suspect exactly `` What '' was going on - it 's fairly predictable as a trick ending , I might add - though , based on my description of the plot , methinks you can tell it was early on.Narratively , it is structured very well . It 's a tidy 90 minutes , broken into clear thirds like a classic three-act play . The first 30 minutes is set-up of all the players ; the second 30 is when the black-out occurs and everything goes downhill fast ; while the final 30 clearly begins pointing toward the ruse you 'll probably see coming . Suffice it to say , folks are n't exactly what they seem ... but the critical failure of the particular subterfuge of S. Craig Zahler and Jerome Fansten 's script is that , by the final third , there 's no room left for subtlety . What should play out as mind games end up being something fairly close to torture porn - a plot device used way too frequently in horror films these days.To further beat the dead horse , the dodge they use makes little sense to the chronology of the film : the final moments are a book-ended revisitation of the picture 's opening segment , forcing you - the viewer - to suddenly realize what you may have just seen may , in fact , NOT be what you just saw . While others might find this ` genius ' or ` groundbreaking , ' I found it more than a bit fraudulent.MODESTLY RECOMMENDED . It 's probably a one-off picture for most people ( meaning it 's worth a single viewing ) . The ultimate problem with ASYLUM BLACKOUT is n't in its performances or execution ; rather , it 's in its conception . Given the nature of the story - think of a really good episode of ` The Twilight Zone ' that went too far - is that once you know the ending , you have to re-evaluate everything you 've seen heading up to it . When you look too closely at the seams , then suddenly you realize you 're W-A-T-C-H-I-N-G a movie instead of being immersed in one - the way you are a really good book . Instead of enjoying it , you realize that you 've been duped - and not in a good way - only now you 've wasted the last 90 minutes and ca n't get ` em back ... which is kinda/sorta like what happens to George .	-1
Opening credits lists an asylum in Washington State as the source and the date of 11/6/89 of this patient breakout - sorry , despite the docudrama feel it never happened on that or any date and for that matter in any state . Our Belgium `` Tax Shelter for Films Investing '' studio must have played pin-the-tail-on-the-map as a site location for their fantasy tale . As for the script it 's usually females that are picked by writers as victims who can only make dumb decisions while being implausibly `` no way out '' trapped by bad whatevers but in this case it 's a rock band group ( How could all of them have gotten the same cafeteria jobs at once ? ) having to defend themselves . The whole thing seemed contrived and as artificial as the blood . You have to be desperate to want to see red stuff ( sort of since the lights were mostly out ) to last through this one . The whole production seemed cheap . Must not be a lot of investors ( they actually listed their names ) seeking some tax sheltering .	-1
[ BEWARE : The following review of `` The Asylum Blackout '' contains minor spoilers . ] The title tells everything about the story . Well , apparently . In `` Asylum Blackout '' ( aka `` The Incident '' ) George , an aspiring rock musician ( Rupert Evans ) , is seen working as a cook at the Sans Asylum . One night , while working at the asylum 's kitchen with his friends and band members Max ( Kenny Doughty ) and Ricky ( Joseph Kennedy ) , there is a power failure due to a storm , and they are trapped inside the facilities with the inmates , who start attacking the guards.Director Alexandre Court & egrave ; s ( his feature debut ) takes time in setting up the character of George - serious-minded and short of sleep - and does it very well . George is very tired and clearly needs a rest , while the story unfolds from his viewpoint . George says the riot is instigated by a certain inmate , but is it true ? `` Asylum Blackout '' has a few violent and gory torture scenes , but as the film 's bizarre conclusion suggests , it obviously attempts to be something more than a survival horror , something more psychological . While the dimly-lit photography and stylish camerawork are effectively employed to represent the disturbing situations that surround George , there is also something wrong with the film 's premise.For , in order to make the film an engrossing psychological thriller , you need , besides atmospheric photography , better narrative skills in telling the story . While watching the chaos that is going on inside the asylum , we ask ourselves : how come these security guards are inadequately armed when they are supposed to deal with violent and dangerous inmates ? Why do the police take such a long time to respond ? The film has potential for a more unnerving horror , but to create one you need a set-up that is more credible and intriguing .	-1
This is a badly made movie . Bad story , bad plot and terrible acting.It amazes me that movies this awful actually get made and distributed .	-1

Now I know that anyone can make a movie . The grainy black and white filming was interesting , and really did n't add to the movie . It 's like they said & # 34 ; We 'll save money if it 's not in color & # 34 ; .	-1
ONE GREAT THING IS THAT THIS IS NOT A & # 34 ; FOUND FOOTAGE & # 34 ; MOVIE ! Filmed with grayscale effect and at some scenes it will go into full colour . Yes , it will go into full colour especially on those scenes that has upper body nudity . In terms of demon characteristics of the characters , I find it weird how a succubus is portrayed in the film . Succubus does not make a dead person comes alive ! Exorcism does not work as it is portrayed in the movie . Demons do n't die . It can only be banished . And you have to make the demon tell you its name to banish it.The following are what I found good in the movie : -Audio overlay throughout the movie-Yay ! Not one of those handheld camera movies : DThe following are what I found to be no good in the movie : -How the story escalated-Lack of research regarding demons and spirits-Sexual scenes are the & # 34 ; honey trap & # 34 ; of the movie ; you do n't need those scenes in a good horror movie ! -Please stick to one video format ; either grayscale or colour but not both !	-1
This kept coming up on my `` Recommended '' page because I 've been watching a lot of BBC series on Prime lately , so I thought , Oh , why not.This was a joint production between ITV and PBS , designed primarily for the American market . This explains the heaving decolletage and lip augmentation for the ladies , and the too-long hipster haircuts on the dudes , one of whom looks for all the world like Bob Dylan in his mid-60s Carnaby Street phase . Theoretically , the movie is based on a novel by Jane Austen . But even if you 're not an `` Austen purist '' , it would be hard to class this movie as anything other than a guilty pleasure , though I could n't tell you where the pleasure is to be derived . If you want an uncomplicated adaptation of Austen that focuses on the love story to the exclusion of all other concerns , I recommend the Gwyneth version of `` Emma '' -- at least that movie is occasionally humorous.I 'm finding it hard to find things to say about this production . It was over in about and hour and a half . All background , characterization , and nuance were thrown overboard in order to connect the dots on the map in the most single-minded and simple-minded manner that would arrive at the final destination . The heroine , as played by Billie Piper , bears not the slightest resemblance to the uptight stick-in-the-mud Fanny Price from the novel . ( Well , okay , perhaps that 's an improvement . ) Piper plays Price as a coltish ingenue with her hair perpetually down . And , from the looks of it , bleached . Hip.Blake Ritson as Edmund is the only actor among the younger members of the cast who seems to be making any effort to play a recognizably Austenian character . Generally speaking , the younger members of the cast act too `` modern '' , particularly the young woman who plays Mary Crawford . The older actors are hardly given any screen time , so I ca n't comment on their efforts.The fact that the entirety of the movie was shot on one location -- some grand old pile or other in Yorkshire -- says volumes about the cheapness of the production . Neither ITV or PBS really laid down any serious money for multiple sets or additional location shooting . A lazy production for lazy viewers : an adaptation of a literary classic done in the forgettable style of a `` Hot Pocket '' microwaveable meal . 2 out of 5 .	-1
Did not like this movie , there was too much running and did not enjoy the acting as much as the other version .	-1
I 've been looking for a good standup comedian that knows how to deliver real laughs without making me cringe or change the channel for fear that someone ( my grand kids ) would see me laugh at crude humor .	-1
At first , I could n't understand the low ratings this series got , but as I watched more of them , I could see a pattern repeating . Too much reliance on smutty jokes as a whole by each of the comedians , and whether intentional or not , a couple of the comedians seemed to be relying on the same material .	-1
I made it through about 15 minutes before giving up . It just was n't first rate material . It seems that a lot of stuff on Amazon Prime could be described this way .	-1
Not so funny . This appears to be the second tier of comedians . If you are looking for something to laugh out loud with , continue looking .	-1
This may be related to my sense of humor or my generation , but these people are no Robin Williams , or even Jeff Duham . Too much commentary on social issues or nu-relatable events instead of relating to common values or situations .	-1
this movie was boring and felt so fake and staged to me . Did not enjoy it but kept waiting to see if it got better	-1
Low budget film that is plagued by unoriginal scenarios , terrible effects , awful dialogue , and horrible acting ... and not in a good way	-1
God please tell these film school pimps to quit making these awful clones . It seems there is no end in sight of the film school rejects efforts at selling a product whose time has come and gone years and years ago ! Do n't make any more !	-1
I was happy when I found a bunch of new additions to streaming . Until I started to watch 'em . Geez ... man , how easy is it to get your flick out there these days ? ? ? Movie making used to be a complex undertaking . You have lots of different elements that need to be executed , coordinated , put together , and then finally distributed . Not for the faint of heart ! But it must not be that way anymore , judging from the latest batch of secretions up for our viewing pleasure ! I will admit I did not put myself through to the end , not even the middle . I immediately noticed that the camera work was subpar , well below even soap opera standards . The acting , if you can call it that , well ... . sorry , no . Once we got to the screaming , 'possessed ' kid , I bailed . No friggin ' way ! Seriously man . Just no !	-1
The film makers really should stop watching reality TV and actually go to film school to learn how to make movies .	-1
I fell asleep twice while trying to watch this . Honestly , this could have been done in one episode . I ca n't think of a single highlight worth mentioning . But I was curious about what Carole had done to her lips . But if you are into whining ... you will enjoy both episodes . If you are into fakeness ... you will enjoy Aviva in the reunion episodes . I did however finally realize who Heather reminded me of ... it has bothered me all season . Her face is the spitting image of Lady Elaine Fairchilde from Mr. Rogers Neighborhood . And that is pretty much it .	-1
Bravo really needs to do better than this . The three duds you brought on to replace Jill and Alex are just not working . Please bring back Jill and Alex . I never thought I would say this , but I am liking Ramona more and more and actually find her to be more trustworthy than anyone else on the show . I do like LuAnn , but she is becoming too competitive , and I wish she would stop . I find her , however , to be much more likable than the princess you brought on the show . I think that Carole Radziwill is an accomplished person , but on this kind of program , she just does not work out well . She is kind of boring . I wo n't be watching next season , and I just got into the Real Housewives of New York , and found it interesting until this year . Some of the Real Housewives shows are getting old , and this is one of them .	-1
Aviva Drescher 's father George Teichner is a truly disgusting creature . A perfect example of his race . Any decent producer would have neglected to subject us to the filth of George Teichner but in this case , the producers are of his same people , and so do n't have such decency .	-1
Missed the Grade and slid off the road . The writers must have been snowed in because is no longer worth watching .	-1
This episode is too depressing . 1 officer being assualted , ok possible . 2 officers goes directly to depressing . Sorry , un-beliveable and it takes drama and turns it into just a depressing episode . They should have written this better . This ruins drama by being too un-realistic .	-1
I was determined to make it to the end but I should not have been wanting the film to just be done . The writer seems to have forgotten where the plot was supposed to go . Scenes and actions and the choices that the characters make should be derived from the story 's thesis -- -what was the writer 's argument about life ? The writer knew the answers at the beginning and then forgot.I was bored throughout . I got tired of staring at the main character 's depressed and confused facial expressions.The main character had no direction in her life but plenty of commitment to self-centeredness . Worst of all , I did not respect her . Life just came along and pushed her into choices instead of her being a deliberate actor on her own behalf . Who was she ? Where was her determination and sense of purpose ? And , finally , as far as the plot conclusion goes , where were the inevitable consequences for her lack of self-determination and purpose ?	-1
Margot ( Michelle Williams ) meets Daniel ( Luke Kirby ) and the two feel an intense and immediate attraction . But Margot is married to Lou ( Seth Rogen ) , a cookbook writer and tries halfheartedly to resist . Margot seems bored by her domestic happiness with Lou . She craves excitement . As luck would have it , Daniel and Margot live across the street from one another . After over an hour of teasing , including a blow by blow verbal account of what Daniel would like to do to Margot , they succumb . Margot moves in with Daniel and they have hot and heavy sex including threesomes of various kind . But by the end of the movie , Margot is just as bored with Daniel as she had been with Lou.It sounds like the makings of a pretty good movie but this is so exploitative and unpleasant that watching it just becomes a tiresome chore . One scene in which we see a bunch of naked women in a swimming pool shower had me particularly puzzled . As well as the lovely bodies of Michelle Williams and Sarah Silverman , we see a bunch of older bodies , sagging breasts , pendulous breasts , flabby tummies , wrinkled backsides . What is this for ? Is it to remind us that youth is fleeting and age will catch up with us all ? Do we need reminding ? It seemed just gratuitous and almost cruel to me.The fleeting glimpses of Margot and Daniel in three-way sex were also like peepshow parades . Who does that kind of stuff ? These seemed like two nice normal people . The filmmakers had a message and by golly they were going to get it through.For the first hour of this movie , there was a kind of slow-burn eroticism . By the end , just a nasty taste in the mouth .	-1
Enter Margot ( Michelle Williams ) ; saying Margot has a lot of quirks is an understatement . Margot is downright flawed . She 's very peculiar with not only the things she likes , but in everything she does . She 's afraid of the thought of being afraid ; those in-between moments in life . The events that kick off those moments and their conclusions do n't phase her one way or the other , but what bridges together those moments is the most terrifying thing in the world to Margot . While traveling , Margot meets Daniel ( Luke Kirby ) ; a private painter who makes his living pulling a rickshaw around town . There 's chemistry between Margot and Daniel right from the start , but Margot is married to a chef named Lou ( Seth Rogen ) so things are obviously a little complicated . There 's this simultaneous unstoppable chain of events that transpires as Margot gets closer and closer to Daniel , but she feels her marriage to Lou crumbling in the process . It 's an in-between moment that Margot has lost all control over.This is the most frustrating movie of the year ; hands down . It 's nearly two hours of characters being pulled in directions they do n't want to go and playing tug of war with their emotions when things could easily be resolved with a few simple actions . For a movie whose screenplay was included in The Black List a few years ago , the final result is a huge letdown . The dialogue is downright atrocious at times . Margot 's little `` gaylord '' speech to Daniel being the prime example , but their exchange on the airplane leaves you with a furrow in your brow . Margot says something along the lines of , `` I 'm afraid of being afraid , '' after confessing her fears to Daniel to which Daniel replies , `` That sounds like the most dangerous thing in the world . '' Really ? Because like seven hundred other things come to mind that are way more dangerous.The three main characters leave you with the urge to lobotomize yourself . Margot ca n't make a decision to save her life and when she finally does she regrets not staying on the path she was already on . Lou is seriously a contender of the most childish excuse of an adult to grace the silver screen . The immature jokes between him and Margot make you want to projectile vomit on newborn puppies and the two of them have the worst pillow talk you could possibly imagine . Daniel is the most interesting of the three , but only because he acts so cryptic and tries so hard to be this enigma . You remember that scene in `` Family Guy '' where Stewie mocks people who think they 're photography majors because they took a black and white picture of a lawn chair ? That 's kind of the way Daniel is with painting.The entire movie can be summed up in four actions ; cooking , sleeping , being immature , and cheating on your husband . The end . Cue `` Video Killed the Radio Star . '' Thirty minutes in and you 're ready for every character to s**t or get off the pot . `` Take This Waltz '' also includes a shower scene with about a dozen women you wish you never saw naked . After seeing it , you 'll be convinced that the only reason Sarah Silverman joined the cast was to get naked on screen and brag about how hot she looks . `` Take This Waltz '' tries to take advantage of this preconceived notion that you already love this movie even though you have n't seen it yet . It tries so hard to be cute and cuddly and emotional and it winds up being massively annoying in the process . `` Here 's some actors you may have enjoyed in other things along with some humor you wo n't find funny and a horrid screenplay that we insist on cramming down your throat . Oh and people cry a lot , so you better do that too . `` It will be a damn miracle if you can finish `` Take This Waltz , '' but if you do you 'll have to fight every urge to run off into the night , scream at the top of your lungs , and tell every couple within a six block radius to just end it now and screw the first person they come into contact with because that 'll be quicker and easier than pretending to love each other and wasting everyone 's time for an undetermined amount of years . Just save yourself the trouble and punch a brick wall ; it 'll have a better outcome .	-1
that marriage should be abandoned the second it feels `` incomplete '' for new lovers ( who will surely feel `` incomplete '' . ) Maybe this writer director was raped during childhood , slept with lots of losers , then everyone who could possibly advance her career , and is now a man hating lesbian with fantasies of retribution . It 's the most cynical movie I have ever seen bar none .	-1
From pretty much the start of this movie I wanted to turn it off . Not long after my husband said this is really lame . The dialogue was so completely unrealistic and forced and the main character was annoying . The interactions between both the husband and wife and the wife and the new guy were so unnatural and not what would really happen . The public pool shower scene put the nail in the coffin for us and we shut it off there . You are just watching and bam you are blasted with a bunch of full frontal beaver shots and not just for a second , but extended . It has no place at all in a movie like this and it pretty much represents the poor , juvenile quality of the rest of the movie .	-1
Really boring film with empty relationships and a very few interesting though strange moments . I think there might have been about 15 minutes total of mildly interesting content . Otherwise this film was a waste of time .	-1
This film lost me in the first 5 minutes , but I gave it a chance because I loved Michelle Williams in Dawson 's Creek . This movie does nothing to showcase her amazing talent . And her chemistry with Seth Rogen was non-existent . Totally insipid movie .	-1
It had a few jumpy moments but we never figured what the pact was and who made it . It just was n't that good . The acting was sub par especially for who the actors were .	-1
This show is starting to loose its apeal to viewers . I have trouble getting through it , guess its hard to keep this series alive with new material .	-1
This show could have been interesting but the writers and producers ( like most reality shows ) must think that the general viewing public is just plain STUPID to believe the crap they feed us.One example - One of the mountain men broke down in his snowmobile 10 miles from home in the middle of the night . Also it was -30 below zero . He had to hike back to his cabin ( again 10 miles ) and fetch another motor ( 80lbs ) and hike BACK 10 miles and install it . Give me a break ! All the while you could hear wolf howling in the background . Very bad sound effects . And I guess the camera crew hiked back also.Another scene , another & # 34 ; man & # 34 ; and his brother were hunting down a mountain lion that was coming to close to their residence . They wanted to scare it back into the mountains . They rode horseback for a few miles before coming across the lion . And when they did , they yelled & # 34 ; shoo lion , get away from here ... & # 34 ; And the lion ran off never to come back again.Yep ... now I know what I have been doing all wrong when trying to get rid of raccoon 's that have been getting in my trash . I forgot to yell SHOO ! ! !	-1
Staged , hokey and ridiculous . For one thing , they repeat little segments so much each episode could be half the length . The 70 lb snowmobile engine looks to be maybe 20 pounds . Plus the guy seems ill prepared , and ill equipped . Then you have the faux concern over the missing Montana guy . His friend looks for him `` with concern growing with each step '' , but when found the fellow is fine , just rambling around looking for otter sign with his dog . He even asks , `` hey what brings you down here ? '' Indeed , what brings us to find such garbage TV as an episode . Then the guy in NC has his rifle misfire . Well sorry , it did n't misfire , he missed . Supposedly because bad help sighted in his rifle poorly . Well excuse me , if your rifle and your deer are crucial to feeding yourself , sight it in yourself or at least oversee it being done . What crap . Plus , during this one deer hunt he has 3 different long barreled firearms . The shot is taken with a Ruger # 1 , later he is seen with what looks like a shotgun , and in between a bolt action . Truly disgusting crappy staged for TV made up melodrama from nothing .	-1
Come on , I have lived in British Columbia and knew some real mountain men ... these guys are NOT . Real mountain men do not have airplanes , snowmobiles , sawmills , cars or handy neighbors just to name a few things.Then on top of that the show tries to make it seem like these guys are & # 34 ; lost & # 34 ; or in danger when it 's so obvious there is a camera crew with ( for one example ) stage lighting making it much easier to fix the broken snowmobile in what should be darkness . How dumb . Are we not supposed to notice that or are we supposed to think the whole crew was in such peril ? On top of that , it 's almost as if there was n't enough dialogue to fill up the time slot with the same dialogue being repeated over and over ad nauseum.This must be one of the worst put together series I ever saw on TV ( or in my case the Internet ) . I found myself watching more than just a few minutes of the first episode because I could n't believe how poorly done it is.I could make a camping video with more realistic danger than this show .	-1
There is a great moment in this particular episode.There is a scene where one of the faux mountain men is working at his sawmill . They claim the sawmill is water powered . The whole premise of the show being that these `` mountain men '' are living a subsistance life in the hills by the old ways.Not only do they show that the generator is so small that it can not possibly power the sawmill , they actually show the gasoline engine that does power the sawmill in the background . Its right there connected with belts to the sawmill.I know what reality television is . But when they give up the basics of even trying for a suspension of disbelief , its all just kind of sad . Their audience would not have thought any less of a guy running an old gas-powered sawmill and when people finally figure out that they are being treated like fools , they tend to all walk away at once .	-1
I did n't expect Jeremiah Johnson but this series is so staged that , to me , it 's not watchable . Does a mountain man live in a two or three hundred thousand dollar house , travel on paved roads and get regular family visits ? I would n't have thought so . There is only one of these men who resembles in the least how a mountain man would live . The rest are so faked it completely stultified my credulity . I do n't recommend this series at all .	-1
I had not been interested in seeing this movie , but watched it after reading all of the positive reviews . I stayed with it , but basically can not understand why people liked it to the degree that they did . Virginia Madsen and Morgan Freeman are obviously excellent actors but their lines seemed stilted to me and they did not seem to melt into their characters . The three girls who played the daughters did a very good job.It 's a `` cute '' movie that I would not recommend .	-1
I would have rated this higher but there are NO SUBTITLES ! ! ! I should have read previous reviews AND I & # 34 ; should & # 34 ; have noticed that it was DVD-R , printed on & # 34 ; demand & # 34 ; ( and they NEVER have subtitles ) . So what 's up with DVD-R on & # 34 ; demand & # 34 ; ? ! I was just looking forward to getting season 3 - I did n't read the reviews because I had seasons 1 and 2 , and knew the show . One of the first times I 've felt ripped off but I should have been paying more attention - my bad . The show itself is fine , but they talk awfully fast and REALLY could have used subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired !	-1
I liked the first season of this series , it was somewhat original and quirky while being a bit stereo typed , the & # 34 ; bad cop turned good & # 34 ; and the & # 34 ; conflicted girl with a heart of gold and a past & # 34 ; set to a Miami Vice theme , alligators , Armani suits and bikinis . The second season was n't bad , even though there was a strong sense of & # 34 ; I 've seen this before & # 34 ; and the super hot woman police inspector/supervisor did n't work at all . By the third season this series has simply become an excuse to show hot girls in bikinis , there is no pretense of a story or anything resembling a mystery or a thriller . It 's almost as if the writers got bored with it . Nicely produced , well filmed but the story got lost in a hot tub ... ... ...	-1
This is not as good as the original MobWives . The characters are boring . The first or second episode the woman were fighting , cursing , and pulling each others ' hair out . I 'm not watching any more episodes. # notmycupoftea	-1
I found Chef Ramsay 's screaming extremely hard to take . I had not watched this series before , and I would not purchase another year 's version . What I did like about it was that more attention was given to actual cooking than on other similar reality shows . And I liked that when it got down to the final three contestants , Chef Ramsay was very kind to all . But before that , I found him angry and demeaning and I ca n't help but think his approach made it more difficult for everyone involved .	-1
I had read all of the Longmire books before buying this . I did not like the adaptation in the series at all . My neighbor who has only seen the series and not read the books likes it , but I was just very disappointed .	-1
I really did n't enjoy this show much . The scenery is beautiful , but the first episode pretty much scared me off of this show . I would think they had fact-checkers or editors for some of the plot points , but they were missing in action .	-1
We watched the pilot , it was okay ... enough to make us curious about a second episode . So we started the second episode and about 10 minutes in while they are investigating a crime involving a stripper they go into the strip club and then the dealbreaker for us was when the female deputy gets up on stage in full uniform and starts dancing around the stripper pole , undressing and down on her knees to supposedly get information out of the male patrons . It was so lame and once a show has to objectify their female professional lead in such an unrealistic way ... we are out . It means lazy writing and that they are targeting an audience that we do n't belong to .	-1
I was on this edge with this one . Main character mumbles a lot and hard to understand . This particular episode is Hollywood standard `` white man bad - Native American good '' tripe . Tiring . Another episode they let a bear go after it killed a guy . More Hollywood fantasy . A fed bear is dead bear unfortunately , no matter how nice it is . Improbable . I 'm Sorry I paid for it .	-1
just did not hold my interest for very long.it is more of selling stuff than storage issues involved for most part	-1
this show is like watching someone play cards , roll dice , or some other form of gamblingwith the bluffing , and each person hoping to guess , and hit the jackpot when they win thebidding war and see if they get some valuable contents . I certainly think it is over pricedand will wait for the reruns on tv .	-1
Completely unreal . I ca n't see anyone leaving some of the things they come up with . No one leaves rare coins and valuable artwork .	-1
this is all i am going to write so take it or leave it ! lllllllllssssssssaaaaaaaaaaakkkkkkkkjkkkrrrrrrrrrerrnnnnnnnnnnmmmmmmmmnmm nwhat happened to all the wholesome , oldies but goodies showes ?	-1
I only watched two episode of this series . It is n't a story type of show but just a lot of scattered things happening . Someone may enjoy the shows but I would personally not recommend it to anyone .	-1
Finished watching the season and it was good , but it was plagued with fits and stops coupled with error messages . Numerous reboots over the few days I watched only helped somewhat . Shut every other program down except that one window and still had problems . Never experienced problems with amazon streaming before . When it worked , the picture was bright and flawless . Other streaming services worked fine on my computer .	-1
Not really my feeling of entertainment . Too much arguing and bad attitudes plus I do n't like the rude language . Crap	-1
The actor who plays Louis Litt is just awful . He 's a lousy actor , and he 's truly unattractive . No tv show would have a female principal character who is this ugly and one dimensional . Why do viewers have to endure such lousy casting and acting when the character is male ?	-1
Yet another verry stupid & # 34 ; hollywood & # 34 ; idea of how to & # 34 ; fight a war , & # 34 ; any war . I especially liked the part where , while being hunted by an enemy who has absolute control of the air and space , the & # 34 ; resistance & # 34 ; find a hospital with a generator and what do they do ? They fire the generator up , light up the hospital like Times Square , and & # 34 ; rest & # 34 ; there for a couple of weeks . Of course the enemy never notices this brightly lit hospital . That 's ok though , the enemy never notices them driving around , at night , in military tactical vehicles with the HEADLIGHTS ON ! Oh , and we must not forget going out on & # 34 ; patrol & # 34 ; while having extremely LOUD internal & # 34 ; Ihate you , you hate me , we all love one another & # 34 ; fights . During which , while there is much shouting , no one is paying any attention to their surroundings.Any & # 34 ; resistance & # 34 ; unit , in an occupied territory , operating like this , would be wiped out in hours.The only reason to watch this show is , there is nothing else on .	-1
This series started off decently enough , but as it has gone on , it has , in my opinion , become less and less believable . It seems to me that any advanced civilization capable of interstellar travel would n't mess around with bombs and lasers . If they really wanted to exterminate the native species , they most likely would have used some kind of genetically engineered bio-weapon that would have a near 100 % kill rate . Also , some of the episodes have become more and more like a soap with the various on and off again relationships.I have noticed that this series has been renewed for a third season to air in the summer of 2013 . I am not sure that I will waste the time on in next summer .	-1
Slow movie with predictable outcomes . This could have been a winner ! ! ! ? ? ? but I found myself bored at times ... . GOODLUCKDave	-1
This cartoon is loud , obnoxious and lacks any educational value . I make my children turn it off when I 'm around .	-1
Do n't expect any realism when it comes to modern day spy craft . Take this series with several grains of salt . It 's clearly a cheaply done series and it shows . I ca n't even understand how the main character ( Piper ) ever got the part . I do n't even like the look of her and her acting is mediocre at best . Thankfully several other supporting actors in the series hold her up and make the show bearable .	-1
I do subscribe to this show through Amazon so it was not too surprising when a new one showed up off the weekly cycle . It turned out that this episode is a prequel to the series and is only 19 minutes long , even though it still costs $ 1.89 . It tells the story of Augie learning to cope with being a blind agent handler . It takes place in Barcelona and since I have n't been there in 45 years I found the travelogue aspect beautiful . The story is sort of weak , given that we already had one show about Augie getting blinded in Iraq . Annie the usual heroine is not in this at all . It is an OK sort of clip but not worth the price of a full episode .	-1
there is no way a blind person can do what that character does , which makes it fiction and not realistic . she is to much into her self and is really not that bright . too make believe . there are two excellent actors in this series ; however they have minor roles which is too bad .	-1
That is how I watched this series . It is fun to watch if you expect nothing else than just passing some time watching old fashion TV without paying a lot of attention . The main character 's acting is terrible . She is pretty and fit . And there is not scene in which you can believe for a second that she is CIA or scared or being tortured or in love . She looks at every men with exactly the same expression . Which is exactly the same expression that she has when she looks at women . Or walls . Or guns . Or phones . Or whatever . The writing is poor so what she looks at really does not matter . But the series is not bad as in hard to watch . It is quite easy to pass the time with it . It is the old fashion TV formula -- a CIA target is discovered , pursued , and turned or captured in less than a day by an unexperienced , not really compelling pretty girl making cute dog faces without any clever plan . There also some senseless subplots with absurd conspiracies -- most of them focused on Russia because here the Cold War has not ended -- and the CIA here is run by a married couple in which he is the big boss and she is something of a maternal # 2 . They could have made a vintage piece , a la Mad Men , and it would have been charming , but comparing this to Mad Men is like comparing the taste of the best chocolate to an used chewing gum .	-1
They 've tried to add more danger , intrigue and heat ( suspense and romance ) into the show . I had settled into and was enjoying how it WAS and the change is a little off-putting to me . Some people might like it better , actually .	-1
I was on the fence as to whether or not that I should order a season pass . Guess what ! I should not have . Had I known that a 20 minute episode ( Sight Unseen ) was going to be thrown in at a full charge , I would have picked only the full-length episodes to purchase and download . I feel a bit taken since this so-called prequel IS free online , but not here on amazon . I feel a bit taken .	-1
I 'm a spy movie fan and I 'd like to go with the fantasy , but it 's just too contrived . It 's so predictable that it 's not much fun .	-1
This is way to sexually explicit for a young person to act . I guess the world has changed so that this is normal behavior in some homes . To bad .	-1
Well I loved the first three seasons watched them straight through . Its NOT that season four is bad but for me I could n't stomach it.The series is pretty gory with characters lacking in moral compass in many ways but watching atrocities is not my idea of entertainment , far too raw for me.Acting is always wonderful and written well .	-1
I was so dissapointed with this season . I ca n't figure out why they had to sully up the season with so much filth , sex and bad language . I noticed it consistantly has a low rating so I can see that no one else liked it either . All the other seasons were so good and that tells me that people do n't want all that filth . I hope they do better with the 5th season .	-1
The tagline for Magnolia Pictures `` 360 '' is `` Everything comes full circle . '' That 's really about the only thing `` 360 '' has going for it . `` City of God '' director Fernando Meirelles is at the helm with a cast that includes Jude Law , Rachel Weisz , Ben Foster , and Anthony Hopkins . The unfortunate thing is these actors really only feel like they 're filling a void and do n't really make themselves totally useful . `` 360 '' jumps all over the world ; Vienna , Bratislava , Paris , London , Colorado , and finally Phoenix . Seeing how all of the characters connect to one another is really the only drawing factor of the film . You 're mostly left feeling like you could 've spent a lot more time with certain characters instead of being introduced to so many . Ben Foster is a great example . His character just begins to get interesting when you only see him briefly in montages for the rest of the film . Anthony Hopkins has one really emotional scene during an AA meeting , but mostly feels underused . Jude Law and Rachel Weisz are criminally under-featured . Weisz seems to be rehashing her performance from `` The Deep Blue Sea '' except Rose is a watered down version of Hester Collyer . Meanwhile , Michael Daly ( Law ) mostly just acts suspicious and then kind of just admits to everything in the long run without much effort . It all just feels so fruitless.How these characters are connected are n't really all that interesting the majority of the time . More often than not , somebody is cheating on somebody else . Aside from Tyler ( Foster ) and the Older Man ( Hopkins ) , being unfaithful or using sex to make a living is an underlying theme for everyone else . It 's just really disappointing . `` 360 '' initially has this `` 21 Grams '' meets `` Closer '' kind of potential and yet is n't nearly as good as either of those films.The drama is edited in a really unique way though . Its execution is a little odd , but is also really intriguing . At certain points in the film , the camera will show several characters on screen at once despite being in different areas of the world . So the screen will be divided into four vertical strips that are devoted to one specific character . Later on , during a phone call , the screen is divided into two horizontal strips featuring both individuals on the phone ; one in each strip . The most interesting is when Sergei ( Vladimir Vdovichenkov ) is driving through a tunnel . The lights in the tunnel begin swirling around the screen which eventually transitions to the side of a parked car . It 's just a very unusual editing technique . `` 360 '' feels a bit too overzealous for its own good . While connecting so many characters to one another is extremely impressive on one hand , the characters themselves mostly feel very flat and underdeveloped overall . The film makes good on its promise of coming full circle , but there are so many half written stories in between that the experience leaves you feeling like there 's no substance whatsoever . `` 360 '' comes off as introductory without much filling . The intersection is one thing , but what about the road that gets you there ? Should n't you have time to admire the scenery and get to know at least one person at more than face value during the adventure ? `` 360 '' is a carousel that gets caught up in its own whirlwind and does n't utilize or know how to appreciate its talent properly .	-1
Film six unrelated films and film them separately . Then cross-edit them all with zero continuity or interrelation and you have 360 ! The idea is to come full-circle as the title states , but this does not happen here . Most film makers would just say the producers cheated . The films are not related to each other except at the end , where there is some attempt to correlate crossover . So in watching it , the viewer is constantly wondering when the film is going to make any sense ... this never happens , so is disappointing . Filmed in Slovakia , England , France , Vienna and the US we get some international flavor ; but this does n't assist the go-nowhere screenplay or storyline . The weak premise of the film is that opportunities only occur once in a lifetime and so you have to take advantage of them when you can . The screenplay has one basic premise ... everyone is with the wrong partner , who they do not love ... so it 's time to get somebody else ! All in all a weak submission , which is more the fault of a non-workable screenplay and storyline than anything else . Just another example of how one weak element in the hundreds it takes to make a film can totally screw the efforts of everyone involved ! Film making is tough !	-1
This was n't my kind of movie at all . I ended up turning it off before I was one third through .	-1
I imagine this is titled 360 because `` Ring '' and `` It 's a Small World '' were already taken . 360 involves a number of disjointed stories that have a way of intersecting or not . There are many indie films out there that do this , some work better than others . The ones that work have quirky stories that hold our interest . This one does not . The stories consist of an escort , infidelity , a sex offender , a man looking for his missing daughter , and a Russian . There may be a few more.The Denver airport was filmed in Minnesota , apparently they figured no one travels enough to either place to notice . While the acting was n't bad , the stories were presented in a mundane fashion . One of the problems with the film is that you know in advance the story will circle back so you spend your time concentrating on how it is going to do that rather than try to take in what is on the screen.If you like intersecting indie films , try Jason Freeland 's `` Garden Party '' a modest production which I enjoyed more than this film.Parental Guide : F-bomb , sex , and nudity . It had some of each , but really did n't dwell on it .	-1
When a movie has a great cast we have a right to expect a movie to match . This did n't come close . It may seem interesting to create a story showing how lives interconnect etc . But the script in this movie just does n't amount to much . The film aspires to be thought provoking and/or profound but I found it just provoking . Why did I waste the time . A few good scenes - Anthony Hopkins at an AA meeting etc . But overall I found this to be a pretentious flop .	-1
I did not like the film because the negative seemed to overpower everything else . There are digusting , illicit , and unscrupulous things that take place . See more at vyctorynotes dot blogspot dot com .	-1
I wish I had n't wasted my money . I fine this series not funny at all . It 's full of talk of oral sex and stupidity . If I could , I 'd get my money back . Do n't waste your time or money	-1
This was a rather long , boring , dry , chronicle of the Queen of England . Maybe the folks in the UK enjoy it .	-1
Ha ha ha , this show is a filler of major turkey proportions . At least judging by this episode , in which Ozzy Osbourne 's son ( of all people ) is trying to find a Skin-walker ( a shape-shifting demon in Native American mythology ) , while some of his colleagues are on the lookout for the Ozark Howler , apparently a demon feline of some sort.Bad acting , extended scenes in complete darkness or the multi-coloured chaos of a thermal camera , and absolutely no action whatsoever - that seems to be the concept behind `` Haunted highway '' . The investigators come across as super-gullible , at one point confusing the Ozark Howler ( which is supposedly the size of a cougar ) with a racoon or possum ! Sure , it 's an entertainment show , but I admit I was n't . Entertained , that is . Judging by the Youtube comments , the average viewer of `` Haunted highway '' is a 15-year old sexually starved boy with a bad crush on Dana , Ozzy Junior 's female ( feline ? ) assistant . I admit *that* was pretty entertaining . And yes , it *is* somewhat strange that both Dana and Devin can keep their make-up on after two days chasing monsters in the wilderness ... OK , let me guess . This show is ... scripted ? Sorry , this episode only gets one star - and I doubt the search for the El Dorado Hell Hounds or Louisiana Swamp Woman get much better than this . Besides , I doubt the Swamp Woman can beat Dana & Devin 's make up , LOL.This is a real `` ghost turkey '' .	-1
HAUNTED HIGHWAY ( Prod . Jack Osbourne ) is laughable . When they first hyped this show -- when was that , 2011 ? -- I expected an honest-to-goodness travel documentary of investigative journalism . Something which , as we all know , does not exist in paranormal shows or else they 'd cease to be paranormal.Lately this show has been starring only Devin Marble and Jael De Pardo , both notoriously awful B-movie bit-players ( Jack had to go off the show for a while due to an MS diagnosis ) . While Devin is something of a producer as well as an `` actor '' , both of these clods were so much more fun when they were doing FACT OR FAKED . That was a show I liked because they made strenuous efforts to debunk everything.HAUNTED HIGHWAY is the reverse . Osbourne , or whoever conceived of this smelly gym sock , was clearly not serious about anything at all . It always , and I mean ALWAYS , has the air of a cruddy C-list horror flick made in someone 's backyard . In fact it often looks as if they are shooting in a backyard in California . And as I said , since the show has been reduced lately to Devin and Jael , well , the horrifically bad acting and scripted `` investigations '' get funnier and worse with each minute.If I have to see Devin fall on his butt into the water one more time , or hear Jael 's blood-curdling ( totally phony ) screams at every little creak , I 'm going to stop watching this altogether . Come on , people ! There are real intrigues and locations to be checked out , we do n't need these two zombies who think they have creds because they did FACT OR FAKED for a couple of years.However , I would like to take the opportunity to wish Jack Osbourne a good-health future . MS is a nasty bugger , which I know from my own experience . All the more reason for Osbourne to get serious if he wants to produce an outstanding , quality show . HIGHWAY is worse than any other show I can imagine. -- SOAPBOX TIME -- What is occurring with these shows is sad . These shows are being put out there with the claim they are `` reality '' -- in other words , DOCUMENTARIES . If an advertised documentary is not a documentary , then it is a fraud . It is very simple.Jacques Cousteau and Marlin Perkins faked some footage in every show they ever did , but they always admitted it and they were not trying to deceive their audiences . Even then , I recall it caused a national stink in both cases , and both those great men were in a little hot water for a time . Perkins then Cousteau invented and perfected the reality-documentary-show genre . Pity they did not invent the `` ghost-hunter '' genre ; it would have made the standard much higher.The true problem is , we have a law that says there has to be a disclaimer that a show is for entertainment only , which signals that it is a faked show . That law seems to have simply fallen by the wayside -- has everyone forgotten the Miss Cleo debacle ? Or is it that everyone wants to forget ! The disclaimer law I reference was a direct result of Miss Cleo 's exposure.That disclaimer has words to the effect that the shows are `` for entertainment purposes only '' , and as if that were n't weighty enough , there also has to be some disclaimer that the shows are faked , partially faked , or partly reenacted as applicable . To what purpose goes such a law , you ask ? -- to let us know what has been faked and what is real , and NO , you ca n't say fakery is part of reality so it is `` real '' too . That stupid straw man argument has been used for over 20 years and I 'm ashamed of anyone who says such a thing.For an excellent example of the right way to avoid fraud accusations , see the disclaimer on Ernie `` Turtleman '' Brown 's excellent show , Call of the Wildman : Season 1 -- see my reviews . I ca n't recall it verbatim but it states pretty clearly that parts of the show were recreated/reenacted for dramatic purposes.Honestly , why have n't these networks or at least the producers been brought to heel for this major offense ? !	-1
`` Why Stop Now '' is a comedy-drama in which a simple trip to an audition becomes a life-changing adventure . Piano prodigy Eli Bloom ( Jesse Eisenberg ) is on his way to the most important audition of his life , but first he has to drop off his mother , Penny ( Melissa Leo ) , at a drug rehab center.Since Penny is not quite high enough to be admitted , mother and son end up at the door of her dealer , Sprinkles ( Tracy Morgan ) . Since Penny is in debt and Sprinkles is low on product , Eli must play negotiator as the unlikely team hits the streets . A series of comic misadventures ensues , perhaps too many to make the events even passably possible . The cast is in top form , however , though each of the principals has been showcased far better in other projects.Bonus extras on the Blu-ray release include a making-of featurette , interview with Tracy Morgan , and theatrical trailer .	-1
Well , I now know once Woody Allen dies , Julie Delpy can take over . Is that a good thing ? Nothing wrong with Delpy as an actress but , honestly , 40 odd minutes into this one I gave up . Oh , I left it running till the end but I just flat-out did not care about these characters . The cast are quite the cast of characters but I found I was not laughing nor remotely interested in these self-involved idiots . In fact , I could sympathize totally with Chris Rock 's character wanting to go into his home office and check the heck out of this movie.The extras -- sorry , I had no patience to sit through them after wasting time on the actual movie . I 'll let some other fool give them a shot here .	-1
It is n't required viewing to see Julie Delpy 's 2007 film `` 2 Days in Paris '' before diving into 2012 's `` 2 Days in New York '' to fully grasp or understand what occurs in the romantic comedy sequel , but it would more than likely help you appreciate `` 2 Days in New York '' a bit more . However , `` 2 Days in New York '' does n't leave you with this overwhelming sensation to view or revisit its predecessor either . The film leaves you feeling like secluding yourself from your family and any sort of responsibility would be the absolute best thing for you when things get really hectic.This movie makes it seem like living in New York leaves you with no time to do anything ever . Maybe all of this was supposed to be funny ; family members who do n't know English getting away with things no normal person can just because they 're from another country and being too busy to be intimate with the one you love despite talking about it all the time . It just felt sad and kind of pathetic . There 's a huge emphasis on language barriers , ignorant racial jokes that are pretty preposterous , and how a simple thing like buying drugs in front of a child can really impact them . Most of the humor seems like it 's stripped away for a last ditch effort just to stay on top of an already sinking ship . It 's emotionally exhausting more than anything.Chris Rock is surprisingly the best part here . He really breaks away from whatever comedy he has associated himself with in the past and brings logic and reason to an already well developed character . The highlight of the movie is his scenes where he has full-blown conversations with a cardboard cut-out of Barack Obama . The whole brain tumor thing and what it leads to is amusing as well as is when Marion takes Rose to her yoga class . One of Marion 's art pieces is a contract for the selling of her soul , which results in this quest for Marion where she 's just searching to find herself again . It 's very reminiscent of when Bart sells his soul on `` The Simpsons . `` `` 2 Days in New York '' just leaves you feeling drained . Its conclusion feels extremely clich & eacute ; , as well . Not only could the movie have ended nearly 45-minutes beforehand , but it 's something so simple that always seems to happen in movies containing this plot device . It 's like shaking a Magic-8 Ball and getting an `` Ask again later '' type of response . Having too much on your plate and its inevitable consequences outweigh the laughs here . Even though Chris Rock is fairly impressive here , `` 2 Days in New York '' is a frustrating attempt at romance that is n't overly amusing or charming .	-1
I chose to watch this because I typically like Chris Rock and I was hoping for a movie that was light and funny . This movie was more `` artsy '' and that 's not my style so this movie just did n't work for me .	-1
`` 2 Days in New York , '' a nominal sequel to `` 2 Days in Paris , '' stars Julie Delpy ( who also directs and co-writes ) as Marion , an artists and mother of one child now living in a Manhattan apartment with a talk-radio host Mingus ( Chris Rock ) . One day Marion 's family members , her father Jeannot ( Julie Delpy 's real-life father Albert Delpy ) and sister Rose ( Alexia Landeau ) with her sister 's boyfriend Manu ( Alexandre Nahon ) travel from France and stay with them for two-day vacation , disrupting their hitherto happy home.Chris Rock is surprisingly good as a `` comic foil , '' a ( comparatively ) level-headed person providing opportunities for other characters to be funny , but , let 's face it , Delpy as director or actress is not skilled enough to turn the annoying and embarrassing traits of the visitors and the subsequent situations into a comedy.Marion 's father is just annoying . Her sister is embarrassing . Her boyfriend is just silly . Do n't get me wrong . I know characters can be annoying , embarrassing , silly and very funny , like Diane Keaton in `` Manhattan Murder Mystery . '' But Julie Delpy is no Woody Allen , and Diane Keaton is fun to watch because after all she ( and Allen as director ) knows what she is doing.So what does Marion want to do ? Or Mingus for that matter ? With repetitious jokes and so many subplots that go nowhere - with cameos from Dylan Baker , Daniel Br & uuml ; hl and Vincent Gallo - `` 2 Days in New York '' is a sporadically funny romantic comedy that does not have much of a story to tell , with characters that we really do n't care .	-1
Let me say that I live near The Great Lakes , they are pretty great ! But , if you have see any of those Long John Silver fishing shows , it 's the same thing . You may be actually surprised what the Lake Superior North Shore looks like ... seriously ! Plan a trip	-1
It just wants so badly to be deadliest catch ... ... and it is just so not deadliest catch . It does n't take long for you to get REAL SICK AND TIRED of the same darn graphic of a tugboat sinking . *No tugboats or tugboat captains were harmed in the writing of this review .	-1
If I wanted to be lectured about the issues of the day I would turn on a police procedural . Entertain me , you are not social , political , economic masterminds . The crazy person being led around by a level headed and dedicated detective has been done before and that 's okay but this offers nothing new . If you buy this season I 'm sure part of the money will go to the construction of the temple of Obama .	-1
It was silly Not a good story line . I could not get into the story . actors were not real enough to hold my interest .	-1
Seriously if I want politics then I 'll watch the news . This thing has way too much political undertones that are not even subtle to be likable . I 'm used to some politics but this series reminds me of Cars 2 with its ham-fisted approach to political issues .	-1
This season like all the rest is just great . Only problem is that Amazon is late when it comes to making episodes available . This is often true with SyFy shows , that we have to wait two or more days . Fortunately , they can be found elsewhee .	-1
The writers and producers took the series into a direction that is away from the formula which worked well - now it is formulaic and not worth watching .	-1
While the first two seasons were very good , and season three was okay , this season seems to have lost that indefinable something that made the show enjoyable . It is hard to explain , but something in the chemistry of the show was lost in season four . Some of the characters seem to have lost their depth , and the artifacts , which were key parts of stories past , seem to have become mere props . I 'll pass on season 5 . Have lost interest .	-1
It is bad enough that for a Monday night show , you have to wait until Wednesday night to get this , but then only 2 minutes ! Where is the rest ?	-1
What a great show this is . A great cast and a great premiss and it gets ruined because some network JERK doesnt care if he leaves people hanging at the end of a season ... . no resolution in site . It makes watching the show a complete waste of time since it leaves you in limbo with no questions answered , and believe me , there are many , many questions left unanswered ... the entire show becomes an enigma ... this would be a 5 star show if it had anything close to an ending ... Boooooooooo ! ! ! ! Hissssssssssss ! ! ! !	-1
I had high hopes for this but it just seems to average and plain in it delivery and viewing experience to make you care if you come back week after week .	-1
I 've always enjoyed White Collar , as silly as it is , because of its stylish take on NYC . But in the last few episodes , it 's lost some of the features that anchor at least my interest . If anyone 's paying attention , then:1 . We do n't need a psychobabble back story for Mozzie2 . What happened to the women ? Elizabeth is sorely underused ; Diana is barely present ; Sara is nowhere to be seen . These roles are all played by fine actresses who bring humor , class , and pizzazz to what is otherwise a Hardy Boys story . Bring 'em back ! In fact , a few episodes where the boys are locked up somewhere and it 's up to the girls to rescue them would help a lot.3 . Is there a writers ' strike on ? The actors look embarrassed delivering some of that dialogue .	-1
I wanted this to download into the Kindles memory so my kid could play this show in the car while on long drives . Unfortunately it wo n't play unless you 're connected to the net . Neither can I get a refund . I 'm not very happy .	-1
There is nothing in this even remotely appealing to kids under 5 . I have a 4 year old nephew and a 5 month old son , and neither looked at the show after the 2nd minute .	-1
Note : I only saw the first 20-30 minutes with XFinity On Demand.This show , advertised as a `` Limited Series , '' whatever that means , has a great cast ( Sigourney Weaver , Ciaran Hinds , Carla Gugino and Academy Award winner Ellen Burstyn ) and a premise that slowly unfolds . What could be the problem ? Within the first two minutes , there 's a slew of profanity that heretofore you 'd think could only be aired on a cable network like Showtime , HBO , Encore , MAX or Starz . That , coupled with the very frank dialogue , was okay with me . I 'm merely making a note of this , as the series is TV-PG and the language sounded like it belongs on television series ' like Shameless , The Sopranos , etc . PG means that the language , if there 's any , is MILD ( hell and damn ) and infrequent ( ie . occurring not more than twice ) .What really did NOT sit well with me was that there 's a sex scene between Bud and Eva . Do they need to show that on television ? The show is rated TV-PG . However , the language and sex scene really amped it up to a TV-MA . Then around 15 minutes later , there 's a nasty scene between two males . Disgusting . Does every television show these days feel the sick need to throw in one of those people into a show ? And even worse , depict them copulating like the male inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah ? I turned it off just as the two males were ... e [ ... ] Disgusting . Nasty . Anti-biblical . Immoral . Filthy.I DO NOT recommend this series .	-1
Interesting idea , not the first time that it 's been tried before . I liked `` Commander in Chief , '' the short-lived series about a woman president , better , because it did n't try so hard to play off real people . Sorry to be the lone dissenter , it seems , and this will undoubtedly sound trivial and sexist ( and probably is ) , but : I was offended by the absurdly high and ugly waistbands they dressed Sigourney Weaver in to hide her thick middle-aged waist . They did n't do that to the men with their middle-aged paunches.It amazes me that whoever cast this thought anyone would think that Ciar & aacute ; n Hinds is sexy enough to appeal to so many women ( he 's very unattractive , to me , and what 's with that mouth downturned mouth that 's apparently an affectation ? ) or that someone as attractive as Susan Berg , who played the reporter , would find whoever it was who played the editor she worked for attractive in the least ( definitely not ) . And surely they could have found a lot of men to portray the character based on Bill Clinton better and something more substantive for the character to be than such a pathetic sex and power monger.Most of the plots were just silly , not developed , way too contrived.Sigourney Weaver was fine in the part and in her acting as Secretary of State and would-be President . And I liked Ellen Burnstyn and her portrayal of the sniper-witted , functional alcoholic mother of the Secretary of State ( do you see a problem there ? ) . But I found some of actors , much of the acting , and most of the dialog ( writing ) insulting to anyone with average intelligence . An embarrassment , basically .	-1
So disappointing ... .I assume A LOT OF Talented people were involved in creating this show.You are stuck ... .walk into a door ... .run until you drop ... .but , do n't continue until youshow us more then 'bonking ' and loose zippers . What happen to the original idea ? You havelost the mojo . Hopefully you can pull it together .	-1
This is one of the most disappointing pilots for a TV show that I have ever seen . I could n't even get past the first 8 minutes . Who is that horrible man playing Sigourney Weaver 's husband ? He 's terrible ! She was awful in the role . If that was supposed to be Hillary Clinton ... ... ... what a joke . Not even close and not even remotely similar to Bill Clinton.Terrible , terrible show ! I am requesting a refund ( $ 1.99 ) .	-1
I have been a big fan of this show and could n't wait for the final season to come out on DVD . I wonder if they had different writers for the final season , because most of the episodes seemed to be a typical formula show like most show on TV these days . I especially hated the way the series ended and I am glad that it ended when it did , because I think a sixth season would have been a disaster !	-1
This Australian film was written and directed by Jonathan Teplitzky and starring Matthew Goode.The film begins with a shot of Goode 's agonizing face trying to get an erection while a topless woman looked on.The next scene shows Goode working in a restaurant kitchen barking orders.That scene jumps to Goode driving reckless in traffic and got hit by another car in slow motion and lost a lot of blood.Then the scene jumps back to the restaurant while Goode did all kinds of unthinkable things to a cooked duck just becausea customer wanted it more well-done.Afterwards we were introduced to Goode ' ex ( ? ) -wife and child then Goode destroyed a picnic just because a rugby player bumpedinto him . Then someone was in the hospital ( dying ? ) and tears were shed.I must admit that there were so many jump cuts from the 1st 30 mins that I could have missed mentioning some scenes and notremembered them in correct orders.What bothered me was not watching a man with all sorts of offensive behavior . There were a lot in the movies.It was the annoying non-linear filming style of Jonathan Teplitzy that offended me.My question for Mr. Teplitzy is why ca n't he tell his story in straightforward format or not so recklessly non-linear ? Filmmakers must understand that they are making films for the people who watch their films.Films are unlike novels which the creator can take some liberty in the narrative.Using non-linear filming style must have its justifications.The manner and style that Mr. Teplitzy used for this film are pretentious and maddening to say the least , and with that annoying piano soundtrack added to the fury.I could only endure 30 mins of this film and watched another DVD instead.I do not set high standards for watching movies and seldom do not watch them till the end .	-1
The behavior is irrational and unpleasant to watch . Too deep for my taste . I like to be entertained rather than trying to figure out the plot or trying to explain to myself the rational for the behavior of the characters .	-1
kin of a run of the mill plot	-1
There really does n't seem to be enough `` meat '' on this movie to generate much viewer excitement . To the contrary , it is by-and-large a humdrum production , and its main claim to fame may be that the plot is morbidly depressing . Difficult to say why the `` Doctor '' in the story was give such a bad haircut -- which was truly distracting . All-in-all , this film would have done better as an okay `` made for TV '' film .	-1
I guess movie writers and studio exec 's think the public are niave or stupid . Half way through the movie you knew what was coming , very , very predictable . The only saving grace of this movie was the ending ; but then again we as vieweres have seen so many & # 34 ; dream sequences & # 34 ; in both movie and tv , that ending was n't a surprise either . Solid acting but here in lies another problem , the characters were not well rounded so you felt no connection to them . Are we left to pity this Doctor or empathize with him ? ? ? Is it business as usual ? I 'm sorry , I like Orlando Bloom but this movie is flat from start to finish./	-1
Orlando Bloom stars as Dr. Martin Blake , a first year resident under the supervision of Chief Resident Waylans ( Rob Morrow ) . Blake is loner who has a hard time mixing with the staffers . He has no friends and lives in a stark but kind-of-cool apartment . An 18 year old girl comes under his care with a treatable urinary infection . Diane ( Riley Keough ) has a boyfriend but when they appear to be breaking up , confides in Dr. Blake . He is smitten with young Diane.When she is released , her family invites Blake over for dinner . Their motives appear to be one of thanks but to also prompt a romance between Blake and Diane 's older sister who is on the make . Certainly a doctor will do just fine . Blake has other ideas . He 's only interested in Diane . Upon a return visit to pick up a gift basket they had prepared ( way too many coincidences in this film ) he excuses himself to the bathroom where he alters Diane 's medication which lands her back in the hospital.Through a series of inexplicably easy access to medication and IV bags , Blake manages to keep Diane hospitalized , to what end I do n't know . I guess the guy is just crazy . Playing against type , Bloom gives a creepy good performance . His character has obvious moral conflicts . What he 's doing seems acceptable to him but the filmmakers never explain why . At the same time , he 's outraged when one of the orderlies makes crude sexual advances toward the staff and patients . The orderly ( Michael Pena ) is also a pretty obvious drug user.I do n't know where this hospital is but I sure never want to go there . Evidently they have no security , no cameras and lax supervision . The film also stars award winning actors Taraji P. Henson as the head nurse and J. K. Simmons as a police detective . Unfortunately neither is given much to do . Certainly the film had an opportunity to be something more , but when it ends I do n't know what it was all supposed to mean . Fortunately it 's only 90 minutes long .	-1
I 've said it before , and , if RITES OF SPRINGS teaches me anything , it 's that it often bears repeating : almost anyone with an idea can write and shoot a slasher/horror picture these days , AND almost any studio will distribute it . The upside ? The market continues to be flooded with good and ... erm ... let 's say `` less than good '' product , and that keeps the consumers coming back to the trough for yet another scare . The downside ? Well , because the dynamics of producing even a modestly-thought-out idea , video store shelves are stacked with one forgettable piece of garbage after another.Do n't say I did n't warn you.After killing a local businessman 's wife , a group of entry-level kidnappers nab his tween daughter to hold for $ 1 million ransom . Hiding out in an abandoned school , the team of criminals is surprised when a blood-stained young woman stumbles into their hidey-hole ... with a maniacal axe-wielding killer in pursuit ! Forced to team up for safety , the criminals and the young woman realize they 're in the wrong place at the wrong time , and , unless they can cooperate , they 're bound to become the lunatic 's dinner ... or something.This is Dumb . Yes , dumb . With a capital ` D. ' ( NOTE : unfortunately , there 's no way to review RITES without some spoilers , folks . So if you want to know my final rating , then jump down to the last two paragraphs . However , if you 're up for some laughs , then read on ! ) Writer/director Padraig Reynolds bears the distinction of shooting the most ill-prepared slasher script I 've watched in decades . To his credit , there 's some mythology here - apparently , the ` barn creature ' feasts only on the heads of five female victims once every first day of Spring , hence the title - though it makes absolutely no sense . See , he has a keeper who - for reasons never made clear - catches the women for him . The ` barn creature ' ca n't do it himself ( or herself ? ) because he 's kept locked in the cellar of a barn ( ? ! ? ! ) for the rest of the year.Not only that , but also the monster apparently has a fetish for munching only the heads of beauty pageant queens or other reasonably hot-looking women , though ( again ) we 're given no logical explanation for that , either . Instead , each woman is hotter looking than the one before , and , no doubt , we can figure out the subsequent lookers ' fates once we 've seen ` em.Not only that , but also this ritual - Reynolds calls them `` rites '' for a reason , kiddies - has been going on for 25 years ... and yet no one has ever come up with the idea to simply close shop , take your good-looking women and children , and leave town every March 21st in order to escape the ensuing annual bloodshed and mayhem . Instead , the townies go about their business like nothing 's ever happened , and you can what happens from there.Not only that , but these characters are n't fleshed out enough to be anything other than stock fodder for the maniac 's blade of choice in a script desperately in need of going under the knife . There 's the bad criminal . Then , there 's the criminal with a heart of gold who only has to take the law into his own hands because he 's $ 300,000 in debt . There 's that guy 's good-looking girlfriend ( can you guess her fate ? ) . Then there that guy 's mistake-prone brother ( can you guess his fate ? ) .Not only that , but , technically , the film stinks of amateurism . Here 's a tip : when making a film with a handicam or steadycam or hand-held camera of any sort , it might actually serve the process to stand still every now and then . I have nothing against the herky-jerky documentary look of filmmaking , but , when you do it in a slasher film , you 're constantly giving the audience the impression that you 're seeing things from the perspective of the killer . When that ai n't the case , you 're confusing the story ! And to complicate matters further , the story goes from daylight to nighttime in the flick of a switch . Literally ! Guy goes into the abandoned school , and it 's bright daylight ; guy runs from abandoned school only moments later , and it 's the dark of night . Really ? Plus , as long as I 'm piling it on , do you know any abandoned and clearly condemned schoolhouses fully equipped with mood lighting only ? I mean , maybe that 's the reason that the schoolhouse was condemned , after all . The school district should be ashamed of itself.To the film 's credit , it ends . However , the way it ends , makes absolutely no sense , and I ( seriously ) laughed for about five minutes . I guess when Padraig Reynolds says cut , his crew took him seriously . Stay tuned after the credits , though , because there are a few seconds more that try to ratchet up a few more scares ... or was that a few more laughs ? RITES OF SPRING is produced by IFC Midnight , Red Planet Entertainment and White Rock Lake Productions in association with Vigilante Entertainment . DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group . The disc looks and sounds about as well as any scream flick probably can and should - not a bad thing , just nothing all that special . A few sequences were poorly miked , but , when you 're making schlock-horror on a budget , you take what you get . The disc comes with a commentary track and some pleasant enough behind-the-scenes materials , if you 're inclined to check ` em out . Again , nothing special , but it 's nice to see that the cast & crew put some thought into some aspects of their tale ; it 's just too bad it was n't in the script.NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED unless you 're a glutton for punishment or in the mood for a cheap laugh . It is n't that RITES OF SPRING is poorly made . To the contrary , the cast and crew do they best they can to muster a few scares along the way . It 's just that so little of the script makes any coherent sense . It 's as if writer/director Reynolds had an idea - one based on a regular diet of slash and gore - and then he ran with it . And why not ? Horror pics of this nature nearly always turn a profit , if not a few stomachs.In the interests of fairness , the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of RITES OF SPRING for the expressed purpose of completing this review .	-1
I 'm a bit torn in my evaluation of the new thriller `` Rites of Spring . '' As a low budget shocker , it leaves a lot to be desired with a clunky screenplay that raises more questions than it answers . But I also appreciated that the film attempted to meld two different film genres into one story . If not always successful , it was something that I 'd never really seen before . So I 'll give writer/director Padraig Reynolds points for originality . `` Rites of Spring '' is really two different films . One is a standard heist picture and one is a horror story . Neither is particularly well developed or spectacular on their own , but it 's the mash-up that keeps things interesting . My head is telling me that the movie should only rate about two stars . My heart , however , is pushing me toward three stars just because the idea behind the film is rather bonkers . And I like that ! I did n't love `` Rites of Spring '' and probably would n't view it a second time , but I enjoyed seeing the two stories collide ! The first plot thread revolves around the unexplained disappearances of young women that have plagued a small community . Two girls out for a night are abducted and soon find themselves in a treacherous situation . The creepy fellow that grabbed them seems to be preparing them for a ritual sacrifice . But for what ? And is there any chance of escape ? The other story revolves around a gang of losers that decide to kidnap a wealthy man 's daughter to extract a fortune in ransom . Of course , not all goes as planned . There are some major trust issues and personal agendas within the group . Before the evening is through , they 'll have to determine just who is playing whom . But would n't you know it ? The abducted girls are on a property adjacent to the where the kidnappers are holed up . So a night of crime will soon collide with a night of horror . As the body count escalates , it becomes a battle for survival . Will anyone endure until dawn ? My biggest complaint about `` Rites of Spring '' has to do with a lack of genuine plot development . Nothing really makes much sense in the telling . Neither story , as written and presented , would be satisfying on its own and that 's a near fatal misstep . The kidnapping scheme is rather ridiculous and we never know how these guys got together to do something so extreme . Meanwhile , the horror story gets the vaguest ( and most over-used ) of explanations . Reynolds sets up these two separate scenarios , but each one feels a bit lazy ( especially if taken alone ) . Trust me , aside from the mash-up angle , you 've seen it all before and you 've seen it better . At a brief 81 minutes , however , it is just nutty enough to hold your attention . About 2 1/2 stars . As I said , I 'd have been happy enough watching this for free , but it 's not something that I 'd recommend as a blind purchase . KGHarris , 11/12 .	-1
There is way too much of an emphasis on Juliette 's woes this season . If she were at least a mimimally competent actress it might work , but she 's limited to one -- count 'em , one -- facial expression , and that 's it . Furthermore , her face screams COSMETIC SURGERY and she looks fake . Her nose is too pinched , her lips are over-botoxed , her hairline is receding , she has an overbite for Christ 's sake , and her arms are fat and doughy . It 's impossible to take her seriously or care what happens to her . Nick and the rest of the crew make the show worthwhile . They ought to get rid of Juliette .	-1
have not reviewed season 2 am only in season 1 3rd episode and am enjoying it very much at this time .	-1
On the front of the box it shows the main character `` Nick '' swinging an axe but it never happens in the show . There is no axe . It 's just a cheap marketing ploy.I wanted this show to be good but it is not . I saw season one and was bored and hoped it would get better but it never did . Being a `` Grimm '' means you are related to the faerie tale author from long ago . The only thing that separates a `` Grimm '' from a normal dude in the show is that they can see a wolf/ox/fly/lamb person and that 's it . Strangely this seems to terrify creatures that can shape shift , heal , jump ten feet in the air and have claws and teeth . It makes no sense . It 's stupid.It makes no sense that the Grimms have not been all killed off by now . They have a power that is problematic for beast people but not dangerous . If you just look at the world like it is Grimms are no big deal but everyone seems to think they are because of the writing that has no basis on logic at all . ( spoilers ) OK well the whole Juliet amnesia thing gets dragged out more which is really really really boring . Nick continues to act really wooden , The partner who is a better actor does not get less air time than last season . The Asian dude is still the plucky comic relief comic relief which is racist . All the monsters are white people which is racist and their is a Mexican Banshee which is odd.The monsters are not all were farm animals this season which is better but actually less tied to actual Grimm faerie tales or legends of any kind . I have no idea why the show is called Grimm . I imagine there is a copy of Grimm 's Faerie Tales in the studio but I 'll bet it is dusty.There was a Minotaur ( Greek ) that turns into an Efreeti ( Indian ) but is played by an American white dude like 99 % of every monster on the show , I mentioned the Mexican ( Mexican/Spanish ) Banshee ( Irish ) , Naga ( South Asian ) biker dudes played by more American white dudes . Actually all the monsters are basically played by white people from America or Canada which makes no sense what so ever.None of the plot arks ever unfold into anything interesting . This show is so boring and not connected to Grimm 's Faerie tales at all . It should be called `` Were Farm Animals and Cops that Deal With Them ''	-1
Did they just stop updating this series ? there are way more episodes to this season than are available here on Amazon .	-1
A kung fu kicking , chainsaw wielding , blood splattered bride screaming `` it 's my day '' is my kind of bloody good fun . So , then why is it that the new entry in Spanish director Paco Plaza 's soon to be never ending franchise fails to move me . I suppose to be honest and up front I never did really think all that much of his previous ( REC ) movies , nor the dull nearly shot for shot Quarantine American versions . The films have all been too deadly serious and derived of the kind of fun that makes a good scary movie . And yet , the lighter , sillier , and even reasonably more engaging ( REC ) 3 : Genesis still did n't move me.Starting off as a found footage document of the wedding of Koldo ( Diego Martin ) and Clara ( Letica Dolero ) , for the first fifteen minutes we attend the various wedding day gatherings , toasts , drunk uncles , etc. , until we are ready to check that we are in deed at the correct movie and not some projectionist 's lame practical joke . Finally , the drunk uncle turns out to be a zombie and through the usual bite unleashes a zombie plague . The title card arrives informing us that we are in deed in the correct theater , after all , providing that you are still awake.For the next hour the picture moves at a breakneck pace as Clara and Koldo are forced to dawn chainsaws and medieval knight 's attire , do n't ask , to face down their undead relatives . At a running time of just eighty minutes , once things get rolling they do indeed , thankfully , not let up . ( REC ) 3 : Genesis takes a lighter tone that it 's grim predecessors , it 's full of slapstick humor and strange quirky bits , like the children 's entertainer dressed as a SpongeBob knock off , spongeJohn , of course . Think a wedding and four hundred funerals . The problem is , none of it is really all that funny , the humor draws the viewer out of the narrative , often it is badly forced , occasional just plain bizarre , and very rarely hits the mark.Of late the horror genre , so beloved by me and many others , has become tiresome and stale , it ` s stuck in a rut that is worst than any I have ever seen . The very fact that the ( REC ) movies , and possibly even the Quarantine films , are seen at the forefront of the current movement illustrates the distressing point.The stars here are appealing , mostly Spanish actors that I am not familiar with , but a good talented lot . Dolero is very good in the lead role , she 's beautiful and forceful , which helps the proceedings move at a more agreeable rapidity . Enhanced by thralling camera work from Pablo Rosso , who helmed the other ( REC ) flicks . The screenplay , credited to Plaza and Luiso Beredjo , from what I hope was meant to be an ironic credit for original idea by Plaza , Beredjo and David Gallart , is just plain awful , derivative of not only their earlier films , but countless others , it is also chocked full of hideously stupid dialogue , then again that could just be in the subtitling . Still , Clara nd Koldo refer to one another by `` my love '' so many times in the movie 's short running time that a drinking game could be suicidal . The show all comes to the same kind of close that we have learned to expect from it 's predecessors . ( REC ) 3 : Genesis unfortunately adds nothing new what so ever to the genre , for sure some are going to draw comparisons with the much better Shaun of the Dead , but I think that the inspiration lies in a slightly more obscure film from the early 1990 's . My feeling is that it desperately wants to be a close cousin to Peter Jackson 's truly magnificent New Zealand zom-com Dead Alive , but Plaza 's movie winds up being merely brain dead.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com	-1
The only good thing about this film is some of the death sequences , but this one is totally different from the previous two REC films . The other two were some of the best foreign films I had seen but this one is too campy and cheesy acting by some of the performers . Skip it and just stick with the first two .	-1
I was in middle school in 1982 , so I 'm kinda surprised I do n't remember this show . Without the rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia , you may find this quite difficult to enjoy . Considering its age ( 30 years ago ! ) I was n't expecting much during a recent viewing , but I was nonetheless mostly disappointed.PROS : Although apparently not a high-budget production , the locations and sets suggest a moderate amount of care and effort , with the unfortunate exception of occasional clips from various video media . Voyagers ! would be a fine show to watch with your ( young ) children if you have any . History as a premise for episodic stories is of course a good idea , and it almost feels wrong to badmouth any show that ends with , `` If you want to learn more about [ historical element from the episode ] , take a voyage down to your public library . It 's all in books ! `` CONS : While the two protagonists were more or less well-cast , their scripts did n't give them much to work with ; the acting is basically dreadful by today 's standards . I was hoping that Voyagers ! would at least make me laugh occasionally : no such luck . When a TV character repeatedly exclaims `` Bat 's breath ! '' you are reminded that you are not watching a drama intended for a mature audience . I 'm not saying that this or any show would be better with vulgar expletives instead , but the phrase `` Bat 's breath ! '' should give you some indication of what you are in for if you choose to watch Voyagers ! I would not pay $ to view this serial . I gave it a shot due to its cost ( free on Amazon Prime ) coupled with my penchant for sci-fi/ fantasy . After 2 episodes I am shelving it on my list of shows to watch if [ by some cruel fate ] I run out of good shows to watch .	-1
Written by people who did not do their history homework and engaged by actors with just a modicum of ability , the show takes us 400 years back in time to another country where everyone speaks English and laundromats are as plentiful as Starbucks .	-1
I really did not like this show at all . I wanted to see what it was about and it really is about nothing . I guess the money helps the family but the show is not interesting at all . Like watching paint dry .	-1
I have to admit , I was curious about this show because I keep hearing so much about it . It did n't seem like something I would like , but my husband and I decided to give it a shot . We watched more than half of the first episode and finally had to turn it off and put ourselves out of our misery . This show really is by , for , and about the lowest common denominator . The producers are exploiting poor ignorant people , who in turn are exploiting their unremarkable and untalented little girl . Do yourself a favor and watch something that makes you feel good about life and humanity . This only made me feel disgusted as it showcases the worst in the human race .	-1
I am sitting here trying to figure out why I watch this ? Oh I remember , I accidently signed up for it with one click . My bad . Live and learn . What a sad life style .	-1
This is a kind of amateurish film , with very poor character development . In fact , we only really get to know the female lead . In contrast , portrayals of the mother , father , boyfriend and sister are empty and shallow . While there is some hint of incestuous abuse early on , this thread is cut off with no follow-up . As for the pornography , it consists primarily of some topless shots and what might be called `` dirty talk . '' A number attractive women are also shown kissing each other . Some males also do the same . The only bright spot in this production is the physical beauty of the female lead . The ending is kind of amorphous and the acting is sometimes hysterical -- as marked by over-the-top emotional outbursts . Watching this film probably wo n't hurt you , but I do n't believe that you 'll get much it of it either . For those viewers that do happen to enjoy it , consideration might be given to the very similar movie , '' Starlet '' .	-1
terrible horrible movie , no fx , no good pic , no good view , nothing , bunch of good actors after get high decide to do a terrible horrible movie ... this is a low cheap budget movie ... stay away..so bad , bad director , bad producer , really this is a vomit of movie..stay away..do not buy , do not rent , do not copy , bad movie	-1
I FELT THE WHOLE MOVIE WAS VERY POORLY WRITTEN AND EXECUTED . IT SEEMED LIKE IT WAS ALL EYE CANDY AND NO SUBSTANCE .	-1
did not enjoy this movie . it was not what i expected it to be . maybe next time i will ask for information about it .	-1
Too bloody , violent and there was nudity and explicit sex scenes in the first five minutes ... ... Not my type of entertainment ... at all . It was not evident that this was in the show by reading the synopsis or I would n't have rented it .	-1
THis was a very hard story to follow . The characters were not distinct or outstanding . They blended together too much . Although the story is set in the olden days of the US , it has foreign directions which becomes obvious as the stories unfold .	-1
The writer 's went over-board justifying the angry black man . The plots were lose and poorly written . The characters were n't believable and I found myself drifting off watching the series to the point I stopped halfway through . Bad In every aspect .	-1
I have not watched TV since 2007 but just buy DVD 's . I liked the fact COPPER was a `` period piece '' but it was n't anything like I expected . I saw it to be VERY violent & very graphic ( I 'm sorry , but I do n't need to see people throwing up , people being shot and chopped up and LOTS of blood , or people having sex ) I was n't crazy about a lot of the subject matter in the episodes either.BBC is a lot more lenient in `` censorship '' so there is also nudity , bad language , and definitely blatant sexual material . ( I would not recommend this for young people . Then again , kids today are so desensitized ... ... ) The show was fairly well done ( but moved a little slow many times ) and I liked that they were doing `` new forensics '' ( for the time ) , but I wo n't be buying season 2 and I will be giving season 1 away to a friend .	-1
Definitely the worst TV show out there . Do n't believe the reviews . I wanted to like this . It seemed like it would be absolutely amazing . I thought this show would be an accurate depiction of police back in the mid-19th century . I could n't believe my eyes when I saw the black medical examiner working like Dexter trying to figure out how the girl died in the first episode . I had remembered what I had read about detective techniques in 1880 's London . They basically did nothing that was shown on the show , and this takes place in the 1860 's . Other things just made me roll my eyes . It reminded me of how lazy Detroit 187 was . They hired Michael Imperioli to play a detective in Detroit and even had him asking his coworkers if they wanted to get a slice . Facepalm ! Seems the show was probably originally set in New Yawk and no one bothered to adjust the dialogue , or even try.Mercifully , I quit this show before they brought up anything about Shake Shack or Iphones . What a load of wasted potential .	-1
We tried watching this show and it did n't pull either of us in at all . About 3/4 of the way through the first episode we agreed that this show was n't something we were going to add to our Amazon Prime watchlist .	-1
We looked forward to this show with great anticipation . After 3 episodes it became repetitive . The show did not seem to get beyond the shock of having a little girl want to be a prostitute . Nothing interesting about showing a little girl in the sex trade . There was not any spark between the characters , nor great acting . We could predict every plot line . We stopped purchasing the episodes .	-1
I did not watch much of this as i felt it was not worth my time . Not a good choice .	-1
I 'm sorry if this is nit-picky , but NO respectable lady would allow herself to be in the same room , let alone the same house , as a prostitute , and no respectable gentleman would allow his wife to stay in that room/house . I do n't care if the owner of the house thought it was okay or not , his guests would have left as soon as the `` ho '' walked in . This was the Victorian period ... ladies did NOT mingle with prostitutes . Do the writers seriously not know this ? ? ? I thought this show was trying to be historically accurate.And the women 's dresses in this episode were atrocious . I noticed how ugly they were in previous episodes , but I was willing to overlook that , until this episode . A very recent widow -- who should still be in mourning , I do n't care who she thinks she is , or how open-minded she is -- would NEVER show herself in public in a WHITE ballgown ! Are you kidding me ? ? ? Who is the costumer on this show ? Not only was it white , but it looked like a wedding gown ... HELLO ! ! Again , who is dressing these people ? ! ! I guess I 'm just used to the higher quality and attention to detail I see on other BBC shows like Downton Abbey , for example . I 've never seen such deplorable costumes on a BBC show in this century ! And do n't try to argue there was a war going on . This was the North , and these people are supposed to be VERY wealthy . They can afford the best silks and satins , etc . So the women should be dressed to fit their station . They do n't seem to have a problem dressing the wh @ res to look like wh @ res ... why ca n't they dress the upper class characters correctly ? I could have overlooked these seemingly minor details except it seems as if great pains have been taken with the rest of the show to make it as accurate as possible , so the whole costume debacle is just sad , bad , and beyond my comprehension.Then there 's the awful acting , that I wo n't even go into.The first several episodes were interesting , but once the bad acting became too much to bear any longer , and the hideous costumes made my eyes bleed with their ugliness , I had to stop watching . If this show gets another season , I hope they get a bigger budget and can afford some better costumes and more talented actors .	-1
Could only watch three episodes . Blatant attempt to manipulate emotions over abused little girls -- then episode ends by using little girl to accomplish what no self-respecting ( and copper is n't ) lawman should do for the sake of justice . Series fits the mold of stories from graphic novels -- to give excuse for over indulgence and short cut the plots	-1
Yet another fantasy produced by Jews ( Sherri Rufh , Sam Berliner , Barry Levinson , et al ) that prominently feature a black expert , in this case , forensics . Since we know that none such existed in the 1800 's , the intentional but subtle brainwashing message here is that there would have been if not for the cruel , ignorant bigoted white society that prevented it , for which we should feel guilty and make atonement . Have you figured that out yet ? And in productions that are present-day , it 's the message that blacks are fit to rule over us and we should submit to them ( when in reality they serve as fronts for Jewish political power ) . But please explain why in real life there are virtually no black physicists , black philosphers , black mathematicians , black brain surgeons , black rocket scientists , black engineers ... heck , there are hardly any black auto mechanics ! Could it have anything to do with the fact that where whites have an average IQ of 100 , for black Africans it 's 70 , and for black americans ( with most of them having some admixture of white ) , its only 85 ? Only in Jewish-produced film and TV are we constantly barraged with this propaganda . Even Barack Obama is only half-black , is of average intelligence ( at best ) , was a failure at Occidental and only got into Columbia because he did so as a foreign exchange student from Malaysia , AND he 's purely a media-creature paid for by Goldman-Sachs ( again , Jewish ) .	-1
How could the BBC and HBO do such a poor job ? The true grit and integrity of performances we 've come to expect from both British television and HBO was utterly lacking . What was Levinson thinking ? We can usually count on him , too .	-1
Very bloody . um . Didnt get too far ... in.. Might not have given it much of a chance I guess on reflection . It just was very .. bloody .	-1
This show seemed interesting at first , but it just became boring after only a few episodes . I think if I still had cable and did n't have to pay per episode , I might watch it when nothing else was on . But at this price , it just is n't worth it to me .	-1
Sorry folks . This may have just been a cultural difference , but ... . This was just boring . Could n't get through it . I like sub titles , this one fell short	-1
This film got rave reviews but do n't believe any of them , it 's just horrendous . You wo n't get past the first 5 minutes .	-1
I have no idea what happened to my life . Time just got sucked out of me and I have no good an happy feeling , or deep and meaningful reflection , out my wasted time . I guess I am just not as deep as the people who attend film festivals ...	-1
It could have been good , but it was too slow and somewhat obvious . I think I could have liked it if I had been in the right mood .	-1
A slow abstract meditation on death that is not at all entertaining . You 're probably not going to actually like this , or glean much from it . Do n't feel guilty . Just because a movie like this is generally unwatchable and quite impenetrable does n't make it high art . I submit that you that this is really just fetishistic weirdness dressed up as sophisticated musing .	-1
I 've always enjoyed her as an actress and was surprised at her rendition of this detective who seems to have replaced Kyra Sedgwick in what seems to be a new rendition of & # 34 ; Closer. & # 34 ; I can not bear to watch her in this so I only watched the first episode .	-1
Do n't know where to begin . Story was loose , characters not believable , relationship to boy hooker domineering , and just ... wish I had n't paid the two bucks to see it .	-1
This spin off from the Closer I had high hopes for but it left me longing for Kyra Sedgwick . No one can replace her in this role . I bought the entire season to try it out and ended up giving up after episode 5 . This series seemed to mostly revolve around Rusty . The chemistry seemed dead and the magic was gone . I wish I could get a refund .	-1
I could only watch two episodes and could n't stomach anymore . Sharon Rader making 'deals ' for murderers ' instead of taking it to the jury , I felt ill . It 's too realistic . The legal system always wants to save a buck and the victim has no say in the matter , I should know as it happened to me . But worse yet is David being replaced by Sykes , the butt kisser . This woman is a nightmare ! Seriously , they added this dumb woman to the 'elite ' squad ? She does n't fit in at all . Just too many changes for the bad rather than the good . I 'll stick to my repeat episodes of The Closer and leave this to everyone else who enjoys sub-par television . What a huge mistake they made in the direction of this show !	-1
The same group without the Closer 'Brenda ' I think lacks big time and falls flat . It 's not nearly as fun or interesting as the Closer was . I really miss having Brenda in the series .	-1
This flick is simply pathetic . It tries to channel the raunch of `` The Hangover '' movies with the female angst of `` Bridesmaids '' and fails at every turn . I have nothing against the girls engaging in the kind of horseplay usually reserved for the boys but here it just comes off as juvenile . It would help if there were some characters you can root for . This flick attains the unthinkable by making Kirsten Dunst unlikable . And her character works with pediatric cancer patients ! The usually reliable Isla Fisher comes off not as a smart person playing a dumb character but just plain stupid . I guess if you were to point to any positives there 's kind of a sweet turn by Rebel Wilson as the pleasantly plump bride-to-be . If you 're looking for a girls night out type flick skip this one entirely . My wife who is less discriminating than me could n't stand `` Bachelorette '' either .	-1
What a mess . First-time feature director and screenwriter Leslye Headland goes for the jugular in this 2012 black comedy which takes the same cues as 2011 's megahitBridesmaidsdoes but frankly does n't take them far enough to be remotely funny . In fact , I laughed only once during the film 's 91-minute running time ( it was the line about Michael Jackson ) . That 's too bad because producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay were able to recruit a first-class cast and then unfortunately lets Headland flounder with a predictably belabored situation , leaden pacing , and gags that are overly deliberate in execution . The threadbare plot focuses on a dysfunctional trio of obnoxious girlfriends who gather together & agrave ; laThe Hangoverfor a hedonistic night of celebration before their friend 's big wedding . The bride-to-be is Becky , a former geek whom the trio viciously called `` Pig Face '' in high school behind her back . Now hitting thirty and finding their lives disappointing to say the least , the girlfriends are horrified to be beaten to the altar by someone they treated as a mascot to make themselves feel better.The alpha leader is Regan , the overachieving maid of honor known appropriately as the Hannibal Lecter of bridesmaids . Although resentful of Becky 's happiness , she is determined to make sure the wedding goes off without a hitch , a challenge given that she inadvertently ripped Becky 's wedding dress during a drunken binge with bubble-headed Katie and perennial party girl Gena . The three women desperately figure out how to fix the dress in the middle of the night as they cavort with the various groomsmen out on their own bachelor party . So many moments ring false including the set-up and the lightning-flash changes in the characters just to service the plot , but at least the cast is game . Fresh from playing the understandably depressed bride inMelancholia , Kirsten Dunst appears to savor her mean-girl turn as Regan with surprising acuity and fearlessness . I give her credit for not being afraid to come across as unlikeable . Playing a more extreme version of the obsessed sister she played inWedding Crashers , Isla Fisher plays Katie with nervy comic abandon and obviously reflects her husband Sacha Baron Cohen 's go-for-broke influence.Starting with a scene on a plane with Horatio Sanz as she graphically describes how she gauges a certain act , Lizzy Caplan gets to play Gena as the tough-talking chick still aching for the boyfriend who abandoned her when she became pregnant . Adam Scott plays the boyfriend in his typically smarmy manner , while James Marsden gets to play his cynical character in the same vein as Regan 's foil . I was surprised to see Andrew Rannells , star of Broadway'sThe Book of Mormon , play Katie 's flamboyant co-worker and the party stripper . Rebel Wilson , who played Kristen Wiig 's brain-dead roommate inBridesmaids , has to play straight woman this time to the nasty trio as poor Becky , though she gets to have a few choice comic moments in the home stretch . Speaking of which , Headland cuts a lot of corners in the third act in a last-ditch effort to deepen the characters . It does n't really work since any goodwill the movie generated had long since evaporated by then . It 's no wonder this movie has shown up on Amazon Instant Video and Video on Demand a month before its theatrical release since word-of-mouth will likely sink the film 's chances at the box office . At least at home , the producers have gullible viewers like me who were willing to give it a try without leaving the couch , a big mistake on my part .	-1
This movie has several quality actresses and a promising premise . The trailer suggested a funny movie similar to Bridesmaids , which I loved , so I was really looking forward to watching this . Unfortunately , the jokes fell flat and the characters were catty and unlikeable . The language was foul , the bridesmaids were awful to the bride , and there was cavalier treatment of near-lethal drug use . I just did n't find it funny . I ca n't recommend this movie at all , but if you are looking for a funny film , I can recommend Bridesmaids .	-1
I do not get the point of this movie . It was not funny or sexy , the soundtrack was ok , but the story-line was depressing . If I had friends like these I would n't invite them over for dinner never mind a wedding .	-1
It was : :sad : : chaotic , stupid without sense , total garbage and waste of time , not funny at all , the beginning started well good but then it turn into garbage	-1
This movie had such great potential . It features a powerhouse cast , including Kirsten Dunst , Rebel Wilson , Isla Fisher , and many other fairly well known actors/comedians . Sadly , the contents of the movie were more dismal than anything.If I had to sum up this movie , I would say it is a combination of the Hangover and American Pie minus the laughs . A pack of girlfriends from high school are reunited when one of them is engaged to be married ( Rebel Wilson ) . Most of the story centers around the hours , and events , leading up to the wedding.The problems I had with this movie are many . First of all , Rebel Wilson , arguably the funniest of the bunch , is absent throughout roughly 90 % of the movie . Maybe they should have had her switch roles with one of the other ladies and improvise a bit . Could have helped things ALOT ! And I noticed they gave Horatio Sans a credit in the movie on the Amazon listing . He was in it for roughly a minute . It was much more a cameo than anything else.They joke around about doing coke . I 'm rarely ever a fan of a movie that shows people using hard drugs , especially when they do not show the repercussions of such actions . This movie pokes fun of it ! Truly poor taste ! The three main characters are extremely flawed and do not learn from their behaviors . One is addicted to coke , one is a hardcore partier , and the third is a jealous type A personality with body issues . Despite all of their bad decisions and the horrible outcomes , at the end of the movie it is n't clear if any of them learned anything . The only one who might have learned something was the coke addict , but even this seemed unclear . To make matters worse , the hardcore partier almost dies from an overdose and they gloss over this fact . Seriously ! ? It seemed like the perfect point for her to turn her life around for the better . This movie missed a golden opportunity.Where does that leave this movie ? Not funny with hardcore drug usage and characters who do not learn anything from their experience . In my opinion , this makes the movie a definite pass . You wo n't be missing anything , trust me !	-1
Being a fan of all these ladies , I was expecting something along the lines of `` Bridesmaids '' with a hint of `` Mean Girls , '' both films I liked . Unfortunately what I got was a mean spirited , unfunny story about 3 unpleasant and unlikeable women , all of whom are too attractive to be in such a state of despair.Regan ( Kirsten Dunst ) is the maid of honor for Becky ( Rebel Wilson ) who no one thought would ever get married . Certainly not before Regan or her other two gal pals , Gena ( Lizzy Caplan ) and Katie ( Isla Fisher ) . The trio has never outgrown their party days from high school . In one scene , Gena gets on a plane stoned and gets into a conversation with a seat mate ( Horatio Sanz credited as `` Barely Attractive '' ) about how she manages to give a man felacio on a scale of 4 to 10 . The film is full of raunchy dialog and the ladies lead the way . This does n't bother me but I checked out when Gena hooks up with a former boyfriend ( Adam Scott ) . After the wedding , Clyde ( Scott ) stands up and rather than toast the new couple , tells everyone how he bedded Gena and went `` in and out , in and out . '' Really ? The middle section of the film is forgettable and hinges on the girls being able to repair the bride 's dress that they tore apart while high on coke . While all this sex talk might make you think , this is going to get better , it does n't . All the characters keep their clothes on . In fact when the boys go out to a strip club the night before the wedding , they do n't seem to be concerned at all that the strippers ... well ... keep their clothes on . Huh ? Yeah , girls giving lap dances in their dresses . Where are these places ? I want to be sure to keep my distance .	-1
Happened upon this on Netflix . Thrilled that I did n't pay money for this - and I ca n't believe there are actually 5 star reviews here . This movie has no point - is not funny , and I ca n't believe I watched it until the end . None of the characters are remotely likeable , and the 'bridesmaids ' ( supposedly friends of the bride ? ) are horrible to her . Do n't waste your time , even if it 's free .	-1
Predictable , terrible plot and I just want to slap all the characters except the lady who plays the bride . I do not recommend it at all and I did n't find it funny .	-1
The story line just does not really work properly . The actors are not doing a bad job , but I spent the entire movie thinking that something was missing to make this work or at least believable . If you have nothing else better to do , I would not call watching this movie a waste of time .	-1
Three former high school friends Regan ( Kirsten Dunst ) , Gena ( Lizzy Caplan ) and Katie ( Isla Fisher ) are shocked when they learn that another high school friend of theirs Becky ( Rebel Wilson ) is getting married . On the day before her wedding , the three girls rip the wedding dress and have to fix it . ( But why do they have to fix it ? If they are really mean and self-centered , as the film shows , why not hide it and pretend they do n't know anything about it ? ) That the main characters of `` Bachelorette '' are all mean-spirited and selfish did n't bother me . I enjoyed watching `` Carnage '' and to a lesser degree `` Young Adult . '' In making comedies and dramas , you do n't have to make your characters sweet or likable as long as they are interesting or funny , and more importantly , believable , to sustain the film 's running time . That does not happen in `` Bachelorette . `` The characters are honest to the point of being totally nasty . That is fine , as being nasty is not mutually exclusive to being funny or even attractive . The problem is the story is not only unconvincing , but is uninteresting . Characters are not fleshed out . Drug/sex-related jokes are clich & eacute ; d. There is some smart dialogue , and the talented cast gives their all , but sometimes it seems writer/director Leslye Headland just does n't know what she wants them to do.While watching the uneven mid-part of the film , I expected these girls to raise much more hell . That did n't happen . Jokes and crude remarks , themselves alarmingly real , may work as a sketch , but a feature movie needs more than that .	-1
First let me preface by saying I 've followed Doctor Who through most of it 's lifetime , never got that excited about it.Then there was the whole Russel Davies resurrection of it and I was hooked . It jumped the shark a lot over the seasons , many omg what were they thinking moments , but if you twisted your `` head '' just right , it was a pretty enjoyable experience and I 've watched seasons 1-6 multiple times and not regretted the price of admittance ( Amazon for a lot of it ) .Season 6 , enjoyed it , though was getting a might tired with the `` and then there was a paradox ... and everyone lived happily ever after '' . Moffat , I 've loved his stuff , Hyde and Sherlock being two series well worth watching . Though admittedly several years later I still puzzle over Hyde.That said ... This season for whatever reason they 're doing `` small stories '' , that winds up being pretty boring and predictable . They 're getting rid of Amy and Rory ( that 's happened in an episode that 's aired already so not viewing that as being a spoiler of any sort ) , and they wind up spending way too long with everyone giving each other long sad looks ... . Boring.In this specific episode , plot was predictable , their work on having the Doctor being at a `` darker '' place since he 's been wandering around without companions a lot does n't work all that well . The cyborg in the episode , well , I think I could come up with something better looking.Alien ship lands in the old west in the USCyborg looking for the doctordoctor and companions show upI 'm being kind by giving it two stars and no have no desire to see the episode again , just not that much fun .	-1
I do n't know why writers have this overwhelming need to bring down every happy couple . Why ca n't some of them remain happy ? However , it turns out the divorce does n't really happen and Rory and Amy love each other as much as they always did . Sorry , spoiler.Lots of color , action , bangs and noises as usual . Not much of a plot . The final couple of twists to the story were interesting , I wo n't add any more spoilers , though.I like Matt Smith as the Doctor . But the Matt Smith stories lack the emotional depth and character interest of the David Tennant stories . That 's not Matt Smith 's fault . It 's the fault of the writers .	-1
SPOILER : Finally the overworked Pond companion is finally written off . Steven Moffit again wrote another bad story , but it does not matter because the most irritating and annoying of companions ever conceived for Doctor Who is gone . He at least was able to do that , but again in a very predictable way . I hope the new British female model they hired as the next companion can actually bring some talent and creative interest to a sadly fading storyline , which gets worse each episode , starting from the beginning of last season.As I stated in my first review of this season , ( just after the first episode ) the Doctor Who saga is in desperate need of an injection of unpredictable story lines and crafty inventiveness , which Doctor Who used to be infamous for . The writer for the past few seasons refuses to bring anything fresh ... this of course means no new creatures , new planets and worlds to a 50 year running saga , which is my favorite SI-FI of all time . I do appreciate that the BBC keeps on releasing older episodes , from last century , back again in DVD and remastered . For those of you who only got into Doctor who since 2005 , you would do well for yourself in investing time into the previous adventures since they truly mirror the genius behind the reason why the legend of the Doctor has lasted so long on television , and not just in England , but everywhere around the world.It is just so disparaging that the worst writer ever of this show , is getting cart blanche in making all of the new episodes ( not fresh , just new ) and dragging the franchise down with his predictable , repetitive and boring style of writing , which disgraces the great name of the series . Instead of another female British model as a companion I really wish they could bring about a real person we all can identify with , like a Donna Noble , who ( in my opinion ) should have been kept on as long as boring Amy Pond did during her OVERLY long run on the show . It would , at the very least , have been more fun and more entertaining , because for one thing , she can believably act.Anyway , cross your fingers and hope with me that the rest of the season and seasons ( hopefully to come ) will improve now that there has been a cast change.Thanks for reading my review .	-1
I am a true Doctor Who fan and a true science fiction fan , so I am used to a lot of fantasy . But there is a point where it is too much . I only watched the first two episodes . I got tired of watching wildly unbelievable events that occur for no apparent reason . I really miss the thoughtful plots of the older Doctor Who 's . Amy Pond is great but she is the only part of Season 7 that I like .	-1
This is an ad for the upcoming season . As an ad it does not really work for me since I see nothing new in the up coming season to make me want to pay for the next few episodes . I like the Dr but I am going to wait 6 months for it to show on Netflix . Also , charging me 99cents for three minutes has made me an angry viewer . Only for the new Canadian Primeval would I pay that ... ... rip off !	-1
The Mindy Project is a `` comedy '' I do n't find it funny when a successful doctor acts like an insecurity teenager . `` Mindy '' may have graduated medical school and practices medicine but is a `` project '' because she is n't in a relationship . This show sends a horrible message to young women .	-1
Mindy is to be commended for having enough sense to finally leave The Office . She should also be among the first against the wall when the artisan revolution rolls around . This show offers nothing new , no unique viewpoints , no relevant voice , and is an overall let down . Quite honestly , we had expected better of her and have been once more taught to expect nothing out of anyone in the business for the money and not for the art . She could have been a truly unique stand out , instead we get a clone of a clone of a clone of ... you get the point . Save the IQ points , watch Victorious or Icarly instead ... at least they are trying .	-1
Despite how many people dislike her , I actually like Mindy Kaling . She has a quirky enough charm to her , where she 's worth watching . And unlike her Office character of Kelly Kapoor , in real life , she 's actually pretty smart , despite her ditzy voice . So , all of her more real life magic and charm was expected for her breakout series , `` The Mindy Project '' ( which came about from `` Untitled Mindy Kaling Project '' , meaning this show really does n't even have a real name , to it ) .And while Mindy 's chick-flick charm , mixed in with small flashes of intelligence or competence does work here , she simply is n't enough to hold an entire show . While her best friend and Office co-star , BJ Novak is also working on this show with her , and she has some backup in the form of NBC buddy cameos , like Seth Meyers and Ed Helms , the fact of the matter is , none of the rest of the show is good : Her believability as a doctor ( unless you were to get racist and assume it 's because she 's Indian ) , her insufferable and BORING supporting cast , and her premise of being an adorkable girl starring in her own self-imposed `` life as a romantic comedy . `` The show is supposed to be a companion show to `` New Girl , '' but at least 'New Girl ' has it 's niche : It 's a girly comedy with enough manpower and masculinity in the form of her support cast roommates that it balances itself out for all audiences between 16 and 30 . However , `` The Mindy Project '' does n't have any of this , and it 's only real audience seems to be girls ditzy enough to be into Kate Hudson movies , like Mindy Kaling/her character , herself . There is no real audience appeal , because not all women in their late 20's/early 30 's are like Mindy , and honestly , there 's no real reason for men to watch , at all . The show is n't funny enough to break any demographic barriers , either . It 's mostly not funny , at all . Add in NO likable or interesting support characters , and a boring career premise with Mindy as a 'stupid , yet smart ' doctor , and it 's just overall lame . Even at it 's BEST , it 's a mediocre comedy.Mindy Kaling herself has the energy , charm , and pep to at least hold the show on her shoulders for maybe a full season , if that long , but none of the other elements of the show are really worth it . To sum it up : The show sucks and Mindy Kaling alone ca n't support it .	-1
if your interested in watching a woman whine like a little kid this might be the show for you . I think my wife likes to watch it just to enjoy someone else go through pain .	-1
It was not what I expected and narration was boring . I could hardly stay connected and was glad when it was over .	-1
( SPOILERS ) documentary discusses Hollywood 's transition from film to digital , i.e. , how hard the movie industry fought digital , how George Lucas ' tenacity helped get it established , and the mixture of emotions ( some wistful ) from filmmakers seeing film move out and digital move in . In some ways , film to digital is an example of a way our species adopts new technology : someone discovers a new tool , or a better way ( in the case of digital , George Lucas and his team ) ; the established guard ( Hollywood ) resists , as they 've invested heavily in the old technology ( in terms of time , learning , and money ) , plus the new technology has some disadvantages ( initially digital not as good visually as it is today ) , and the technicians , and everyone working in film , does n't know how it works , or how to marry it with their current way of working , all of which generates fear/anxiety - so they basically ignore it ; while others ( who have less to lose and most to gain , i.e. , Robert Rodriguez , and other young and/or poor filmmakers ) enthusiastically embrace it , exploiting it 's advantages ( real time viewing of photo capture , cheaper , and after a learning curve , ease of editing , etc . ) , to create their own brand of art , a significant amount of which becomes successful thus getting the attention of Hollywood who seek to emulate their success . So now , by 2013 we see digital adopted into the Hollywood mainstream . I 'm a big fan of Keanu Reeves , which is why I wanted to see the documentary , and I 'm an even bigger fan of George Lucas , who wrote my favorite film , Star Wars , A New Hope , so it was great seeing them , and all the other filmmakers and technicians talk about film . Alot of what the technicians discussed went over my head . The documentary itself was n't told in an especially engaging way , but it was okay . Probably will be of interest to future filmmakers studying film history . For me , an ordinary viewer in the present , two and a half stars .	-1
I 'm usually down for a good film-based documentary , so I decided to give this one a try as it looked like such an interested concept . While it was indeed a very intriguing subject , one has to truly be a hard-core film buff ( the technical stuff ) to really get into it.The topic of `` digital film '' vs `` celluloid film '' truly is a fascinating one and deserves a documentary like this . Whenever a medium change is about to define any industry , it is always a turning point filled with pros and cons that must be discussed in order to obtain some sort of understanding . That concept is the high point of `` Side by Side '' .Sadly , I wish they would have made this doc a bit more `` user-friendly '' to those ( like me ) who wanted to see the comparison `` in action '' . There is far too much `` talking '' and far too little actually comparison of the two film methods . Clearly , this was a doc made for not just film buffs , but more towards camera buffs who really get into the technical stuff.The choice of Keanu Reeves as narrator/host is also a terrible one , as his dry , bland story lends nothing towards the excitement factor.Thus , `` Side by Side '' will be a great little doc for those internally fascinated by film . If you are just a `` movie fan '' , however , you can probably skip it .	-1
Contrived chemistryContained cinematographyConcealed ActingWhere 's the Epic ? A waste of time ... why are there so many versions of this classic - no one gets it right ?	-1
I think the online price for this was high ; however , I am glad I did not pay to see this in a theater . It was plodding and the only value in watching was some of the special effects and costumes . I doubt if this film will be in theaters long .	-1
the plot was ridiculous and the story line was over all very very slow its pace was sleepy and i lost interest after the first 20 minutes the story line is very very predictable girl get kidnapped girl gets rescued bla bla bla dont waste your money	-1
Well , I rented this movie after seeing the behind the scenes for it and it looked good , but the actual watching of the movie was slow , did not show the action that looked so cool during the movie behind the scenes . It was ok but not the best .	-1
Definitely worth watching . A lot of action and 15th century B.S . about God and the Devil . If it were true , they certainly could not be defeated by swords . It 's worth a watch but I would n't set my hair on fire hurrying to get it.Dark and confusing plot . Leaves a lot of holes to the imagination . It is all a strange Devonshire movie with heavy accents and two bit metal and amazingly accurate flintlocks , which had not been invented yet , used to kill.Generally makes no sense , but Good wins over Evil as always . I would wait until it is Prime Free .	-1
But I suppose this is great for tween girls . Or something . I was quite surprised at the general tackiness of the production value , the cheesy opening titles , and the poor quality of the writing .	-1
So I thought that this show would resemble Gilmore Girls since the creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had created that show lasting seven seasons , and that the grandmother form Gilmore Girls is a central character on this show . However , I was proven wrong , this show does n't resemble Gilmore Girls at all , it 's about a Vagas show girl who teaches dance in a small town . Granted I have n't finished the first season , but it was n't that interesting and used plot twists early on like killing off a promising romantic partner for the main character . I guess that the network differences between this show and Gilmore Girls could affect the content , but I would hope not . Anyways as a fan of Amy Sheman-Palladino I am disappointed with this show , however it could also be that I am not interested in ballerina 's too . I think it 's because I am not familiar with the central topic of the show , ballerina dancers . I won ' t be watching this anymore , however , on my favorite show on TV , Parenthood , Gypsy 's character from Gilmore Girls has a sideline character in season four/five .	-1
This is a mediocre and boring show.The characters have no nuance and the actors are not helping.This is a shame . The subject is timely and engaging.I had high hopes for this series but this is no Will and Grace.Alas .	-1
The story is lame , the filming endeavored to make this seem & # 34 ; campy & # 34 ; made me sea sick instead . Come on the movies made using this style understood that at some point the camera has to stop shaking ... . And the story , well honestly ordinary trash .	-1
what is wrong with these people , you can check this movie in Netflix , I do not recommend this movie , terrible and cheap low budget movie	-1
Disclaimer : this review contains the *OPINIONS* of the reviewer.I 'd been hoping for more with this , and I felt like my expectations got shot down.To start off , I 'll say what I did n't like the most about this : the lack of any trace of a comprehensive story . What we have are a bunch of middle-aged guys ( it 's never revealed , but you get the sense they 're anarchists ) who , recorded ( possibly accidentally ) over one 's own personal sex tape , record their own dangerous misdeeds ( including a force flash of a young lady ) . Well , after a brief discussion on how they get money on a porn site for every time they get a flash recorded , one of them tells the group how they can get more money than they could imagine from finding one certain tape . What 's on the tape ? Why 's it worth so much ? Who 's paying for it ? Those and other questions get asked , but no real answers are given.What trace of a storyline there is in the central story , there 's little more than that in each ministory . Honestly , it felt like the dialogue in each story had been crafted by college kids that did n't care about coming up with an intelligent ( let alone intelligible ) storyline , they just wrote what they felt like then added special effects to make it all fit . Not only excessive swearing ( already making it too much like today 's American horror rather than a substantial foreign horror movie ) , but also ( in most cases ) having excessive nudity ( I think they only added horror elements to keep it from being labeled as `` porn '' ) , it already made me anxious to actually want something substantial.Well , I would rate something like this 1/2 a star rather than none at all simply for nostalgia ( they did get V/H/S technicalities and tape quirks right , I 'll give them that ) , but I 'll slightly further than that . Another 1/2 star for one segment that included a decent special effect that did impress me . The forest segment where the killer could n't be clearly seen due to being glitched out ( not only visually , but also the sound was glitched to add to the atmosphere ) . Beyond that , all the other special effects I could n't pretend to have the heart to enjoy.Maybe there 's a chance the sequel , S-V/H/S , will be any better ?	-1
Maybe I was expecting too much from this movie but it was hyped up a lot.I was thinking it was gon na be really scary . I usually like anthology movies but this was just lame.It 's was like watching something like the Blair Witch Projects but as an anthology.This gang of guys who film stupid videos to sell online are hired to steal a VHS tape from a house.One of them ends up watching all these random tapes he finds and each of those shows its own horror story.Most of the stories were kind of lame and reminded at best of some of the crappier episodes of Freddy 's Nightmares , as far as acting and writing went . Just a lot more low budget than that show was obviously.There is one story with a killer in the woods who kind of reminds me of Jason . There are some creepy parts there but overall this movie was just really slow and boring.The framing device , with that gang of guys , was shitty as hell . I hated watching those parts and the actors were annoying .	-1
Possible Spoliers '' V/H/S '' so some filmmakers pull various pranks on people they pass by , like attacking girls and exposing their chests to the camera and well ... . that 's about the extent of their `` talents '' and `` skills . These filmmakers were hired by a guy or girl or could be a crazy koala bear for all I know , to break into an old guys house and find some rare tape , ( at least that 's what 's provided in the description of the film , never made fully clear to the viewer ) . They find said old guy dead and a bunch of tapes , which as they progress become more disturbing . Before and after each segment we see footage of these guys searching for this tape.The first is `` Amateur Night '' where we have 3 guys , 2 girls , bars , later a hotel room and well some bad ends for everyone involved . One of the girls is a quiet , goth like one who keeps saying to one of the guys , `` I like you '' . The moral here , turns out it 's true that you really need to watch out for the quiet ones.The second one is `` Second Honeymoon '' where a young couple is in a hotel room , after a knock on the door the husband says some girl asked them for a ride the next day . Then after falling asleep , the camera is back on and someone is filming both of them , taking money from the guy 's wallet . There 's not much more to this one as things end quickly.The third one is `` Tuesday The 17th '' , now we have a camping trip where 3 friends end up as bait for a girl with them named Wendy . There 's apparently some killer who is very hard to see even if he 's right in front of you . Violence and bad editing galore in this one.The fourth installment is `` The Sick Thing That Happened To Emily When She Was Younger '' , Emily and her boyfriend are trying to find out why ghostlike figures are appearing in her apartment and what 's with a strange bump on her arm . Guess what follows ? A whole lot of lameness honestly and things do n't end well for Emily.The fifth and thankfully final segment is `` 10/31/98 '' , a halloween night sees 4 guys in costume , an arrival at the wrong party house , a cult ritual and a bad end for said guys.The concept honestly sounds a lot more interesting than when it plays out , there 's nothing very scary in it , the film feels way too long and the whole VHS style editing and feel really gets old and fast . The only plus is there are some very pretty girls in it , including the girl who played the quiet one in `` Amateur Night '' . I 'll never think of the words `` I like you '' in the same way again . But this is overall a pretty big mess of a movie , where the style falls flat and everything else is very umm ... . bad . * out of 4 stars .	-1
This will depend on your alcohol tolerance , so adjust from the base line ( up ) if you are a drunk . First , if you are a non to light drinker , drink one-half of a fifth of some cheap whiskey . Wait 30 minutes . Now , stand up and spin around in a circle 40 times . Without taking a break , drive to Wallmart and run up and down the isles . That is what you feel like if you watch this disorienting movie . You should also remember that VHS video looks like crap nowadays , so do n't expect too much from that aspect either . Do n't pay $ 10 to see this early , if you feel like you have to see it , wait till its about $ 1.99 to rent so you wo n't feel robbed when you turn it off after 30 minutes .	-1
The hand held video as movie concept should have died with Blair Witch , but it must be cheaper to put together nonsense like this rather than take the time to craft a really good anthology series . Do n't get me wrong . There are some good ideas that could work in the hands of better directors and writers . Getting past the first 15 ( eternity ) minutes to try to set up this movie is the real torture . If it was n't on NetFlix ( which has become the dumping ground for bad movies ) , I would have quit watching . But since I could simply leave it running while catching up with the local news , I allowed it to continue . If you really want to know what happens in this movie ( with all `` spoilers '' ) , go to the Wikipedia listing ( [ ... ] ) . The listing is like a movie trailer . Believe me , all the good parts are in the synopsis and you do n't need to waste time watching this movie . If you do watch it , use the Wiki listing to find out exactly what 's going on . Oh , I know there are some reviewers here who think this is high art and the future of horror . Do n't believe it . You want a good anthology ? Go view Hammers ' `` Dr. Terror House of Horrors '' . There you 'll find good acting and good stories . The only horrors in VHS are the directing , acting , and writing . And you know VHS 2 is just around the corner .	-1
i had really high expectations for this movie . got ta admit that trailer is amazing . huge horror fan here and the buzz about this movie had me psyched ... .rented this movie early for the ten bucks , and will say that i feel it was a worthwhile rental , i wont be seeing it again or have the need to.five films . just like creepshow ... .but all found footage . interesting and pretty well done. got ta say though that out of the 5 stories , only 2 were really any good ( first and last ) ... .the third and fourth were awful . no seriously . the acting was insanely bad , like , please kill these people now , bad ... the second story was merely entertaining.also ... the whole 'people got sick , beware when watching this movie ' is hokey and has been done before and better.needless nudity completely takes away from the stories . not a buzz kill ... .just a fact.some interesting scares but the hype is not warranted ... .save your money for I Saw The Devil ... .now THAT is a MOVIE.fun rental but you can wait till its cheaper ... .not missing anything here but still fun .	-1
The great thing about anthology films is that , if one of the segments falls flat , you usually do n't have to wait too long to get another shot at a decent story . Even better , anthology horrors can side-step one of the biggest problems with the horror genre : the fact that scares tend to stale when you stretch a tale out to feature movie length . Much like some of the scariest campfire stories you heard when you were younger , really scary flicks do n't have to be much longer than twenty minutes to pack a wallop , and they have the added benefit of being less likely to drag.That 's in theory.V/H/S might have worked a lot better if it had n't gone for the found-footage theme , a film-making style that continues to plague theaters and films . The idea is that , if you put the movie behind the lens of a home video , viewers will be more inclined to invest in the reality of a story , to feel its presence and immediacy , and therefore to be more drawn into the drama or -- in this case -- chills . What usually ends up happening , however , is the screenwriters have to struggle through exposition heavy dialogue ( often regarding why the event in question is being meticulously filmed ) , and viewers have to deal with shaky , amateur-style filming . Luckily , the short length of these vignettes made camera excuses easy to come by , but this is without question an example of some of the worst blurry/shaky/look-how-headachingly-real-this-handheld-look-is filming I 've seen in a found footage movie.There are six tales : TAPE 56 : This story provides the connective tissue for the whole movie . A group of hooligans who like filming themselves are hired to go to a strange house and procure a VHS tape . During their search , they watch some of the tapes they find in the house , all of which comprise our anthology . This segment is poorly acted and even more poorly written , but that 's mildly excusable given that it only exists to be connective tissue for the other bits . ( 1 star ) AMATEUR NIGHT : A story that could 've been told in about five minutes , this little bit is about three young bucks who go out on the town to pick up some chicks and make a little hidden camera porn . Needless to say , they pick up more than they bargain for . The lead actress in this bit is a real trooper and does a bang-up job , and the special effects are n't too shabby . Our three male leads , however , are annoying beyond belief , and the overall `` twist '' of the story you can see coming from a mile away . ( 3 stars ) SECOND HONEYMOON : Our footage this time is in the form of a vacationing couple 's camcorder . The story is so basic that even stating one part of it would be giving too much away ; I 'll just say their honeymoon does n't end in the traditional way . Filmed and acted quite well , the plot is just too thin to be worth the twenty minutes it 's given . It feels like there could 've been much more to it if they 'd just taken the time to juice up the script . ( 2 stars ) TUESDAY THE 17TH : Four 20-somethings go for a vacation in the woods and , guess what ? They have a horrible time . This is one of those scripts where you 're asked to believe that four completely different people ( an alpha-male jock type , a skinny dweeb , an impossibly hot blonde , and a surly dark-haired misfit ) would for some reason be close enough friends to vacation together , in spite of their acerbic dialogue and general lack of common ground . One of them has a secret though , and although the content of the secret is rendered in a pretty cool way via some of VHS 's more common frailties ( think tracking errors and tape glitches ) , a total lack of answers and unbelievable plotting ruin the effect . ( 2.5 stars ) THE SICK THING THAT HAPPENED TO EMILY WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER : Told exclusively via webcam chats , this is tied for the strongest clip of the group . A waifish ( and kind of dense ) Emily has conversations with her doctor-to-be boyfriend , James , who is away at school . A possible haunting and a strange bump on her arm lead to a truly unexpected conclusion . Although the script is almost as annoyingly vague as the last one , there are enough clues to get the point across , and to do so in a way that does n't feel like a total cop-out or rip-off . ( 4 stars ) 10/31/98 : Four 20-to-30 something males go out to a Halloween house party , with one of them dressed as a nanny cam ( probably the best excuse for a found footage filming that I 've come across in one of these movies ) . They apparently go to the wrong house , however ( or they misunderstood what kind of party it was ) , because what they discover is less party than it is horror . With some pretty solid special effects and a fairly rapid delivery of action , this vignette is also one of the strongest . ( 4 stars )	-1
I rented this because Ti West was involved and I have loved his films thusfar . House of The Devil and Innkeepers especially . His short film in this about the people on their honeymoon was actually pretty solid . The remainder of them were straight up craptastic . I paid $ 8 to rent this because I was so excited to see it months before it came out . I actually turned it off before finishing it . I would not even be willing to rewatch this for $ 0 . My friend bought it ( he is bummed by the mistake ) so I ended up finishing it a couple of months later thinking that maybe I was just in a bad mood or something ... nope ... hated it !	-1
This was a horrible waste of $ 9.99 for a `` pre-theatrical '' rental . If this movie ever comes out in a theater , I 'd be quite shocked more by that than anything in the movie.It was so stupid and poorly done on all levels , that I watched most of it on FF just to get through it in case somehow all this tied together with something more than the ending it did have.As someone else aptly put in the title of their review ... '' This movie sucks '' . I agree.But to each their own.I 've seen several posts praising this movie for being `` daring '' , `` innovative '' , `` superb '' even . Did we watch the same movie ? ! ? ! Wow ! Now THAT would be a terrific gimmick ... Different movies all under the same title , and a random pick by a computer which one you actually get to see . This way you 'd have to find out how many different ones there are , and then hope you rent enough times to see them all . I 'm fairly certain the movie `` Clue '' did something like this in the theaters each having different endings of `` whodunit '' . The DVD shows all the endings the movie actually had . Now that was a well done fun movie based off of a fun board game.There ya have it ... simple and to the point . Let 's see how many call me names for writing this review ? I guess based on those other reviews we 'll all just have to wait until Hollywood finds a well-written horror comic book to make into the next awesome movie . Why not do a GOOD Vampirella movie since we 've got the whole supernatural being thing going hot & heavy with True Blood , Supernatural , The Vampire Diaries , etc. , etc . The original was terrible , but it is a cult classic . Just sayin ' ...	-1
I really could not watch . Not my kind of movie . It must be some sort of reality based film , could n't get through more than five minutes .	-1
I 've heard some good reviews from other sites about this movie..that is why I got the time to watch it and judge it my self . Well , from my point of view , this movie has : - Few new elements ( at least for me ) .- Fair scattered scares ( jumps ) in different portions ( different stories ! ! ) of this movie.- Majority of acting is fair but not good.- Some scares are of the type that can creeps you out.- Lot of unnecessary elements and scenes that got me bored.In overall I did n't like this movie because I got bored as there is no build up of story maybe some people can see it but I could n't . Maybe because of that ..I could n't get scared into the level I expected ( I expected it from the reviews I heard ! ) .It is a & # 34 ; watch once & # 34 ; movie for me .	-1
I love horror movies , and I love anthologies , AND I even love found-footage stuff . Sadly , this is pretty lame.For one thing , it 's possible to do horror without having the entire cast of characters be un-relateable douches . Not here , though . Everyone is grating , obnoxious , and obtusely stupid . The first story is so full of screaming and shaking the camera that it 's nearly unwatchable . The wraparound story is likewise bad ( and it 's a cast of douches ) .Sure , it 's somewhat inventive , but you 're better off going to watch an hour and a half of amateur stuff on YouTube ( there will be less camera shaking and OMG-I-HAVE-A-CAMERA LET ME ZOOM IN ON EVERYTHING idiocy ) .Pass .	-1
`` We have to break into this house and all we have to do is steal this one VHS tape . '' This review will be a little different then the others I have done . This will be different because the movie was different . This first off is n't really a movie at all . They try to put a little plot in but the movie is more like a `` Tales From The Crypt '' type style where there 5 little movies that are n't connected to each other instead of one long flowing movie . The 1st one is nothing but sex and gore . the 2nd is `` Paranormal Activity '' like . 3rd one is a generic college kids on a getaway movie . 4th is a haunted house seen from a Skype point of view and the 5th is like a Twilight Zone type . Everyone of of these little movies started off OK but everyone had an anti-climatic ending and left you more and more disappointed . This really is for hard-core horror fans only . Overall , a strange idea that really will only work for hard-core horror fans . Since this is n't really a movie I wo n't give it a grade .	-1
& # 8220 ; V/H/S & # 8221 ; is a found-footage anthology that comprises six horror shorts : & # 8220 ; Tape 56 & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Amateur Night & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Second Honeymoon & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; Tuesday the 17th & # 8221 ; & # 8220 ; The Sick Thing That Happened to Emily When She Was Younger & # 8221 ; and & # 8220 ; 10/31/98. & # 8221 ; Actually , & # 8220 ; Tape 56 & # 8221 ; is a & # 8220 ; frame story & # 8221 ; ( directed by Adam Wingard , & # 8220 ; You & # 8217 ; re Next & # 8221 ; ) that links other five short movies & # 8211 ; five short horrors that are mildly entertaining but not exactly scary.Let us forget the film & # 8217 ; s contrived premise . A group of young men videotaping their criminal activities ( who doesn & # 8217 ; t ? ) breaks into an old man & # 8217 ; s house looking for a certain video tape . What they found is a dead body and a stack of old VHS tapes.That & # 8217 ; s silly , but still OK . Sadly , what follows is not really impressive , either . I hate to reveal much about the stories of each segment , so let me just say that though some of the shorts have nice ideas & # 8211 ; and gory deaths and some naked women & # 8211 ; none of them has managed to fully develop them into a compelling narrative.In short , the 116 minute film feels long with largely boring shaky cam footage .	-1
The newest episode aired over a week ago , but its still not on Amazon ! I paid for the whole season & even sent them a complaint but nothing has happened ... guess amazon just dropped the ball on this one ... why am I paying for this again ? I can just go watch it on some other site for free without the waiting around !	-1
This is another fake reality show . The cast is made up of human train wrecks who long ago left the Amish community pretending to be innocents encountering the outside world . We have the typical collection of drunks , wifebeaters , petty criminals and losers that can be found anywhere.Putting the fake elements and the fraud of the show aside , the only thing of value here is that it seems a certain percentage of humans , no matter where they come from or how they are raised , are trash . Even though its a fake show , the really awful nature of each of their personalities comes out . The show might have been better called `` becoming trailer trash '' .	-1
First , let me mention that , Michael Scott aside , I was a fan of this show just as much for Jim and Pam , and if they end their relationship on a `` divorce '' note I will NEVER invest in another show by these producers . Guess what ? Breaking up a happy family to go out on a high-minded story arc is a betrayal to the fans , and here 's one more fundamental truth : DIVORCE IS N'T FUNNY ! ! ! These characters deserve to end the show as much in love and together as when they started.I am a STALWART fan of the series , and have been since it 's American debut . I think the humor of the show was that most of the other people in the show were REAL people and Michael was the insane one . That is what the show was about , how a crazy manager interacts with real people . Michael was shocking , irrepressible , irredeemable , and loud , inappropriate at the worst and most inopportune moments , and almost entirely oblivious to it ( which was also his saving grace ) . The moment a light of understanding hit his brain , he would suddenly become human , attempt to back pedal , and then begrudgingly apologize.It was this that made the show . When Michael left the office , the curtain should have closed , the lights turned up , and we should have been made to leave our seats . Instead , seasons 8 and 9 continued to turn the carcass over and make a mockery of the quirks of each character , way , way over emphasizing the suddenly , equally quirky traits of the staff . If it 's one person being a fool and all around staring in awe and disbelief , that 's an out of the ordinary moment . If everyone is cavorting around foolishly , there 's no awe or disbelief.Here 's the primary example : Michael tells the new temp Ryan to play along with a prank he intends to play on the receptionist Pam . Ryan , not yet aware of Michael 's insanity , nods , and Michael calls for Pam.Pam walks into the manager 's office , and Michael informs her that his choice in which employee to fire in their ongoing campaign of downsizing has been made simpler . Because she has been identified as an office supply thief of potentially thousands of dollars over 3 years of employment , she will not only be terminated , but will not even qualify for severance because of the punitive nature of her dismissal.Ryan shakes his head , non-verbally disavowing any participation in the `` prank '' as Michael stifles a gleeful chortle . Pam , however , begins to frown and denies the accusation , claiming that she has not even stolen so much as a paper clip , but Michael casts her plea aside and tells her to clean out her workspace.Pam begins to cry profusely , a reaction Michael at ONLY THAT MOMENT realizes is a bad turn . He promptly cries , `` You 've been 'punked ' '' and laughs , sticking to his joke even as it careens into a deadly plummet . Pam calls him a jerk and runs off.In another episode , Michael makes small talk with Pam and mentions the common phrase , Thank God it 's Friday , and that it 's another day overworked and underpaid . Pam 's only reaction is to say , `` I know what you mean , '' and Michael suddenly becomes stern . He says , `` if you are unhappy with your compensation , bring it up with HR . `` Michael is clearly a character with huge flaws that all the other cast members have to tip toe around in order to get a solid day 's work accomplished . None of the other characters exhibited signs of silliness , but as the seasons went on , the characters evolved their own various issues that , while making them unique , also made them all seem like cartoons . They stop tip-toeing and begin bumbling around Michael Scott style.Jim and Pam 's relationship was the other huge staple of the show . Just because they 're married does n't mean their `` adventure '' is over . I married my wife and it felt like life had only just BEGUN at that moment . Pam should have been able to make something of her art . When she failed , it felt like the show was saying , `` Just give it up , kids . You 're going to stay mediocre regardless . '' Jim 's ambition to become a sports agent should have been much smaller , and he a lot more understanding of what he 's putting his wife through . It 's like nice , sweet , cool Jim has been replaced by Jack @ ss Jim . If that 's what we 're left with , then none of his good moments , kind deeds , and hard choices have EVER mattered . He 's just going to end up a douche eventually . NICE !	-1
Every episode not only manages to disgrace this brand name but actually make seasons 1 through 5 worse , somehow . After seeing this season , I want to forget about the entire series and that 's a shame , I recall truly enjoying the awkward Michael seasons . As for the actor who plays Andy , his absence at least made the show tolerable . Upon his return in this episode thoughts of blinding myself and bursting my eardrums became preferable to finishing the episode with his talentless non-portrayal of a character that has no aspirations beyond being overlooked , unfortunately thanks to the horrific brand of `` look-at-me-I-didn't-get-enough-love-from-mommy-as-a-child '' acting , we can not simply ignore Andy . Never underestimate the ambitions of individuals for attention and money to ruin art . Please cancel it now , we do n't need an ending or series finale to this any more than we need a resolution to any rotting roadkill corpse in the middle of the interstate .	-1
Worryingly misleading about cancer treatment realities . Three observations : First : no doc would allow someone who needed surgery as urgently as the Parenthood character is alleged to have needed it to wait for weeks to have the surgery . It 's called 'malpractice , ' and for good reason : if a cancer is thought to be so urgent as to require surgery , it 's medically ill-advised to wait.Second : no one who has been through chemo is doing splits at a bar a few weeks later . Or only BEGINNING to lose a little hair . Someone who has been through chemo is obviously and visibly pale , weak , and bruised , and looses hair ( if she is going to ) much more dramatically.Third : going through surgery , chemo , and radiation -- which the Parenthood character is alleged to have to go through -- takes an enormous toll . Most people -- even young , otherwise healthy , and clearly very affluent -- people who have been down that path LOOK it , for months , and possibly forever , moreover , since you are leaving with a weakened immune system after cancer treatment , you are much more vulnerable.It 's a huge disservice to the many women ( and some men ! ) who have gone through breast cancer treatment to make it look as manageable as the show does . Even when there are not emergencies -- as often there are not -- cancer treatment is a slog , a struggle , and it marks you for life.I understand that television glamorizes/misrepresents most of the difficult things in life . Pretend that the characters could afford to live as lavishly as they do in Berkeley ( if the parents ' house/compound were in Berkeley -- which is it not -- it would be worth many millions of dollars ) . Pretend that normal working people and parents have the sort of time and money to do overnights in expensive hotels , wear fabulous clothes , constantly have parties with snazzy gifts , etc . That 's just standard Hollywood fare ; no one is really fooled.But DO NOT MISREPRESENT WHAT CANCER TREATMENT REQUIRES , or WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GO THROUGH/HAVE GONE THROUGH IT . That 's just irresponsible .	-1
Unless they ramp things up quickly , this is just about dead . Nothing new , interesting or clever here . Seems Poehler is just dropping into the old corporate mold as fast as she can . You 've come a long way , baby . Yeah-right .	-1

It 's hard to think of anything innovative these days . Especially if you had to judge the horror media today through this film.5 friends on a road trip ? Check.Come across creepy places ? Check.Ignoring a grave warning ? Check.Constantly swear like your whole vocabulary has no words beyond 2 syllables ? Check.Oh , and one of THE most annoying cliches : overt predictability.The shortest amount of time I had to be able to predict anything was around ten seconds . Either I 've watched too many horror movies of this sort or ... wait . Maybe that 's it.This is supposed to be IFC , yet it feels like Hollywood- meaning it feels cookie-cutter in its setup , premise , and execution ( pun intended ) .There may have been one or two scenes that got me to jump , but The Grudge was better at getting me to really JUMP , not just have a small jumpstart . Not to mention the main character seemed to not know ( at first ) how to use his camera for anything more than to try to make a sex video with his girlfriend ( believe it or not , filmmakers out there , not ALL men are sex animals , some actually respect women as women and not sex toys ) . He and the rest do seem to present the one thing that 's almost convincing me to stop watching indie horror : no real aspect of hope of getting out alive , but pulling the same mistakes the kids in the previous horror film you watched make and getting offed in the process.The decisions these kids made made me think they were kindergarten dropouts rather than try to convince they had a brain at all . Not to mention the video itself , though described in the beginning to be top-of-the-line in all its features , kept having cliched glitches yet no explanation as to why they kept happening ( I doubt cameras detect human tension and therefore constantly screw up their own quality in the process ) .I hope IFC does n't keep letting people repeat this type of movie mistake .	-1
this was quite possibly the most annoying movie ever . `` Dumb '' is too smart for this movie ! This movie makes the Blair Witch look like a 5 star movie ! I actually wanted to put my head through a wall- that 's how stupid this movie is ! 80 % of the movie is a camera being dragged through brush and trees.worst script logic ever ! IT MADE NO SENSE ! nothing was even remotely realistic or logical ! If this was a film about how to make the worst decisions ever while being hunted by a murderer- then it 's the best movie ever ! lolThis movie was so bad it 's hard to give examples- I 'm so sorry.I will never watch a movie by this director ever again.I 'm sorry that I sound like a broken record ... it 's just I ca n't believe how gawd awful this film was !	-1
This movie was horrible . If you are a fan of horror films skip it brcause you are noy missing much .	-1
Justin ( Victor Zinck Jr. ) gets a camera for his birthday from his girlfriend Brook ( Mittita Barber ) and immediately goes into little boy mode . They go on a trip to `` the cabin '' with another couple Kirk ( Aslam Husain ) and Amanda ( Chelsey Reist ) . Amanda 's sister Danielle ( Christie Burke ) tags along as the moody `` whatever '' girl.The first half of the film takes place in the car . We are filled with the `` Turn the camera off ! '' and `` Okay it 's off '' stupidity . They detour to a place called the Crowsnest to get half priced beer only to be harassed by slashers in a travel trailer for the second half of the film during which we see film footage of trees and ferns.This is a lousy `` kids in the woods '' film made worse with terrible found footage and a bad script . If you are going to skip one found footage film this year , I think you found it.Parental Guide F-bomb . Brief Nudity ( Mittita Barber ) . Near sex .	-1
too many attractive people are living under one roof in an upper class section of LA . The movie drips with what can only be called a sunny narcissism . Yes , there 's trouble in paradise , though for all their well-intentioned pretensions , none of the characters seem particularly bright enough to look past their narrow horizons , much less their own worst impulses . Perhaps this is why film makers should n't live in LA ; they cut their cultural teeth on the town and wind up making films like this .	-1
Given the screenplay was co-written by Lena Dunham , creator and breakout star of HBO'sGirls , I was hoping this 2012 indie relationship drama would resonate strongly like Lisa Cholodenko 's acclaimed Los Angeles-set films ( Laurel Canyon , The Kids Are All Right ) , especially with such a smart cast of actors . However , something feels amiss in director Ry Russo-Young 's coolish approach to a familiar story of adulterous deception and family dysfunction . The pacing feels glacial , and the characters are just not that involving emotionally . Perhaps that was the intention in showing the shallow nature of the lifestyle being portrayed , but it rubs off on the film 's inertia leaving it feeling quite flat . The setting is LA 's funky-chic Silver Lake neighborhood where sound engineer Peter lives with his psychotherapist wife Julie along with their young son and her teenaged daughter from a previous marriage , Kolt . They epitomize the laid-back , everything's-cool attitudes one associates with affluent Southern Californians.Enter Martine , a New York acquaintance of Julie 's college friend who happens to be an attractive 23-year-old experimental filmmaker . She has agreed to work as Peter 's assistant in exchange for him helping out on her latest project , an arty video installation revolving around close-ups of ants . How Martine emotionally invades the family is the crux of the story , and to the credit of Russo-Young and Dunham , she never comes across as an unrepentant interloper like more commercially driven exploitative films have done in the past . It 's just that the plot pretty much goes the way you would expect it would go from the outset , although the characters carry decidedly ambiguous natures that make some of the story turns feel more complex than they really need to be . For instance , the inevitable tryst between Martine and Peter lacks believable passion because it feels almost matter-of-fact . In hindsight , I feel like it should have been the driving force in pushing each character toward self-examination.The cast is not really at fault here as the acting , for the most part , is sensitive and assured . Olivia Thirlby ( the best friend inJuno ) provides the requisite gamine quality needed to make Martine credible as an object of obsession even if her character remains a cipher throughout . The always becalming Rosemarie DeWitt ( Rachel Getting Married ) delivers a thoughtful balancing act between earth mother and jealous wife as Julie . John Krasinski has a bit harder time escaping his amiable good-guy image fromThe OfficeandAway We Go , but he does provide some surprisingly heated moments as Peter that make you wonder if he could do a greater variety of roles onscreen . As the constantly yearning Kolt , India Ennenga appears to be channeling early Claire Danes , but she makes the character 's unrequited love palpable . In smaller parts , Justin Kirk as a horned-up Hollywood screenwriter and Julie 's attentive patient and Dylan McDermott as her self-possessed ex-husband bring much needed alpha energy to the proceedings . A late meltdown scene with Kolt 's smarmy Italian tutor ( Emanuele Secci ) feels very out of place . Lethargic viewing .	-1
I abandoned watching this . I tried . As soon as the young girl cozied up to the John Krasinski character , I gave it up . It was n't going anywhere to begin with and now it was just trash .	-1
Seven dollars to rent a movie ? You could buy a DVD for $ 7 easily . This is a rip off . I watched this movie but found it horrible because the price was so high .	-1
The story is kind of lame and I lost interest halfway through . The story also does not makes much sense . Skip it !	-1
Overall , I did n't care much for this film . It does have some highlights , like Hugh Jackman 's portrayal of a pervy car-salesman , and the cute young girl named Destiny , but that 's about it . Jennifer Garner and Ty Burrell have some funny moments , but they are just MOMENTS and ca n't carry the whole film . I actually found the whole `` let 's make fun of middle-America '' thing a bit on the vicious side , and Olivia Wilde 's character was just gross . I was glad that I did n't have to pay to see this one .	-1
I had heard many good things about the movie BUTTER before I had the chance to see it . Critics were treating it fairly nice and word of mouth via numerous magazines said good things as well . So I went in expecting something quite different than what I got.The world of BUTTER revolves around the annual Butter Carving Championship held at the Iowa State Fair . For the past 15 years the winner has remained Bob Pickler ( Ty Burrell ) . Ty is a good natured man who has done an amazing job with his sculpting , his last being a full sized replica of the last supper . Bob is married to Laura ( Jennifer Garner ) , a prim , proper and respectable leader in their community who feels that Bob 's 15 years of winning may lead them to greater things like being the Governor or perhaps even one day the President . Not only is Laura a respectable member of the community , she is one that is feared as well . No one will mess with Laura or what she wants.When the championship committee makes the decision to ask Bob to step down and let someone else win for once , Laura goes on a rampage . She views it as the world trying to take down her and her family , never once thinking that perhaps it would be encouraging for others to be involved . When Bob refuses to enter , Laura does what she considers the next best thing and enters herself in the hopes of retaining the family legacy.But this wo n't be the easy win she expects . A storyline running alongside the Pickler family is that of Destiny ( Yara Shahidi ) . A young black girl in an orphanage passed from one foster family to another , Destiny has landed with a new couple , Ethan and Julie ( Rob Corrdry and Alicia Silverstone ) . When Destiny happens across Bob and his sculpture at an exhibition she is amazed and picks up on carving butter herself . A natural at it , she decides she wants to enter the competition as well.Also entering the competition is Brooke ( Olivia Wilde ) , a stripper that Bob had a fling with and who he owes $ 600 . In an attempt to make his life worse than it already is , Brooke continues to show up at Bob 's house demanding her money and finally enters the competition just to spite Laura.So far this sounds like a decent satire of the whole competition scenario that we 've had before in films . Instead we get something a little different that actually turns out to be a bit more hateful than one would expect . I mean granted when it comes to movies made about the Midwest people will always be portrayed as closed minded and redneck , the whole clinging to their guns and Bibles sort . For some reason Hollywood finds a lot of humor in that . While they continue to laugh uproariously at those sorts of things I find that it 's more of an easy out and lazy comedy than anything.This is not to say the film fails completely . At the start it truly has some funny moments . It 's well made and does feature some really good performances . But then somewhere along the way it veers off and decides to get nasty and mean instead of funny . Laura goes from being an obsessed housewife with delusions of grandeur to what Hollywood thinks of right wingers . She 's spouts off profanities when the mood suits her , feels she is entitled to a place of power and prestige , displays racists tendencies and will do any and everything she can to retain the family title . Her character becomes hateful and manipulative . Anyone that opposes her , including a stripper , is offered up as just and righteous.The movie changes along with the character of Laura Pickler . It changes from a movie that has some great humor in it to one that seems more determined to ridicule those the writer does n't agree with instead . In those attempts to ridicule we see displayed some of the laziest writing around resorting to stereotypes better left to online memes rather than a feature film.One odd thing about those in Hollywood . Anyone who has actually lived in the Midwest always talks about how much they loved their childhood , yet they always seem to find it necessary to insult or ridicule where they came from . And for those who have never visited let alone lived in the Midwest , they always feel they know exactly what it 's like to live there . Unfortunately with rare exceptions , they almost never get it right . This holds true in BUTTER.A great example appears in outtakes that roll during the final credits . Ethan and Destiny have a scene where they 're sitting in his car and she tells him she 's afraid of going in to enter the competition . He begins to tell her that there are worse things that could happen than just entering . Things like piranhas learning to walk and entering the building at the same time to attack . These are things he says to break down her fear and give her the courage to enter . It 's a nice scene and in the movie plays well . But in the outtakes one of the scenarios that Destiny offers up is `` It could be worse ; it could be a Republican fund raiser '' . Gee , is n't that a subtle display of where the thoughts of this writer lay.The potential for a great movie was there . Instead it resorted to the cheap laughs it had that are actually not funny unless you hate Republicans . If so , you will love this movie . If you 're a bit more open minded and think there are good and bad people on both sides of the coin , then this movie will offer a few laughs and then toss them all aside to gain political points with Hollywood .	-1
Cute movie with a unique plot , but far too predictable and often times bland . The little girl makes the movie , though Jennifer Garners acting is superb . Not the best , but definitely not a bad movie . It was n't worth the Watch While It 's In Theaters price though . I would wait until it is cheaper .	-1
This movie has a funny cast , but it is anything but funny . No wonder this movie did n't make any money at the theater .	-1
Terrible movie , no redeeming qualities , turned it off without finishing . Can not understand who would give 4 stars , not any good	-1
I could name dozens of rom-coms from the last decade that this one liberally steals from , but what would be the point ? Perhaps I watch too many comedies . What should be a simple boy meets girl story is complicated by all sorts of wacky , twisted , and clueless peripheral characters . Each obstacle to their relationship seems contrived , like a 1978 tv episode of `` What 's Happening ? '' without the laugh track .	-1
This show was two hours of my life that i will never get back . I kept watching thinking that surly the main character would grow a spine and kick his abusive toxic family to the side..but no ! He just keeps coming back for more with that sad puppy look in his eye . I found myself yelling insults at his family for him . I would steer clear of this one .	-1
This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever seen and I very much regret spending the money for it . I had high hopes for it because of the actors involved but we stopped watching because of how totally stupid it was . It was a total waste of money and time . It was just unbelievably bad .	-1
I am confused about the hype and raves for this film . It is a wanna-be quirky independent film using trite jokes and unreal situations in a world that does n't require a release form . We are told that Bruce has spent his life torturing and filming his brother Frankie from the film blurb . We get to see one quick episode , hear about a second one , that really had nothing to do with Bruce and the movie is about a third one that again , Bruce ( Chris O'Dowd ) just happens to film.The whole set up and building of characters was done in a very poor fashion . The get together of Frankie ( Charlie Hunnam ) and Lassie ( Lizzy Caplan ) was slightly humorous , but there was no good follow up . Bruce was extremely unlikeable . Frankie only slightly less so . The characters overall are meh , even the over the top Ron Pearlman ... '' call me Phyllis now '' tried so hard to be funny , that it wasn't.This is a sex comedy that lacks the crudeness of successful sex comedies , and lacks the cleverness of a good indie . It is a hybrid that does n't reproduce . Some may find it amusing , I do n't recommend it , even as a rental.Parental Guide : F-bomb , sex , nudity .	-1
I rented this because it had an interesting premise . I think they could 've done more with this . I really wanted to like it , but I was mostly bored .	-1
This movie needs to & # 34 ; Take a HIKE & # 34 ; right on out duh Amazon instant video section , and never come back ... .it is plain out too bad to even explain why ... .	-1
The film opens with people screaming and running around getting killed by an off screen slasher . After that brief teaser opening , 5 girls take off to go camping . Kate ( Zara Phythian ) is five days back from Afghanistan ( guess how her training plays in this ) . The girls drive , then leave their convertible with the top down to go hike and camp several hours away . The girls are armed with shorts , boots , back packs , and military issue undergarments that can double as a swim suit . It is n't long before they meet some cute boys and become flirty.If you were awake the first few minutes then you know where this goes.This is a & # 34 ; me-too & # 34 ; woods slasher . It offers nothing new . The characters were not well established . Their personality was bland . It was killing for the sake of killing . No cannibals , inbreeding , or a sportsman club . Boring.Parental Guide : F-bomb , rape , nudity ( male and female )	-1
Hard for me to watch . I view it when I need motivation to clean my own house and throw stuff out . How can anyone care so much about & # 8220 ; stuff ? & # 8221 ; They put & # 8220 ; things & # 8221 ; over people and that is the most disturbing part .	-1
I have heard from a lot of people about this show , so I was curious to see a few episodes for myself . It lives up to the descriptions of my friend , but I was disturbed by how the therapists treated - or rather failed to treat - the underly issues of the & # 34 ; hoarders. & # 34 ; The show is seriously over dramatized , which is n't unexpected for a reality TV show , but I would expect more from the therapists , who I would assume have a professional duty to treat their patients rather than to just antagonize for the cameras .	-1
Patty started hoarding when her philandering husband leaves her . She has two sons . The cleaning guy with the chin dimple tried to sleep in her house , but could n't to it . It was yucky and funny seeing his head resting close to some fecal matter . Patty has two sons , one married to a man . ND does n't allow same-sex marriage , but I 'm so happy that the show always refered to Cody as a husband and not some euphemism . The mother and brother called the husband all kinds of names , but the show does n't explain why the husband is a bad person . If anything many rainbow-flag men would have left lovers with crazy family members in a second . Once the house is clean , the therapist encourages the owner to deal with her feelings . I do n't understand how an empty house makes a woman deal with being dissed by her ex-spouse . The ( straight ) son at times has his T-shirt 's msg blurred and at other times is seen wearing the Gabriel Iglesias shirt saying `` I 'm not fat ; I 'm fluffy . '' I 'm a fatty too and I can empathize with the family , but they did seem morbidly obese . I do worry about their healths.In the other fact pattern , the woman of the house owes about $ 50,000 in credit card debt due to hoarded objects . Her husband had every reason in the world to leave her , but you can tell he does n't want to in his heart . The woman had the nerve to say she never wanted sons , although she has 4 of them . The crew is nice enough to clean her house and she yells , `` I do n't like the color of these walls . '' After all her drama , the therapist said , `` She may seem like a jerk to others , but that 's the disease controlling her . '' I 'm skeptical of that . It felt like passing the blame . This woman was just really nasty and when she abandoned by everybody who could have loved her , I think she 's going to be quite rueful . She cries and yells , `` I hate being disappointed . '' I was thinking , `` Then maybe you should n't set unrealistic standards for others ! '' I kinda wonder if she has anti-social personality disorder .	-1
Not overly impressed with the show -- it 's just like every other Hoarder show . Some a little more disgusting than others . Pick those ones for the shock value only.Here 's how it goes : & # 34 ; People who hoard have issues and they usually wait until it 's so far gone that they a ) are getting evicted by their landlord or b ) the county has deemed the house/apartment/trailer uninhabitable. & # 34 ; That 's the message through and through.The hoarder always has some reason for their behavior and of course is reluctant to make any changes -- this goes on for at least a half hour . There is a crazy family dynamic going on where family members are estranged from the hoarder , mad as can be and & # 34 ; do n't want nothing to do & # 34 ; with the hoarder . They all have n't spoken for a long time . Soooo , bring in some specialist in the psychological issues of hoarding ( really ? there is such a thing ? Well , now apparantly there IS ! What an idiot job ... sorry about wasting your perfectly good educationon a TV show . Probably getting paid great and it serves your ego oh-so-well to be the 'expert ' ) Then the & # 34 ; clean up crew & # 34 ; ( who look and sound like they are always advertising their services ) show up and make predictible comments on the mess of it all . Then they done protective gear and start the clean up job.There might be a crisis moment at the point the clean up is underway . Of course , there is a serious time crunch of like , oh ... say : 48 hours . It 's so serious at this point , because the hoarder was so reluctant for months , years ... whatever ... but no matter ... .the hoarder starts freaking out and has second thoughts about getting rid of some piece of cardboard or the bucket of poop ( seriously , this was in one of the episodes I watched ! ! ) and everything halts while the family gets ticked off again , walks out , vowing that they are DONE with this nonsense . Bring in that specialist and have a come-to-reason meeting ... . on we go with the clean up.Everything turns out good in the end . Or maybe not . To be honest , I watched two shows and just ended up feeling disgusted that main stream entertainment has turned into such a freak show . It must be the & # 34 ; train wreck & # 34 ; mentally.And there are SEVERAL shows like this -- some are & # 34 ; Extreme Hoarder & # 34 ; shows and some are & # 34 ; Just Hoarder & # 34 ; shows . It should just be a matter of time before the & # 34 ; Relapsed Hoarder & # 34 ; show is on the air.Hey , I want the rights for THAT brilliant idea .	-1
If you are extremely bored this is the show for you . People like this should be sent to a mental institution	-1
There is nothing whatsoever sexy about a nearly sixty year old slut with a hotel blanket showing her wrinkley upper arms , shoulders , and neck . Sutter is overexposing Sagal and making her looks and behavior grotesque . An elderly whore is not an interesting character . Then she gets loaded and wrecks her car with her grandchildren in it . The strong matriarch has lost her throne and turned into a nauseating loser . That 's not a character study , that is not character development , that is just plain character assassination .	-1
Been a fan of this series for four seasons.. Understand the desire for writers to push the envelope however this time S5 episode 1 crossed the line . For me anyway . Afraid I am done with the series . Could have accomplished the same plot line and emotional impact without exposing the audience to such graphic and obscene footage . Too bad too because the story seemed to be headed in an interesting direction . Thank you Mr. SUTTER for four great seasonS . Going to return this and give JUSTIFIED a try .	-1
I made the mistake of watching the series from beginning to season five in a fairly short period time . I was ill and decided that I needed to watch something serially . Seasons one through three were great . Season four started to get a little bit silly . Season five was so ridiculous that I just simply quit watching it even though I had already paid .	-1
I still like the Shakespearean drama component of SOA . But the & # 34 ; action & # 34 ; part is getting really tiresome ( say about two seasons ago ) , it is turning into an adolescent 's fantasy , and it is really getting hard to suspend disbelief , or take any part of the show seriously because of it . Look , we know nobody important is ever going to be killed , ( even if chained and handcuffed , they will find some miraculous way out because TV villians have never heard of Occam 's razor ( or listened to the advice of Scott Evil ) , and even the CIA is helpless before the wisdom and power of Jax from Charming ( having already easily conqured the ATF and DOJ , I suppose this is a logical progression ... but what is next ? The White House ? ) . It has become a very lazy show , recycling years-old masturbatory character arcs and plot lines , and increasingly applying hard to accept fantastical resolutions . They went & # 34 ; big & # 34 ; several years ago and lost what was special about the show ; the inherent drama in human relationships under extreme stress .	-1
I can barley remember the plot . Not one redeeming quality that I can remember . Giving the choice I would not recommend this to any one .	-1
This is crazy . In reading other reveiws , I see that you guys are not giving those of us who have a `` TV Pass '' , a full episode to watch , instead many have viewed a version that is missing some scenes . That sucks ! But at least they got to watch SOMETHING . Now it says there is NO version available for me to watch at all ! I must agree with the others who are upset about this . I have a `` TV Pass '' for several shows currently . If this is n't resolved soon , I may just pull all of them AND my `` Prime '' acct . Unacceptable Amazon ! ... ..Here I am at 3:00 p.m. , on THURSDAY and this episode is STILL UNAVAILABLE ! ! , ... Just about reached my limit in dealing with this issue ... I spend a BUTTLOAD of money here , every week , on videos and T.V . shows , I want this fixed NOW ! ! ..Or me and my money are done with you inept fools	-1
I want my money back ! I DID NOT PAY FOR 16 seconds of commercials before the show or 2 min of commercials after ! Your commercials eat up the limited internet usage that I have way out here in the country . I DID love amazon vidoes when it first came out and I have been a VERY loyal customer , and how have I gotten re-paid ? By Amazon sneaking in commercials that I DO N'T WANT TO WATCH and I PAID so that I would not have to watch ! ! ! ! STOP the commercials or start loosing customers ! ! !	-1
I love Glee , but I got ta say that Season Four of Glee was by far the weakest of the seasons . The storylines were not that great-the songs not too good and while I enjoyed Blake Jenner , I do not like some of the other new characters . It also depresses me that this is the last season that Corey Monteith is in , and also that it was not that great . Do n't waste your time or money on this , most of the songs can be watched on youtube .	-1
What started out as a reasonably enjoyable show seems to have run it 's course . Season 4 attempts to continue the story-line with some of the original 20-something- aged characters moving on to bigger and better things in the Big Apple . Meanwhile , back at the old Alma Mater , everything continues to run on the same old track . 27 year-old Heather Morris continues her role as dumb blond Heather Pierce with a bit more screen time . Even the original music seems to be less enjoyable than it was in the first seasons .	-1
Too many show tunes for me.. at least I think they are show tunes because I do n't recognize most of the music .	-1
Another dumb comedy about teens and high school . Not funny and the music is awful and sounds like its from rejects from American Idol or The Voice .	-1
Not a fan of Gere but this story was n't too bad . Had some good twists on what could have been a rehashed , tired storyline . The language was way over the top though .	-1
The only thing worse than having to watch a movie you never really cared for to begin with is being forced to watch it again and then realizing you ca n't stand it . That 's exactly what happened with first time director Nicholas Jarecki 's `` Arbitrage . '' Starring Richard Gere , Susan Sarandon , Brit Marling , and Tim Roth , `` Arbitrage '' is the story of a billionaire named Robert Miller ( Gere ) . Robert is the manager of a hedge fund empire that is supposedly one of the most profitable in the business , but Robert altered his books and committed fraud . Even though he 's covered his tracks , the fraud is still there . On Robert 's 60th birthday , a deal that will tie up all the loose ends and keep Robert and his family very happy and wealthy is on the verge of being negotiated . But that 's when things begin to get a bit more complicated in Robert 's life and his lies begin to get the best of him . `` Arbitrage '' was one of the first screeners sent out to critics during the awards season . The movie is getting a ton of buzz because of Richard Gere 's performance , so it was thrown into the nearest movie playing device and watched as quickly as possible . Needless to say , it was a huge letdown and was passable at best . So many screeners are sent out to critics every year , but this was the first year that the majority of the pile was watched on this end . So after viewing 30 or 40 movies since its initial viewing , `` Arbitrage '' shows up on Blu-ray in the mail and since the specifics of the movie had become so blurred since the last viewing another one was in order . Its second viewing only makes the experience feel even more mundane.Robert Miller is n't exactly an upstanding citizen . Hell , he is n't even likeable . Robert Miller is only watching out for Robert Miller . He only does what benefits himself . He tries to make it seem like he 's worried about his family , but he 's honestly just obsessed with money and is afraid of tarnishing his reputation . Richard Gere 's performance is n't bad , but it does n't really deserve a ton of accolades either . He 's a guy that 's buried himself in his own grave who 's now mimicking a cockroach who wo n't die while scurrying along and trying to find any escape route that he can . Gere mostly just seems to throw temper tantrums and has a few emotional outbursts , but is nothing special overall . He yells a lot , but his go-to method is yelling completely belittling things to whoever he 's talking to before whispering that they should come sit next to him so he can show them something . This happens on at least three different occasions with two different individuals.The movie is also a total waste of Tim Roth . Going into this , you may think to yourself that maybe Roth will at least have some enjoyable scenes . That unfortunately is n't really the case . Det . Michael Bryer ( Roth ) is a cop who plays dirty without actually being a dirty cop , if that makes any sense . He pulls strings to do things that are n't by the book , but it 's to put the ones who deserve to be behind bars where they belong . Roth mostly just acts tough without ever doing anything to back it up or possibly never really having the chance . The most enjoyable part of his performance is his handlebar mustache . Brit Marling and Susan Sarandon feel wasted as well , but the wound does n't feel quite as deep . Marling portrays Robert 's daughter Brooke who also works for him while Sarandon is Robert 's wife . Marling 's only real shining moment is a shouting match with her father in a public park , but the scene only makes you wonder why nobody is stopping or taking notice of the argument even though it gets extremely heated . Sarandon 's highlight is acting too busy to talk to Tim Roth even though she does n't really have much going on , but honestly anything feels like a step up for her after her appearance in `` That 's My Boy . `` `` Arbitrage '' attempts to be this thrilling and compelling piece of cinema and it just is n't . There are several different storylines going on throughout the movie , but it all just feels very ho hum ; you do n't care about any of it . Robert tries to be portrayed in this light that he 's a wolf in sheep 's clothing , but he 's more of a rat in a skin suit . You have no desire to see his story go one way or the other . Not to mention that he bleeds internally for like a week and barely acknowledges it after the first night . With all of the cheating , the lying , the backstabbing , and innocent people who are trying to turn their life around and yet are getting hurt because of Robert , `` Arbitrage '' is the story of one rich man 's downward spiral where both sides lie to try to get what they want but both walk away empty handed . It all results in a standstill that is about as thrilling as a staring contest.Special features on the Blu-ray of the film include Commentary with Writer/Director Nicholas Jarecki , the 12.5 minute `` A Glimpse into Arbitrage '' featurette which features the cast and crew discussing the film , the 7 minute `` Who is Robert Miller ? '' featurette , and 10 minutes of Deleted Scenes with Optional Director Commentary .	-1
I really like Richard Gere but I think that this movies is quite below his ability . The movement and themes of this film have been used time and time again so that the viewer knows what will happen which leads to a boring repetitive theme seen in so many other movies . Originality is missing in today 's hollywood productions . ,	-1
It 's about people living lies in order to succeed , even though it does not bring them happiness . There are better ways to live , and I 'd rather learn about those .	-1
Typically , I love Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon . I had high hopes and sadly , this movie just did n't do it for me . I felt the plot was a bit weak and obvious / dull / been done enough already ... The supporting actors were just so so . I wish SS had a larger role , I do n't enjoy Tim Roth or Monica Raymund , so was disappointed to find they were part of the cast . Thankfully MR did n't have a large part . I watched while doing some hemming , so at least my time was n't wasted .	-1
I could only stand to watch this movie about 15 minutes . I came close to watching a major league baseball game as an alternative , and that 's a sad statement . no really worth even 1-star .	-1
Something misled me into expecting a smart white collar crime story , say like Margin Call with Spacey , Irons a.o.This one is n't it . Nothing wrong with the cast , Gere and Sarandon a.o . do their job , but the plot is , frankly , just yellow press pulp.American billionaire in his 60s runs into headwind on two fronts at once . His risky investment in Russia faces obstacles , which he tries to hide by cooking the books , so that he can sell his company just in time . His private life is upset by an accident : driving at night , he falls asleep , and his girl friend dies . He tries to hide his involvement from the police , and that becomes a race of time in the course of his company sale . His wife knows about it all , as wives do , and blackmails him . His daughter , who works with him , finds out about his con games and threatens him ... That seems to be all the pressure a man needs in life.That should make a good suspense possible , if not a very original case , but the movie fails to interest me . I also see a serious flaw in the plot line : how can the man , Gere 's billionaire , expect to sell the company and not be caught afterwards for the faked numbers ?	-1
I had high hopes for this movie based on some of the other reviews and the fact that I like Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon . Unfortunately , there were few redeeming qualities about this movie and their acting was n't among them.The storyline fell flat , the acting was shallow , and Richard Gere 's character was a total A-hole . Did n't care what happened to him at all . And it turns out that his wife , played by Susan Sarandon , was just as bad . She really did n't care what he did or how he did it as long as he did n't bring his problems `` to their doorstep '' or get their daughter in trouble ( the daughter was the firm 's CFO ) .The entire film felt like a made for TV movie , not a national theater release . Actually , it felt like a Lifetime channel made for TV movie ! The only redeeming character was the young man who begrudgingly helped Gere 's character . He was the only one who had a heart and deserved leniency . He and maybe Gere 's daughter.The kicker for me though , was that the movie was so poorly done that they put Susan Sarandon in a cheap prom-like gown to go to a charity ball . Now , keep in mind that Sarandon and Gere 's characters are multi-millionaires in their mid-50s . So why in the world would she be in an ill-fitting ugly cheap dress that looked like a 1980s prom gown ? Why do I care about the dress ? Because it just highlighted the fact that the writers and directors did not pay attention to small details that would have made this film more believable and more worth watching . As it is , Arbitrage was a thrill-less drama with a stupid ending that should have left me wondering what would happen to Gere 's character . Instead , I was left wondering why in the world I wasted my time and money on this ridiculous movie .	-1
We did not think this was Gere 's career-high . Sarandon , usually wonderful , did n't have enough to do and appeared to phone this in . Big waste of money - do n't fall for the great reviews .	-1
Intended as an indictment of the one-percenters , but falling completely flat due to a lifeless script that has been done more times than Pamela Anderson has been mounted.Always affable Richard Gere plays Robert Miller , investment fund guru and billionaire . A power player on The Street with the grandiose nickname of 'The Oracle ' , given in response to his ability to forecast trends and seeing opportunities that the average manager did not . A man who is respected by his peers , adored by his investors , and loved by his family . He has it all . And as we get past the glossy introduction scenes , the dark and ugly revelations are quick and decidedly unremarkable.Unsurprisingly , Bob is a lying philanderer abusing the love of a good wife ; a corrupt businessman who has manipulated and leveraged his company 's assets into a wholly illegal and monstrously devastating position . And a self-absorbed narcissist who , when pushed , reveals his twisted inner essence . In a nutshell - evil dressed in a power suit and handsome frame.Yes , we get it . The one-percenters are moral frauds and ethical failures.Not a particular fresh revelation.And based on the brief revolting experiences I had scoping out various published society pages of Gotham , Malibu , Bean Town and the Potomac palaces - almost certainly an accurate portrait of most of the upper echelon and their stunning disconnect from us , the remaining 99 % . Only $ 2 million dollars indeed.But an entire film restating the obvious is n't particularly creative or enjoyable.A production made worse with the stunningly linear role of the oh-so-tragic figure of Mrs. Ellen Miller , played by Susan Sarandon . Ah yes , she of the steadfast homefront , withstanding her partner 's past indiscretions , supporting his weakness - loving the man for all his foibles and shortcomings until finally discovering who she had really married . And in a final & eacute ; worthy of a Lifetime Channel flick - a karmic resetting of the scales by delivering societal goodness under a false banner of generosity . Cut to the award scene where she delivers slow perfunctory claps from a sitting position while everyone else is standing and cheering in admiration.Depressingly predictable.The sole presence that I found even mildly engaging was Stuart Margolin as Miller 's personal attorney . I have very fond memories of the character actor as the persecuted neurotic goof from a multitude of comedies during the 70 's and 80 's . Screening him some forty years later as a calculating thousand-dollar-an-hour legal eagle was surprisingly enjoyable . But noting his wonderful performance was like noting a sweet cherry on top of a bored moose 's steaming dung pile.I would love to say that there was something here worth spending entertainment funds or precious time out of one 's life - but after thirty or so minutes I started to press the FF every few frames ; skipping over ground that , quite frankly , started to put me to sleep . Literally.Destined for the OWN Channel 's rotation.Movie Note : - In all honesty , to get a better sense of these people and their lives , I would strongly suggest watching `` Margin Call '' from 2011 .	-1
Richard Gere is the best part of this film . In it he plays a billionaire who stands to lose everything because of a bad deal with a copper mine and so the lies come out as things go from bad to worse.Unfortunately most of the plot points were overly predictable but fortunately the performances were delivered better.Susan Sarandon plays the wife of Gere and you can tell early on that the couple is disconnected one . Also starring Tim Roth as a police detective.A message of rich people getting away with it but it lacked any depth or twist or anything remotely interesting enough to push it above average . Also , you had Gere and Sarandon and that was the best you could do with them ? The budget for this picture was not listed ( always suspicious and likely that means a loss ) and it made a bit over $ 22M at the Box Office.STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING : C to C plus ; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE : C plus to B minus ; SOUND/MUSIC : B minus ; CINEMATOGRAPHY : B minus ; MORALITY FOCUSES/MESSAGE : C to C plus ; OVERALL GRADE : C plus ; WHEN WATCHED : early January 2013 .	-1
This was not a good role for Richard Gere . He has made movies I have enjoyed . `` Unfaithful '' for example . Mr. Gere just was n't believable as a tough arbitrager . The plot was about as exciting as watching paint dry . I fell asleep twice , the car crash woke me up once . The second time was when my dog wanted to go outside . I gave it 2 stars for the scenery .	-1
Richard Gere , Susan Sarandon , what could go wrong ? The ending , that 's what . Folks could rate this movie 1-5 stars based on their likes , interests , their taste in `` film '' , blah , blah , blah . It held my attention , it was mildly tense throughout the movie , but the end feels like rape . Rape of my time and attention . Only one time in my life have I taken note of a director ... that was M. Night Shyamalan . Sixth Sense was amazing and all my years of critiques , editing , writing , and reading , that one movie was one that caught me entirely unprepared , but satisfied . But then , his constant and consistent failure since has convinced me to avoid anything he participates in . Now , for the second time in my long life , a director has caught my attention . Nicholas Jarecki for Arbitrage . Should his name ever come to my attention again I will avoid the product related to him . All my life I 've studied writing , editing , entertaining in creative forms as a matter of a love for it . Stephen King , very well loved , does n't cross my desk after years of horrible `` non '' endings . I 'm inclined to writers like Dean Koontz and J. Michael Straczynski ... people who appreciate their audiences and do n't play idiocy with them . They have the guts to write a climax that leads to a sensible conclusion that satisfies the consumer . If you think `` Highly praised '' aka `` art '' or `` artistic '' is `` just wonderful '' , then waste your life watching movies like this one . Better still , find a foreign film where you can read the closed captions and miss the acting for your entertainment ... personally , I would prefer a book if I have to read . You have to take this review based on its title , Instant Review ... I rarely get upset unless my valuable time is infringed upon . If you do n't mind being moderately entertained for around 100 minutes and then going to the bathroom and missing the whole climax and conclusion , you 'll like this film . I ca n't give zero stars , one star would insult the 95 or so minutes of great acting and tension you 'd expect from 'drama ' . So two stars with the warning , 100 minutes are YOUR minutes and you deserve to enjoy all of those minute , not 95 % of them .	-1
I love Gere in almost everything he has ever done , this would be my exception.I found this movie very confusing and boring . There is too much going on and too many sub-plots.Tim Roth was annoying as the dogged detective.My favorite character is the young black man , played by Nate Parker , who helps Gere ; he had the only part I believed.Susan Sarandon was almost invisible ; if she spoke 10 lines throughout that was a lot . And she 's such a good actress.Brit Marling , playing the daughter , was an Ivanka Trump wannabe without the intelligence , beauty and sense of style and humor . Bad choice.I would be astounded if Gere got an Oscar nom for this as people who are interviewing him are all saying . He seems humble and probably knowsbest that this was no stellar performance of his.Do n't waste your money , as I did .	-1
I thought it would be like most of his movies ; action-packed and fast-moving with a lot complicated scenes to figure out . I was very disappointed . The concept would have been ideal but the movies started too slow for me so I move on to another more interesting movie .	-1
This film is a big waste of talent . Richard Gere at 60 still is charming and has a great hair cut . Poor Susan Sarandon did n't do so well . Somehow they managed to make her look fat and unattractive . The others are uninteresting . Some attractive but boring blond girl plays their daughter . You 'd think a child of theirs would have some personality but no . There 's a detective who does a bad Columbo impersonation . I 'm ashamed that I sat through the whole thing . I kept watching just to see how the guy 's troubles would end up and then ... .it was over ! What happened to him ? Frankly I did n't care much .	-1
I kind of lived this life so I hated this movie although I like Richard Gere . Reminded me too much of the arrogance and selfishness of this kind of man and of the woman willing to go along with it .	-1
This is a very watchable film and it held my interest throughout . Richard Gere , Susan Sarandon and the rest of the excellent supporting cast are what makes this film go . This is a financial thriller right out of today 's headlines . Richard Gere is a financial magnate who has made a large and unwise investment that has threatened to take his firm down . He is groping for a financial lifeline , and therein lies this interesting story . This is a thinking-person 's film , but it tells the story very well.The problem with the film in my opinion is the unsympathetic nature of most of the characters . Gere comes across as an unlikable hypocrite and his wife is no better . The rest of the characters are swept up in Gere 's amoral and immoral schemes , and somehow mostly come across as unsympathetic saps . Well , that was my take on it ; yours may be different . Despite this flaw , this is an entertaining film that is worth watching . RJB .	-1
Ending ruined the whole movie . What was that ? It 's like they got bored with their own story and just gave up . Bummer .	-1
( SPOILERS ) Feel as if I 've seen a variation of this character so many times in film , super rich , caucasian , male , and still do not understand him ... perhaps I never will . Loved the actors , but the story ... nothing new , why tell it . Not to rag on the filmmakers , in the commentary the gentleman explained it took him forever to be allowed to direct . But why this story . Does every well off male character of a certain age have to have a mistress 20-30 years his junior and be a scum bag ( lying to wife , cheating investors ) , ugh . Such an unflattering picture . I still do not understand what made him tick . Maybe I 'd need to be male to understand what drives him ; as a woman , I 'm sorry to say , he makes no sense to me ( I may just be too slow , honestly ) . Basically , in my opinion , the character in this film is presented as a successful , powerful businessman , but it is also clearly shown in the story that he is a criminal just smart enough to manipulate the system ( legal system , capitalist system ) , to stay a step ahead of the authorities . How is living your life a lie equal to success . To me , the character was a liar , a cheat , and a criminal ; and as he chose to live his life the way he did , he seems stupid , not smart . But almost all the characters surrounding him either ignore his shortcomings ( his wife ) , or maybe most just do n't see them . His daughter seemed shocked by his revelation of criminal activity , as if she knew nothing about him - it 's not believable that the characters closest to him would know so little about him - he 's not suddenly behaving this way , he 's been behaving this way for a long time . How could his adult children not have a clue to who he is . He 's not a flawless liar - I think his kids were underwritten . Had the writer/director presented the character in a way I could understand , I would give the movie 3 stars , but I am still as confused about this type of fictitious businessman as I 've always been , so I gained no clarity from the film . Also disliked the women characters ; the wife character ( played by Susan Sarandon , a great actress ) displayed no power until the surprise ending , so her sudden power at the end is not set up properly ; and I 'm so tired of seeing stupid women characters as mistresses to some dog who strings them along - ca n't we have a gorgeous mistress dump some jerk and go to school to get her masters degree or Ph.D ; and the daughter had no power in the story , just a title . Basically the Richard Gere character disrespected all the women - how is that attractive to any woman viewer . Anyway , disliked the character Mr. Gere played ( liked his acting , of course ) , and just wanted more from the women characters . Hope the writer/director will try again and do better . Regarding the use of the N word in the story , as a middle-age African American woman , it indicates to me how disrespectful the film business treats minorities with less financial power - the film business has a lot of powerful Jewish people , I very rarely hear Jewish racial slurs in the movies I see , but I often hear the N word - racial slurs should n't be in film stories unless they are sprinkled throughout for all the races , which they never are . Just a thought to the film maker for future projects . Maybe he 'll think about it . For instance , whatever his ethnicity is , how would he feel viewing films that lobbed racial insults at his group , at his ancestors . There are alot of different people in an audience - not just the people financing films , all races view them . I think we need to move abit closer to the concept of world film , i.e. , respecting all life and thinking long and hard before inserting insulting racial slurs in film . Ca n't hurt and it may help .	-1
Well-known cast with a story-line that was just average . Did not really hold your interest in that most of the outcome was rather predictable . Felt more like a TV movie . Worth watching but just not outstanding . Susan Sarandon 's role was rather limited in scope .	-1
I was skeptical going into this movie . Nothing really good can come out of Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere when they want to `` denounce '' corporate greed . Everything was clich & eacute ; in this movie . Down to the donation of 2 millions to a cancer research foundation , that will be used to make the doctors more rich and famous for nothing . They will use the funds to have `` meetings '' in exotic places in order to `` share the information '' ( I have n't seen a scientific meeting downtown Detroit in a while ) . They will use the money to have big dinners and share big awards between them and patting themselves on the back . No drug that will cure a real disease will ever come out from these big donations and galas . In spite of this , people still believe that they are doing the right thing by donating money to these foundations . What a waste ! The plot is somehow complicated and we are not getting a real answer because the movie just ends ! Robert Miller ( Gere ) is a hedge-fund magnate ( immediately you think he is the bad evil guy who deserves to die ! ) who has manipulated the books because of a bad investment ( where else , in Russia ) that cost him 420 millions . He wants to unload his company for approximately the same amount of money to replace the money before somebody checks the books ( I guess he thinks that somebody who spends this kind of money , will not check the books first for accuracy , ... but that is another story ) . One night while driving with his mistress he falls asleep and gets into an accident . She dies and he tries to cover up.Taking lessons of ethics and behavior in life from Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon it is quite amazing . I knew immediately even before the movie started that their goal was to denounce corporate greed and arrogant behavior . They did n't succeed in their goal since his mistress is not portrayed as a great person and we do n't know much about her , just that she is of French origin . His wife is a cold selfish person that nobody should care about , and he is not greedy , he is just trying to cover for a mistake . They did n't want to make a real thriller or a mystery movie . They could have taken that route . That would have been a much better film . But they decided to make a ( bad ) propaganda movie . Just another complaint about people with money . But wait : are n't they also arrogant millionaires that give their money to hedge-fund managers to make more money ? And when I watched the extras I saw a patronizing Sarandon and a serious Gere lecturing us about the problems of the world and what is ethical or not . What a bunch of pretentious hypocrites ! Richard Gere performance is the same as in `` Pretty Woman '' or `` an Officer and a Gentleman '' . Average , nothing special . When I heard rumors of him going for the Oscars this year against Daniel-Day Lewis in `` Lincoln '' it made me vomit . This film was already nominated for the Golden Globe which is a prelude to the Oscars . The only reason they will give him an award for this pathetic performance in this pathetic movie , is because everything is rigged in Hollywood and they want to promote their anti-Wall Street propaganda . Really do n't understand why the Hollywood people will bite the hand that feeds them . I do n't think that the average Joe buys their propaganda : `` white collar corruption '' , `` corporate greed '' , `` fair share ... fair share '' ... blah , blah , blah . These are clich & eacute ; sentences that only minimum educated people ( ... like the occupy Wall Street moronic crowd ) believe . This is totally illogical . Nothing in this film deserves even the mention of an award . And please people , get Susan Sarandon some decent clothes . She was dressed with rags like a homeless person throughout the movie . In contrast , Brit Marling was very classy ( we can tell that she already worked on Wall Street ) but Susan Sarandon ... was really very casual ( to say the least ) for a hedge-fund magnate wife.The only bright moments in this movie are the performances of Jimmy ( Nate Parker ) and of Detective Bryar ( Tim Roth ) . Great acting and really great presence . But still , trying to manipulate a picture and make up a poorly pixilated license plate was really cheap and sad . Anybody can do much better these days with a computer ! Two stars only for Nate Parker 's performance that really saves the film from the abyss where it really belongs together with the entire pathetic script .	-1
annoying . 1 yr old did not like it compared to other shows like curious george and bubble guppies ... . .	-1
WHY am I paying to watch commercials both before & after the show ? ! Iam NOT going to continue paying for these shows with commercials ! I have a very limited amount of internet and these stupid commercials take up a valued portion ! STOP MAKING US PAY FOR COMMERICIALS ! ! ! !	-1
I am very upset with amazon . I bought this and was unable to view it on my amazon fire . I tried contacting them 3 times nothing was resolved and I did not get my money back . Finally I tried my computer it worked but I did not buy it to watch on my computer . Now I hesitate to buy videos from axon knowing they may not be playable on my amazon fire	-1
This show is one of the best Bones has produced , but I have to complain that I bought this video for my library and it came with commercials for the channel that airs it . What ? ? ? I should n't have to watch commercials on videos I bought . That is so incredibly LOW . This is my last purchase for a wonderful show on a terrible channel . It starts AND ends with commercials . If you can figure out a way to strip them out , please share .	-1
I like `` Bones '' . I watch it on Amazon since I do n't have cable . The characters are great and i like the way they interact and even when a show story might be weak I just enjoy the conversations . The actors do a great job of portraying their characters . So why did I give this weeks show a 2 ? Mainly because Hodgens unequivocally states that 911 was not a conspiracy . There is no way if Hodgens really existed that he would n't at least keep his mind open . This is a political statement that the viewers are supposed to gobble up . Nobody wants to believe the truth .	-1
Seriously . We buy these to avoid commercials if fox continues this we will stop buying these videos . Want to test us ? Keep the commercials and watch your revenue fall.Update 4/2/2013Since Fox has refused to stop the commercials I have cancelled this season and will not buy any more seasons of Bones . If this persists I will subsequently start cancelling / not renew all of my Fox shows . There are plenty of providers who do n't put commercials in videos I pay for so I will not stand for having commercials impressed upon me .	-1
I 'd hoped that in addition to interviews with knuckleball pitchers , the DVD would also show pitches in slow-motion , from angles that allowed one to clearly see how the ball behaves on the way to the plate . Also some description of the physics involved , and an explanation of why there are so few knuckleball pitchers . Did n't happen .	-1
It sucked as a movie . The sound was scratching in spots well a lot of spots but I do n't think that is Amazons fault . Withing minute from the start you knew the entire movie before it happened .	-1
hahahahahhahhaah this movie is EXACTLY like it 's name ... H-O-L-L-O-W ... Oh gosh , this was bad , really bad ! Save yourself ; do n't even think about pushing play . Ha !	-1
Let me clarify this from the get-go : I 'm not one of those reviewers who seeks to kick the stuffing out of ` found footage ' films . All you need to do is peruse the reviews I 've done here at Amazon or elsewhere to know that I 'm entirely accepting of this sub-genre . I 'd go so far to say that I enjoy them quite a bit so long as there is some quality story , development , and characters at the heart of whatever footage the producers allege to have found . Granted , I do believe these flicks work best as horror upstarts , but that does n't mean I wo n't appreciate a few dramatic turns here and there , and , to its credit , HOLLOW thinks it knows what it 's doing in presenting four young folks - two couples , basically - enjoying a weekend outing in some romantic and spooky setting . Unfortunately , HOLLOW should 've known better . ( NOTE : The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of characters and plot . If you 're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free , then I 'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment . If , however , you 're accepting of a few modest hints at ` things to come , ' then read on ... ) There 's a tree on a hill in the middle of a small remote village that - rumor had it - has been haunted by a local legend ... for , in the hollow of this massive , somewhat disfiguring tree , there lives a dark spirit that seeks out young lovers in the midst of some relationship strife and convinces them to commit suicide.Now , if you stop right there , I 'd argue you have the makings of a possibly mystical thriller . You have all the right elements - an evil place , an evil spirit , and an evil cause - that coulda , woulda , shoulda made for a nice picture.Unfortunately , then they made the film.Emma , a/k/a ` the innocent one ' ( played by the lovely Emily Plumtree ) , and Scott , a/k/a ` the alpha male ' ( Matt Stokoe ) , long for a weekend away from it all ; and , hoping to share it with a few friends , they invite James , a/k/a ` the jilted ex with a troubled past ' ( Sam Stockman ) , and Lynne , a/k/a ` the slutty one ' ( Jessica Ellerby ) , to join them . Emma 's grandfather - the pastor for a small , country village - recently passed away , and they 're heading there to make use of the premises , despite the fact that it has no electricity . Once there , they find themselves all equally creeped out by the legendary tree of local lore , and , before their weekend getaway is over , they may find out just how real and deadly folklore can be.Some ` found footage films ' clearly give ` found footage films ' a bad name , and HOLLOW is part of that growing group of flicks made clearly to capitalize on a sub-genre but not provided enough spine upon which to build a perfect body . In fact , all there is to HOLLOW is its twist ending - not all that big of a twist , and certainly one you can see coming from ten miles away . These characters are n't given any legitimate depth - though I 've read some reviewers who think the introduction of relationships and faithlessness accounts to ` character development ' ( here 's a tip : it does n't ) - and , instead , they 're all archetypes plopped into a ` locked box scenario ' with very little hope of escaping.In that respect , much of HOLLOW works just fine . There 's a benign charm to some elements of the film - the introduction of the local church mythology surrounding the suicide tree , the fact that there exists more than ample evidence to support some paranormal phenomenon in the vicinity , etc . - that work well enough to establish the premise ; however , when writer/director Matthew Holt essentially delivers an ending an audience knew from their very first frame , why bother at all ? Why not , instead , give viewers a legitimate reason to hang around for 90 minutes by creating characters that mean something more than just fitting the stereotype ? These are four relatively self-centered and stupid individuals who one could argue get just what they deserved for being so mind-numbingly self-centered and stupid . Do n't be shocked when they get their comeuppance.Sadly , a sense of ` nothing new here ' pervades so much of HOLLOW.HOLLOW is produced by ( how fitting ? ) Hollow Pictures . DVD distribution is being handled through New Video . As for the technical specifications ... well ... the video looks and sounds about as good as the next ` found footage ' flick , though I 'm alarmed by the increasing use of a camera at night when the characters are running while essentially filming the ground . Sound is good , but the herky-jerky camera work really could 've been improved . Also , there 's an awful lot of turning-the-camera-off ( to save battery near the end ) , but , boy , it 's sure good that they turned the camera on just as something was about to happen ! ( Do n't give me that gobbledy-gook about them `` needing the light , '' either . I did n't just fall off a truck . ) As for the special features , there 's only a two-minute `` story behind the scene '' wherein the director gives you his two cents about how and why they shot the ending the way they did ; it 's interesting , but it ai n't all that special , nor much of a feature.RECOMMENDED only if found footage films are REALLY your thing because , otherwise , I 'd be hard-pressed to see what value one might find in HOLLOW . It is n't that it 's poorly made because , in most instances , the production quality is there . While I would n't agree with some stylistic choices made , I strongly disagree with those who think there 's a winning 90-minute story here because there is n't . At best , it 's a half-hour Twilight Zone episode stretched out into 90 unnecessary minutes . Once you experience the `` engrossing and effective '' ending ( their advertising words , certainly not mine ) , perhaps you 'll agree.In the interests of fairness , I 'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with a DVD screener copy of HOLLOW for the expressed purposes of completing this review .	-1
The & # 34 ; found footage & # 34 ; approach worked as a novelty in The Blair Witch Project . Once was enough . This one appears to imitate that style . We could not enjoy the shaky amateur photography used in such films . For that reason , we watched only ten or fifteen minutes of this one before moving on to something else . In fairness , it may have had some good points , but we did not stay to find them .	-1
Utilizing the increasingly popular `` found footage '' genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation , `` Hollow '' takes a rather slight story and serves up exactly what you might expect . It seems like many absolutely loathed `` Hollow , '' but I think some of those people were expecting a full-on horror show . There is some creepiness , but this presentation does n't show you much of anything that will actually scare you . It tries to get you to jump at jarring noises , that 's the extent of its thrills . Neither particularly good or bad , this is a film with limited ambition or originality . I watched this with a friend , and when the movie ended -- he turned to me and said `` well , that was just what I thought it would be . '' It 's not that either of us hated the film -- far from it -- we simply thought it lacked any real element of surprise . It 's reasonably well made and the actors are appealing enough . It just lacks impact from a plotting standpoint . You 've seen it all before and oftentimes better.Four friends venture to the countryside to a family estate for a weekend . Set in Suffolk , England , the house borders a creepy monastery with a history of driving local youths to suicide . The friends , comprised of two couples , make the best of things with no electricity and increasingly mysterious goings-on . As usual , it does n't occur to anyone to leave until things have progressed too far . As an extra annoyance , they decide to film absolutely everything . Yes , this is one of those movies ! Someone is always holding a camera ! Tension , and even madness , starts to infiltrate the group . Can they work against a curse ? Can they survive a murderer ? Can they stay united ? Just what is out there in the hollow ? And for goodness sake , that 's the best darn camera battery I 've ever seen ! If you want complex mythology to explain the nightmare , it 's never really developed in any depth.For all that , though , `` Hollow '' is surprisingly well acted . What the screenplay lacks in horror , it makes up with some actual character development . The primary quartet are all quite believable . Emily Plumtree , Sam Stockman , Matt Stokoe , and Jessica Ellerby play the four leads . As the stress of the weekend starts to divide them , each turns in a performance that was more convincing that I had anticipated . Seriously , I think they all have the potential to go on to bigger projects . As much as I want to recommend `` Hollow '' for this reason , though , I 'm still unable . The back story is both derivative and only vaguely explored . And in a movie that is trying to ratchet up the tension , this is a fatal mistake . I 'd personally be happy if I never saw another `` found footage '' thriller . Too often , the genre lends itself to sloppy storytelling . Performances at 4 stars , plot at 2 stars , scares at 1 1/2 stars . The DVD/Blu-ray packaging might convince you that this is a horror story , but it 's really a piece about relationships under duress . KGHarris , 2/13 .	-1
Hollow ( Michael Axelgaard , 2011 ) Sometimes , during those brief moments of lucidity when my head clears a little and I can step back from the Netflix Instant queue , I ask myself why it is I continue to watch movies in subgenres that were played out before they even got popular . I never come up with a good answer to the question ( and I 'm never lucid long enough to go digging , really ) . Case in point : the found-footage film , an offpsring of the mockumentary that is , ultimately , an offshoot of the popularity of 1999 's The Blair Witch Project . I 've seen maybe a half-dozen found-footage films I would consider watching a second time ; I 've seen maybe one hundred found footage films overall . Hollow is not only not one of the half-dozen , it 's a movie I would consider using as an instrument of torture were I a guard at the Salt Pit . Pointless , plotless , presumably scriptless nonsense that almost dares the viewer to keep watching to see how much worse things are going to get . Guess what ? The answer is & # 8220 ; a lot & # 8221 ; .Plot : Two couples are on vacation on the English moors . Okay , maybe not moors . But that sound spookier . It 's actually quite dry for England . And maybe not vacation , either ; they 've come to sort out a dead relative 's estate . Dead relative is a priest , and estate is ... an old abbey ? I think it was an old abbey . While they 're on their way there , they pass a big old gnarled tree , and Emma ( Emily Plumtree in her first feature appearance ) relates the story of how the tree is possessed blah blah . Emma , her beau James ( The Task 's Sam Stockman ) , and their pals Lynne ( Get Him to the Greek 's Jessica Ellerby ) and Scott ( Devil 's Pass ' Matt Stokoe & # 8212 ; no relation to the writer , at least I fervently hope not ) , arrive at the old pile and spend a few entirely uninteresting days trying to keep a clich & eacute ; d script afloat ( predictable sexual tension between non-couple pieces , growing obsession with the tree , things that go bump in the night ) before , of course , they must all go confront the tree and find out if it 's really possessed or if the scriptwriters were just ripping off The Blair Witch Project.You get all the usual lowlights from a movie like this , people running around and screaming incoherently , usually off-camera , while something that you never quite get to see is chasing them . Now , I am a big , big fan of not revealing the monster ; the one scene I did n't like in Cloverfield ( and yes , I do realize I am the only person who really liked that movie , shut up about it ) is the one Big Reveal scene at the end that 's there solely to stop the masses complaining that you never get to see the monster . ( Compare with the excellent scene in Val Lewton 's Cat People in Central Park , where you get a few glimpses of shadow at best ; it is a textbook in how to create suspense . ) So when I 'm complaining about it , you know you 've got problems . Much of the problem has to do with the fact that , during the action scenes , we 're not really seeing much of the characters , either ; Axelgaard seems to have decided that the movie would be more suspenseful if you could n't see the characters or the thing chasing them . Not a bad experiment , but he probably should have changed direction once he realized how incredibly stupid it ends up looking . You , too , would be better served by avoiding such . ( zero )	-1
This is one of the worst foreign films of the year in my opinion . Definitely skip it cause there are much better ones out there to be viewed .	-1
Fox accepting this series is a total waste . Another medical drama mixed with espionage and a female lead taking over and stuff ( boring ) , yet I am glad it received a proper series finale .	-1
The concept of the show ... that the doctor has to compromise her principles by doing jobs for the mob to protect her brother just did n't work . I ca n't imagine week after week is not my cup of tea .	-1
actually , the beginning of prom , already shipping water ( why is it that the rest of the planet is unaware of the cool cave paintings , why was there no debate about the wisdom of unleashing an expedition into deep space , with such slight consideration of consequences , why was n't the crew prepped for at least months prior to takeoff , instead of receiving a 15 minute briefing after arrival , and where is the rest of the goddamned crew ? ad nauseum . still , it was about the only coherent segment of the thing , and seemed promising , even after excusing the instantaneous fast forward from cave to space ... a VERY bad sign . when this prick tease of a film was n't straining itself disfigured to `` strand '' in alien elements ( obviously , in order to pull in the same alien fanboys who will never stop insisting this debacle was a perfected meisterwerk ... oh , yes , and to jam theatres with them ) , it was failing incessantly to either develop characters or sustain logic . already forced to forgive a lame beginning , i was entirely unable to locate a coherent middle or ending of a film that had been ridleyed to death with ( here it comes ) plot holes , and meaningless `` clues '' , a la lindelof . no story , no logic , no thanks . i see he has actually made an emblem of the one serious mar he forced upon bladerunner , which would be the assinine intercalation of the unicorn puzzle dream . once again , deckard 's partner could have shared an interest in them for far too many reasons . `` take that , you vulgarian fools ! '' would be the meaning of that pathetic gesture , so very characteristic of ridley in a snit . fine . take THIS , you pompous twit : i could n't care less where this doomed attempt to force meaning on prom I leads . been lead down that path one too many times . even for an egomaniac , did you really think i would be willing to WAIT for a story to happen , one movie too late ? you keep it .	-1
Like most other reviews here I loved the premiere , but every episode since has just gotten worse.This last episode `` Another Fine Navy Day '' was the worst yet . Seemed to me it was more like a stalling tactic - that the writers did n't know where to take the show - so they just drugged everyone and we have to sit through 45 minutes of stupid hallucinations that simply annoyed me . I found myself fast forewarding through parts I was so disappointed.The writers had better get on the ball with the next episode or risk losing more and more viewers .	-1
Uh ... the `` stuff '' is not moving along very fast ... . I am getting a little bored at all these stalling tactics , get on with it .	-1
Bad show . Not sure why this was made . It is sort of like the book & # 34 ; on the beach & # 34 ; but not good . It was cancelled quick which should tell you all you need to know	-1
WTH Writers ? Are you trying to tank the series ? This was actually a shocker series for me , episode one was a hit , the episodes after are typical but all still pretty good . And then ... . `` Another Fine Navy Day '' . In this episode we take action drama , adrenaline , guy show and cuddle it a little , make some very feminine slow , shocking day time soap opera drama . Maybe to attract more women ? I am not sure , whatever it is , if you follow this with the same kind of trash , you will likely tank this series very quickly . It 's as if the writers took a break and the overly effeminate romance novel day dreaming secretary got to change the pace and twists in the show . Sure it was going in the same direction , it is n't the story exactly that has changed , it is how it is being delivered . This episode was so bad . You were doing so well , do n't do this again , or you will find it hard to get another season .	-1
This episode , stay , is the worst in an at best mediocre series . It is so stupid that the actors seem on the verge of laughing when they say their lines .	-1
If amazon would allow less than one star , this would be one of those films ( film being very loosely , and I mean VERY , used in this review . Yes , I know this was a `` short '' ) .I read this synopsis : A fairy tale for adults about a little boy who has to gain strength and courage , to find his way out of a mysterious place by making the ultimate sacrifice.The synopsis was absolute nonsense and ABSOLUTE BS , designed to get someone to watch this drivel.Yeah , I thought this might be cool to see , considering it was about 20 mins . I was wrong . Incomprehensible , lackluster , disjointed . Just a lame 'crossing over after death ' story . Hard to follow , and contrary to what others have said , I can not imagine how dull and pedantic it could be if the story was 'fleshed out ' . I would place this on the list of `` high school media : the early years '' - if it was imaginative . This `` short '' was short of story , sense , imagination , and anything else that would make it worthwhile to even watch .	-1
The production is beautiful , and the acting is excellent , but the story simply plays out a series of cliches that never add up to make a plot , and by the end , when you realize it was exactly what you both expected it to be and hoped it would not be , this albeit well-made short falls flat .	-1
Looking at other people 's reviews I 'm clearly in a minority . After all , what could possibly be more wholesome than yet another TV series in which the good guys blast away at all & sundry with a never-ending stream of Hollywood rounds ( the sort that keep on coming long after the magazine is empty ... ) ? Best of all , we do n't need to feel even a pinch of remorse because - now this is the Really Good Part , honest - the victims are already dead ! What could be better than that ? ? Needless to say the acting is average , the script is wooden , the plot is essentially non-existent , and the verisimilitude likewise missing in action.But , if you are in need of an effective diet plan then apparently being turned into a zombie is just what you are looking for , because although the series is set in & around Atlanta GA where 86 % of the population is either fat or morbidly obese , everyone in this series is straight out of Central Casting Los Angeles . Realistically this show ought to be about The Waddling Dead but here in TV land being a zombie means you 're pretty darn lean . Not that it matters - gore is gore , blood is blood , and in the end they 're all just targets . Remarkably , whereas in the real world people have to train extensively to manage head shots with any degree of consistency even against static targets , here even kids can make special-forces style shots with total accuracy . No one ever gets hit by blue-on-blue , there 's never a negligent discharge , and the concept of a ricochet is entirely alien.In other words it 's basically boring repetitive mindless violence for the over-two crowd . Presumably the series appeals to couch potatoes who simply have n't anything better to do with their lives . As for me , enough is more than enough . This is tedious and violent rubbish - the mental equivalent of eating junk food . Avoid at all costs .	-1
Every Monday after a new episode , it 's the same old thing . `` can not connect '' Ca n't leave feedback . Ca n't download . It might be easier to just pay for the cable and watch it on AMC , and get rid of Prime , and quit PAYING for episodes that can not be streamed or downloaded on MONDAY .	-1
At the end of Season 2 , the most fascinating heroine appeared . I could n't wait for S3 ! And what did that do ? Strip her of everything fascinating about her and turned her into a broody background victim . BLECK ! ! ! And what did they give us instead ? A whole lot of blood and gore . WHAT A MISSED OPPORTUNITY . I tried to like S3 , but it just got more and more pathetic and I really lost respect for the creators of this show .	-1
This is what we waited for ? What a major disappointment ! This is one chapter you can save your money on and you wont miss a thing	-1
For the first time in a long time , saw and episode that I regretted paying for . And that is a bad thing . I gon na stick with this series for a while , but it 's just not as layered and complex as it used to be.The brilliance of this show is its ability to address & # 34 ; virtue & # 34 ; on a very physical level . I think they have of lost their way in this manner .	-1
Getting into mid-flight , then crashing again . That was season 3.So after the fascinatingly terrible second season we kick off the third season with a bang , the doofi have n't come up with a plan or anything but they 're wandering aimlessly getting by when they find the prison and plan to make that their home due to it 's impenetrable walls . The first half of season 3 is , actually pretty damn enjoyable ! Rick 's team scrambling to get their s*** together was pretty entertaining while Andrea 's encounter with the Governor was pretty interesting . Unlike the second season where the actors sat around a farm and waited for their knuckle-dragging fanboys to shower them with money and praise , this season interesting things actually happen and the 7th Heaven conversations are vastly minimized to bare necessity.Rick 's group was the most entertaining part of the show . A few major characters are unexpectedly killed off in gruesome ways and after one problem is dealt with another pops up . I guess it 's because we 're familiar with these people now that they all have a place in the situation instead of sitting around bored . The acting is still hammy and forced , especially by Rick who does the worst American accent I 've seen in awhile . Apparently American 's grunt all the time . His descent into madness though was nicely done . Carl also steps his game up this season , instead of annoying his parents and me , he has hardened into the situation and his actor does n't play it cutesy or whatever . Short Round also steps his game up when he sees Rick going crazy , so it was nice seeing some development with these characters , lord knows it was long overdue but at least it 's finally here.Then we got the other storyline with the Governor , and it was pretty interesting when you 're first introduced to Woodbury . However a few episodes in this supposed badass Governor seemed to enjoy nothing more then sitting around drinking with Andrea and discussing their feelings , I would n't be too surprised if there 's a scene they left on the cutting floor with both of them reading Cosmopolitan too . His arc is slow and boring , which was a bad call considering the producers want him to be a memorable villain . Basically after his eye 's taken out he becomes a surly douche who is hellbent on destroying Rick and his gang for flimsy reasons , then the last scene you see him in he finally snaps into what we 've been hinted at for an entire season.Andrea is also boring with her token black friend , I got little to no impression that they 're friends , instead they seemed more like survivor acquaintances who at the first sign of shelter start snapping and b***hing at each other like rabid hyenas . Her arc was interesting regarding that she 's one of the main characters in the comic who 's still around . In the show , she goes to Woodbury , sleeps with the governor , wonders if he has some screws loose when she finds his human heads collection , tries to resolve the tensions between groups , then gets killed . Wow . I mean , half the season was dedicated to this sole character who slowly pieces together for 12 episodes `` governor ... BAD ! `` , and then abruptly dies . I mean the surprise was nice but what a waste of time that ends up being watching this expendable character sit around , drink , and wonder if something 's wrong.Michonne , like a malignant tumor , grew on me . At first she just glared at everyone/everything and clutch onto her unbreakable katana afraid everyone will take it . However once I got endless vapid dialogue with the other characters comparing periods her silence became welcoming to me , and I ended up liking her by the end of the season . Merle also comes back this season , but he basically just plays governor 's lackey until he 's betrayed , then turns into angsty jerk that no one likes . Like Michonne however , he was pretty straight-forward and not too talky which worked fine for me , also Michael Rooker is a great actor so he brought some dimension to Merle 's character.So after the midseason finale when the governor 's pissed off and Rick 's going crazier , the show kind of just stops . They could 've excluded the last couple of episodes and still worked . Instead we got many filler episodes , such as Rick running into the black dude from the first episode , and Andrea getting chased by the governor for an entire episode . Why did they even do that ? Why did they bloat out a solid first half into more nothing ? Why do the Walking Dead writers hold so much contempt for their fans ? Why not end this season 12 episodes in or something , keep it lean and solid , or go the extra mile and give the season a clear resolution with the governor/rick 's conflict , and make season 3 a knock-out ? Oh yeah , because AMC does n't care about quality.So season 3 definitely picks up from the soggy turd that was season 2 ( really though there was no where to go but up ) , but flails and crashes after the halfway mark into another bafflingly mishandled season of the walking dead . It looks like the production team blew their entire budget on the first half then slapped a few filler episodes together centered around one character , and called it a day . So instead of this being a solid good season , it 's a few good episodes , followed by nothing , followed by a giant middle finger , followed by credits . Really though , they promised for the finale 27 deaths , then it turns out that almost all of them were unimportant stock characters shot off screen . I 'll give the writers this , they 're intune with their fans pleads for mercy . They hated Lori , she died . They hated Andrea , she died.So all in all it concludes into a mildly diverting tv show , but it 's never really scary , exciting , or engaging . The zombie apocalypse is still poorly shown and instead of a grittier more realistic survivalism story we still see characters sit around not doing too much . The gun handling in this is still laughably bad and the pacing gets progressively more sluggish as the season shambles along . Really though I 've long given up higher expectations for this show , the fact that thousands of fans showered this season with praise before they even finished it ( finale date - 3/31/13 ) shows that TWD fans are , still , gullible morons who see nothing wrong with paying $ 40 for another half assed season.P.S . Nice 5 star reviews that are 2 vague sentences of praise written by many people who have only reviewed The Walking Dead Season 3 . F***ing viral marketing , how does that work ?	-1
I believe I was looking for another movie title and was n't sure what a friend of mine was watching . This definitely was not the movie I wanted to watch .	-1
I have to admit when I first started watching this show I was prepared to dislike it intensely . I 'm not a huge zombie fan to begin with , too much grossness what with falling body parts and their predeliction to snacking on the living plus the screaming just does n't usually make for the kind of entertainment I enjoy . But the Walking Dead Season 1 charmed me enough with it 's believable , intriguing characters and end of the world as we know it depiction to get into watching it . And I found myself enjoying it immensely even though I had to hold a pillow in my lap to block out the more squeem-inducing moments . ( If you 've seen the show you know what I 'm talking about ) Season 2 was equally great , more so since now we knew the characters enough to care about their fates and/or even be annoyed by some while growing to love others . WARNING : SPOILER ALERT HERE - But then when Shane died at the end of Season 2 I thought , `` Uh-oh , am I going to even like Season 3 ? '' Granted while Shane was n't the greatest humanitarian he was THE main source of the internal conflict amongst the group . It made watching the series so worth it for me since I was by turns fascinated , frightened and even sometimes sympathetic of his hoped for role as savior and hero being upstaged repeatedly by his best friend , Rick . It 's enough to drive a man mad and sure enough that 's what happened to Shane and then Rick , every the shining hero put an end to Shane 's life . And sadly the best source of internal conflict on the show too . This left me wondering what Season 3 would bring . I heard about Michonne and that seemed like a good thing . A kickbutt woman with a katana ? How cool will that be , right ? And then Season 3 arrived and with it my feelings of growing ... boredom . Sadly Michonne 's character is taking forever to develop and sorry , but having the actress run around looking angry all the time while not saying much does not endear her to me . I know Michonne 's a strong , silent warrior type , but I do n't know why since she 's just not been given the time and attention her character needs to take it 's place in the overall story . The Governor is also boring since again we know he 's a bad guy who seems charming on the surface , but not really why outside of the usual cliched `` former nobody finds himself in power and aims to keep it that way no matter who he has to mow down along the way '' villian . And the survivors themselves have n't really gained much in the way of new developments either . All of this leads to a not very compelling story to watch and maybe it 's just me , but I find myself having to use the pillow in my lap alot more this season . Even in places where I do n't think we should have to like did we really have to see Hershel 's foot getting cut off ? That coupled with the fact that things just keep getting worse and worse and worse and there 's no real reason to care or goal to be had makes me feel that this story is simply another one of the walking dead , shuffling along with a blank stare on its collective face . And I 'm so jaded by this point I just dance out of the zombie 's way a little bit then do n't even bother with the head shot since it really just is n't anything I 'm interested in dealing with now . For me anyways , this show is dead .	-1

Episode 16 , `` Welcome to the tombs '' , shows us how far this series has sunk , from what used to be hilarious , grisly , suspenseful , and original . Now we have the worst horror-movie cliche , a `` heroine '' who will be fine if she just hurries up , but she takes her time to indulge in maudlin dramatics and gets ... eaten . We do n't care about Andrea anyway , because Laurie Holden 's trout pout is too hard to look at , and her character 's predicaments are all the result of simple stupidity : she just ca n't see that the Governor is a homicidal sociopath , even though it 's obvious to everyone else . We , the audience , keep seeing things before she does , and then we 're supposed to endure her endless obtuseness and still cheer for her ! In this latest example , Andrea is locked and bound in a room with Milton , the Governor 's assistant who is about to die and turn , and then will try to eat Andrea . Milton , still barely alive , urges Andrea to hurry up and use the pliers he left at her feet to free herself , so she can mercy-kill him and escape , before the Governor returns with his strike force . There is every reason here for extreme speed . Death sits across the room from her and the Governor can not be far behind . Never was it more important to keep one 's mind on the task at hand ( freeing oneself ) and get the hell out of dodge . All Andrea has to do is hurry . But she indulges in long , tragic looks , tries to philosophize with Milton , forms dreamily optimistic facial expressions , and thus fritters away the time she needs to survive . So of course , Zombie Milton gets her . But there is no meaning to it , because she LET it happen ! Then we have some more drawn-out tragic posturing when Rick and the gang arrive to find her all bitten open and about to die . Sad music , long stares , reverence . And we 're supposed to see her as the `` Noble Soul who only wanted people to live '' . Walking Dead is starting to get Smallville Disease , where the characters spend all their time bloviating about the Deep Inspiring Meaning of what is happening , but there is no story . Someone needs to reboot this series .	-1
Remember the scene where Carl got shot ? Remember when Rick turned that corner on the horse in the city ? Remember the CDC , the interstate when the herd came through ... ..any scene that Shane was in ? This is no longer that show . If all they 've got is a guy mowing down a crowd with a gun then screw them . Even the Merle situation seemed rushed and contrived.The dynamics that Shane and Dale brought - gone . The interesting path Andrea was on - gone . Now she 's a g-stringed girlfriend - oh wait now she 's dead too . Merle 's great presence and the potential for his character - gone . They brought the cool black guy with the dramatic British theatrical training and the greatest southern accent ever from the first season back just so you could watch him quickly disappear into useless madness and find out that his awesome kid died.All that remains is a lukewarm crowd of people waiting for Rick to give orders - even Daryl - with some moodiness and bitchiness occurring throughout from what 's left of the uninteresting group.The governor - the actor totally unconvincing.All my favorite characters are dead - no longer anticipated the next episode . It 's a dead show as far as I 'm concerned .	-1
This has become a soap opera more for 10 year olds with all their love of horror , blood , and gore . The first season was good , but from the second season on ... it has sunk so low there is no saving it now . I 've cancelled the rest of the season and wo n't be watching any further . What a disappointment for something that could have gone a whole nother way and been really great .	-1
Andrea and Michonne are not that interesting anyway ... and the governor and his group are unlikeable . If they have too many shows focused on this group , they 're going to lose me ... and I was a serious fan !	-1
If you do not have ovaries , you will completely miss any appeal this show has , and I hope you are only watching it to get into the pants of someone with ovaries who happens to be a fan . Completely from the female point of view , this show does nothing more than highlight to the rest of the world that `` men '' in America are nothing more than feminized ideals brought about by our guilt that we are somehow responsible for women not having penises . It is a complete failure even in its attempts mock itself . The actors are all on their way out of the Hollywood meat-grinder and they know it and are not afraid to let the desperation seep into their performances . You 'd just as well watch several Old Navy commercials back to back , at least then you might see some celebs of note .	-1
The show should have only ran 6 seasons . After the sixth season the shows writing and acting seemed forced . The jokes were old , and the show is just terrible . The seventh season was slow , but season 8 was terrible . I am going to stop watching after this season .	-1
The same old same old , another cop show with a so-called best selling author sidekick . This kind of show has been done to death . ANOTHER cop show ? Adding a writer of fiction cop books to the same old same old mix is something new ? It was cute for the first season , all that sexual tension between them , but now that 's over and now the show is slowly dying . It wo n't see another season .	-1
Really loved Castle when it had a layered storyline ( Beckett 's mother , the serial killer , etc ) and when it had connectedness with characters . This season has lost the magic . It 's episodic , contrived and tired . The character chemistry is gone as we see little of Alexis and Castle 's mother and the relationship with Beckett and Castle lacks substance . The one-liners and stories are mostly predictable and the season finale was anti-climatic . And what 's with the cameo appearance of Beckett 's Dad ? We never see the guy and suddenly we are supposed to connect with a moment when she is at a crossroads and meets him for coffee for advice ? Blah . Wishing they would have tied it up neatly a season ago as I 'm finding that I do n't really care what happens now .	-1
Maybe with time the actors will become comfortable with their characters and stop over-acting them . Denis Quaid scowls and growls even when he smiles . I get it , you are a miserable rancher forced into being a miserable sheriff.Chiklis is n't very imposing as a chicago goon in the desert . Full face camera shots of his expressionless face do n't frighten anyone . OH ... .a miserable Havana casino manager now a miserable Vegas casino manager ! The actor who plays Dix needs to decide what voice he is going to use all the time ... ..he sounds like Rich Little doing Denis Quaid ... .or a whining kid . Pick one , please.The brother of the sheriff could disappear and noone would notice . He and the casino chick will finally get it one when Frank and Dean come back .	-1
This series has a very exciting concept , but lacks the acting skill to pull it off . Dennis Quaid has n't got the personality to project a simple man of integrity , the land , traditions , etc . His whole demeanor , and his acting forte , just breathes & # 34 ; complicated & # 34 ; , hinting at mysterious depths and quirks . He should stick to roles that play on his strengths . Not to paint him into a stereotype , but he makes a great trickster , hood , playboy , bad boy . Clint Eastwood he is not . John Wayne he is not . Tom Selleck he is not . Serious miscasting here . Too bad .	-1
My kids used to remark about an old joke that it was old when the dinosaurs roamed the earth . This formula about an aggressive , honest , opinionated sheriff taking on a saloon-keeper in the wild and wooly American West is far from original . It is not well acted , directed or conceived . I expected much better from the cast . One cultural stereotype after another with many murders , jurisdiction challenges , and righteous indignation . How much a relief it would be if life were like that ... .	-1
This show could have been so much better , but since they had to get the characters sooo involved with so many other things , it really took away from the main theme of the show . You should have let Michael Chiklis be a mean and nasty hamster too .	-1
I really wanted this to be a 5 star series but its not . I like both the main actors and had high expectations but have been disappointed at the & # 34 ; tough cowboy & # 34 ; & # 34 ; though mob guy & # 34 ; wooden acting . The set for outside the casino is so bad , even today the Fremont street area is not that shiny ! If you want to watch a really good series about Vegas in the 60 's watch Crime Story & # 8230 ; ..better acting , better sets , better cars & way better music . The series starts in Chicago but moves to Las Vegas after the first 2 seasons .	-1
Now , I 'm going to admit I thought the show was pretty funny when it first came on . But midway through the fist season , the child actors started to get on my nerves , they wernt acting like kids , they were acting like snotty adults . I stopped watching for a while , then I caught a couple reruns on USA Network , the new baby is just awful and annoying . And one thing that bothers me is that they completely ignore the cameras . I know they are n't suppose to act like the cameras are around in a documentary , but its not like a movie theater will allow a camera crew in a movie theater with copyrighted stuff in it ? just come on	-1
I actually stopped watching this show . I was so tired of them trying to shove the gay part down my thought . It was a pretty funny show in the first and second seasons . A friend told me to give this episode a try . This is probably one of the funnier ones in a LONG time . Still this show has tanked a lot .	-1
Riley Keough and Juno Temple star in Jack & Diane which is basically a love story between two young women and disguised as a warewolf story as well . But the whole warewolf storyline was pretty much vacant and nothing , and I mean NOTHING happens in this movie . The writer/director could n't create a full and compelling story , the writing is flat , the acting is only really good from Juno Temple , and the direction is sloppy . And the way Riley Keough looks in this movie is like a young Elvis Presley which is I 'm sure intentional since that is her grandfather for crying out loud ! I just did n't believe the relationship between Jack & Diane , they fall in love way too quickly and I ca n't figure out why they do ? This movie is pointless and I 'm only giving it 2 stars ( way too generous , I know ) because of Temple 's performance .	-1
None of it is Amazons fault , just a real bad movie . Had a good story line they could have done so much more .	-1
Although I 've yet to see the concluding chapter of `` Twilight , '' I ca n't image it would be any worse than this mess . Here we have 2 teen age girls , both with issues who meet , get friendly then bleed , vomit and cough up teeth on each other . I 'm not sure if director Bradley Rust Gray was trying to make a horror film , but the film is horrible.The horror element comes in often as Diane ( Juno Temple , `` The Dark Knight Rises '' ) who also has an identical twin , has nightmares ( which we get to enjoy ) of some sort of monster ( werewolf ? ) I could n't quite figure it out . We see this growth of long hair , blood , teeth and internal organs mixed into the visuals . It never makes sense as to what it is or why she has the dreams.Diane also seems like the needy , fair-weather lesbian , just there for the moment , whereas Jack ( Riley Keogh , `` Magic Mike '' ) is the real deal . Butch in all ways . That 's about it . Just 110 minutes with two sour-faced unlikeable young women . Not funny , not sexy , not interesting , not emotional , not educational . I needed a shower after I watched it ... the warm kind.The Blu ray transfer comes with a 1080p resolution and a 1.85:1 aspect ratio . Shot in 35 mm film , it looks very good on Blu ray . Film grain remains and clarity is good for the most part . Skin tones are spot on as are most of the colors . The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 . The film is dialog centric so the surrounds do n't come into play often . Sometimes with ambient noise but rear channels come alive with the nice soundtrack . Extras include a 10 minute doc about the special effects , an AXS-TV promo , a trailer and other Magnolia features .	-1
Sad attempt at humor . Poor acting to boot . Why is this a popular series ? There is sooo much TV that is good , why does this get good ratings ? ? ! !	-1
This show needs to be cancelled ... it 's not even funny anymore . Ashton is an idiot ... really ca n't stand that guy .	-1
This is the worst season of the series . The first few seasons had me laughing so hard . But this season , everything seems so forced . Penny seems to be more of a miserable lush than previous seasons . The exchanges between Howard and Bernadette are so dull at times . I do n't know what the heck Raj is doing , but watching a full show stacked with tidbits of a texting date ended up putting me to sleep . However , I see the progression of Sheldon 's character with Amy as an interesting story line and see this as taking center stage instead of the Howard and Bernadette snoozefest and the painful Leonard and Lush Amy storylines soon . I wish there was not so much angst in those relationships . It would be funny to see Howard and Bernadette and Leonard and Penny in a competition to see who is the most passionate or romantic couple only to have Sheldon try to join in the competition out of pure competitiveness where he suffers a kiss from Amy for the sake of the cause and make Raj the black horse out of nowhere !	-1
yeah okay so maybe they will eventually tell us what happened out in the woods after the plane crash , but they are taking too long , and in the meantime , the stories are boring and non-existent . I suppose it 's to keep us watching , but it 's disappointing . How did they stay warm , given the fact that they used their last match ? and how did they get food ? What about the pilot- he could n't have stayed strapped in his seat for a week ! and how did they keep Arizona 's leg from bleeding out ? Cristina mentioned once that animals were coming for Lexie , but how did they keep the animals away from her ? I 've loved this show from the beginning , but this season is one HUGE letdown so far . At the very least , they should give us interesting story lines if nothing else . I 'm guessing it 's going to end very badly , like too many good TV shows do.I ca n't stand how they just keep showing us tiny snippets of the crash without any explanations .	-1
Well , the acting is great and the characters are very interesting but it 's one of those shows where the longer I watched it the more I felt as if I were doing something I should n't . I realize there is adultery and there are dirty politics but it just is n't something I want to fill my brain with and call it entertainment .	-1
For all that Sherlock Holmes-type characters are lauded for their deductive abilities , what they 're usually doing is induction , not deduction . Induction is the type of reasoning that goes from the specific to the general , e.g. , he has blood on his sleeve therefore he is the murderer . This sort of reasoning is very unreliable and even the smartest people are wrong more than they 're right . This means that Holmes and his ilk are fundamentally impossible characters , although Doyle 's original is shown as less miraculous than most of the current iterations . The conclusions drawn by the character in this show are absurd .	-1
Too boring for words ... the whole thing fell flat from beginning to end and I amazed I even got to the end or did I ? Forgettable to say the least .	-1
Mundane , pedestrian , intellectually insulting . These are all things that Elementary wishes it could rise to the level of . It is too clearly gimmicky to be effectively a gimmick . A disappointment on every level and an insult to any actual Holmes fans . This so far removed from the greatness of the BBC series Sherlock that I do n't think it deserves to inhabit the same universe . The rest of the world must watch elementary and think it was intended for mentally challenged pre-schoolers . If your IQ is below 95 , this program no doubt keeps you guessing , but then so would Sesame Street . If you like watching Lucy Liu disprove that Asian women are ageless in appearance , tune in . If you want to be entertained , buy paint ... watch it dry .	-1
If you like this show , you must not have read Arthur Conan Doyle 's books , or watched the old Basil Rathbone movies -- which I recommend . I thought this series might be good because it has Lucy Lui . It is just another cop show with a smart cerebral main character . He is just too clever for words . The characters are nothing like Watson and Holmes . Holmes would never try to burn his violin . I would rather watch reruns of Monk . He has his problems , but he is not rude and nasty . Does this Holmes ever take a shower , he looks so grungy !	-1
The actor portraying Holmes is about the most annoying person I have had the unfortunate experience of having to listen to ... if that makes sense.I would rather rather lose toenails , one-at-a-time to Moriarty than listen/watch Holmes .	-1
i really wanted to like this show , and it is just ok . I think they are trying to hard to make sherlock like a bad @ ss hipster guy , and really the main thing i like about the show is Lucy Lu	-1
To me , this episode seems to take everything wrong with Fringe and pack it into one , plodding , tedious and at times , deeply annoying script . Walter Bishop is at his most annoying and boring . Peter and Olivia are weak and ineffective . The big reveal takes so long and , really , in the end , so little is revealed , you just want it to be over . With respect to Walter Bishop 's acid trip ? Trust me , there is nothing more boring than someone else 's acid trip . Walter 's acid trip is no exception . I think Disney should sue them for using a very recognizably disneyesque animated fairy . And then there 's the Monte Python animation sequence.Aimless , drawn out plot developments . Everything that usually makes a Fringe episode exciting or interesting is eliminated . It 's claustrophobic . Absolutely minimal forward plot movement . Forgettable dialogue . No suspense . One scene of pointless and unconvincing violence . Utter absence of interesting supportive characters . Rehash upon rehash . No new ideas - zero . Utter lack of wit or humor . And on and on . And the director seems to take delight in sapping whatever life there is in this sorry script with excruciatingly slow pacing . Everything that can be wrong with a TV episode is wrong with this one . It 's enough to make you dread the next episode . Right now , it looks like the season is going nowhere . Or the show 's creators have no idea what to do with the plot and do n't really seem to care .	-1
How sad . They turned Fringe into a dull invader story . Gone are the fantastic events that required the quirky team of Olivia , Walter , and Peter to make some incredible discovery . Walter is no longer the lovable damaged person he was , and that was 80 % of the draw of the series . I had pre-purchased a season pass but I am now canceling it . For me the series is already over .	-1
I totally loved this show in the first two seasons ... then I sloughed through BORING season 3 ... got better in season 4 , and I started dreading the end of the show this season . The season started out a little boring , but it got better quickly . I put off watching the last 2 episodes because I was dreading the fact that it was going to be over . I waited so long that I was able to watch the last 2 episodes back-to-back , fortunately ! The 2nd to last ep . was amazing , and the last one started out that way , too . But - and I wo n't give anything away , it ended VERY badly . Too many shows end badly , but generally it 's because they did n't know they were going to end . THIS show knew it was ending , and they could have done a much better job of it for sure . IMHO , the last episode ruined the show for me . It was so disappointing that now I do n't even care that the show ended , and that is just sad . It 's better for shows to go out on a high note so that people will miss the show , not be happy it 's over . Shoot .	-1
Hey , guys , I love this show , but I 'm PAYING for it so I wo n't have to watch your stupid ads . FOX , you 've seriously screwed up , in this viewers opinion . Bad . Bad enough that I WILL NOT be spending money for this show again if it has ads .	-1
There should have never been a second season as far as I am concerned . Season one should have ended with and they lived happily everafter just like the fairy tale .	-1
To go along with all this cheesy acting.I did n't think the first season was all that great but I thought it had potential and would pickup so I watched it to the end . I have seen every single last episode of this series to date and I 'm not sure Why I gave it the benefit of the doubt . It goes from `` Okay , to Interesting , to Good , to Terrible , to Great , to Completely Awful '' and that seems to be the episode cycle with this series . The balance of story writing and acting ability is never consistent with this show . Sometimes there 's a really good episode and then one that is a complete flop . It 's as though each episode has a different writer like this is a series of short stories all by different authors . Some time you hate you missed the show and sometimes you wish you did n't waste your time to watch it all . Then complied into that is the acting , and how bad it is . There are maybe but a handful of `` good '' actors on this show and they are all Villians . With the exception of Mulan just about everyone else makes you want to cringe at the way they deliver their lines . It 's as though Uwe Boll is directing this show . The acting is completely all over the place.For starters Seeing less Henry and more story started to make this show seem more promising and then came season 2 . Not only is Henry all over the place but as usual he is the most annoying character on the show . I get it this kids supposed to be a key character but his acting is awful in every scene which makes watching him just make you shake your head and hope the scene ends soon . Whether the writers have him doing some stupid and pointless idea or if he 's just running around town nagging people with the same `` I want to help '' , `` your a story book character '' it just gets old and quick . Why and I mean WHY would you give the worst actor on your show the most screen time ? This kids acting makes Tommy Wiseau look like Kevin Costner ! and I know `` he 's just a kid '' yeah and a terrible actor . I would n't cared much or have said much if they did n't cram this kids in your face every 5 minutes into the show . No matter what the story is as soon as this kid appears it 's ruined . I do n't even understand this kids story . So what if his adoptive mother is an evil witch . She 's nicer than 99.9 % of the mothers out there.Unlike his real mother she did n't abandon him and actually wants to be his mother . I mean think about it she feeds him well , buys him toys to play with , drives him to school , takes him out eat , I mean what the heck . She 's a great mother but this kid ca n't stop complaining about her . For what ? Pampering and spoiling him ? Worse thing she ever did was try to show him how to use magic . If this show stuck to the point and did n't jump back and fourth to this pointless Henry Mills side story it would probably be worth watching . Instead I just find myself looking to spend an hour doing something else before TWD comes on.and by all means do bring the thumbs down . Hate the idea that someone sees this series for what it is . Semi interesting plot trouble by bad writing/acting .	-1
This second season has the characters stuck in Neverland , and it drags on and on.Sorry to say that i lost interest .	-1
THE PARTIES AT the Hamptons are wild - especially at the Graysons . Season One gave us the murder at the engagement party ; now we have a character dragged off to rehab at her mother 's memorial service , the pregnant mother 's swan dive at her baby shower , and the groom 's arrest for murder at his wedding . My favorite character , the unpredictable Nolan Ross , played by Gabriel Mann , is dragged through serious trouble throughout the season.It 's not looking good for him in Season Three either.Seems creator Mike Kelley and producers Mark B. Perry and Marty Bowen decided to opt out of their `` Count of Monte Cristo '' revenge motif and embrace the night time soap opera format - and it also seems there are plenty of people who love it once you count the rave reviews on Amazon . For me , it 's not as good as Season One , where Emily Thorne ( Emily Van Camp ) donned her black hoodie and put the hammer down on those who had wronged her father and ruined their lives . I miss those photos , where she would cross off the guilty with a big red `` X '' after executing a clever payback.Now - surprise ! - Emily has a boyfriend , a hunk she met in Master Takeda 's school for revenge . There was no mention of this in Season One , but we are dealing with soap opera rules now , like is Amanda 's baby Jack 's or the result of a one night stand ? Two major characters get over-the-top death scenes ( where I began to wonder if they would actually die or not . They do . ) Cinematography is excellent again , making the most of beautiful Southampton scenery , gorgeous sets and high fashion style . Madeleine Stowe , playing matriarch Victoria Grayson , wears a fantastic Vera Wang gown in the wedding episode ; the designer is recognized in the end credits , too . Sound is just fine for this dialogue-driven show ; the occasional ambient sound and special effect blends in well.ABC Studios also provides a generous batch of extras for Season Two beginning with three commentaries : executive producers Sunil Nayar and Melissa Loy , and writer/co-executive producer Michael Foley on `` Illusion '' ; executive producer/writer Mark B. Perry , writer/executive story editor Joe Fazzio and actors Nick Wechsler ( Jack ) and Margarita Levieva ( Amanda ) on another , and creator/executive producer/writer Mike Kelley and Emily Van Camp on `` Truth , Part Two . '' The one with Kelley and Van Camp hint at spoilers for Season Three , so be on guard.There are three interesting featurettes : `` Schooled in Revenge , '' that gives us a peek at Master Takeda 's new students in his martial arts school of vengeance ; `` The Sound of Revenge , '' showing how iZLER composes music for the series ; and `` Haute Hamptons : Dressing Miss Davenport '' with costume designer Jill M. Ohanneson again demonstrating how she chooses clothing for the characters , focusing on Ashley Madekwe , who plays Ashley Davenport this time . There are deleted scenes on each disc and the bloopers on Disc 5 are funny again , mostly because it 's a treat to see the so-serious Stowe and Henry Czerny ( Conrad Grayson ) crack upWho knows if the series will return to its thriller format ? Once sucked into soap opera , it 's hard to get out of it . `` Revenge : Season Three '' will premiere on Sept. 29 on ABC. -- Kay Reynolds	-1
Season one was very good . The writers seem to have lost their way . The plot is now incomprehensible . Too bad , but like many shows , it simply ran off the rails . Bizarre .	-1
I 'm always disappointed when a TV show starts out with a fantastic first season and then fizzles in the second . It 's almost like all of the creative energy was used up making the first season and then there 's nothing left . Or maybe they just ran out of things to say . Either way it looks like it 's happening with Revenge and I 'm pretty bummed . Looks like I have to find a new favorite show .	-1
every one has their personality and sticks to it - but are all very moral decent peoplethe good thing if you watch on a regular basis - is that you see the ancillary California communities as the locationsthe best thing was Bradley Whitford 's episode and the next best thing is Morena Baccarin 's episode otherwise I found these episodes to be really horrible .	-1
I ca n't believe I forced myself to finish the first season 's 13 shows . I think it was the fascination of just how terrible this series is in so many ways that it 's amazing and drove me here to write a review . Where to begin ? How about the cast and acting ? Where in h # @ @ ( pun intended ) did they get these actors from - some community college acting class ? Except for Terry O ' , the acting was beyond awful . And so badly cast that it made me laugh out loud several times . Then there 's the writing ; wow , I do n't recall hearing such mundane lines in a long time . Actors walk into a room several times and ask , & # 34 ; What are you doing ? & # 34 ; What are you watching ? & # 34 ; Are you kidding me ? There 's no other way to evoke curiosity ? The sets were so fake , it was fascinating . And if you are going to use CGI badly , do n't use it at all . The plot , at times , held promise , but that quickly disintegrated in a series of laughable twists . Honestly , I got so many laughs from this series , so it was n't a complete waste of time .	-1
Ok so I had to update all of my blu ray players just to get the disc to work . It still wo n't work on my Sony blu ray player . No idea why . I do n't want to spend fifty dollars on it at a store to try a different one when I waited over a week for it to arrive after I preordered it a month early . This is not how I saw my bday gift to my husband going . Thanks for making it a lame gift . So upset !	-1
I started watching this show because Monica Raymund was in the cast and , after watching all three seasons of & # 34 ; Lie to Me & # 34 ; , I think she 's among the most provocatively beautiful , talented , and fascinating actors I 've ever seen , but after watching & # 34 ; Chicago Fire & # 34 ; for most of season 1 , I 've given up because , apart from Raymund 's Gabriela Dawson , for me there simply are no characters in the series who are interesting , likeable , or possible to care about , and more than a few are just plain aggravating - especially Taylor Kinney as the obnoxious Kelly Severide with Jesse Spencer , late of & # 34 ; House & # 34 ; , a pretty close second . This is really just a nighttime soap with the & # 34 ; drama & # 34 ; of fires added to give it what juice it has and that really is n't much . Eamonn Walker as the Chief is quite effective , but Charlie Barnett as Peter Mills is a ridiculous , puppy-like character who acts about 16 . Others , of course , may well feel very differently , but I was very disappointed .	-1
So dark and depressing . Awful because of the rampant promiscuity as well . Your all going to get vd and stds .	-1
I watched this show , right up until Phil 's interview with GQ . How can anyone , ANYONE , claim that African Americans were & # 34 ; happy , happy , happy & # 34 ; under the Jim Crow laws ? How can anyone , ANYONE , be so hateful about people who identify as LGBT ? I will never watch again . Feel free to hate on this review . Just because some people agree with him does n't make it right .	-1
The pilot episode is funny because its audacious and over-the-top redneckery , but shortly thereafter it becomes a droll , uninteresting show about this stupid family of fakes pretending to be beverly hillbilly like backwoodsmen , new to fame and fortune because of a popular duck call , having fun in their hemi trucks and shiny new carharrrrrrt attire . I would have a real problem with the publicly bigotted statements if it were n't simply a pandering to an audience of morbidly obese neckertown walmartians and a false flag of 'any-publicity-even-negative-is-publicity-nonetheless ' as a dubious means to perpetuate a WELL overplayed merchandising campaign at Walmart that is as stupid as the people who buy into it .	-1
poor little millionaires making even more money on the idiots that care about duck dynasty 's daily lives ! reality TV is the worst !	-1
They are wealthy fakes pretending to be good old boys . Cops was an excellent reality show because it was not fake ! Now they make fake junk like this and call it reality , but this has nothing to do with reality . It 's amazing how the sheep suck up this BS . Also , the claim about them being religious is perverted version of religion . The story goes that God created man in his own image . Not in any bible does it say & # 34 ; white & # 34 ; men only , so how can racist bigots like these guys be considered religious ? It 's completely FAKE garbage !	-1
Do not believe all the rave reviews . They 're all from family members and die hard fans who do n't want to see these bird killers go . It 's time to close the curtains on this lame show already .	-1
Do n't waste your time on this movie . The first 40 minutes of it is about stupid kids and their crappy life , parties and other B.S . The rest of it ( until the titles start rolling ) is based on a very bad plot , with unlikable actors , and average special effects made with nowadays available for everybody , programs . The after titles last minute of the movie was without any scare or whatsoever . Do n't believe what the trailer or the cover says . It is NOT ! twice as scary as the first movie . It is far worse ! I was bored through all of it ! Stupid , pathetic , shameless movie ! That is all I have to say . Nice attempt to make money ! Now I would like to get payed for watching this garbage !	-1
Alex and his fellow film school friends receive a mysterious video link that suggests the frightening images from the GRAVE ENCOUNTERS film may have been for real . The group gathers their cameras and heads out to the old insane asylum where the film was originally shot to investigate , only to fall victim to the same insatiable spirits ! GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 shares all of the first film 's weaknesses without finding any of its strengths . At first , it seems like the makers may be parodying the `` found-footage '' genre just as they had done with the popular ghost hunting TV shows from before . By the end of the the first act , however , we come to the frightening realization that the atrocious acting , idiotic characters , and recycled plot points are all being taken seriously . The story borrows generously from Dave Parker 's THE HILLS RUN RED with a touch of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY as John Poliquin and the Vicious Brothers prove to us that they have nothing new to bring to the table in this second installment . The same cheap effects and obnoxious scare tactics are employed once more , but what is the point of using the `` found-footage '' format when the images on screen are exaggerated to such an extreme ? It then becomes impossible to accept any of the footage as being `` authentic , '' thereby destroying the illusion and rendering the film a complete failure . A little subtlety goes a long way , which is a lesson that the makers of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS have yet to learn.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies	-1
Again , let me offer up this defense before I go any further : I 'm not opposed to the whole ` found footage ' phenomenon . As I 've said , I think there 's a spark of brilliance behind every one of these films . If there 's any fault to this entire movement , it 's that too many stories that would be better served and received by being built as a regular feature ( meaning NOT as a found footage vehicle ) are , instead , being done on the fast and the cheap by taking this somewhat easy-way-out . Still , if the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise teaches us anything , it 's that `` if you build it , people will come '' ... so settle in for the long haul , society . It looks like ` found footage ' is here to stay . ( NOTE : The following review may contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters . If you 're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free , then I 'd encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment . If , however , you 're accepting of a few modest hints at ` things to come , ' then read on ... ) I did n't see the original GRAVE ENCOUNTERS , so I 'm only going on what I 've been able to ascertain from some quick reading ; but it looks like that 2011 flick tapped a vein : budgeted on a slick $ 1 million , it at least had legs strong enough to start a franchise , and it 's second installment , GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 , even garnered the embellishment of the Tribeca Film series , so that 's none too shabby . While the first feature explored what happened when the production crew of a ghost-hunting program actually ran afoul of real ghosts , the second tweaked the formula just a bit.Film student and horror enthusiast Alex Wright ( played by Richard Harmon ) believed that GRAVE ENCOUNTERS was a legitimate conspiracy released to audiences . He contends that what happened in the `` film '' was actually a true story , but it was only `` marketed '' as a fictional film in order to get it before the masses . Out to prove his point , he enlists the aid of his fellow classmates to scout out the real location of the original ` encounters ' so that they may probe the condemned psychiatric hospital for true spirits . What he finds brings him face-to-face with some grim truths that might spell doom for those who joined him for such a personal haunting.This horror schlock is brought to you by the same team who did the first outing : the Vicious Brothers . At a glance over on IMDB.com , it would appear this franchise is presently the only thing they have to their name , but , in their defense , there 's enough charm , gore , and inspiration that I would n't be all that surprised to see more from them . Granted , not every stone turned over here is all that original , but there 's a pleasant enough mix of solid performances , predictable developments , and harmless scares that they 're probably destined to do another one , at least , or launch some other screamer on unsuspecting audiences.What I did n't like was the blatant stupidity of so many of these characters . Yes , I realize that a ` working stupidity ' kind of goes hand-in-hand with horror films . But you would think that a group of young film nerds - ones who have made a college career out of mildly sending up the same genre with their own little pet projects - would know best what trips and traps to NOT fall into here . Once they 're deposited in the psychiatric hospital , all of what they knew before seems to vanish quicker than the first virgin ( another horror film staple ) , and that 's sad . If they were so smart , why did n't they plan this all out better ? If they were so creative , why did n't they expect some of what awaited them ? If they truly believed everything in the first film was a legitimate spectral event , why would n't they have gone in better prepared than they did ? I know , I know , I know . It 's a horror film , after all , and that 's what suffices for a horror film in this day and age . Put your brain on ` pause ' and you 're liable to enjoy this one a bit more than I did.GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 is produced by Death Awaits Cinema , Twin Engine Films , and Pink Buffalo Films . The film appeared as part of the Tribeca Film series . DVD distribution is being handled by New Video . As for the technical specifications , much of it looks and sounds solid , though there is some obvious distortion done deliberately due to the nature of the ` found footage film ' phenomenon ; however , I did n't find any of it unusually distracting from the experience , though some muffled audio was tough to hear . Sadly , there 's only a single special feature ; it 's listed as `` An Interview with the Vicious Brothers , '' but it 's essentially a 3-minute blurb about the film - I 'm guessing it was almost what they said when they pitched this idea - and it 's disappointing.RECOMMENDED only for fans of horror and/or found footage films . Outside of the basic storytelling premise - that the Vicious Brothers kinda/sorta intended for this to be ` respected ' as a legitimate found footage flick - there 's nothing new here . As I 've tried to be clear above , it 's kinda/sorta sad that the whole ` found footage phenomenon ' has come full circle to the point now where fully realized stories that may 've been better served by not being filmed this way ( as ` found footage ' ) are still being churned out by an industry that apparently never heard a bad idea . I think GRAVE would 've been better constructed as a traditional horror film - the very ones it thumbs its nose at - but maybe that 's just me . Odds are that , if ` found footage ' is your thing , you might enjoy this one more than I did.In the interests of fairness , I 'm pleased to disclose that the fine folks at New Video provided me with an advance DVD screener of GRAVE ENCOUNTERS 2 for the expressed purpose of completing this review .	-1
( Warning , this review contains some spoilers ) I thought the first would help the producers realize their mistakes and improve on them . Fat chance.The initial shot has people raving about Grave Encounters and going loco about how good or bad it was and how some were convinced it really was real . One such raving fan goes to an alcohol-steeped party and ( eventually ) reveals that he 's a @ # % ^ # @ $ visionary . My thought on that was `` Sure you 're a visionary . I do n't get your vision , though . `` His plan is to provide evidence that Grave Encounters was the true deal . Problem is ... his obsession with the `` proof '' leads to problems with his girlfriend , friends , and , really , his whole life situation it seems . Between his own filmmaking ( you 're given snippets of his film , which is nothing but predictable shot after predictable shot ) and finding what he needs , he 's really letting himself loose on his psychosis.Just like in the first film , this goes to show you NEED to know how to make your ghost effects realistic . There was one singular shot where a creepy ghost did send chills down my spine . Then the ghost moved . End of the fear and the beginning of my eyes rolling.If there 's anything I can say this movie did that did get my interest , it was the use of multiple types of cameras ( iPhone , professional camera , B/W silent-era camera , etc . ) to tell the story from different types of angles and get a sense of realism.The other was the return of a certain character from the first movie . Out of all the actors in this movie , his was hands-down the most believable . Pure craziness , from the shocking reveal to his last moment.Unfortunately , afterwards , it 's all hedonism at its most horrorific . And it quickly got as disinteresting , bland , 1-dimensional , lackluster boring as it had been . Even when a cleaning lady is passing by the ghost hunting team , I 'm quite certain the team did n't notice the look she gave them , which tipped off that something was going to happen . Before the elevator doors opened , I ( unfortunately again ) could predict what would happen . It defied physics , but it could n't defy predictability ? When will filmmakers today learn ? Overall , despite the nice maneuver of using multiple cameras to some advantage and one character being believably looney , I only give this 1/5 .	-1
Grave Encounters 2 is a found-footage film that follows Alex , an aspiring filmmaker ; Alex , who recently posted a negative review for `` Grave Encounters '' , begins to receive eerie messages that have him questioning the original film 's authenticity . Alex eventually believes the film is real , and convinces his friends to travel with him to the Grave Encounters ' shooting location , a mental hospital , to get proof . Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept , but lacks the essential horror elements ( terror , suspense , atmosphere , etc . ) The story in Grave Encounters 2 is interesting ; I know this concept has been done before , but it 's not something that 's been overdone , so I was genuinely interested . The execution , however , was poor . The film uses the first 30 minutes or so to build up the mystery and introduce/develop the characters . A horror film with build-up and characters ? Great ! However , the build-up/mystery in this film is very dull since it lacks suspense and creepiness , and the characters are n't actually deep , despite spending a third of the film learning about them- we see the surface of the characters , and they 're irritable and illogical . So , the first act of the film is basically useless backstory that could 've been told more efficiently.The rest of the film takes place in the mental hospital . Again , the tension is absent throughout the film ; this makes the jump-scares ineffective , except for 1 or 2 . Most of the film is the group walking into a room , seeing something paranormal and being chased out ; running from room to room , you 'd think you were watching an episode of Scooby Doo . I wo n't spoil the final third of the film , but it 's actually somewhat decent ; the explanation is twisted and somewhat unique ; I 'm sure there are a few hardcore Grave Encounter fans that will enjoy it . I 'm not saying it 's the greatest finale , but it adds to the dull atmosphere/tone of this film . My final complaint for the movie overall : the poor use of an immensely creepy and haunting setting- the opportunity to build a dreadful atmosphere is completely missed , and the setting is basically ignored . The acting was mostly good , occasionally some of the dialogue would feel forced and there was some overacting.Overall , Grave Encounters 2 has an interesting concept and a decent final act . But , most of the film is uneventful , boring , and uninspired ; the tension is absent , the jump-scares are ineffective , and poorly uses , actually , completely forgets about it 's setting . Barely enough to warrant 2 stars , I recommend a rental for horror fans . As of 2/23/13 , this film is available on Netflix Streaming.Grave Encounters 2 has strong violence and blood .	-1
If you loved The Vicious Brothers and their film `` Grave Encounters , '' they 're hoping you 'll flock to buy the next chapter of their horror saga creatively titled `` Grave Encounters 2 . '' Utilizing the increasingly popular `` found footage '' genre that combines elements of the thriller into a faux documentary presentation , `` Grave Encounters '' was a reasonably effective ( if not spectacularly original ) entry into the horror arena . It does seem that every low budget scary movie of late thinks that this is the go-to genre of filmmaking , so it 's becoming more difficult to distinguish inventive works from the overcrowded pack . This sequel employs the same device to carry out the story . And it is just so tired already ! But as long as the movie has something fresh to offer , found footage can still make for a thrilling visceral experience . I may not have hated `` Grave Encounters 2 '' as much as some -- but after a reasonably promising set-up , the film seemed to implode on itself with a lunatic ( and ill conceived ) final act.The movie takes place roughly two years after the events of the first movie . A film student ( Richard Harmon ) is obsessed with the footage of the first film and decides to see if the events depicted were real or not . As any remarkably sane person would do , he assembles some friends to break into the psychiatric hospital represented two years prior . Even if everything is real ( which he believes ) , his knowledge of the place and its monsters should provide plenty of clues for survival . There is n't much more to tell without revealing spoilers . I 'll just say that the introduction ( which takes a VERY LONG time ) is handled well enough , but a major twist in the hospital kind of derails the franchise . Very little makes sense after this revelation and the film just gets loopier by the second , and not in a particularly good way.I liked that there is a distinct connection to the first film . Here , The Vicious Brothers made a smart decision . This movie presupposes that you 've seen the original . Although you can certainly watch this as a stand alone , the finale will lose some of its impact . But maybe that 's a good thing as I really thought that this was the weakest point in the series so far . If you remember the stylistic differences between `` Blair Witch '' and its abysmal sequel , some of the same mistakes were made here . It 's almost too meta , too referential to the original and so it loses a unique voice of its own . And with the choices made in the conclusion , it defies the logic of the first picture and this is always something that irritates me . KGHarris , 3/13 .	-1
I absolutely loved GRAVE ENCOUNTERS . I would place it high in the ranks of my films that came out the year it was released and include it in my list of top notch horror films of all times . For me it hit every note exactly right . Not so with the follow up film which fails more often than it succeeds , the usual problem with most sequels.If you have n't seen the original it revolves around a ghost hunters ' type program that we find is more staged than reality . In that film the terror rises when they discover that the ghost are indeed real and that they prevent the crew from ever leaving unless they 're placed in a body bag . It offered some truly scary moments and a general sense of unease that prevailed from start to finish.The reason for its failure can be seen in the majority of the opening sequence which takes up perhaps the first half of the film . Instead of a professional crew we have a student film maker who along with his friends spends most of his time getting drunk and trying to have sex . When he begins to look into the disappearance of the original crew he eventually talks his group into seeking out the abandoned hospital and investigating it on their own . The problem is that the majority of film time here involves them partying and swearing like sailors as opposed to furthering the story along . The whole opening segment feels like wasted film and time and something to just fill out the story instead of add to it.When the group finally gets to the hospital they 're confronted by a guard who prevents them from entering . But this is a determined group and they eventually find their way in . When the guard enters to pull them out things begin to happen starting with the guard 's death . Frightened and unable to leave , the group searches for a way out just like their predecessors did . It 's not until later in the film that they stumble across the sole survivor of the original film , the host of the show , who has been trapped here for years . Can they escape with his help even though he has n't been able to all this time ? That 's the sort of stupid question that comes up in this film . The scares that we see are this time around more predictable than the first time even though there are some creepy moments to be seen . But the sense of discovery found the first time around is lacking this time and the whole initial sequences do nothing but make you want to reach for the fast forward button rather than wait until something happens.I do n't think I can even give this film an A for effort since it seems like so little effort went into making this a good picture . It feels like someone realized they had a cult hit on their hands and decided to keep the ball rolling rather than take the time to add something to the story . Sure the part with the old host adds something but at the sake of dead air time ( no pun intended ) prior it is n't worth it . Sorry but I ca n't recommend this movie to anyone , including fans of the first film .	-1
First season was a nice , somewhat innocent , and enjoyable fish outta water story ; but the second season is just about characters bed hopping and using each other .	-1
This movie is really bad . Not funny in the least . A total waste of time . So sorry I rented it .	-1
Extremely poorly written . I found the jokes more disturbing then sad as the movie progressed . This is a very adult film , not something any age kid should be watching . From the hardcore porn playing in the backround , to the full frontal nudity . Somehow watching a old guy getting blown up with all the kids watching was supposed to be funny.I found my self feeling bad for the kids being in a film like this.They take the shock value we see in movies like , wedding crashers oldschool and dodgeball . Then they put it in a movie with a bunch of little kids . Instead of adding in some funny inendo , or word plays , like the other films . They show hardcore porn , nudity , and really disturbing behavior.There is a line between funny , and WTF . They stayed firmly on the WTF side the entire film .	-1
This film raises serious questions , such as should I give my copy away or throw it out ? Randy ( Patton Oswalt ) is determined to take a group of boys on a scouting trip . He persuades the kids with a corny scout video to the dismay of everyone and absconds with the kids to the woods . The film had potential , but did n't know which way to go . The frequency of crude humor prevented it from being a kid 's film . The crude juvenile humor prevented it from becoming a good adult film . It should have appeal to an adolescent crowd , one too young for the rating.The characters are poorly developed . Leonard , whose mother coddles him , is not utilized . Kent 's attraction for the older women could have been made more for an adult audience , as long as the film is going that way . What was with the naked girl on the motorcycle ? The opening scene was idiotic as scout masters take on the responsibility of informing a child his father has died.Are there funny scenes ? Yes . In spite of all the crudeness , there were scenes which made me laugh , but too few to put up with a poorly written production . At one point I thought they were going to mimic `` Lord of the Flies , '' but that fell flat . I think a LOTF spoof would have worked better i.e . make Leonard a fat kid they call `` Piggy '' etc.Watch at you own risk.Parental Guide : Frequent F-bombs in front of children .

I had expected more for the main character . So good in Friday Night Lights ! This is weakly written and lacks polish .	-1
I really like country music and I enjoy relationships and I do not know anything about the music business . The music in this show is a teaser -- -you get a few seconds of really good stuff and then it 's off to something else . I am sure they are doing that so people will buy the music but I do not like being manipulated like that.The relationships are smutty and flat and predictable . Sort of like the old fashioned bad & # 34 ; cryin ' in my beer my gal done me wrong and my dog hates me too and I smell just fine and if you do n't like it you can kiss my ... . & # 34 ; songs.There is not one person who is a moral , upright , stalwart , good and Godly person to offset the smuttiness and dirtiness of the rest of the cast . I want to have at least some hope that good will triumph -- -there is none of that here.So , this is not entertaining to me . It is frustrating .	-1
i never seen this before ordering it and i watched it when i recieved it and it wasnt all that , i wouldnt recommend it at all.its not good	-1
Paid $ 9.99 to rent this primarily based on the two really glowing reviews left on here by people who called this the best movie they 'd seen in a while etc . Beware : I think those reviewers might be marketing people working for the studio that put this out.I really like psychological thrillers , mysteries , horror , etc . I like Selma Blair as well . I had no expectations of what this movie was or what it could be , but I took a chance on it and wish I could get a refund . It was terrible . There 's no real mystery to this as you should be able to figure out what happens in the first ten minutes . It 's very obvious what 's going on.The first 30 minutes or so are somewhat interesting , as this uncomfortable feeling builds at a dinner party that only one side of the table wanted to happen ... and then you start to wonder how the other people are going to get out of the bad situation . I laughed because it reminded me a little of holiday meals with relatives I do n't like and who I wish would leave ... but they ca n't take the hint.By the 46 minute mark I just gave up on the movie and realized this was one I 'd have to sit through and endure until it was over because I spent the $ 9.99 on it and I just ca n't turn it off and not see the rest of it.This is the kind of movie that ends up playing very late at night on a random cable channel and is only watched by people who have nothing else to do and ca n't get to sleep . I would never recommend this to anyone ... definitely do n't waste money on it and do n't believe the reviewers who are giving it 5-stars and saying it is the best thing ever.I fell for that scam this time . I saw two glowing reviews and one bad one and I thought the person who wrote the bad review was wrong ... but now I have to side with that person because this movie stunk .	-1
IN THEIR SKIN stars Selma Blair and Josh Close as a young couple who move with their gentle son into Dad 's family home . Of course , there 's a tragic family secret haunting them . Soon they meet their over effusive neighbors played by James D'arcy and Rachel Miner and their bullying son who gradually insinuate themselves into their lives.The film moves languidly and there are no real surprises or genuine thrills . Blair sleepwalks through her role and D'arcy adopts a Hannibal Lechter impersonation that just does n't work.More intensity in the pacing and performances might have had better results . Sadly , IN THEIR SKIN just does n't succeed .	-1
This is another home invasion film . Mark ( Joshua Close ) , Mary ( Selma Blair ) , and their son Brendon ( Quinn Lord ) get away to their summer home when their daughter is killed in a car accident . While at their retreat they meet Bobby ( James D'Arcy ) , Jane ( Rachel Miner ) , and their son Jared ( Alex Ferris ) . They get together for dinner where Bobby asks all kinds of questions and exhibits a high creep factor . This aspect was done very well as you can sense the creepiness in scene and characters.There is of course the later hostage situation and from the title and write up you know that these people want to take over the lives of the occupants . They did a lot to try to set this up , but I just did n't feel it like the creepiness . The problem with this film is that it lacked character . The characters were creepy , but were not colorful . Because the family was so bland , with Selma Blair looking gaunt , like a heroin addict , I did n't really care if they lived or died . In fact I was hoping they got knocked off early because they were boring . View at your own risk.Parental Guide : F-bomb , sex , nudity ( Selma Blair ) .	-1
One of the many , many , far too many spin-offs of the Blair Witch Boondoggle ! This one starts out better and with more good moments of human interest . But , and this is where the film school crap takes over : just turns into a bloody gorefest with no plot , meaning , conclusion or plot to make it into a cogent whole with a real plausible story-line . Next , I suppose will be the take-off on teh Todd Sees case which has so many nuances , that it would make a great movie if handled right !	-1
Technically poor , disjointed story in which nothing much happens and what does is not worth bothering with . I did n't finish it . Nuff said .	-1
Terrible acting , and quality is very low on the camera work . If you have prime it ; s free so you can see for yourself .	-1
This movie was soooooo awful and the pitiful attempt to be blair witch was sickening . Maybe come up with something original .	-1
I usually like the paranormal shows but this one was just bad . The Wraith how bad can an interview be ? The whole story and the acting was very much lacking in everything . Definitely not worth spending time watching and I want my 1.99 back . This is the first time I really disliked something bad enough to write a negative review . Do n't waste time ... there are much better shows out there .	-1
Gossip Girl has grown up and with those crucial scandalous high school years behind her , can not make the translation into adulthood ( or what approximates it on this show . ) Salacious has turned to sleaze and the bad girls are n't really clever , just mean . All of the conniving has worn thin and while earlier seasons seemed like underhanded moral plays in pretty cloths , this episode reeks of ugly .	-1
Boring and dry . characters did not entice me to continue to watch this program . I find that British shows can be really good or boring .	-1
Sorry to say , I could not watch the entire movie.Parker Posey played a complete wacked out lady within a loser script that should never have been written .	-1
Stephen Amell seems like he 'd be a good guy to have a beer with , but he does n't project much of anything else on the screen . No anger , no outrage , no affection , no enthusiasm , just `` I 'm a nice guy '' . That 's still leagues better than what everyone projects , which is angst and fecklessness . It 's hard to care about any of them.A few of the story lines are pretty good , others rather stupid , even if you accept the premise of a comic book world . The screen writers apparently feel a need to end each episode with a syrupy moral lesson , each of which is forgotten by the start of the next show ; it would n't do to have the characters change and grow.I 'd be surprised if the series lasted more than the first season .	-1
The actors are attractive and wooden . Good series for adolescents who are more into clothes , cars , gadgets , and romance , with a now-and-then bloody fight to break the monotony . As to & # 34 ; Arrow & # 34 ; himself : I am reminded of a review of Talullah Bankhead in Cleopatra : & # 34 ; She displayed the gamut of emotion from A to B. & # 34 ;	-1
A guy gets back from 5 years stranded on an island , and he says to his sister , `` you were there the whole time ? '' Do n't wait until the 7th episode to figure out this is a dumb chick-flick . Crappy acting , cookie-cutter cliches and nonsensical plot .	-1
So here we have another series where a skinny model is able to whack around a bunch of guys much bigger than her . Come on . It 's hard enough accepting the premise that every cop in the precinct -- male or female -- is drop-dead gorgeous , but that some chick weighing no more than a fistful of feathers can be sucker-punched by someone she has no reason to suspect , right out of the blue , and come back like Bruce Lee calls for way to much belief-suspension . I might give it a couple more views , but if the pilot is the best they can do , then I 'll pass on the rest .	-1
All I can say is that this show was extremely boring . It was too much like Dark Angel . When you think of Beauty and the Beast , you think of a beast , not some governmental experiment gone wrong .	-1
That this show is n't really very good ! NO SPOILERS : Let us start with Fiona , ah Kristin Kreuk , who may be best known by her supporting role as Scotty 's unfaithful girlfriend in the movie `` Eurotrip '' ( and music video featuring Matt Damon ) . Fiona , AKA Kristin ( I promise to get it right before the end of this review ) AKA `` The Beauty '' plays Detective Catherine Chandler ( Ivy League educated and studying for the Bar when her mother was killed ) Jay Ryan AKA `` The Beast '' plays Vincent Keller , a doctor by trade that volunteered to go to Afghanistan and participate in an experiment that caused him to become `` The Beast '' . When the government decided to `` cancel '' the experiment , Vincent went underground both looking for a cure with the help of his Chemistry Professor friend J.T . ( played by Austin Basis ) and in his spare time helping people in trouble with his great strength and extraordinary sense of smellNina Lisandrello ( Tess ) adds some ethnicity and alternative `` hotness '' , as Catherine 's partnerMax Brown ( Evan ) is the obligatory good looking Forensic Specialist ( with an English accent ) So what is wrong with the show ? Dude , I would take the scar and trade places with `` The Beast '' in a heartbeat ! The fact that Catherine is developing feelings for Vincent , simply is n't the stretch that the writers should have been looking for . I mean Vincent in monster mode is still better than the guy that dumped her in the opening creditsKreuk has some mad fighting skills for a police detective , however , throughout the entire program I was hoping for a short skirt , lingerie scene or a slide show from her last beach vacation . I could n't even remember the case that they were working on.I understand that the series opened to good numbers ( not as good as `` Arrow '' ) and works well back-to-back with `` Vampire Diaries '' . I just do n't see `` it '' . Might be worth keeping on your DVR and watching during the holiday hiatus .	-1
Horrible acting , LAME concept . Utterly disappointed ! I barely made it through 3 shows without poking my eyes out ! Do n't bother watching .	-1
Same story as many others . Damsel meets danger , is rescued by dashing monster person , damsel falls madly in love- pining away for years until she finds . Did not appreciate this in any way . Although I am sure some school age girls might appreciate it .	-1
Kristen continues to find acting that portrays her in the & # 34 ; same old - same old & # 34 ; fashion . Why did she pick the same old type of roll as she played in Smallville .	-1
Very disappointing episode that totally lacks what made the show funny . The writing was very poor , and the failed attempt to be funny was all put into the plot . Comedy is always funniest when it 's character driven as much of the earlier episodes are . In addition to the poor writing , the episode is dragged down by the dead weight that goes by the name of DeVito . Compare any episode of Season 1 ( which was blessedly DeVito-free ) to any subsequent episode you wish and the season 1 episode comes out on top . The cast ( minus Dead Weight DeVito ) is extremely talented and their creation of season 1 was fresh with a Gen-X sarcasm , and consistently laugh out loud funny . In that first year , Glenn Howerton can make you laugh with a mere look in close up . But with season two came the addition of Dead Weight Devito , whose comedy is tired old-school broad sitcom comedy . It does n't match the sensibility of the other four actors or their characters and the longer the series went on with DeVito , the more it sunk towards his sitcom level . This episode hits that rock bottom .	-1
The idea is okay for a special but there is too much sameness for a series . Also , these people seem a bit obsessive about their animals .	-1
I watched the whole season and wished I had n't . The mom drama is disgusting and judges are idiotic . Robin Antin comparing everything to her Pussycat Dolls franchise was laughable . She mentioned it in almost every critique of a dancer when the kids on the show were already more talented than that group that no one has heard of anymore .	-1
I was very disappointed to learn this was a History Channel documentary praising the lords of industry and finance . I should have been more careful to read the product description before I purchased it , but was expecting a good and possibly realistic drama about the period of Reconstruction and Redemption and what the average citizen experienced post Civil War .	-1
I am unable to rate this program . It looks like a very good program , one worth watching but I did not .	-1
I really like most medical dramas ( thanks ER ) , but this one was missing something ... The main character was hard to watch and her need for attention from her best friend is ... Well ... Annoying .	-1
The first season was interesting and this second season was silly , now the third season looks soooo stupid I 'm all together passing ... ..if you are going to buy this get the first season , the second is pretentious and not worth the money .	-1
I love a good mystery/thriller/action movie or TV show but American Horror Story is a bit too gory and visually graphic for me . I watched most of Season One but could not finish that season . Thought I 'd try again , but had to turn off the video less than half way through . Perhaps if they left more to the imagination and less blood and guts ? ? ? but then it may not appeal to you . We all have our preferences , this one is not mine .	-1
I watched and enjoyed season 1 for a lot of the same reasons others did . I expected more of the same this season . I made it through three episodes and stopped . It is a non-stop series of scenes depicting humiliation , gratuitous cruelty and violence , outright torture , sadism , bondage and obedience , degrading and violent sexuality , simple ghoulishness , and on and on . I find nothing redeeming in this series . There is nothing in it I would call a plot or a narrative arc or character development . Any more than there is in your average porno production . Just a pretext for more `` torture porn . `` There is no wit or humor or depth or insight , either . It is just relentlessly and oppressively cruel.The fact that it has so many positive reviews tells me that it has found a cult following - not that it actually deserves positive reviews.I think the actors in this series are not only wasted . I think they are degrading themselves and damaging their reputations by participating in the project . I will never be able to watch Jessica Lang , James Cromwell , Evan Peters or any of the other actors without unfortunate flashbacks to this series . Unfortunately , I used to enjoy these and other artists connected with the series . I wish I had never purchased the first episode . At least then I would n't have these awful associations tainting my memories of these actors .	-1
I got lost somewhere . Did not understand the connection between beginning and ending . I do not want to watch any more episodes .	-1
I watched the entire first season , but found it difficult to watch as it is basically a soft porn made for Prime Time with disturbing sexual situations . That just is n't & # 34 ; entertainment & # 34 ; in my book . Now zombies , on the other hand ... .	-1
Big let down from season one . This year 's show is much too over the top with the writers throwing in every horror cliche and then even more cliches . Back to the drawing board for season 3 .	-1
This season was too dark and violent for me . I made it to episode 4 and thought why am I watching this . Seems like they just want to shock you into how depraved they can make the show . I will pass on the rest of the season .	-1
I am a HUGE fan of AHS season 1 and it is with sadness I ca n't say the same about Asylum . When I realized what the creators were going to do with each season , I thought it was risky but brilliant . I loved the idea ; so I waited with anticipation for Asylum to start ... they even have the actor from Babe ... well know and uber talented added to the cast this year . Zachary Quinto and Jessica Lange and Evan Peters back ... I was SO stoked ... then I watched it . I tried , tried SO hard to love it like I did season one ... but I just ca n't . It is n't that there is too much going on ... I do n't like torture porn . I find it trite and unnecessary . So for those reasons I am out . Here 's hoping season 3 , if there is one , is more along the lines of true horror instead of just horrific .	-1
Don : t get it . _enjoyed the first season . This one doesn : t capture my interest from the first episode . Kinda of wondered what happened to the first family . _thought they would continue it .	-1
I enjoyed the first season of this show but this one about a Catholic run asylum I just could n't stomach enough to even get past the third show.if next season is anything like this one count out this viewer .	-1
I did n't like it at all . The same characters are used as in the first season playing different parts . I did n't find it interesting but more on the bizarre & weird side . There was no & # 34 ; tie in & # 34 ; into the first season 's parts played by the same actors like I had hoped . The writers are borrowing from aliens to & # 34 ; Snake Pit & # 34 ; to Hitler 's reign with no continuity .	-1
Violent and heartless . No storyline that I can tell except how brutel can people be to each other . Do n't buy .	-1
I liked last years series , spooky and kept it interesting . This year they went wacko with the writing . It is disgusting and downright gross . Glad I did n't purchase the whole season ! I love suspense , but not the sadistic torture , it lost the story line & focuses on cutting people up for fun . Really sad that this show has 5 star comments . I cant watch people abusing , torturing & cutting their limbs off people . It 's sick & very disturbing !	-1
Stupid is as stupid does . What a cluster f ... . mess These poor souls find disaster everyway they go . I finally started feeling sorry for them but most of there woes they bring on themselves . If you are really bored maybe watch it.Chuck	-1
I would not pay to watch this show it reruns constantly on regulartv . most of these guys do n't know what they are doing . they are diggingup gravel and dirt thinking are are going to be millionaires . the mostexciting thing is figuring what the next crisis is going to be andwhich piece of makeshift equipment is going to break next .	-1
Christopher has been in too many dark works since leaving Dr. Who -- -I loved him in that role and really missed him . Who needs one more crummy politician -- --	-1
There is a lot going on in the heavily stylized three part British miniseries `` Blackout '' and I do n't always mean that as a compliment . I was drawn to this presentation due to the involvement of Christopher Eccleston , an actor that I almost always find fascinating to watch . While he gives a largely successful performance , the actual adaptation is overwrought and even borders on preposterous . It may seem like an unusual feat to make something that is simultaneously over-simplified and over-complicated , but that 's just what `` Blackout '' has done . As a study of addiction , of infidelity , and of political machinations , `` Blackout '' is a show that had a lot of interesting themes to work with . But nothing is explored in any real detail or depth , so there is n't much with which to emotionally connect . And it does n't help that the political side story is just plain silly ! To compensate for some of the plot 's shortcomings , the show is fashioned as a quick-edited and jarring nightmare that leaps around in time . While this disorientation might be a good approach in an addiction drama , it does n't disguise the implausibility within the narrative structure of the program.Eccleston plays an alcoholic City Councilman who is caught up in corruption with a local builder . After an intense confrontation kicks off Episode One , Eccleston awakes with only a vague memory of the previous night 's events . However , something seems amiss as he 's covered in blood and the nefarious builder is in the hospital . We see the scene repeatedly in short staccato bursts of memory , but can Eccleston piece together what happened and stay out of trouble ? A young woman . presumably a prostitute , was also on hand and her involvement with Eccleston is something that the viewer has to decipher with time . As Eccleston 's world seems to be crumbling , an unexpected act of violence brands him a national hero . And this deeply flawed man has a chance to ascend to power . Is this a time for cover-up or is it a time for redemption ? While this twist literally made me laugh out loud , I never believed it for a moment.While loud and over-produced , I did enjoy the set-up of `` Blackout . '' And the ridiculous twist was mightily entertaining . But I had a couple of major issues with the remainder of this three-parter . The mystery is never particularly compelling , and the political power Eccleston wields never rings true . Originally set up as a puppet leader , he grows more resistant and altruistic . SLIGHT SPOILER : As the show needs to come to an end , in one miraculously scene , he ends contract corruption once and for all within the city ! Easy as this , one man made a decision in one night and revolutionized the entire city government ! That 's how things work , right ? END SLIGHT SPOILER . In the end , I just did n't think `` Blackout '' was smart enough to work as a great political thriller but it also lacked the humor necessary to make it a pleasing potboiler . An exercise in style over substance , you will have to overlook a lot in the plotting of `` Blackout '' to get much enjoyment out of the rather dour affair . KGHarris , 12/12 .	-1
okay show ... i think the first season was better , but its still a great watch..no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all !	-1
while this was n't my typical kind of sitcom , a little too edgy for me , it was still funny enough that I was willing to watch . Then it 'jumped the shark ' with really crude language , as is typical with sitcoms these days . Apparently the writers mistake crude and graphic language for humor or else they assume the viewer wo n't know the difference . Sad .	-1
The UNcensored NC-17 version of Universal Soldier - Day of Reckoning is an above average sci-fi/action movie , nowhere near as good as its predecessor Regeneration , though . However despite the director 's promise that the uncensored version will be released for home media this is not the case here . I do n't buy INCOMPLETE movies , so I 'm not buying Day of Reckoning until they correct this mistake ! By the way , do n't expect to see too much of Jean-Claude Van Damme or Dolph Lundgren in this one ! They 're only in it for a few minutes .	-1
I tried to like this movie but could n't . Too much non-sensical violence and so many stone faces you think they filmed this thing on a really grimy Easter Island . Jean Claude looks desperate as if going through the motions and Dolph looks like he hates being in this mess . Someone needs to tell the makers of this movie arty shots do not make up for a turgid plot .	-1
Universal Solider 1 set up that the army found a way to reanimate a corpse and control it . So they thought . Things go a bit iffy when two of them begin to regain their memories and recall they have unfinished business with each other . The second was a mega flop , where Luc Devenroe or whoever it is Van Damme plays is pretty much back to normal and helping to stop the worlds worst wrestler ever from taking over the Universal Soldier army . Part 3 was a blur . I just remember thinking it had nothing to do with the original film , it just brought two characters back.Now a 4th installment . Now Luc is the bad guy ? Dolph Lungren is back , after being killed how many times now ? And they work together ? Lungren takes orders from Van Damm ? WTF ? ? ? A new guy with Van Dam moves is the new good guy ? Who wrote this ? And have they even seen the original movies ? Had this movie NOT been in the Universal Soldier name , it probably would have been passed off as maybe 2 and a half stars ... but to take the original hero , and turn him into the villain ? It 's just dumb . It 's like making a sequel to a popular hero movie and for no reason at all , suddenly Martin Riggs is a terrorist , Axel Foley is a drug lord , Rocky has become a Russian fighter , Cameron Poe has become a mafia boss ... it just makes no sense .	-1
I 've read where this is the last of the franchise that began in 1992 with Jean-Claude Van Dam and Dolph Lundgren at their peak . It is the only one of the series that I saw and I do n't remember much other than it was OK . Here , they make brief appearances as leaders of the secret UniSols project.The headliner this time is Scott Adkins as John who appears to be just another citizen being awoken by his young daughter who hears something downstairs . It is Luc Devaraux ( Van Damme ) and a few cutthroats who then torment John with the brutal murder of his family and beat him within an inch of his life . John lives and of course seeks revenge . But some things are fuzzy in his head as he mends in his hospital room.The plot did n't make any sense to me but then I missed all those sequels . Still , good sequels can usually stand on its own . This film is not much more than a traditional bad guys vs. good guy blood bath . I did like some of the fight sequences and clearly Adkins knows what he 's doing on the martial arts front . So does Andrei Arlovski as one of Devaraux henchmen . He and John have one great dual in a sporting goods store .	-1
In the opening scene John ( Scott Adkins ) sets the screen scene record for a non-cyborg to get hit by a crowbar and survive . As he wanders off into a coma as he watches Luc Deveraux ( Jean-Claude Van Damme ) who is wearing gloves , murder his family . The FBI knows it is Luc , because he `` left his prints all over the place . '' Now is this a clue , or just a screw up ? John awakes from his coma and does n't remember much of his life as he looks for Luc and tries to put things together . He discovers he was not a nice person and that entering a strip joint causes instant healing as he no longer has to use his cane to get around . He teams up with a dancer ( Mariah Bonner ) who knows the bad him and they go on an adventure having to fight off a `` Manchurian '' plumber who drives a truck with a self repairing hood.In order to keep things level , people who could act better than Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren were not considered for roles . All around a fairly sorry film for the franchise . Oh , not `` Halloween 3 '' bad , but close.Parental Guide : F-bomb , sex , full frontal nudity ( male and female ) , plenty of blood and exploding heads .	-1
ok , Claude and Dolf have gotten to be better actors over time and in this movie once they start acting , they like stop them at once and make them hit random people . I do n't get it . ( spoiler ) Also when they brought back Dolf 's character he started thinking for himself and the scientist hated it . He just resurrected a guy and gave him a healthy brain . You 'd think he would be happy . There were a lot of things I did not like about this movie . It seemed like a waste . It should have been about Claude and Dolf achieving independence and beating the robot brain soldiers but alas it was about brainless super troopers killing each other again . Boring .	-1
`` What difference does it make , what more can you take from me ? '' After a home invasion leaves his wife and daughter dead , John ( Adkins ) is after revenge from the group behind it . Since this is like the fifth movie in the series this review will be short . Either you will watch it or you wo n't . I have to say that this is not my kind of movie . I am not really into these type of let 's make another movie in this series type movies . Movies like this with just action and no real story are not interesting to me . I know a lot of people will disagree with me but I had a hard time staying with this movie and by the end I was just glad it was over . Overall , not my kind of movie . I give it a D+ .	-1
`` Universal Soldier : Day of Reckoning '' stars Jean-Claude Van Damme , Scott Adkins , Andrei `` The Pit Bull '' Arlovski and Dolph Lundgren ( credited in that order ) . The new Universal Solider film is directed by John Hyams , responsible for so-so action flick `` Universal Soldier : Regeneration '' ( 2009 ) and just plain terrible `` Dragon Eyes '' ( 2012 ) .First things first . `` Universal Soldier : Day of Reckoning '' is not a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie . Van Damme 's role here is only as an extended cameo , and his fight scene is rather brief , and so is that of Dolph Lundgren . I do n't even know if I should call it a Universal Soldier movie , as in `` Day of Reckoning '' there is hardly any sci-fi element that was still seen in `` Regeneration . `` Still I expected something exciting from the film as the star of `` Day of Reckoning '' is Scott Adkins , who can really do action . Adkins plays a man named John , who , heavily injured , wakes up in a hospital to learn that his beloved wife and daughter were brutally murdered by masked intruders . So far , so good.As the story goes on , however , it becomes clear that the film is going nowhere . Action is brutal and gory ( that 's fine ) , but terribly drawn-out and poorly edited . The confusing story ( including the lengthy non-action opening scene that should be much shorter ) does n't make much sense . There is one decent car action sequence , but ... is Scott Adkins , a martial artist , hired for this ? As you know , Van Damme , Adkins and Lundgren were also seen in `` The Expendables 2 . '' They are just part of the cast , but they did much better jobs there .	-1
How do you mess up this opportunity ! ? ! Both original stars . Some great MMA talent . And you dump them into THIS slow , dull , depressing , confusing story ! ? ! The best way I can describe this movie is that it plays out like some half-formed story idea dunked into the dream of a drugged mental patient . Just when it seems to make sense and promise something good , it flops and drags and makes no sense.If you can even FINISH this terrible movie , you either fell asleep and woke up at the end or have a will of steel.It does no justice to the original movie , nor the tepid sequels . The good guy is now evil . The evil guy is now . . . good ? The action is lukewarm , shot poorly , and uninteresting.Wasted talent . Wasted time.AVOID .	-1
This movie circa 1950 is poorly done by today 's standards.Plot is not believable not at all realistic.Some bigger names in the cast but acting is poor.I do not recommend this movie .	-1
not a very good film . low budget , poor script , mediocre acting , mediocre action scenes , mediocre all around . I like well made war films . this one does n't come close .	-1
Acting was very poor and plot was not good with many unbelievable events included . Would not recommend unless you are really & # 34 ; in & # 34 ; to old war movies .	-1
This was chosen by my s o , so I can only give a review based on their opinion.To be honest , they never finished this video as they do not care for subtitles on the screen during viewing.Their opinion is that if they wanted to read they would open a book.I suppose some find the subtitles distracting , not me.I wish I would have watched , but am not fond of the WWII genre in film , or any war movie , for that matter .	-1
This story of robbery went wrong and the brother sister criminals tried to escape with the loot in the snowy countryand held locals as hostages is so old , forced and predictable that it is boring.It is a complete waste of ( this viewer 's ) time.Second worst film of recent years , after `` The Paper Boy '' .	-1
I do n't understand other reviews , this is a 0 star movie , but I had to put 1 . The acting is bad , what happens in the story is bad ( at leaast 1 stupid decision by every character in the movie that make you go `` oh , come on '' ) .This might just be the worst movie I 've ever seen .	-1
I have a theory , possibly true , possibly not , than any movie involving someone named Zach or Josh will be terrible . This movie falls into the terrible category . A great noir has a sense of inevitability about it , but also surprise . This film had nothing but cliches without irony . Lets see incestuous Southern siblings , Father and daughter cops . Violent boxer in jail for something who throws a fight . In a great noir , the boxer 's taking a fall would have something to do with the killers . But that would be a film I 'd like to watch , not a film like that I laughed my way through . Now , Todds are solid in the film world . Maybe if a Todd had written or directed this film , it might have been better . How did this movie get made ? How ?	-1
I think this was a really good film it seemed short but It was enjoyable . I think if you liked FROZEN or WOLFS or love films with some violence but not overdone with it ... films done in the snow ... you will love this .	-1
Storyline was predictable after the first 30 minutes and a polite psycho is not really believable . It was good to see Kenny Rodgers again though	-1
Deadfall is a white noir , instead of being told in the shadows of the mean streets of the corrupt city , it takes place in the wide open snow covered wilderness . It is easy to identify that Deadfall wants to conjure up memories of Fargo or any other Cohen brothers movie for that matter , but ends up simply stuck a drift in it 's own snow storm of tedium . This is n't a bad movie , per say , but it is middling , predicable and more often than not , dull . Which comes as a shame because the movie has a real great cast that is game for something more meaty.Telling the story of Addison ( Eric Bana ) and Liza ( Olivia Wilde ) , a brother and sister team that just stuck up a tribal Casino . A car wreck leaves their driver dead and them stranded in the cold Michigan wilderness heading for the Canadian border . They become separated and Liza hooks up with a stranger , Jay ( British actor Charlie Hunnam ) , an Olympic silver medalist pugilist just out of jail and already on the run again . He wants to go home for Thanksgiving , but they end up stuck at a roadside motel for the night . She pretends he 's her brother and he pretends she 's a playboy centerfold , and somehow through all this they fall in love.Also add another subplot involving small town cop Hannah Becker ( Kate Mara ) , trying to prove herself in a man 's world and dealing with daddy issues involving the local sheriff ( Treat Williams ) , who may be her father , but he is also a sexist , arrogant lout.Deadfall starts off very well with a great hook , but as it goes along it becomes tiresome and conventional . The early cinematography by Shane Hurlbut is excellent with a nicely done car crash and an exciting chase on snowmobiles , but like everything else in this movie becomes more pedestrian as it trots along.Directed by Stefan Ruzowitzky , an Austrian born director who won an Oscar for 2008 's the Counterfeiters , making a very mild mew English language debut . Working from a half backed script by first time screenwriter Zach Bean , who manages yo fit more clich & eacute ; s in a ninety-five minute movie than just about anyone this year . Bean 's script seems cobbled together by bits and pieces of other movies , and not necessarily there best parts . It 's plotting , it is rushed and there is little or no character development.Deadfall manages to almost descend into self parody with it 's obvious and contrived ending that feels like the old Humphrey Bogart movie Desperate Hours , which itself was remade by Michael Cimino and starred Mickey Rourke , with a very special Thanksgiving twist . A holiday showdown in the snow.A very good cast is all that keeps this afloat . Eric Bana is superb in the central role , a tough guy villain that is easy to root for . Olivia Wilde proves she 's much more than merely eye candy here , she is sweet , scared and sympatric in the role , she makes Liza simply more human , and this could be Wilde 's best work so far.Kate Mara is excellent as rookie police officer Becker , she 's smart and tough with the offbeat charisma that Mara is good at exhibiting . She 's pretty , but not glamorous , and gives a clich & eacute ; d role a more firm footing in reality , or at least she makes it appear so.Charlie Hunnam is just okay as Jay , a poor man 's Tom Hardy the role is so underwritten that the actor is given little time to do much of anything , he 's just there as the movie 's handsome stranger , a rather dull protagonist.Add reliable veteran performers Kris Kristofferson and Sissy Spaceck as Jay 's folks , and Treat Williams as the sheriff , this highly capable cast really cooks . Unfortunately it adds up to more of a cold lunch than a holiday feast.Deadfall is a slight and unmemorable thriller , it 's laughable in all the wrong ways and does n't add up to a impressive Thanksgiving themed movie . Although it would be interesting to see what happens after diner , I mean some people have some explaining to do that could have added up to something more interesting than what we have here . This time of year you can do better . Give the gift of love and take some you care about to see something else.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com	-1
This movie , starring Elizabeth McGovern among others , has an obvious similarity to Downton Abbey and no doubt fans of that wonderful series will be drawn to it . But the similarity is all on the surface . In fact , this turns out to be a pretty dour and rather boring excursion into the emotional stuntedness of the English upper middle classes during the 1930s.It all takes place at a country house in Devon on a single day . Dotty , a rather vapid young thing who is pretty but not much else , is marrying the square-chinned Owen . But she has invited her former swain Joseph to the festivities -- and he for some reason has come . The house fills with guests , none particularly interesting , and Dotty knocks back slugs of rum while waiting for Joseph to do something -- which he never quite manages.We also get flashbacks to the lovers the previous summer , boating on the river , kissing in the conservatory , running through the rain etc etc . We wait for them to give in to the dictates of the heart - and wait and wait and wait until the closing credits.Downton Abbey is great not only because the characters are vivid and memorable and the writing and acting are superb but because we also learn something about the way English society was changing before , during and after the Great War . The web of relations between upstairs and downstairs is interesting and provides for great drama.This movie does none of that . It is simply mediocrity dressed up in nice clothes with smart British accents .	-1
I went into this movie without any expectations , but I like wedding movies and thought I 'd give it a try . The primary female character has great screen presence . The story had potential , and I enjoyed the flash back technique used to tell the story . But the plot moved slowly and did n't quite close the loop . Kind of ended with a thud .	-1
The best thing I can say about this film is that there are nice shots of pretty clothes and a lovely upper-class English home in the early 1930's.The main character , a self-absorbed wealthy young girl , is torn between the man she is about to marry and a former lover . She is pretty in a vacuous way , but with an annoying habit of posing with her two front teeth resting on her lower lip . I guess that 's what privileged young girls did in England at that time ? Her groom to be is a handsome cheerful chap but we do n't see much of him . Who we do see `` moping about '' is last summer 's boyfriend , a chinless lad with all the charm of the tortoise he gave her . It turns out , in the only interesting scene in the film , that he may have impregnated her , in which case the child will have the worst features of both -- -egad ! The bride , who is supposed to be not only pretty but witty and charming ( we do n't see that but we are told that she is ) has the stock plain , little sister whom everyone ignores . There are other stock characters ... Miss Spoon who gets herself locked in the bathroom ... .a little boy who plants confetti bombs on the stuffier family members and the `` charming '' but dreadfully interfering mother ( well played by Elizabeth McGovern ) .I suppose if I cared a whit about who this dim , blah girl eventually married I 'd have enjoyed the film . But I did n't .	-1
A friend of my wife recommended this movie to us , saying it was extraordinary , and after watching it , I can not help but wonder how good a friend she really is : ) This is one miserable movie , based on a premise that is not really original , with many unlikable characters and that at times moves at snail 's pace . The first 10 minutes were so bad that I am surprised I kept watching . After that it does get slightly better , but it never really delivers much to the viewer.The only redeeming aspect is some humorous moments that got chuckle from me , but the story and most of the characters were unlikable . The plot revolves as you can guess around a wedding , and we have the strong-willed bride that likes to have everyone marching at her own pace , the former boyfriend who we know is going to try to sweep the bride away , the conniving mother , the oblivious groom and a myriad of quirky family members . The use of flashbacks to tell the story of the bride and Joseph , her summer love , was OK , but nothing special.The performances are nothing to write home about , and as it should be clear by now , I am not satisfied at all with the experience . Luckily it was relatively short ! I really recommend staying away from this one . My wife loves most British movies and she also thought this was rubbish .	-1
Director Stephen Frears ( `` The Queen '' , `` High Fidelity '' , `` Dangerous Liaisons '' ) and screenwriter D.V . DeVincentis ( `` High Fidelity '' , `` Grosse Point Blank '' ) are back together again for a new film based on the memoirs of American writer and journalist Beth Raymer , a memoir about her experiences in the sex industry , amateur boxing and sports betting.The film would feature an all-star cast starring Bruce Willis ( `` Die Hard '' films , `` The Sixth Sense '' , `` The Fifth Element '' ) , Catherine Zeta-Jones ( `` Chicago '' , `` The Terminal '' , `` Entrapment '' ) , Vince Vaughn ( `` Wedding Crashers '' , `` Mr. and Mrs. Smith '' , `` The Break-Up '' ) , Rebecca Hall ( `` The Prestige '' , `` Frost/Nixon '' , `` The Town '' ) , Joshua Jackson ( `` Fringe '' , `` Dawson 's Creek '' , `` The Skulls '' ) , Laura Prepon ( `` That 70 & # 8242 ; s Show '' , `` October Road '' , `` Are You There , Chelsea ? '' ) and Corbin Bernsen ( `` L.A. Law '' , `` Kiss Kiss Bang Bang '' , `` Psych '' ) .VIDEO : '' Lay the Favorite '' is presented in 1080p High Definition ( 1:85:1 ) . For the most part , picture quality for the film is very good . Colors are vibrant and really look good outdoors . Really good detail when it comes to closeups and colors black levels are nice and deep . I did n't notice any problems with the overall picture quality , no aliasing or artifacts.AUDIO & SUBTITLES : '' Lay the Favorite '' is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA . The film is primarily all dialogue driven and dialogue is crisp and clear . Not a film where you would hear a lot of surround usage but you do hear a bit of the ambiance come into play during the film . But for a film like this , the lossless soundtrack was appropriate.Subtitles are in Spanish.SPECIAL FEATURES : '' Lay the Favorite '' come with the following special features : Deleted Scenes - ( 7:41 ) A total of 11 deleted scenes.JUDGMENT CALL : '' Lay the Favorite '' may have been a fascinating memoir to read but as a film , I feel that the film tried to incorporate comedy but also be a bit deep at the same time but it just does n't work.The primary character of Beth Raymer comes off in the film as a girl who loves her job of pleasing men as an in-home stripper , showing her body and getting what she wants but trying to make money and survive . When compared to the original memoir , there is a much better story as Beth is trying to balance life at Florida State University and to pay her way through college life , she becomes a stripper . But because of her not being satisfied or she was fired from these jobs , that 's the reason why she moved to Las Vegas.I really do n't know if the real Beth Raymer was anything like the film version of Beth Raymer but the film 's first half hour tries to feature Beth as a naive sex kitten that who is a stripper , tries to have sexual relations with her boss and fidns a guy at a casino and has sex with him immediately after they met.While the film tries to focus on high-stakes gambling , you 're left thinking ... '' really ? '' . Not to say that Rebecca Hall 's portrayal of Beth Raymer makes her out like an `` airhead '' but perhaps instead of focusing on the sexy side of Beth Raymer , at the beginning of the film , there should have been some glimpse of her brilliance with numbers that is later mentioned in the film . That Beth is actually a smart young woman , not just some kind of vamp . Also , unless you have an interest in sports-gambling , the film is really lacking in structure and not that entertaining.Of course , we eventually see Beth grow in the ranks of high-stake gambling when she moves to New York City and starts to make money for herself . But by then , I 'm wondering to myself , is this really a Stephen Frears film ? And what an unlikely film to find Bruce Willis and Catherine Zeta-Jones in . But do give the film some credit in the fact that Bruce Willis , Catherine Zeta-Jones , Joshua Jackson and Vince Vaughn made `` Lay the Favorite '' much more of an enjoyable film because they appeared in it.The Blu-ray release does feature very good PQ and for dialogue-driven film , lossless audio was also good . And for special features , you get eleven deleted scenes.Overall , `` Lay the Favorite '' was a film that may have featured a talented director and also featured a cast of big names but unfortunately , with an uninspired screenplay , the characters were n't fully utilized and the film just lacks anything of interest unlike the original memoir that the film was based on . Probably worth a rental but nothing more .	-1
It was n't exactly easy to make it to the end of the tone deaf comedy `` Lay The Favorite . '' When I got there , though , I was in for a huge shock . The credits rolled and I realized that Stephen Frears was responsible for directing this ! In case you have n't heard of him , the Oscar nominee has orchestrated some truly great films including The Queen , The Grifters , and Dangerous Liaisons . Well nothing could be further from these excellent films than this flight of fancy . Based on a true story , an expose on the world of gambling by Beth Raymer , the plot had the potential to be absolutely fascinating . In fact , I 'd love to read Raymer 's memoir . I think it would be very enlightening . But instead of a hard hitting drama , Frears has removed any sense of reality from the picture . I do n't care that he wanted to make something light and comedic , but this is n't serious enough for a drama , funny enough for a comedy , informative enough for gambling enthusiasts , or rich enough in character so that anyone might actually care about what happens . In short , the movie has no idea what it wants to be and that is very apparent.Rebecca Hall plays the central character as a chirpy stripper who is simultaneously brilliant and clueless . She dreams of the big time , she wants to be a waitress in Las Vegas ! She gets involved , instead , with an odds-maker played by Bruce Willis . She 's a natural at the game and soon becomes invaluable to the operation . Willis 's wife ( Catherine Zeta-Jones ) does n't like the closeness between the two and this causes much friction . As Hall sets out on her own , she gets into some trouble from which she may not be able to extricate herself . Hint : It involves Vince Vaughn . It just might require a little help from her friends and a caper is afoot . And boy , there 's no stopping this crew when they are joined ! One of my biggest issues with `` Lay The Favorite '' is that it is all over the map in tone . And none of it really works , nothing is developed in enough depth to get you involved . Even the gambling aspect of the picture is lackluster and pedestrian . I never cared about anything that happened . Willis seems to be sleepwalking , Hall is positively grating , and everyone else is pretty much wasted . Hall has a love affair with Joshua Jackson , but we never know the first thing about him . The character development is so sketchy as to be virtually non-existent . A few of the smaller roles scored and Zeta-Jones has presence . The experience , for me , had no real laughs , no real danger , no real romance . I 've certainly been a fan of Frears , Willis and Zeta-Jones in other projects . Here , though , I 'm hard pressed to tell you anything that I like about this misguided effort . About 1 1/2 stars , I 'm not sure why I 'm rounding up . KGHarris , 3/13 .	-1
Having finished watching Stephen Frears ' `` Lay the Favorite , '' I am still unsure what to make of this `` true story '' based on Beth Raymer 's memoir of her experiences in the sports-betting industry in Las Vegas . The film has one interesting subject matter , to be sure , and benefits from the fine performance from Rebecca Hall as the spirited heroine , but with its unfocused and disjointed narrative `` Lay the Favorite '' simply does n't know what it is doing.An in-home exotic dancer Beth travels from Florida to Las Vegas , dreaming of becoming a cocktail waitress at a casino . As luck would have it , she gets a job working for a bookie Dink Heimowitz ( Bruce Willis ) . Beth , who is good with numbers , becomes a sort of good luck charm for Dink and even gets romantically involved with him before his wife Tulip ( Catherine Zeta-Jones ) comes back and interferes.The story may sound interesting . Actually , it is not , jumping from one scene to the next without developing any of the characters . In `` Lay the Favorite '' you will never know anything about the betting industry . That itself is not a big problem if the film allows us to know the characters . Beth meets characters played by Corbin Bernsen , Frank Grillo , Joshua Jackson , John Carroll Lynch , Laura Prepon and Vince Vaughn . The impressive cast does their best , but frankly , we really do n't care what happen to these uninteresting cyphers.The only exception to the mediocre writing is the film 's protagonist Beth , who , thanks to Rebecca Hall , remains attractive even when her character is not really credible . Despite her effective acting , `` Lay the Favorite '' seems trying not to entertain us , by omitting or blurring critical points of her story that should be more interesting .	-1
I decided to pay $ 4 because Entertainment Weekly gave this movie an A . But I was sorely disappointed . It 's a crap movie . And Amazon 's video quality was horrifying . I 've watched a few other things on Amazon Prime and had no trouble , but this was a mess , tech-wise .	-1
Not a great movie . If you can watch it for free that go for it . My bet is that you turn it off after about 15 minutes .	-1
Movie consists of 50 % showing a face in front of a hand held camera boringly telling some story that would make any UFO , paranormal , zombie , Bigfoot , government conspiracy freak as satisfied as a plate load of bbcue wings in the belly . Another 25 % is repeatedly showing old news footage of random , and over the years , dead herd , flock , schooling critters meant to strike fear in all whose education ended in the fifth grade . The final 25 % is just some made up stuff .	-1
The word SLOW , takes on a new meaning with this ... docu pretender video , it moves so slow it seems to be going backwards in time . Imagine an amateur with a video camera taping an amateur unsure of what she is going to say and saying it very slowly and seemingly considering every word for a very long time . Then the footage is not edited at all so when she stops and starts over you want to scream , & # 34 ; just say something ... anything ... stop licking your lips and rolling your eyes ! ! ! I would tell you more but I decided to eat my TV at that point rather than watch another second of this really bad crap . Other than that I have no opinion .	-1
The `` found footage '' technique is taking film by storm . Expect more of it . Soon , we 'll look at `` regular '' films like we do now at silent films . And get this ... . it 's SUPPOSED to be poor quality . Creates a believable and empathetic viewpoint for the viewer . But the science here is a joke . Yes , the fish tongue parasite exists , but everything else is just bunkum . The list is a long one , but I mean , really ? ? ? Chicken manure monsters ? There is really nothing scary here once all the people have died except dead bodies . And the sick guy jumping out at the end is just LAME ! Not worth paying to see except to see the power of found footage technique .	-1
Well here we have another `` found footage '' flick to add to the ever growing genre , where some are great , some good , some average , but lately a lot have been awful . `` The Bay '' tells a story of what happened to a small town in Maryland in 2009 when something in the waters of Chesapeake Bay starts making the citizens sick and makes others do strange things . We hear from a news reporter named Donna ( Kether Donahue , `` Pitch Perfect '' ) , who tells her story and shows us what happened through footage she shot and found . Director Barry Levinson ( `` The Natural '' , `` Rain Man '' , `` Bandits '' ) tries to make this story work as best he can , but sadly this material is tired and seems all too familiar.The first 30 minutes are n't too bad as we see the early signs that something is wrong with some of the people in the town , but what is the real cause ? Sadly by the time it 's revealed the ability to care about the cause or any of the actors in the movie is pretty much gone . I do n't fault Levinson for trying a different type of movie compared to his previous work but this is a lot like `` Sphere '' , a good idea but pretty lousy execution . It 's certainly not as bad of a found footage flick as oh say `` The Hollow '' was , but `` The Bay '' is n't very good . *1/2 out of 4 stars .	-1
It 's totally my fault for not watching the trailer for THE BAY before renting this film , but I had no idea the entire thing would be a collection of poorly filmed video clips , interviews , and shaky-cam shots of people running about and screaming . That 's about it . There is no plot and there are no characters.OK , there are a few characters . Kristen Connolly ( `` Cabin in the Woods '' ) plays a reporter who is making a documentary about a disastrous plague that infected a small coastal town in Maryland . It 's her voice you hear doing voiceovers , and she 's the one pulling all the different film clips together from material confiscated by the government . Frank Deal plays Mayor John Stockman , who was told about the toxicity in the bay but refused to do anything ( he 's pretty much a retread of the mayor in JAWS who would n't close the beaches because he was worried about the tourist trade ) . Then there are a bunch of characters called `` Victim # 1 , '' `` Fair Man , '' `` Activist , '' `` Middle Aged Supporter , '' and `` Bob . '' I do n't remember any of them individually . But who cares ? The plot can be summed up as follows : The water in the bay is toxic because the mayor allowed chicken processing companies to dump their waste into it , which created mutant parasites , which infected the fish , which infected the people , who are now all developing grotesque blisters and lesions and generally going berserk . We see a couple of so-called `` research scientists '' doing ridiculous experiments like looking inside a fish 's mouth with a flashlight ( aha ! Parasites in there ! ) . Doctors speak like high school students . People run around bleeding and screaming and throwing up . And Kristen Connolly tries to be all serious as she comments on all this like it 's really , really happening.THE BAY is a low budget parody of CONTAGION ( which also suffered from too little characterization ) . I have no clue why critics gave this film positive reviews - I guess they enjoyed the `` found footage '' technique far more than I did ( if I never see a `` found footage '' film again , it will be too soon ! ) . Just know what you 're getting before you put down your money .	-1
Good concept but the build up was drug out . I found myself falling asleep a few times . The acting was good but te & # 34 ; live footage & # 34 ; made me feel dizzy and sick . It was hard to stay in suspense with the shacking vibe .	-1
I understand the concept but this film was horrible . Do n't waste your few dollars ... .go to Star -- -- - and get a coffee instead !	-1
I seriously do not understand why people can give this piece of $ @ % & a positive review , the only reason I can think of is that these people either worked on this film or are sadistic and want you to suffer . This was bad.. terribly bad . It is the kind of movie where people literally walked away from in the theater. > > > SPOILERS & lt ; & lt ; & lt ; This film does not deserve a well thought out review but I will try and give a few examples of why I think of this movie so awful.Like the other reviewers already mentioned , this is a found footage film . However , the manner in which the footage is tied together is so random that you could die from a seizure in the theater.The problem of this film is the collection of situations and actions in those situations that make up this movie as a whole . Literally every scene is worth a serious face palm . The film starts with a random ( and way to long ) low quality introduction of the setting , followed by a first victim of the parasite , and it goes down from there . There are scientists that find weird unexplainable parasites and jump into the water to take a look . There are two befriended police officers that come across a house with screaming people , one goes into the house with his gun drawn , the other stays in the car with his seat belt on . There is an agency that specializes in outbreaks ( viral , bacterial.. whatever ) and does not seem to give a damn when they hear about the mysterious issue 's in the town . There is a supposedly intelligent couple ( dentist & lawyer ) that walk into a ghost town filled with dead bodies near the end of the film.. with their few months old baby.. and the guy actually thinks what he sees is funny ! ? The list goes on and on.. 2 hours of this crapThen there is the science.. like the only other review I could relate with pointed out . The science is made up by a 5 year old . All conclusions that are drawn , numbers that are given , idea 's that are thought of.. it is terribly . Just when you hear something that might be vaguely plausible or logical . i.e . the explanation that anomalies could come from pesticides.. nuclear leaks are drawn into the equation to make it sound better or whatever.. Everything about it is pretty pathetic.The overall story is also weak . I mean , maybe there could be made a half-decent film out of the idea behind the movie.. mutated flesh eating parasites , it sounds pretty cool right ? .. but in the context of the rest of the film this story only adds to the train-wreck that is called `` The Bay '' A part of me died while watching this film , I will never get it back , I 'm scarred and I seriously want to kick the creator of this movie in the nuts.. or even better.. I want to go back in time and get raped in stead of watching this film.. I mean it.. getting raped is better !	-1
this is one of those movies where you just want to grab the director and ask him if he has any common sense at all ... no logic- way over the top- the actions & reactions of the `` infected '' people were totally unrealistic- there are so many holes in the movie that you start getting annoyed half way through . Mixed ( very little ) fact with fiction- and the fiction part just destroys any fact credibility.how does the reporter manage to survive despite getting the infected blood all over her , drinking from the fair grounds water bubbler and splashing water from the piers fountain all over her face ? total BS- she does n't get the parasite but the doctor treating people does ? that 's just one of a dozen silly illogical holes in this movie.coulld 've been a great horror flick if the director spent a bit more time on the details and story line .	-1
I did not like the movie , I am a horror movie junkie ( if there is such a thing ) . This was not horror to me .	-1
If you watch any of the SyFy channels self produced movies then you 'll know what to expect . Has some entertainment value but do n't expect good special effects .	-1
Turned it off after 20 minutes . I could n't get past the reporter 's incredibly annoying narration . Her voice was just awful . Like ? everything ? was ? a ? question ? you ? guys ? And most irritating of all , she could n't keep her tongue in her mouth . That 's right . It was just hanging out of her mouth ALL THE TIME . Like a big , gross pink slug . Whoever was responsible for casting this crap should seriously consider a career change .	-1
For this film to be directed by such a good director in the past . This film misses the mark . Another fictional POV film about an infection in the water off of Maine , that infects the town off shore . In my opinion skip this film , because theres nothing there that we havent already seen countless other times .	-1
`` The first signs that something was wrong happened 6 weeks before July 4th . '' While setting up for the big July 4th festivities a small town in Maryland discovers some residents dead and no clues as to why . The more the doctors investigate the scarier it gets until the whole town is soon infected . This is yet another found footage type movie but it is n't like most of the others . This one is done in more of a interview fashion with the footage being used to help tell the story . Also because of the director ( who has done real movies such as Rain Man and The Natural ) the movie is technically much better then most of these types . The problem is that even though it flows better and looks better it is still a little boring . The way it is presented makes it seem like more of a documentary then a horror and I was not really scared at all watching . I will say that if you are a fan of these found footage type movies then you will most likely really like this too . Overall , better then most movies like this but not scary and a tad slow . I give it a C .	-1
I really dislike movies that apologize for being made in the first few minutes the lead actress looks into the camera and suggests they should have hired a voice actor . She was right . And a director . And an editor . And some actors . Oh , and a story that can keep you from falling asleep . Five minutes of dead fish tells you all you need to know about this stew - it 's a plague movie and it 's as dead at its victims . If you finished it , you were a victim too , because you just wasted an hour and a half of your life.Hey here 's an idea ; let 's take an unusual phenomenon that has plenty of free film so we do n't have to film anything , and we 'll just throw it into the air and tape together what falls out.The movie belongs in The Bay .	-1
Nothing new here . Move along . Even my son-in-law who used to love this show is bored by it . Catch the damn thing and put these shows out of business .	-1
hate this show ... so boring ... same thing over and over and over ... so scripted ... so predictable ... no issues with playno issues with purchaseno issues at all !	-1
Yolanda is oh so superior . She imagines she takes the moral high ground ( that whole rotten apples analogy was ridiculous and made her sound stupid ) , and her worship of that husband of hers is nauseating . Mark my words , the Yolanda and what 's his name marriage will be finished within five years . Just as an aside , Kyle has the worst taste in the entire universe . Truly hideous clothes she has chosen for her store . Does anyone take this stuff seriously ? These women stand for much of what is wrong with America , IMO . It embarrasses me that people in foreign countries might see this program and think that this is what American women are all about . Oh , but wait a minute , Yolanda is from Holland is n't she , and she just soars above the others in awfulness . ( I realize that I am watching it and find it to be the best in icky entertainment.And dear little Kim , struggling to stay sober and wanting these awful people to support her when they are just waiting for her to fail . They are the wrong support system for you , Kim . You would be wise to keep your distance and seek support from those who understand your struggle.One more thing , I do absolutely love Jiggy and Lisa 's sweet , sweet husband , who carries Jiggy around happily . Lisa lucked out with that man , I think . He is the best of the lot .	-1
I 've watched all seasons but could n't finish this one . Brandi 's racial remarks and then Lisa 's husband 's remarks to maid when she asked for just one dress of the many that Lisa was giving away . All the maid said is she wished she could have one . And he jumped all over her ugh ! That did it for me . This show has gone down hill . Nobody gets along anymore . Atleast before there were some fun times . Like I said after the maid thing I was done . Too bad I spent my money on this . That just gives all of them them more money . Like they need anymore than they have already .	-1
This show seems boring to us	-1
There 's just something about lance henriksen 's work for years and years that attracts me..Even enjoyed his television work on series 'Millennium & # 34 ; . , which i did n't always GET , but it did provide a different sort of t.v.programing ... On a whim , bought this second hand online for rainy day entertainment , when ive read all my books ... ( yup , it 's true..no KINDLE . ) .Still luv lance 's gravelly , smoke weary voice and that face that carries deep grooves , ..but thats about it..Do n't believe i finished watching it..Gave up..What the hell is that crap stalking the woods ? ? ? Why oh why , must movie people throw in those endless flashbacks of a beautiful , mysterious girl , laughing , twirling , running her perfect face , skinny butt , through fields of flowers ? ? ? After having viewed thousands of movies in time , this is an immediate turn off.~~~~Of course , we realize early on , she 's going to have to pay the price ... .Ah , well , if your a newbie to film , or very young , u might like this sorta thing , some grisly moments newbies might enjoy and then of course a little sex strewn about , which im not opposed to ... but all in all , not for me . It was juvenile ... Instead look up some of lances 's old work , like in ALIEN ; or theres a movie he made years ago where he is part of a marauding bunch of vamps , that is down and dirty , AND thoroughly enjoyable ... What was it 's name ? ... darn it ... sometimes menopause sucks .	-1
Save the Date really *really* stinks . It goes nowhere . It basically sums up the romance genre in one predictably written cliched 80-minute film . A young woman with low self-esteem moves in with her boyfriend . She never really does anything that makes us believe she 's a perfect match for the man in her life . Maybe she 's depressed or maybe she just has a negative outlook on life . Who really knows . It never says which one . She cares WAY too much about herself as well , like the world should revolve around her `` problems '' .She just ... does nothing really . Okay , she hangs out with friends and appears in all the places where guys can hit on her despite how embarrassing the men look when things suddenly go wrong ( such as the one musician who jumps off stage and proposes marriage to her resulting in her running out of the concert as quickly as possible due to overwhelming shock and embarrassment ) . Somehow even *this* scene blows due to lacking excitement.The tone is way too serious to be a comedy- that 's a MAJOR misleading part of the movie description . Nothing 's even remotely funny ever . The movie never even makes an effort to be hilarious . All the characters are lifeless and dull with no personality whatsoever and the writing would n't make the grade in any other context , let alone a film . Save the Date reminds me of a time when a film as poorly written as this would n't have stood a chance of seeing the light of day in theaters or DVD . It 's amazing amazon does n't create a 0-star rating feature because Save the Date would easily be placed in the dark hole of 0-star ratings . I highly recommend avoiding this .	-1
I just ca n't , I ca n't -- -- -I ca n't stand the bad acting and that Jenny Whatever actress -- -just horrible , horrible ... what is up with her mouth , it was soooo distracting , then it hit me , the actress is slurring her lines ! Sooo unrealistic -- -- sorry , but Lifetime was always known for being corny , but some of the old Lifetime Movies were pretty interesting ... .NOW , they just suck ... ..do n't bother , move on and do n't waste 15mins on this drivel ... .I was actually rooting for the crazy psycho to get this horrible actress with the annoying mouth , the bleached hair and the dead eyes -- -- just ca n't get pass the 15mins ... .just ca n't !	-1
Typical formula murder mystery that falls shy of the intended goal . Matthew Rhys is surprisingly good as the bad guy , but police-trained people , or even amateurs , who watch the show will be more than disappointed .	-1
Did not finish watching the movie , did not care for the plot . I found the movie to be a bit gory .	-1
Wish I had read reviews before I even tried to watch this . Gave up after about 15 minutes . Absolutely nothing to make me want to waste any more of my time . Seems this & # 34 ; work & # 34 ; is another bit of self promotion by Nancy Grace . Think she best stick to whatever her fan base is willing to put up with ! She is n't a serious threat to Lee Childs or Michael Connelly , nor even Clint Eastwood and his last few screen bombs !	-1
Truly one of the worst movies I 've seen -- writing , directing , acting , you name it . The lead actress was absolutely pathetic . If this is how Nancy Grace views herself , it speaks volumes . I 'd rather have a root canal than see this movie again .	-1
Strange movie that had a very strange ending . Acting was average and story line OK but not great . Not a great movie but acceptable .	-1
I was disappointed in the casting / especially the walk on by Nancy Grace- you got to know whento step aside . Some one professional should have taken over . A terrible waste of energy .	-1
I thought that I would give it a chance , but nope . The whole thing was about covering up the PD bad actions and the strike team is just as bad as the criminals on the street .	-1
What a waste of time ! All these characters are dirty , unethical , and they get away with it . Do n't like the series , actors , or premise of the show .	-1
In the trailer we see rave reviews from obscure fan sites comparing this film to Toby Hoppers 's ground breaking `` The Texas Chainsaw Massacre '' The eternal classic that provided pure terror at a completely subliminal level.There is no real bloodshed or gore in TCM and it remains one of the few horror films on permanent collection within the Museum of Modern Art.Then we see an equally false claim comparing this film to the original cult classic `` Evil Dead '' . Sheer brilliance on behalf of Sam Raimi , outrageous production value for it 's time and budget - and forever casting Bruce Campbell as one of Horror Fans most beloved actors . Both films scoring a well deserved 99 % -98 % on rottentomates.Enter `` I did n't come here to die '' this film is more than unworthy in every respect to even stand in the shadows of these motion pictures , let alone be compared to them.Never theatrically released . First time director and writer of the film Bradley Scott Sullivan does a miserable job trying to weave a plot and a compelling story line by stealing specific shots of other , much better and well concieved horror movies - one example being the long shot of the van driving towards the woods - is right out of Chainsaw.Hollow performances by unknowns abound and dreary , sullen predictable dialogue - these are characters we could care less about and perhaps this is the movies most fatal flaw . Because not only is it important that we care about the characters we have to want to root for them - this clunker establishes neither.What those looking to cash in on the genre tend to do over and over is dismiss the intelligence of the audience they 're playing to . We 're far more both knowledgeable about what makes for good horror and what is more have a keen eye for cliche ' . The film might as well have been titled `` Accident Prone In Woods '' I think even gore and splatter fans will find this movie disappointing and anyone with a decent eye , certainly any Dick Smith or Tom Savini fan will find the effects laughable at best.This is the kind of film you can walk into at any point and know immediately what you 're seeing and where it 's headed . I adore indy films and really do try to take into consideration they are more often than not an effort of love and homage . That said , it 's important to overlook flaws you might be tempted to focus on regarding big Hollywoodmachine Horror franchises.But they 're exceptions , there are films built on greed that are sub par on virtually every level a movie can be . Films that have made the mistake of dumbing down for their their audience . `` I did n't come here to die '' is a shinning example of just that .	-1
I quit after 15 minutes . The main reason was the lighting . The night scenes you could hardly see the characters . I also did n't get how they were framing the shots .	-1
I guess it could of been ok ... I really do n't know because the beginning did not interest me and therefore ... I feel asleep on it .	-1
In the long tradition of `` women behind bars '' movies `` Prison Girls '' ranks near the bottom ( an achievement of sorts ) . It is a terrible movie shot on a cheap budget with a script that was apparently made up as they went along . It does feature a LOT of nudity , in fact that is the only noteworthy thing I really remember about the ten minutes or so that I watched . I skipped ahead to see if it got any better but it did n't . There is also some simulated sex that manages to avoid being the least bit erotic . I do remember thinking this would make a great beer night movie for college kids . BTW : the two stars does n't mean I did n't `` like it '' . It means I found it well below average .	-1
The acting in this was poor and the quality of the film was poor . It would stop and start several times . This is a movie back from the early 70 , S Lots of T & A but you can go to american Pie for that !	-1
WIP flicks are what they are . They nearly ( nearly ) transcend criticism because they are a hard and fast genre requiring certain obligations to be fulfilled . This one tries to skirt some of those obligations.Here 's the scoop . A handful of female inmates are granted a 2 day pass to the outside to see if they can re-assimilate into society ( right ) . This follows them on their attempts.Other than Uschi Digard and Candy Samples I did n't know any of these actresses ( actresses ? ) . The schtick here is to get the girls out of the prison with the 2 day pass scenario . It opens with the obligatory shower scene and ensuing cat fight and is followed up with the girls visiting the prison psychiatrist as to why this 2 day pass can do them well . We then see how each uses the pass which amounts to little more than one sex scene after another.Yup . Cheap sets . Bad acting . Bad writing . Bad directing . But we 're not here for that . We want the babes and there are babes aplenty . Problem is , everything is so bad the bare babes become tiresome after little time . Sex scenes , even soft core sex scenes , can be arousing . Not so here . They wear out their welcome pretty quick . The real highlights are seeing Uschi and Candy and even those left me wanting.There are a lot of these kinds of flicks out there and most ( maybe all ) are better than this one .

This tv show is very boring and poorly animated . And for a show that is supposed to be an action comedy show there is practically no action . The how to train your dragon series is just very overrated . I cant believe they are making a sequel to the horrible first movie .	-1
Ok so I bought this movie because it was 99cents . The only reason I plan to keep it is because in the future if anyone asks what happened to Lindsay Lohan 's career I can just show them this film .	-1
Everyone knew `` Liz and Dick '' was going to be a disaster as soon as it was announced . Two reasons why:1 . It was being made by the Lifetime Network , with a TV-movie budget.2 . It starred Lindsay Lohan.The pessimism was not unwarranted -- this movie is so bad that I 'm surprised Richard Burton has n't risen from the dead just to throw liquor bottles at the people responsible . I actually hoped that it would be bad in a hilarious , campy way , but instead it 's just hideously awkward , cheesy and cheap . As Lohan croaks at one point , `` I 'M SO BORED ! `` The story is narrated by Elizabeth Taylor ( Lohan ) and Richard Burton ( Grant Bowler ) from the afterlife . Apparently the heavenly host really want to hear the inside scoop on their relationship . It started during the shooting of `` Cleopatra , '' when Shakespearean actor Burton was unexpectedly cast opposite the scandal-generating superstar Elizabeth Taylor.Well , despite a rocky start , they began a torrid affair . Their romance destroyed both their marriages ( her fourth , his first ) and caused an even bigger scandal than her previous homewrecking affair . Over the next twelve years , they lived in a whirl of fights , lovemaking , tragedy , alcoholism and gems -- only to divorce , marry and divorce all over again.The story of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton really needs a HBO miniseries , because it 's impossible to cram twenty-plus years of high drama into a 90-minute Lifetime movie . And the rushed pace is only one of the movie 's problems -- cheap-looking costumes , awful greenscreen , and a choppy disjointed narrative.And yes , the writing is eye-rollingly bad ( `` You do know I 'm shagging him senseless , do n't you ? `` ) , but not in a funny way . I hoped this would be an over-the-top , campy funny mess , but it was simply dull and fragmented.But the death knell for this movie is Lohan . I have literally seen cats who give better performances than her . Her performance in this movie is more Tommy Wiseau than Elizabeth Taylor -- a doughy , puffy-faced , larygngitic mess that croaks her way through unconvincing fights and crying jags , unable to even convey BOREDOM.And yes , she is even WORSE when she tries to convey some emotional depth ( `` I am your ocean , but he was your anchor '' ) . For example , Taylor 's `` suicide '' -- complete with prancing , posing and Bella-Swan-style `` despairisms '' -- is one of the worst scenes I have seen on television . EVER.It makes me feel sorry for Grant Bowler , who actually seems to be trying REALLY REALLY HARD despite Lohan and a dreadful script dragging him down . Despite the movie 's awfulness , he does convey some of the tormented , hard-drinking poet , when he is n't being saddled with dreadful dialogue . And David Hunt gives one of the few good performances as Burton 's tragic brother Ifor.I hoped that `` Liz and Dick '' would be a movie that was hilariously , mockably bad ... but no , it 's just tedious and horribly written , with the worst-cast Elizabeth Taylor EVER .	-1
Well , the cover of the DVD with such words as Scandal , Child Star , Love Affair , Paparazzi etc , etc.. You 'd think the movie would be entertaining , interesting , with a sense of taboo that just makes you want to watch it en grossly just much like the real love Story between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was . But No , as a viewer I do n't get that . I do n't get the sense of passionate , scandalous and bizarre love affair . The Only thing I got from watching this Movie is a boring , bland and amateur re-telling of a supposedly legendary love story of two film stars.What else can I say ? Lifeless acting from most of the cast . Especially , Lindsay Lohan . Who ever thought she would do a good job at playing Elizabeth Taylor must 've had a whimsical sense of humor indeed . Not denying that she 's a bad actress watch her act in Mean Girls , The Parent Trap I 've got ta give her some credit for acting in these two movies but in this one . Uh-Uh she just did it all wrong ! I did n't buy her as Elizabeth Taylor , I did n't buy the fact that she was madly in love to the point of damaging her career . She Just seemed off on screen . Not to mention the slim to none resemblance between her and the real Elizabeth , you 'd think she 'll put more effort into acting her role to compensate for that fact but no . I was pretty disappointed , the only thing she seemed to do was memorize lines and repeat them on screen with just a tad bit of emotions coming across . Even in her purposed outbursts she just seemed like a walking corpse that the writers were n't even interested in to begin with so they gave her horrendous lines and a very one dimensional character to portray.The Other actors are n't that great either but since they 're not the main once they can get away with their zombie walks and poor acting skills . The One Playing Burton was acceptable but that 's only because he was surrounded with such lame actors so he stood out as you can say . He tried his best for his defense too bad there was little he could do since the writing itself was n't that helpful.The Movie itself was tasteless . Most of the time the viewers are told that this and that is happening . For Example , that Richard is cheating on his wife with another married woman which is Elizabeth and are deemed sinful in the eyes of the public but it just seems to come so easy for them afterwards . It 's like no one really cares whether they were having an affair or not in such times when things like these were rare . The whole sense of impending danger , the whole sense of scandal is lost in this film.Watching it is like reading an article on the internet about Elizabeth and Richards relationship . That 's all I can say . You might as well just read a 5 minute article instead of wasting your time watching this movie cause that 's all you 're gon na get in the end . The audience do n't get to connect with the characters , we do n't even get to meet them . We just see Lindsay Lohan presumably yelling , screaming , throwing fits of anger , crying , laughing , smoking , complaining , talking , swimming , kissing and whatever else she 's doing on the film . And then the actors are just there . I could care less whatever happens to the characters at the end I do n't even want to know . Even if the director decided to twist the story a little bit and have Elizabeth and Richard Commit suicide like Romeo and Juliet instead of divorcing I still would n't care.I Guess , I should give credit for the writers and producers for taking such a passionate love affair and making it such a boring , tedious and whiny one.And Lindsay Lohan please next time do n't accept a role if you 're not gon na act it properly . I 'm sure the director did n't intend for you to be a wallflower with nice clothes and make up . You Actually have to act out your role you know.I do n't know , if you wan na waste your time then watch this movie other than that skip it completely . I Know I 'm sounding a tad too harsh but it 's my honest opinion .	-1
There is something strangely fascinating about the casting of a downward spiraling Lindsay Lohan as screen icon ( and two time Oscar winner ) Elizabeth Taylor . Lohan is an easy target , to be sure , so I entered into the Lifetime original movie `` Liz & Dick '' with a reasonably open mind . It 's true that this TV movie was lambasted critically , but it also became one of cable 's biggest ratings hits of 2012 . So , if nothing else , the Lohan factor created a certain curiosity . In that way , Lifetime came out the winner . That said , I might not have expected greatness , depth , or insight out of `` Liz & Dick , '' but I did anticipate a bit of fun . With a history of cheesy and over-the-top movies , I thought this might be a genuine guilty pleasure . Highlighting the tempestuous relationship between Taylor and Richard Burton ( played by Grant Bowler , now on SyFy 's Defiance ) , there was lots of room for campy fun . Alas , this never comes to fruition . Too superficial to be truly enlightening and too serious to be much fun , `` Liz & Dick '' does n't make much of a mark at all.The movie is centered , for the most part , around the Cleopatra shoot that put Burton and Taylor together for the first time . Not much in the way of introduction is done for either , so hopefully you know something about each career-wise to put the story into context . Taylor is a diva , Burton a charming boozer . Both are married , but are somehow drawn to one another . Looking at the movie , however , there is nothing to establish this as a grand passion or a legitimate romance . There is a mild opposites attract flirtation and suddenly they are dissolving their marriages . They get together only because they 're supposed to , to heck with demonstrating any real drama or relationship building . This by-the-numbers biography is so vague and unenlightening , they try to add content by staging interludes where Taylor and Burton reminisce in spare interview sequences.If you are familiar with Burton and Taylor , `` Liz & Dick '' offers absolutely no new insight into the pair . Chances are that if you have a preexisting knowledge of this film era and a love of movies , you are already smarter than the film 's screenplay . I feel like this was made as an introduction to those who have zero exposure to the actual back story . But if that 's the case , the movie does n't dig deeply enough into the dynamics of the relationship or provide anything that defines this couple as the Hollywood royalty that they were . As for the performances , the great Theresa Russell is completely wasted as Taylor 's mother . Bowler is likable enough , I suppose , but does n't have much to work with . And Lohan lacks impact as a woman that could captivate the world . Truthfully , though , it is the tepid screenplay that makes `` Liz & Dick '' so dull . As I said , this did n't have to be great but it should have been fun ! KGHarris , 5/13 .	-1
I am truly amazed that I sat through this entire movie . However , you need to realize that I went into it knowing that it would be a train wreck , but it was far worse than I expected . `` Liz and Dick '' is a bloody massacre . For the record , I am actually a member of Team LiLo . As a child star , she showed great potential as a solid B-actress ( remember `` The Parent Trap , '' Freaky Friday , '' and of course the iconic `` Mean Girls ? '' ) . Then Lindsay Lohan grew up , went to rehab 50 times , got arrested 105 times , and unfortunately she has n't shown a whole lot of promise since then . I actually feel bad for her because she was so horribly miscast in this role . Lifetime obviously was desperate for viewers , and they cast LiLo as Elizabeth Taylor because they knew people like me would watch . And I did . And LiLo totally bombed.In fairness , the entire movie is an epic disaster ( the only saving graces are the costumes , so props to the wardrobe mistress ) . First , let 's talk about Lindsay . Ignore the fact that my cat looks more like Liz Taylor than LiLo does ( as I recall , Liz 's entire body was n't covered in freckles ) . Unfortunately , LiLo put absolutely zero effort into preparing for this role . What you see for two hours is LiLo wearing a bunch of dark wigs , speaking in her regular LiLo voice . There was no attempt to master Liz 's signature dialect , or the way she carried herself , or absolutely anything at all . Heck , she did n't even try to ACT most of the time . Everything was completely half-assed . Even when she was playing Angry Drunk Elizabeth and smashing bottles against the wall , her throws were just PITIFUL . It was insulting . The dude playing Richard Burton is only slightly better because he actually tries to act , but just happens to be a really bad actor ( decked out in an even worse hairpiece ) . The sets are awful . The script is languid . And parts of the movie make no sense whatsoever . ( Like , they constantly poke fun at Liz for being chubby , but I read that LiLo is so vain that she refused to wear any kind of fat suit for the film , so Richard is poking fun at fat Liz who is wearing skintight leather pants and ca n't weigh more than 105 pounds . Rewrite , anyone ? ) Everything . Is . SO . AWFUL . If you go into the film expecting to be entertained by watching really bad Lifetime television , like I was , you may end up pleasantly surprised in that `` Liz and Dick '' is ten times worse than anything you could have possible imagined it to be . My husband likened it to watching a high school theatre production , but I think that analogy is insulting to high school actors everywhere . Bottom line : Dame Elizabeth is rolling in her grave right now . I am glad she did n't live to witness this monstrosity .	-1
This is a cheap bad film with bad acting about a Hollywood icon . Save your 99 cents . You 'd be better off watching an episode of the-its so bad its hard to watch- 'Honey Boo-boo '	-1
Liz and Dick were the Brad and Angelina of their era ... on steroids . The tabloids kept us inform of all the dirt in their life . This was a tabloid view at best.The film is told in part as a flashback with narration by Liz ( Lindsey Lohan ) and Dick ( Grant Bowler ) starting with the filming of `` Cleopatra . '' I thought Lindsey Lohan would be right for the role , although she played it without class and style . Oh , they did get the contacts right . I kept waiting for that moment to tie the film together , to make everything I was watching on the screen suddenly become meaningful . It did n't happen . Grant Bowler had the lines down , but face it ... he does n't command the stage presence of Richard Burton.The screenplay was horrible . I do n't think the film could have been any worse if John Belushi had played both title roles .	-1
Movie is bad , but story of Elizabeth ( as she preferred to be called ) and Richard ( as he preferred to be called ) is a slight look into their story , as blurred as it may be.Lindsey not a very good actress but seems to have a connection with Elizabeth ( this role ) .Its not worthy of any awards or a movie screen but if you love The Burton 's you may want to see this .	-1
Did n't really like the show . We tend to watch only G through PG-13 so sometimes we start watching a show because of the rating and decide it is not for us when we get into it . This is what happened with this paticular movie . Wish you had more selection in these catagories.I will never watch an R-rated movie and there seems to be rather a lot of them , on Prime	-1
Well it started slowly and never made a momentum . I turned it off after 30 mints may be if you watch it longer it would make sense .	-1
I 've found that message movies for the most part offer incredibly boring films that while trying to speak from the heart inevitably fail to entertain or hold your attention for long . Rarely does one succeed . For the most part these movies fail miserably and disappear from memory quickly . How many can say that they 're fans of LIONS FOR LAMBS ? You do n't recall it ? Not a surprise.For the most part message movies do n't do much harm , though on rare occasions overzealous film makers tend to offer simplistic discussions promoting a topic they believe rather than an unbiased account . The majority of these movies seem to head straight to DVD rather than receive theatrical runs . That 's not always a bad thing . Once in a while a decent movie comes out and gets into homes this way . Such is the case with A DARK TRUTH.Andy Garcia stars as Jack Begosian , an ex-CIA agent who now hosts his own political talk radio program . Trying to rebuild his life and steer clear of his past , Begosian must face his history when he is asked by one of the owners of a water purification company to investigate the particulars of a small village in South America . It seems that almost everyone there died of something wrong in the water . Begosian at first refuses but when he is told that the leader of a small group trying to get the truth out is Francisco Francis ( Forest Whittaker ) he agrees . It seems that Begosian owes a debt to Francis but we 're not aware of what that is until later.On the run from corrupt leaders and military officials Francis and his group move through the jungle simply trying to avoid capture . Amazingly Begosian has no problem finding them though . He approaches them and offers them help at about the same time the military shows to take out as many as they can . On the run Begosian learns what the actual problem is and that Francis has the proof that will show the world what happened.The message here becomes one of corporate greed and manipulation . The evil corporate giant that has contracts around the world in water purification and management has failed in the small town mentioned before . Rather than seek out a solution to the problem they instead have tried to erase it so they can continue to market their product around the world and increase their wealth . Why they would n't seek out a solution to the problem so they can continue to profit from a good product does n't matter . What matters is portraying corporations as all evil , all bad and all willing to kill to keep information from reaching the public.So yes , the film becomes predictable for the most part . It still is well made and acted and offers some mild entertainment . Just do n't get sucked into the message . Are there terrible corporations in this world who will exploit the masses for a buck ? I have little doubt . But cookie cutting movies will most likely not be the thing that leads to change . Still the movie offers a mild distraction and decent enough production values to make it worth watching .	-1
Jack Begosian ( Andy Garcia ) is a former CIA operative who has retired to Toronto and hosts an all-night talk-radio show . Hey , why not ? For nearly all the movie he anguishes about something in his CIA past , but never tells us any specifics . At the same time , way down in Ecuador , Francisco Francis ( Forest Whitaker ) and his wife Mia ( rifle toting Eva Longoria ) are being chased by the army for undermining a Canadian water purification project headed by evil capitalist Bruce Swinton ( Kim Coates ) .It seems that the huge water corporation screwed things up and allowed typhus to enter the water system , killing many locals . If that was n't bad enough , a corrupt general is executing any and all who try to escape . Tipped off by a suicidal escapee , Swinton 's sister , and major stockholder , Morgan ( Deborah Kara Unger ) convinces Jack with some big bucks to exfiltrate the Francis family , shedding light on the dirty business . Jack reluctantly accepts the assignment realizing it will give him an opportunity to correct what happened when he was last in South America . Oh , and the big bucks.While much of the photography is excellent , writer and director Damian Lee bungle the production with a ridiculous script . Unger does n't help much with her dour characterization that never changes from a zoned out aristocrat . Garcia is much better , especially given the words he has to work with . Kevin Durand is a hired assassin who changes direction , one that is easily foreseen . Even with its heart in the right place , the film is preachy to a fault .	-1
Well , let 's give it points for trying , but A Dark Truth , a new Canadian produced echo-thriller unfortunately ca n't get it 's act together . It 's self important and semi-pretenses , but it ca n't be said that it does n't means well . Few movies address the issue of water rights in South America , and dare I say , even fewer action movies do . So , trying must account for something , but the sad truth is that A Dark Truth is a bust that never manages to succeed in it ` s intent , but it 's intentions are noble enoughThe nearly always reliable Andy Garcia , recently and bewildering returning to leading man status , stars as Jack Begoison , a former CIA operative turned talk radio host . He lives in Canada , which might explain why his radio show is n't a bunch of crazy rants about the supervise political message of Dr. Seus ' the Lorax or that the Dark Knight Rises is an attack on a prominent Republican candidate . Although , one caller does ask about aliens in the white house . All of this has next to nothing to do with the movie , so let 's get back to that.From writer/director Damien Lee , who has more than twenty films to his directing credit , movies such as Abraxas , Guardian of the Universe ( starring Jesse Ventura ) and Terminal Rush ( with `` Rowdy '' Roddy Piper ) , among other movies you have n't seen and other titles you ` ll scoff at , . Lee seems to be prolific in the video/DVD world , I hesitate to say efficient , but I do n't think I have ever seen a movie he has made before . However , I feel safe in assuming this movie inadequacies are due to his rather dubious skills.A Dark Truth comes across looking very bad . It 's not well made , rather dull in it 's cinematography and editing . It 's writing is more an assembling of clich & eacute ; s than an actually story , and some of the performances are rather lifeless . It 's the kind of theatrical film that only the first week of January can deliver.It can only be surmised that actors , a talented lot like Garcia , Eva Longoria , Forest Whitaker , Deborah Kara Unger , Kim Coates and Steven Bauer came on board this film because they believed in it 's message . Which is more understandable than wanting to say I just made a movie for the director ofAbraxas . Unfortunately , the message is lost in this muddled mess and all that 's left is a sad looking and less than entertaining jungle adventure . Whitaker seems asleep most of the time and Coates for the first time makes for a dull villain , it 's a shame when Bauer gives the best performance.About the half way point , A Dark Truth , abandons it 's original serious minded intent and becomes a rather indolent and generic action flick . The action scenes are badly filmed , too boat . Then it precedes to go on for too long fast tracking itself into a preachy On Deadly Ground style bummer . A Dark Truth may long to be a message film , but it ends up being the kind of movie that Tom Berenger used to make . I think few will see it , and even fewer will take anything useful from it.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com	-1
Why are things like this on tv ? We do n't have enough senseless violence in this country ? Enough people who get off on others ' misery ?	-1
You have some interesting actors in this movie , however , the script is so unbelievable . The movie never really comes together because the characters do n't have any chemistry .	-1
Mindless brutality has been done so many times it 's tiresome . Three Alabama `` rebel orphans '' take a freelance job to swipe a valuable kid from a crime kingpen .

& # 34 ; If I ca n't have him no one can. & # 34 ; When Celeste ( Longoria ) wants to get her son back from her abusive ex Carlod ( Thornton ) she turns to three redneck brothers . Taking him back was easy , avoiding the odd gangs that are after them proves to be a little tougher . This is yet another movie where my expectations were apparently way to high . Also this is another movie where they put two big stars on the poster , but not really in the movie . They are in it more then Bruce Willis seems to be in his movies lately but they both did about 3 days of work each . Other then that the movie is a little boring . Really full of action and comedy but I had a hard time getting into this . I 'm not sure what was missing because I usually like movies like this but I really could n't get into this . Overall , I was very disappointed by this , was hoping for something more exciting . I give it a C+	-1
I could not stand any of these characters at all just annoying low life people that just did dumb things for no reason at all . If it was n't because of that it would be an alright alien movie . The alien was kinda cool looking and the effects were n't too bad . The overall setting and atmospherewas that good either and just felt like a rushed movie for some reason . Not a fan but that 's just me and there are way better alien movies out there . If your bored than I guess check it out .	-1
We go to London for this latest creature feature based flick , where the contents of a secret military plane are scattered about the city . Despite the city being locked down some people totally oblivious to this fact enter a storage facility and become trapped ( come on you were expecting a movie called `` Storage 24 '' to NOT take place in a storage building ? ) . At first things do n't seem all bad but soon it becomes clear that there is something inside with them and it 's on the prowl , that 's really about it folks.The early part with the plane crashing and the aftermath that occured was actually pretty well done . Sadly after the decent opening portions it boils down to a run and hide flick , the people inside try to avoid this creature , which for the budget does n't look horrible in short shots but the longer ones of it do show how goofy it looks . There 's a lot and I mean a lot of `` Do n't go in there '' or `` Do n't separate '' moments with all involved , but of course for the sake of the movie they all do stupid things that lead to their demise.There 's not a lot of scary parts , even the ones that involve the monster , in fact creepiest part was when one of the actors stumbles into a storage unit holding a bunch of creepy looking mannequins . I suppose the dark storage building was supposed to lend some good atmosphere to this typical plot , but there 's a lot of uneeded drama and bickering between some of the key characters that bogs portions of the film down.Others have compared how bad `` Storage 24 '' is with `` Skyline '' , which I can understand but to me `` Skyline '' was much more irritating . `` Storage 24 '' is a pretty basic and badly acted monster movie but nothing more , `` Skyline '' seemed like it was aiming for something more and even a possible sequel from how it ended . * out of 4 stars .	-1
At least that 's what they attempted . But it does n't really scare and it does n't really make any sense . Now , I 'm thinking my rating may have been too high . Is it a government conspiracy ? Is it a love story ? Is it an extra-terrestrial takeover ? Is it a story about a phobia of toy dogs ? Yeah , it was watchable . And this could have been a really good movie had the writers taken one of those ideas ( maybe not the toy dog phobia ) and stuck with it . Bascially something falls from the sky into a storage center . Conviently , the people at the center are locked into it because of a malfunctioning chain link gate . And now the story gets falls off the rails . Starting with the silly woman walking her dog who decides to investigate the fallen metal container . Men in Black in cars suddenly show up , only to never be seen again . Oh , nothing happens to them , the writers decided not to use them anymore . So we 're introduced to the love broken guy from Dr. Who and his best friend , who he finds out later ... well , you 'll see . Throw in an old coot who 's squatting in one of the storage pods , a creepy basement , toy dogs and fireworks , air ducts ( a la ALIEN ) , a twist in the love story , and a creature that looks like a cross between the Predator and a dinosaur . Actually , something you might see in a more intelligent version of Dr Who . And at the end , you 're waiting for the good Doctor to show up to rescue you from whatever is the new plot that the writers have devised . Actually , it looks like something they stole from 2010 's Skyline , which is an even worse alien invasion movie . But it 's too late for this plot because the credits start rolling . The cast deserves better than this and so do you .	-1
I felt like the producers were attempting to remake ALIENS without the big budget or a scary enough creature . My dogs fell asleep on this one . They 'll usually watch just about anything . Not tonight ! BOOORRRIIIINNNNGGGGG !	-1
The only thing I can say positive about Storage 24 is that the alien monster is great . It 's an old fashion rubber monster man-in-a-suit kind of thing . But in this modern age , such a cheesy effect is bound to turn more people off than to win them over . And this is without a single doubt the best part of this agonizingly bad , cheaply made grade B with a minus British made mix of sci-fi and horror . A barrage of misogyny and stupidity that follows is bound to please only least demanding of paying customers , which I hope there are few.It all starts off with the slight twinkle of promise as an unexplained alien monster is on the loose inside of a storage unit . Also on the loose is a hand full of employees and patrons who are inexplicably trapped inside the storage facility with our guest from another world.So far , so good , but that 's all about to change . because in no time at all , Storage 24 becomes a terrible prime time soap with a slimy monster who seems to change size given the requirements of any given scene . Sometimes he 's human size , others he seems to tower above them . And this is only the beginning of this movies faults.Storage 24 was written by actors Noel Clarke and Marc Small , along with Davie Fairbanks , it is surprising in it 's lack of good roles for just about anybody . The characters are simple one dimensional , obnoxious and unlikable . All the female roles are self-center , treacheras bitches . The men , self-loathing cowards.The acting is just shy of dismal . Not one of the cast members manage to give any substance to their roles , a few of them look like they would rather be home watching telly , which you can ` t blame them . Leading lady Antonio Campbell-Hughes is a new kind of low for any actor who is not a professional athlete or musician making there way intro film.Given this material , one could imagine a very funny movie from Simon Pegg , Nick Frost and Edgar Wright , but alas , it is not meant to be . Storage 24 is ungodly stupid , uninspired and worst painfully dull . Little more than a sub par retread of many other similar movies , some better , few not . The one that Storage 24 most resembles is that great summer turkey the Watch , perhaps my least favorite movie of last year . Yes , the kind of movie we all want to see more of . Showing that it is n't just us yanks who are creatively bankrupt.There is an appalling lack of interest here and zero energy to sustain the long 87 minute running time . Director Johannes Roberts , behind the gladly unseen DTD flicks like Hellbender and Forest of the Damned , clearly has no eye for the camera . Shot in a single location , not only does that let you know it 's cheap , it just looks it and feels it even more . Roberts has given us an amateur hour and a half here . You wont be able to believe such a movie is still released into American cinemas . Even going in with low expectations , you will be astonished at how low they would have had to have been.In my original review for Movie Zone , I gave this stinker a half of a star , but amazon wont let me do that . They should allow me an exception , they do n't understand the pain I went through sitting through this.read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com	-1
The story is poor , the acting is fair , the monster is laughable , and even the broader scope of there being an alien invasion of Earth rather than this being an isolated incident is not enough to make this film interesting . Do n't bother !	-1
[ Contains mild spoilers ] A military cargo plane crashes in Battersea . London , and because of the power failure , a group of people is trapped inside `` Storage 24 , '' including Charlie ( Noel Clarke , who also co-wrote ) and his ex-girlfriend Shelly ( Antonia Campbell-Hughes ) , as well as their friends Mark ( Colin O'Donoghue ) and Nikki ( Laura Haddock ) . But it seems there is someone or something in the facilities , too , that is not very friendly to them.You have heard the same story somewhere before . You have seen a young lady with a dog that keeps barking at something in the dark . You have seen some gooey substance dripping from above . Imagine what follows these scenes and that 's exactly what you get in `` Storage 24 , '' a B sci-fi horror film that does these things in a lazier and less impressive way than , say , `` Alien , '' almost to the point of a parody.But the film 's greatest problem is neither the familiar premise nor the cheesy effects ; it is those annoying characters about whom I did n't care . I honestly cheered for the poor `` intruder '' that at least did n't keep whining throughout the story.In short , `` Storage 24 '' is `` Skyline '' without special effects , or `` Attack the Block '' without humor .	-1
Do not waste your money or time watching this fake `` mystery-documentary '' . This show is another in the recent trend of tricking people into buying a program with the enticement that they are going to see a documentary about a subject that is new or at least out of the mainstream but are instead shown 44 minutes of an unqualified host getting on planes , driving in cars , hiking and camping out , sometimes talking to supposed indigenous people and lots of talking to other unqualified `` experts '' about how mainstream ( translation : real experts ) do n't agree with what they say in the script . It 's obvious that the host and his gaggle of fake experts do n't believe a word of the gibberish they spout . This program 's host is one of the poorest actors . None of the hosts of these fraudulent `` mystery-documentaries '' do a very good job of convincing you that they actually believe the nonsense they recite from the script . This program 's host is utterly unconvincing , obviously unqualified and unacceptably foul-mouthed . He obviously thinks he 's being edgy when he cusses which kills any likability . This series was conceived by a gang of unscrupulous people who wanted to get in on the 'Ancient Aliens ' misrepresentation bonanza . And no , it 's not `` good fun '' . It is not funny that people are making and selling these fabricated `` mystery-documentaries '' .	-1
Tim really is a jerk . When you have someone as great as Clate , you find a way to keep him . The project probably cost one million dollars . And they ended up with $ 17,000 . That is a huge failure , they lost more than 98 % of their money . They totally tore up everything , like the hill they washed away and the jungle they made a road through . And for what ? For less than a pound of gold ? The real gold is the TV royalties ! If you 're going to contrive a show , at least do it well .	-1
After watching several of these gold-hunter shows , I 've come to thank God repeatedly that I do n't work for some stupid jerk boss ( like the jackass in this show ) who thinks its ok to run people into the ground , endanger their lives , violate safety practices at every turn , ( OSHA/MSHA would have a field day if this happened in the US ! ! ! ) and flat out does n't care if they live or die . I pray these workers find suitable employment elsewhere .	-1
Not sure what other topic could possibly be turned into a reality show ... ..This ones pretty ridiculous . I have to admit it becomes entertaining , even with the ridiculously OVER dramatization by the narrator/VoiceOver dude ... What annoys me is the fact that the well being of the Amazon is completely disregarded by the greed of gold by way of a lazy , fat Alabama man.100+ year old Trees are bulldozed by the dozen , the ground is excavated and left in shambles and the incredibly eroding , polluting envirmentally polluting cost of mining is never addressed . I hope the producers of this ridiculous show had to pay millions to the locals who will be left with the clean up of the un repairable mess this fools leave behind in the name of entertainment	-1
The bottom subtitles blend in so much with the image on the screen , they are impossible to read . Disappointing . I could n't watch it . But the art looked great for the five minutes I watched . The subtitles need a solid background to you can read them ( and quickly ) .	-1
`` A Little Bit Zombie '' is what happens when fans of a movie make a movie . Look , we all love `` Evil Dead '' - or to be precise , we all really love `` Evil Dead II '' because anyone who watches the first installment and expects the hilarious humor of the sequel is in for the shock of their lives - but there 's a fine line between an homage and a lame copy . Unfortunately `` A Little Bit Zombie '' is a little bit in the latter category.The plot , such as it is , centers on HR manager Steve ( Kristopher Turner ) who is marrying salon stylist and high maintenance fianc & eacute ; e Tina ( Crystal Lowe ) . There 's just one problem : Steve 's sister and maid of honor Sarah ( Kristen Hager ) hates Tina , and it 's easy to see why . Fortunately , Steve 's best friend Craig ( Shawn Roberts ) is also Sarah 's husband and is there to provide moral support . Things take a turn for the hilarious when Steve is bitten by a zombie mosquito and slowly begins to turn into a cannibalistic brain-eater . Hunted by a magic orb-wielding hottie Penelope ( Emilie Ullerup ) and crotchety shotgun-wielding Max ( Stephen McHattie ) , it seems our fun foursome are about to experience a very bad weekend in the woods.The cast is a problem . Turner is passable as a normal guy just trying doing his best to avoid nibbling on his friends ' brains , but Lowe is pretty bad in a role that requires her to carry much of the humor . Her inability to keep up with Hager of `` Being Human '' fame is apparent - the roles could easily have been reversed , as there 's more chemistry between Hager and Turner than there is between Turner and Lowe . Ew.The zombie hunters are n't much better . McHattie plays Max as a psychopath who will blow anything up at a moment 's notice , which is probably supposed to be funnier than it is . For a great example of McHattie 's talent put to good use against zombies , see `` Pontypool . '' Blonde bombshell Ullerup speaks her lines with her usual wide-eyed wooden acting - if you 've seen her turn as Ashley Magnus in `` Sanctuary , '' you know what to expect here.Fortunately , `` A Little Bit Zombie '' does n't take itself too seriously . Yes , the homages to `` Evil Dead '' are over the top , from the shed scene to the chuckle-worthy evil-point-of-view-cam , but the film 's heart is in the right place even if it the script does n't hit most of the comedy beats . The ending is appropriately off-key and at least ironic enough to make it worth sticking with the film . `` A Little Bit Zombie '' is n't very gory , is n't very funny , and is n't very good - but then it is n't trying to be . It 's just a little bit of all three that makes it a passable entry in the zombie humor genre .	-1
All one need look at is the prevalence of Oprah Winfrey evolving into her own network ( OWN , indeed ! ) to realize that women & # 8217 ; s issue matter in the burgeoning world of pop culture . And I say that as a man ! Women have their own unique struggles , they have their own unique baggage , much of which gets passed down from generation to generation . They cross that threshold from childhood to adulthood . They bear children . They send their boys and girls off to fight wars . They experience their own hateful form of peer pressure from girl-to-girl that probably gives them nightmares on up in through menopause.Despite the fact that commercial advertising has told you that you & # 8217 ; ve come a long way , baby , maybe we as a society haven & # 8217 ; t gone far enough ? That & # 8217 ; s some of what & # 8217 ; s in the heart of SAVING GRACE B. JONES , a period piece tearjerker brought to you by living legend , Connie Stevens . ( NOTE : The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters . If you & # 8217 ; re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free , then I & # 8217 ; d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment . If , however , you & # 8217 ; re accepting of a few modest hints at & # 8216 ; things to come , & # 8217 ; then read on & # 8230 ; ) For nearly 20 years , Grace ( played by the incomparable Tatum O & # 8217 ; Neal ) has resided in the care of a state asylum for the insane . Her brother , Landy ( the reliable Michael Biehn ) , finally secures her release , and he & # 8217 ; s bound and determined to bring her home to live with his wife , Bea ( Penelope Ann Miller ) and child . However , secrets never die in Small Town America , and while the townfolks are more involved with stopping the mounting flood waters Grace won & # 8217 ; t hold back her own dire emotions in this tale laced with jilted love and misplaced affection.The good ? I love seeing Michael Biehn in practically anything , and his turn as the small-town baker here is pretty solid . ( Granted , he & # 8217 ; ll never quite look the part , but he does what he & # 8217 ; s paid to do ! ) Also , I could sit and watch Penelope Ann Miller read the label of a mayonnaise jar because I & # 8217 ; m that interested in watching her work . Lastly , there & # 8217 ; s a great roundtable of young actresses in this that are clearly destined to have some very good careers . Writer/director Connie Stevens has put together a winning ensemble around Tatum O & # 8217 ; Neal that looks and sounds pretty spiffy.The bad ? Well , it just wasn & # 8217 ; t all that interesting . Maybe that says more about me as a viewer and a critic than it does the film , but , for all of the posturing , whining , and moaning in this Peyton Place kinda/sorta wannabe , I just didn & # 8217 ; t feel all that motivated . Inspired . Or interested.Now , that may speak to Connie Stevens & # 8217 ; weaknesses as a storyteller . In a career that spanning nearly seven decades ( you read that right ) , she & # 8217 ; s best known as a luscious blonde with terrific comic timing . FYI : this is only her second screenplay , and it & # 8217 ; s based on a true story . I tend to think that something was lost in the adaptation process that maybe a more learned , more experienced scriptwriter could & # 8217 ; ve positively affected & # 8211 ; namely , emotional journeys that resonate for all of the characters and not so few . Of course , I & # 8217 ; m not questioning the relevance of the subject matter , as even today societies around the world continue to struggle with how to confront mental illness . By this film & # 8217 ; s tragic conclusion , I thought I was losing my mind trying to keep it all together.As much as I wanted to enjoy GRACE , in the end I thought it was a bit of a narrative mess , not unlike Grace & # 8217 ; s own fragile mind . Not enough of it made perfect sense , but I couldn & # 8217 ; t force myself to look away , even when I tried . Exceptional performances across the board just weren & # 8217 ; t enough to make this world come alive the way it should.SAVING GRACE B. JONES ( 2009 ) is produced by Shane Productions . DVD distribution is being handled by Arc Entertainment . As for the technical specifications ? This is one smartly shot period drama ( 1940 & # 8217 ; s/1950 & # 8217 ; s ) , and it works very well from start to finish though there was one sequence wherein it was blatantly obvious actor Scott Wilson & # 8217 ; s dialogue was dubbed in post-production . Lastly , I & # 8217 ; d be remiss in my duties if I failed to point out that the film and actresses were highly decorated as part of the 2012 New York City International Film Festival , and the feature won & # 8216 ; Best Dramatic Feature & # 8217 ; at the 2011 Los Angeles Women & # 8217 ; s International Film Festival . Kudos to all involved . Unfortunately , the disc offers no special features to speak of.INTERESTING but it & # 8217 ; s honestly still HARD TO RECOMMEND . At 116 minutes , SAVING GRACE B. JONES is just too darn long . It & # 8217 ; s clear to see why this is a favorite of critics & # 8211 ; it indicts small-town America for something the entire world has difficulty with , and that & # 8217 ; s recognizing not only how to deal with deep-rooted psychological problems but also how to deal with them & # 8211 ; and critics love to see America brought to its knees . At best , JONES is the kind of film that might be worthy of film club study ; otherwise , it & # 8217 ; s pretty easy to see why this one took so long to find a distributor to the masses at large.In the interests of fairness , I & # 8217 ; m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Arc Entertainment provided me with a DVD copy of SAVING GRACE B. JONES by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review ; and their contribution to me in no way , shape , or form influenced my opinion of it .	-1
My wife and I found this movie to be quite boring . It seemed like it would never end .	-1
Apparently this movie is based on a true story . It is a depressing story and one that in my opinion , did not need to be told .	-1
PLOT SPOILER REVIEW.This is based on a true story : Connie Stevens once read a Steinbeck novel . The beginning of the film introduces Carrie , a 10 year old girl ( Rylee Fansler ) whose function is to supply some needless narration . She is not a major character in the film and I kept wondering how she was going to fit into the scope of things with Grace ( Tatum O'Neal ) .Landy ( Michael Biehn ) has the patience of a saint as he takes in Carrie and decides now would be a good time to get his & # 34 ; crazy & # 34 ; sister to come home against the wishes of the asylum . Grace causes issues , not unlike a Steinbeck novel we all know and love . The film introduces religion into the film which did n't seem to have a point , as did the film itself.The film was long and slow . It was like watching the rain come down ... which we did . The adult performances were spectacular . Michael Biehn was unrecognizable from his normal & # 34 ; B ' acting role . Tatum was Oscar worthy consideration . The girls left something to be desired . Too bad Dakota Fanning had to grow up.Overall , this was a tiresome film by Connie Stevens , who I enjoy more in front of the camera than behind.No F-bombs or nudity . Brief sex/love scene .	-1
Talentless and bland , just like Portland itself . Constantly trying to hook onto some form of kitsch or pop-culture to make itself relevant and consistently failing to do so . If you watch this program while actually thinking , you begin to come to the conclusion that the earth is very much overpopulated and the cultivation of the excess should immediately start with C and D list celebs so they do not further detract from humanity as a whole with pablum such as this .	-1
This was not funny at all . It is just an excuse for people to cus for no reason and pretend there is a legitimate reason for it .	-1
there are some pretty good episodes in this season , but the only thing is it is the same exact one 's they show on cable , I hate that I spend money on this , its season 25 and they only have like seasons 19-25 , what the hell happened to the first 18 seasons then ? ? ? that 's ridiculous seriouslyevery week I remember one of my new or old favorite tv shows that I want to watch so I come onto amazon to buy the season ... .after this bull though , im done , not going to be buying anything from amazon streaming anymore now.amazon wants to be so stupid and cheap to have seasons 19-25 but not the first 18 , that 's what happens when your cheap ! ! people leave and take their money with them	-1
too boring ... after 4 or 5 episodes ... gave up and just watched the last one which i fast forwarded through anywayThe stories are just dumb and dumber ... actually ended up rooting for Ava and Boyd .These & # 34 ; good guy & # 34 ; people are too mean including Winnona AND the religious freak who conned the public herself .	-1
I have in the past really liked Timothy Olyphant ( like in Deadwood ) , and I found earlier seasons of Justified kinda entertaining . Olyphant has the ability to play a straight-arrow hero in a unique and wonderful way . The trouble with Justified is that he has become less and less heroic . He does n't stand for anything , anymore . He seems just like the low-lifes he pursues , except he 's got a badge . Nothing important is at stake - just whether the addicts of Harlan County get their fix . I say leave them alone with their devices , Raylan . Oh , and do we have to put up with a whole new helping of overdone evangelical crap ? We 've already seen all this in the first season . False preaching can only divert us for so long . I wish they would transplant Raylan Givens to some city where some dastardly plot is afoot that actually matters to somebody . Get him out of the backwoods , please ! And make him a bit serious , not just a facetious lout who ca n't stay out of trouble .	-1
Each season seems to get more violent and profane and I question if it is really necessary . The staging is superb and Raylon is a true hero in his job , but we really do n't have to see the steamy bedroom scenes to know that he is one sexy dude . We swore off for a while to let them cool down but go back from time to time to see another edition . Glad I do n't have kids I 'm trying to shield from all this obscenity . Even so , it is still excellent drama .	-1
After watching the first episode I said this . Kinda wish I had n't paid for the whole season first , but I 've always liked Megan Goode as an actress and assumed this would be GREAT . Anyways ... ..It 's not a completely terrible series but it was n't `` spectacular '' like everyone else is raving , and the writers/producers definitely could have summed it up within 90 mins . This should 've been a 90min B-Movie straight to DVD and aired on Cinemax or BET-Starz.Also I was really annoyed how they had her jumping on her cellphone every other minute to report her findings ALL LOUD & IN THE OPEN to her FBI contact . Spying on peoples computers 2 secs after they 'd leave the room while AGAIN talking loud telling everything to her FBI contact via cellphone . No one would be dumb enough to do that , ESPECIALLY an undercover cop . They could have tried a little bit better with writing that in.Seriously , I 'm 1.7 episodes in and I 'm already bored & feeling like this is redundant & going no where . They 've already revealed `` Who Dunnit '' & ALL the dirty secrets in episode 1 . Like , why should I watch any further ? *lol* This is another reason why this series could have ended after the first episode . The audience has been made aware of everything , the rest is just filler & boring content . I see WHY this series wa n't renewed , strange that people keep posting `` Why did they cancel this show ! ? '' Cuz it SUCKED thats why . As a series it 's a 1-Star as a B-Movie it 's a 3-Star .	-1
I liked the story but actors are at least supposed to be educated and all the cussing was completely unnecessary .	-1
I use the series to help me sleep . The plot and characters are pretty much the same ... and on and on ... .	-1
This is a live aquarium with real fish and loud bubbling noise . Nothing wrong with watching fish live but they tend to be shy and inactive . I 'll have to admit that if I want an aquarium on my computer or TV screen I would rather have the animated variety - it 's much more interesting .	-1
It 's too bad that the obnoxious personality of Abby and some of the Dance Moms ( Kelly and Christy especially ) are making this show so difficult to watch . I love to see the kids dance but the behavior of these Moms are making it difficult for me to continue watching . I would get rid of Christy and Kelly and leave Nia 's Mom and Asia 's with a new group of Moms . What happened in New Orleans was unbelievable , especially because these women are supposedly wealthy enough to have had some education . Although their grammar is horrendous . Do they not teach grammar in Pennsylvania . These mothers , in my opinion , do for Pennsylvania what Jersey Shore and Jerseylicious did for New Jersey .	-1
Much of this show is out right child abuse as these blood sucking , low life adults `` use '' their children to get fame or money , even if in the process they must be the worst examples of parenthood to those beautiful wonderful kids the have.Years from now you 'll see these sweet children with a myriad of issues , trying to figure out what happened to themselves on a show where `` NO '' love or forgiveness or any positive support is given at all.Just taking a child in your arms , even if they foul something up badly , and praising their effort never happens here , and NEVER , EVER happens from that lazy tub of lard Abby , unless it somehow makes `` HER '' look good . The child is all but forgotten amidst all the desperate problems of the parents . I ca n't come close to watching this horrid psycho drama of tearing down our best gifts in the world until their just like the selfish parents that gave them birth ... .a total mess.Yeah , that 's what kids need at that age is more pressure and more competition to see who 's `` worthwhile '' in life . Who 's top dog or top top of my `` whittle pyramid . '' Makes me sick to my stomach to see how they treat these fantastically talented young girls.NOT ONE parent would put up with a boss like Abby , for two minutes in real life , until charges would be filed , but these moms are ADDICTED to abuse , and all hang on to each other for the ride.Disgusting and un-watachable .	-1
Why is n't the episode from last night not here yet ? I have been noticing it more and more that the tv shows that you buy from here are starting to take longer and longer to get : (	-1
I loved this show but Abbey is going over the top . Her behavior is bordering on emotional abuse and bullying of children . People were outraged over last Tammi on last year 's season of Basketball Wives . Abbey is getting pretty close and she 's pulling her antics on CHILDREN . What kind of example is being set for them ? ? ? Is this like Lance Armstrong syndrome , that you do whatever to win ? ? ? ? That they have to be in abusive situations to be on a winning team ? I 'll have to pass on this show from now on . I ca n't condone children being in this environment .	-1
If you want to pissed off and more irritated with your day , then by all means watch this show ... if you value your sanity , logic and reason ... then DO NOT . I now feel more stupid having watched part of a couple episodes . I now grieve at the loss of the hour or 2 of my life that I will never get back .	-1
I have no idea why I watch this show , probably for the same reason people start at train wrecks . It revolves around this dysfunctional dance teacher , Abby Lee Miller , who , despite her personality flaws , seems to be very good at watch she does because she produces beautiful , winning dances for her competitive dancing team as well as some of her individual dancers . She favors two sisters over the rest of the group . The older one is definitely talented , but one wonders if she 's more successful in competitions because she gets so much more time and attention from Abby than the other girls . That 's mostly because the mother is the typical brown-noser we 've all known and disliked at some point in our lives . The Dance Moms are dysfunctional personalities like Abby . I do n't understand why they have not all ( except the one mentioned previously ) been arrested for child abuse for exposing their children to Abby 's mistreatment . They are all dumber than boxes of rocks . One even has a Ph.D , but apparently not a lot of common sense . ( On one episode , one of the moms did n't know who Ann Frank was ) . The moms fight Abby , fight among themselves , fight a competing dance teacher ( as does Abby ) and the whole thing is really a hot mess . The main reason I like to watch it is to see the girls dance . The girls are the best thing about the show . They all seem to be sweet , lovely , and talented , which makes the Moms even more culpable for putting up with the treatment Abby dishes out . One has to wonder if the money is really worth destroying the self-confidence ( which anyone with children can see is happening ) of these charming young girls . It makes me glad my daughter was into sports .	-1
I watched the first episode and kept waiting for the good guys , i.e . ordinary citizens fighting a world taken over by corporations , to win . It quickly became clear that ordinary people were the BAD GUYS in a world run for and by corporations . I guess if they produce enough of these , impressionable children will think that is a good thing . Adults not so much . They own the media I wo n't add my hard earned entertainment dollar to support this propaganda .	-1
So I was really looking forward to this show . I looks like hard sci-fi . Which I love . It 's got two actresses whom I like . Lexa Doig ( Andromeda ) and Jennifer Spence ( SGU ) . X-file 's `` smoking man '' is in it . And it is Canadian SYFY ( I love Sanctuary & Lost Girl ) . So this seemed like a shoe in . Ugh ! 1 ) 65 years is not enough time for corporations to take over the world and impose a police state . I mean , that 's just lame . 2 ) 65 years is not enough time for us to have all that great tech . Biometrically calibrated suits ? Transformer guns ? Come'on ! 165 years ... maybe . But barely 6 centuries ? . No , I do n't think so.3 ) How is the Kiera 's husband not a terrorist when he totally over react to her being stationed in the execution room . ) Even though I know it was old Alex 's doing . 4 ) All the ethnic people are bad . 5 ) One more , all the ethnic people are bad . 7 ) Let me say that again . There are only 2 black dudes and 2 asians ... all bad . 8 ) The `` bad guys '' are the anti corporation Liber8 ( lame name ! ) and the `` good guys '' are corporations ? ! Really ? Is this show funded by BP ? 9 ) Alex , the wunderkin , runs a sky net style lab in his shady ( Those folks look all kinds of suspect ! ) parents barn ? ! I could go on . This show just was n't my cup of tea . The science is lack luster and while the tech seems cool it is is just not believable . I will give this one more chance only because I love SYFY but it better get good real quick because I simply do n't have the emotional stamina to watch a whole show that promises to be awesome science fiction and delivers nothing but badly thought out she-ite . I 'm looking at you Lost .	-1
What must TV execs think of the American populace that this kind of thing keeps getting on the air ? What must we think of ourselves to allow it ? You could not put together a more forgettable cast if you assembled all the recurring background characters from the entire series run of Law & Order . It is painful to watch this and anyone , writer , actor , set designer , or gaffer involved in it that thinks it or themselves are anything close to humorous needs to rethink their entire life . At the end of the day , though , they should all be grateful that in spite of how spectacularly empty and tasteless this show is , it is still not as bad as `` Whitney '' .	-1
This is one of the 'must pass ' shows of the season . Bill Pullman plays the president in a comedy ensemble -- trying to convince viewers that the 'First Family ' also has problems like other Americans.It would be a great premise , except the scripts really suck . In the pilot , the eldest son Skip Gilchrist Jr. ( Josh Gad ) manages to get himself booted from college . Not only that , but the audiences are supposed to actually believe that in the 21st century , these pyrotechnic exploits would not make the 24-hour and international news cycle . Somehow everything is kept esentially hush-hush . It 's dropped after the pilot ? Since Skip 's higher education career essentially ended , he 's now trying to help out dad . He does this by unwittingly botching a tennis game which dad was supposed to let the visiting elected official win . Again , no concept of reality . If the President knows about diplomacy , he is not going to let his idiot clown son screw up a social event . Appearances do matter.I wonder who had connections at the network to authorize this series ?	-1
NO rating . Never got to see the preview . Tried to watch it but the Amazon system would n't make it happen . After a few tries I just gave up and got it elsewhere .	-1
This is one of my few negative comments because Taken 2 has been out long enough that it should be offered for streaming with prime . This extended preview was a mistake . I thought it was the real show disappointing .	-1
I mean , seriously . Pretty sure the even used the exact same lines . G. R. O. S. S. How lazy and terrible .	-1
because I dislike when villains leave the hero conveniently alone so the hero can escape . And how about when the Liam Neeson character was about to be taken captive and the villains kindly allowed him to place a telephone call . Filmmakers need to make smarter villains . There were what twenty villains , and they were all looking at telly or sleeping , when their job was to be guarding Liam and his ex-wife ; how do villains keep their job if they do it so poorly - not believable they were all so inept . I did like the use of the daughter , I think she has the makings of an agent herself and hope that future sequels pursue that story line . Dislike the editing , cut so choppily I could barely tell what 's happening during the fight sequences . Two and a half stars.Final thoughts : I think the Liam Neeson character needs to train his ex-wife/daughter so they at least have some defensive skills , as often as not one or both are in the thick of things in these films . What if the Liam character gets shot ; it 'd be great if the women could take care of themselves or maybe even rescue him should he ever need it . Having everybody strong , including the women , would be great to see .	-1
Just watching ticket writers got boring . My favorite part was the impound lot and when that was gone it lost its humor .	-1
Why anyone with half a brain find this interesting is beyond me.Is this society so stupid that this is acceptable to take time to watch ? Yeah , I guess so ... 3rd season..honestly I ca n't even stand to look at them.I thought I would just ck it out and it 's just horrid..I think it 's sad that thisis being produced..of course it 's tons of money for the producers and that 's why.If I could have put a zero rating I would have .	-1
I 'm suprised they would make a series like this . A person would need to be very bored to make it through even one of these .	-1
This show proves that Staten Island , NY is a vast intellectually defunct wasteland . Its stupid funny watch only if you have time to kill	-1
why would anyone be interested in these women ? Just bad , rude behavior that they seem quite proud of . Just no value at all .	-1
So much to say and I tried to be fair but I turned it off about 1/3 of the way through .	-1
Okay . This is supposed to be Lovecraftian ... right ? Well , BARELY . Just because there is an amorphous many eyed monster in it does NOT make it Lovecraftian . I'v been a Lovecraft fan for 40+ years and I 'm pretty sure the man from Providence would have declared it `` utter rubbish . '' the script is bad , the acting is bad , it is n't funny ( although it tries to sell iself as such ) and of course it is true that it should n't be ... but it belaboredly tries to be . This junk bites the big pickle .	-1
I watched this on one of the many sites on which you can watch movies free . Just google the name of a movie and `` watch online '' and you 'll find them . Anyhow we can screw Hollyweird , I 'm on board for that , since they screw us every chance they get with their crap movies . Even free , this film was n't worth watching .	-1
I never read the book . I hated this movie . First of all , I could barely understand what the main character was saying most of the time . Regardless , it was n't entertaining , just annoying . I 'm guessing that it is `` trying '' to be intellectual , but I just found it to be fragmented , distasteful and uninteresting . This movie jumps around , has a lot of ineffective voice overs and comes across as a poorly made B movie .	-1
If anyone gave this movie 5 stars they are definitely a high teenager . This is bound to be one of those cheesy cult classics in 10 years , but for now it 's just terrible . The story was okay but the acting was awful and comedy was a joke ( that pun is funnier than anything in the movie ) . I rolled the dice on this movie because of Paul Giamatti who is awesome , but he is only in this movie for like 7 minutes ( the best 7 minutes ) . He was also the producer of the film ( why ? ) .This one has crappy special effects , B and C actors , and is a waste of $ 3.99 . Trust me - pick something else .	-1
This is a film for those that are easily entertained.It 's just weird how movies like `` Red Lights '' that require the viewer to think and use a bit of critical thinking skills to tie the plot together will get bombed reviews because it makes people think . Then you have mindless `` coloring book '' styled movies like this get high praise from the masses . I say coloring book because it does n't make you think or give you a reason to use your brain . As long as you stay inside the lines the picture will come out the way it 's supposed to look , better yet even if you go outside the lines the picture will come out the way it 's supposed to look because it 's already defined for you . That is what these kinds of movies are like . You just sit down and watch them then it ends . I 've seen that shift a lot in movies lately where movies that make the viewer `` think '' get bashed or end up with comments like `` I did n't get it '' , `` I do n't understand '' , `` I have some questions ? '' . People really do n't like to think anymore when they watch movies**** ( I 'm not basing my rating on my observations I note above ) ****As for this movie it just was n't to my taste . Movies that try to be awkward but do n't carry any depth to them are n't my cup of tea . If you could compare this movie it 's like Men In Black meets Harold and Krumar go to White Castle with a bit of Scott Pilgrim tied in ( except Scott Pilgrim had a deeper message to it that only thinking people caught ) . If you 're looking for that kind of movie of quirky action movie . You have to have a certain kind of sense of humor to enjoy this film ( toilet humor ) . That 's all that really can be said about the movie . Plot wise it 's about 2 men that find themselves captivated by a drug that allows them to have unique abilities to see and know things what the rest of us do n't . The two men take up the role to be like the M.I.B . to these outer worldly creatures .	-1
No monster Dave ? ? ! ? ! ? Really ? ! ? ? ! That 's , like , sort of the entire point of JDATE . Sure , JDATE is full of exposition for the rest of the series , and it 's also hilarious , strange , and terrifying . But the big payoff in JDATE is the fact that Dave is NOT Dave by the end ! Why even bother with the axe story in the beginning if they 're not going to use it for a reason ? The lack of monster Dave is not the only problem with this adaptation . Many characters , plot lines , and locations were cut . The final product is a mishmash of scenes that do n't make sense . I ca n't even care about this movie . I certainly do n't care about the characters or plot . It 's disgusting that such fantastic source material could yield such an abomination.John was good , though .	-1
Boring , could n't get past the first 20 mins , fell asleep and then continued for another 10 mins and quit . It was just a pointless waste of my time	-1
So this movie is like hallucinating on Ambien while watching some children 's horror movie . It is scattered and overly silly . Plainly , it is just a dumb film not worth watching till the end . Although , I do in fact hope that all the characters die in the end . I stopped watching it after its incoherent , flopping scenes just made no sense . This movie had a chance to be entertaining . It had good effects , a couple interesting and weird ideas , but it is a lot of trouble to get through.Not recommended , unless you frequently read Goosebumps books while on Ambien .	-1
I used to really like Dual Survival but the new season with Joe Teti SUCKS.He maybe a great special ops man but Stinks at this just way to arrogant . mikyle Hawks would have been a better pick . Or better yet whatever the controversy is with Dave Canterbury ( and yes we 've all heard big deal ) could have been overcome like the whole Bear Grills thing if someone at discovery had n't freaked . AS is show is not worth watching anymore let alone buy.whole show is headed toward oblivion if discovery does n't do something fast.And that would be a sad loss .	-1
We really liked the first two seasons of Dual Survival , watching marathons of it at a time . The chemistry between Cody and Dave was fun to watch.We could n't make it through the first episode of Season 3 though because we ca n't stand Joe 's personality . The scene where he killed the boar is what did him in for us . He sticks the knife in the boar and does it brutally and then looks around in such a fake way . No respect towards the animal or taking a life , it was all about trying to look like some kind of warrior . He tries way too hard to come off as this macho guy and we could n't stand him . I do n't know what happened to Dave , but the show is n't the same without him .	-1
I made it though 12 minutes and could n't take the annoying 'whine ' which was supposed to be 'comical ' I suppose . Cliche drivel . Nothing clever -- a guy in make-up . a man with a bad gay act . commercial spots half-heartedly thrown in randomly . I am not sure who would find this funny -- I think middle-school kids have more sense and tact and a more complex sense of humor . The world needs to back off this type of junk and feed off something with intelligence and maturity .	-1
Kroll is a genius when he taps his comedic talents correctly . Unfortunately , this show does not do him any justice . The skits are absurd and ludicrous , but never funny . Just amusing . The characters are more annoying and off-putting than they are fun to watch.There are a few skits that will make you laugh , but most of the season is just a waiting game : waiting for something to be funny . Unlike his character on the League , who is ALWAYS funny , this show 's offerings are pretty lame.I recommend you watch The League instead .	-1
The show itself I would give a 2-3 stars for content . I guess it is just not my thing so much drama but it is a reality show so what do you think you are going to get . My problem is the video always skips or freezes . I got so sick of it I had to turn it off . It was not my internet conection of TV it is the show I have tried it a few other places and had the same issue .	-1
Deep beneath the Australian Outback lies Area 52 , a secret research facility that the government does n't want you to know about . Here , experiments in human biomechanics have unleashed the ultimate weapon ... And one that Australia 's top special forces agents will be unprepared to face as they enter the facility on a seek and destroy mission ! CRAWLSPACE attempts to combine CUBE 's suffocating mood with the psychological terror of PATRICK or THE SENDER , although it falls short in either department . Writer/Director Justin Dix relies far too heavily on a twist ending which has been blatantly broadcast from very early on . This makes for very little suspense and minimal guesswork as the audience wades through an all-too-familiar plot and predictable characters . CRAWLSPACE does come through with a few commendable moments of supreme tension as the characters face their darkest fears within the close confines of the tunnels , but these are short-lived . The added gore , claustrophobic sets , and winning make-up designs do work to the film 's advantage as well , however . With a stronger character base and a greater exploration of the villain 's near-limitless powers , CRAWLSPACE may have had more room to succeed , but it becomes easily trapped by its own narrow aspirations.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies	-1
I tried to get through this multiple times but just can not . As far as I can tell , no plot , just jumps right into tight , dimly light , tunnels , spaces and `` a monster '' . Sorry but this is just not enough to keep me interested . Too many other movies that use dark spaces and monster and at least a little plot or characters I can care about . Perhaps there is a plot that I just have not gotten to yet but how long should one wait until something is explained ? ? Update 15 Jan 2013 : well , watched it all and still not worth a look . `` Plot '' if you call it that came way late and still not worth the time watching . Hope this movie cost like $ 1000 to make and not more .	-1
i understand why some would watch , but i just could n't latch on to any of the people ... i just could n't get & # 34 ; hooked & # 34 ; ..	-1
What I have seen , it is barely okay . I hope it can only get better . Need to see more . Could be good .	-1
Could n't even watch the whole episode . I 'd rather see young adults behaving with a higher moral code . Not worth watching .	-1
Jr high setting . Entertaining in a weird way but too juvinile to watch a whole series . Reminiscent of 80s movies	-1
Buck wild is ( to me ) a documentary on what NOT to be ... .Instead of `` going mudd-n '' , and perpetually trying to breed yet one more `` buck wild baby '' these ignorant to the world `` children '' should learn something , and spend their time better ... The stereo type that they present to the world about their community , is about the same one that participants on the Jerry Springer show bring to theirs ... .Obviously I 'm missing the point ( or simply `` ca n't stand '' the obvious point ) of the whole show , which is nothing less than just the creation of a red-neck-hill billy version of Friends , or another MTV 's coming of age slumber party . The first one or two episodes were entertaining , but the repetition on how to start your life off at a dead end is just boring.I 'm sure that they ( this show ) has an audience , but it 's not me and I 'm suspect that their `` audience '' ca n't afford cable , Netflix , or amazon prime . They ( the intended audience ) are to busy out `` canning '' or `` scrapen '' ( picking up scrap metal co they can afford more Busch beer ) to even watch this show ... ...	-1
I watched one episode and that was enough . I was n't watching this show to become smarter or to learn anything , just thought I would check it out and maybe be entertained a little . After watching this show I was saddened that teenagers could be watching this and maybe think that some of this stuff was a good idea . I know I only saw one episode , but it was the exact opposite of what I would teach any young kid how to live their life . Once again I know that this show was made for entertainment only , but it lacked in entertainment and was n't worth watching another episode .	-1
I watched this documentary `` The Perfect Human Diet '' with great interest . I feel it did a very credible job of trying to establish what Homo Sapiens have eaten through history . However , it did not do justice to establish scientifically or answer the question what is `` The Perfect Human Diet '' ? It left more questions than answers . If the goal/intention was to leave that answer up to the audience , then it did a good job . I would like to ask C.J . Hunt , are you a meat eater ? or what are your eating choices ? Unfortunately , I do n't think your documentary was very good in promoting an important dialogue as to what is the perfect human diet for homo sapiens to stay healthy .	-1
This entire documentary felt like an infomercial . Also , imagine a world where a news reporter tells you something other than the news : you lost me at hello.Bottom Line : I 'd rather a wet paper bag talk to me . No . Energy . Whatsoever .	-1
Just could n't hold my interest . They did n't convince me that they had found the perfect diet . In fact , I could n't even finish watching it .	-1
I watched this movie and dang it , there was something that was `` off '' it appeared to me to be very light on science and such but very heavy on propaganda . Certain regions of the world were entirely missing from the `` studies '' so how can that be definite proof ? One has to wonder about cherry picking to achieve certain `` results '' is that science or ? ? ? ? Oh yeah , if you actually read the end credits and then web search those names the majority have ties to the meat industry as currently operating in the USA.While I do n't hate this movie , I do feel that it is misleading in several areas and that it actually does a disservice to those who are actively seeking accurate information .	-1
I really hate people who live in pretend time . Cliff Notes - guy lives not so healthy finally decides to do something about it and somehow got a Greenlight to make this stinker of a finger wagging tome.OK - we 're doing things all wrong and he knows how to fix that . Embarking on a global journey to discover the & # 34 ; perfect & # 34 ; human diet ( we all know where that 's going ) but it 's oh so much more than that . It 's designed to fill empty humans with a new lifestyle since all the other lifestyles people like this choose have never worked.OK , so cavemen did n't have Twinkies.The biggest fraud on the planet are folks who claim losing weight is a function of what you eat.But AND LISTEN CLOSELY FATTIES ... ..it 's not what you eat ... ... it 's not even what 's eating you ... ... ..IT 'S HOW MUCH YOU MOVE.Diets DO NOT WORK In fact they make it harder to stay fit.What makes you fit is doing things that make you fit . Eating Twinkies do not make you fit . Eating legumes just make you gassy , which is fine if you 're 10 or have a 10 year old you want to entertain . What makes you fit is walking around the block.There , now put the $ 4.99 you would have paid for this boring waste of me me me me me towards some nice comfy walking shoes and get out and walk . You do n't even have to run . A mile in the morning and a mile in the evening should keep your waist around 32 if you 're a guy . No need to spend money on the gym unless you enjoy the locker room visuals . But we have the interwebporn today so no need to waste time in a stinky locker room collecting toe nail fungus .	-1
It was not as good as I hoped . It really boiled down to ... do n't eat processed food . I fell asleep twice .	-1
I made it through the first 30 minutes after renting . It was agonizing . So rather then continue to suffer I stopped watching.Usually even a bad movie , if I paid to rent it I finish it . This one I just could n't , it was like watching a bunch of dumb youtube fails .	-1
I really can not say how much I could n't stand this movie . I 'm sorry but I have grown weary of writers and directors who think that they can paint themselves as artists by making an incoherent movie with characters no one cares about that flows free form from one scene to the next in an attempt to be different . You 're not different you 're just bad.The basic premise here is Charles Swan III ( portrayed by Charlie Sheen copying his performances from TWO AND A HALF MEN and ANGER MANAGEMENT ) stars as a man in love with a woman who leaves him when she discovers he has a drawer filled with Polaroid pictures of past conquests . Why he feels the need to keep these around in such an open area who knows . Distraught at her leaving he attempts to drive after her , wrecks his car and ends up in the hospital.From here the movie goes every which way it can . It moves backward and forward in time , it moves into the surreal world of Charles 's mind , it bring in characters just made for cameos and it goes nowhere fast . Some reviews of this film have called it genius and others have called it one of the worst films ever made . I tend to fall in the latter group.I found it difficult just to get through a large portion of this film let alone from beginning to end . I 'll be the first to admit I never got there . Something inside of me said that there were better things in this world I could be doing than watching this piece of manure posing as art . Movies like this do little but make me angry when I read about other films that have lingered on shelves for years that sounded good but never got made . Then I realize that someone gave the people behind this movie money to make it and I think why this and not that ? The film was written/directed by Roman Coppola who co-wrote THE DARJEELING LIMITED and MOONRISE KINGDOM with director Wes Anderson . I 've never been a huge fan of Anderson for many of the reasons this film did n't work , but at least I 've been entertained by them in one way or another . This movie feels like it was made by a fanboy of Anderson 's who wanted to show he could make just as quirky a film . Instead it falls flat on its face offering a boring film that makes no sense and is difficult to watch let alone enjoy.Do n't let the cover fool you . Names like Charlie Sheen , Bill Murray , Patricia Arquette and Jason Schwartzman may be listed in the credits but I could only believe they did this movie as a favor to Coppola . They would have done him a bigger favor by telling him that yes indeed ; the king was n't wearing any clothes .	-1
It 's hard to tell whether `` A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III '' is a good-natured bit of self-parody on the part of Charlie Sheen , poking fun at his reputation as a compulsive womanizer , or a vanity project designed to showcase the actor 's now-legendary sexual prowess and playboy image . I suspect it 's the former , but even if it 's the latter , it still does n't make for a very entertaining movie.In plot , the movie feels an awful lot like a full-length version of `` Californication , '' as a middle-aged , sunglass-wearing Angeleno laments how he 's screwed up with the love of his life ( Ivana played by Ketheryn Winnick ) because he 's never grown up enough to stay committed to a monogamous relationship.Writer/director Roman Coppola 's eclectic , scattershot approach alternates between scenes set in reality - or a close proximity thereof - and wild , but surprisingly flatfooted fantasy sequences heavy on op and pop visuals and graphics ( Charlie is himself a successful graphics designer ) and light on originality and cleverness . Apparently , there 's not really all that much worth taking a glimpse of in ole Charlie 's mind after all . Indeed , despite a big name cast that includes Bill Murray , Jason Schwartzman and Patricia Arquette , the movie feels an awful lot like a third-rate film school project that somehow got green-lighted by an actual studio .	-1
On the plus side , this is a very tightly and professionally put together film . It 's well edited , reasonably well structured , and contains a lot of footage from Hollywood A-listers ( and some I would consider B-listers ) telling their stories and giving their perspectives . Another plus is that the paparazzi too are given a chance to tell their side of the story.But on the down side , unless you 've been living under a rock for the last 15 years or so , it contains little if anything that you wo n't have heard before . And yes , I really do mean many , many times before.Paparazzi , high price of fame , invasion of privacy , telephoto lenses , people 's homes , Princess Dianna , Paris Hilton , Kim Kardashian , it did n't used to be like this back when the studios ran things , sometimes the celebs or their agents set these things up themselves , the people buying the gossip mags or visiting the gossip websites bear ultimate responsibility ... Wo n't somebody please think of the children ... You know the drill.I originally titled this review `` Nothing You Have n't Heard Many , Many Times Before '' . But then I realized that was n't entirely true . It did tell the story of how back when the studios ran things , one magazine got info on Rock Hudson 's homosexuality . It then went to his studio and basically said `` give us something better or we 'll run this '' . The studio then offered up another , far less prominent ( and less profitable ) homosexual actor on a platter , who was subsequently outed in the magazine and had his career ruined . Why the magazine went with this instead of doing the Rock Hudson piece is n't entirely clear , but anyway , that 's the story . It takes up about a minute of screen time , and is literally the only thing in this film you might not have heard about before.As for the rest ... It 's not that I really disagree with anything this film has to say . It 's just that like I keep saying , we 've heard it all SO many times before.Given the almost total absence anything we 're not all already completely familiar with ( if not to say positively drenched in ) , I 'd have to describe this work as what William Gibson prophetically called a `` meta-tabloid '' in his novelVirtual Light , published way back in 1994.Great book , by the way . Time spent reading that would be far better used than the time it takes to watch this.Theo .	-1
omigod - I do n't know if it is the lead actress 's waxy skin or her waxy acting but she always looks like she is eager to be a hooker or something despite being an instant farm girl or whatever her clean as a whistle background is supposed to be . I did enjoy Ivy 's veteran nervousness but this is altogether a very creepy show EXPERTLY acted . I do n't understand the point of this show at all . I thought at first it would be a launchpad for an actual Broadway show that would have guaranteed sales from fans of the show but I really doubt it now . It 's just a terrible and expensive embarassing show . If only it was fun to watch in its awfulness .	-1
Last season this show started out phenomenal . This season I 'm still trying to figure out what happened . The storyline has gotten so goofy I 'm not sure if it 's going to survive another season . Bring back the original writers and get the show back on track	-1
The first season was fun with the cast and all of it 's musical numbers , now its just blah . The music is still fun ( most of the time ) but most of the new cast was just not good ...	-1
The show is an awesome broadway drama , but it has been canceled and no one likes cliff hangers not too be continued .	-1
So we need another movie like this ? The only reason I rented it was because others had given such good reviews .	-1
I thought I was ordering something else , but this is not my thing do n't waist your money people . If your into this type of thing so be it . I 'm not going to change what I 've written on this review , it 's going to stay . If you do n't like it keep it moving . He or she below tried to check me on what , I should or should n't write . You should start trying to check your own essay , before you start insulting someone else 's reviews . He or she had plenty mistakes in their essay below in my comment box . I do n't plan on hitting the edit button , but maybe you should ( THIS IS MY REVIEW ) . I will write and use whatever text I please . My opinion is my review , and out of 48 people you chose to stop and comment on mines I 'm flattered chump . ; ) This person goes by the name of Le Strye . He or She is constantly bullying and making harassing comments on this particular post . Anytime you constantly send someone unwanted messages that 's considered bullying your way through . This person might even go to the extent of changing their name just to post again and again and again . I have contacted Amazon in regards to this matter . After he or she kept sending insulting messages to this post and another on yesterday . They tried to sending ugly messages to me and go back to edit , but Amazon is investigating and tracking the edited messages that were sent . You ca n't out smart tech support . I 'm assuming this must be the supporter of this film and is trying to bully people into giving this movie 5 stars . Again , it 's my review and it want change . I wo n't entertain foolishness !	-1
There are a few brief sequences that work , but mostly this is just very very tired stuff . No new light is shed on the issue . The take of `` this is how the issue has affected me personally '' seems contrived . The issue is better covered elsewhere ( not least in realistic fiction like `` The Wire '' and `` The Corner '' ) . There 's no value here .	-1
Honestly , I should give this movie 3-stars , because it 's okay . It is n't bad , but i take a star away for what it is n't . It is a movie about a college professor vampire who thought the love of his life died hundreds of years ago until she walks onto his campus . So this professor , and inexplicably the student , played by the beautiful and the Hollywood underused Julie Gonzalo , get the hots for each other and start having an affair . There is absolutely NOTHING hot about this affair . In fact , through the entire movie , the sex talk is rampant , yet there is nothing remotely HOT about the entire thing.To make matters worse , they also cast the incredibly hot Alexis Knapp ( Pitch Perfect , Project X ) in the movie and she is barely used as well . So , you have Gonzalo , Knapp , a student having an affair with her professor and a sorority full of girls , constant sex talk , vampires attacking parties , an entire sorority of girls becoming vampires and NONE OF IT is actually shown . None of it . It is the most frustrating movie EVER . It is the blue-balls of movies.Vampires . Sorority girls . Sex . Gonzalo . Knapp . Yet , it was filmed in a way that it could safely air on DISNEY CHANNEL ; if it were n't for all the sex talk and cussing . Man I really like Julie Gonzalo and I 'm really glad that she 's getting parts . I just wish that somebody would give her something good . I give this movie 2-stars for the fact that Gonzalo is walking and talking in it , otherwise , it is the most confusing movie ever . There is a cuss word every two minutes , but the creators apparently thought that any sort of violence or sex was WRONG ! !	-1
Disappointed they virtually ignored the black artist . With so many young black children needing inspiration , to know that there are more doors than rap open to them , it is important that respect and recognition be shown . Very disappointed .	-1
I do n't usually hate things , but I can not stand that I spent my candy money on one episode of this show ! Lame	-1
What a bore . How many more Blair Witch Project copy-cats are people going to make ? I guess if you like the show where the people & # 34 ; hunt Big Foot & # 34 ; , running around in the woods in the dark with shaky cameras saying & # 34 ; did you hear THAT ? & # 34 ; every 2 minutes , you will like this one . In this one instead of running around in the dark woods , they run around in a dark mine with shaky cameras saying & # 34 ; did you hear THAT & # 34 ; every 2 minutes . Even Art Bell must fall asleep trying to watch this silliness .	-1
I do n't know but I just found the whole concept too preposterous and superficial in its depiction of violence and suspense . It just seems like it wants to shock you because it has to compete with other cable shows that are much more successful in their execution of similar edgy material . I 'm not feeling the hero or the villain in this setup . Way too contrived for my tastes .	-1
I had high hopes for a series with Kevin Bacon , and his acting really is fine in this series . However , I avoid programs with plots about sick , perverted people doing disgusting , unnatural things to other people ( very often women ) -- shoes such as Criminal Minds and The Fall , do this too . My nightmares are fed adequately with my own imagination ; I do n't need someone else 's perspective to muddy up the id .	-1
I really like the TV show `` Dark Minds . '' It 's one of those rare shows that I really look forward to the next episode , kind of like `` The X Files '' a long time ago , at least before that show went off the rails in its last couple of seasons . I really like the interplay between M. William Phelps and John Kelly ; I always get a really good chuckle when 13 , or Raven , makes some mysterious comment and either the author or profiler looks up at the other in dismay.I just read part of a review , written by Raven , of the show `` The Following . '' Now , for those of you who have n't seen `` Dark Minds , '' Raven is the pseudonym of the real-life serial killer who helps Mr. Phelps and Mr. Kelly during profiling sessions . Raven is now behind bars , but he is allowed 15 minutes a call , to give an opinion on some unsolved crime . Now , if anyone knows what he 's talking about when it comes to serial killers , it would be Raven . After all , practice makes perfect . And evidently , he 's had a lot of practice . And I was very happy to see that Raven hates `` The Following '' nearly as much as I.I watched the first episode of `` The Following '' and only made it through the first half . Raven turned it off after 40 minutes . To me , the biggest problem with this faade-of-a-serial-killer-show : everyone is in constant crisis mode . The real world does n't work this way . People have down time ; they drink coffee every once in a while ! But watching Kevin Bacon -- and his coworkers here -- you 'd think they 're all on speed . Man , I say : kick it down a notch every once in a while ! There are other issues , but this issue alone is sufficient to make me change the channel.One issue that I had with Raven 's analysis : he said that serial killers do n't engage the police . Now , that is usually the case ; most serial killers are smart enough to avoid attention . However , what about killers such as Zodiac ? He is one of quite a few that seemed to enjoy toying with the police . But otherwise , I liked Ravens critique of `` The Following , '' a show that I wo n't be following at all , just like Raven.But I will be following `` Dark Minds . '' I guess the season ends this week . Bummer . Well , I can watch one more show and then I 'll have to wait until fall for the next episode . I 'd recommend following `` Dark Minds , '' and dumping `` The Following '' from your queue . You wo n't be following unwatchable TV that way .	-1
There is so much to say about this television show and I 'm not sure I can cover it all , none of which is good . The only good thing about the show is that they managed to cast Kevin Bacon in it and he is usually a guaranteed sign of quality . I take that back , there is something else that is good about the show ; the premise of it . The first two episodes of `` The Following '' are promising in the sheer sense that the show COULD have great promise . A serial killer . A back story . A detective with a history and a relationship with the serial killer 's wife . A serial killer who can commit crimes from prison due to a cult following of psychos . All of these great ideas are squandered.The reasons why these ideas are squandered is , in my opinion , for one simple reason : `` The Following '' is trying to be `` 24 '' . In an effort to be relentless , non-stop , intense action and thrills , `` The Following '' throws an event at you every five minutes . Therefore , instead of being intelligently fleshed out , it is hastily fleshed out . Every five minutes the show opens itself up for continuous ridicule for stupid teenage criminals , stupid FBI agents who should have known better , criminals who are n't tracked or followed , or just plain illogical assumption story archs . Instead of the creators doing some research and giving us a reason to think that Joe Carroll ( the serial killer ) is brilliant , we are left to just assume so.Instead of being intelligently thought out , the show relies upon gimmicks ; murderers who do n't murder but talk , murderers who have no reason to leave someone alive but do because that person is n't supposed to die yet , victims explaining why the murderer did n't kill them , `` He said he did n't kill me because a live hostage would slow you down more than a dead one . '' Oh , he did huh ? Well that was nice of him ... . thanks for the info . A detective held by three teenage murderers whittling through his ropes with a hidden knife and they do n't see it despite all of them standing ten feet away . Then you have a serial killer who just calls the detective pretty much every episode and has a nice chat and tells him how screwed he is.Mainly though , the `` 24 '' ish format to the show asks the creators to explain escapes and FBI blunders every five minutes and after about 10 of those , or two episodes , the gimmick is over . Then when it continues , the show becomes eye-roll boring and has absolutely zero tension . The tension has no intelligence to it . There is zero tact to the show . Where a show like `` CSI '' would take the time to explain some of the reasoning or how things happened or worked , `` The Following '' does n't have time for that , and when it does , the explanation is ridiculous.Nobody should be giving this show 5-stars in my opinion . NOBODY . This is not a great show . Nowhere close . Is it a terrible show , like my 1-star suggests ? I think so . Maybe that is too harsh . Yet when I see a show that has so much promise and lucky people are making MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to entertain us and they give us something that absolutely ANYBODY with basic writing skills could write , you ca n't be too harsh . When the writers and directors have zero TACT or make no attempt to be intelligent in their tact , but just give you every horror/thriller cliche in the book and expect you to drool and return every week . No thanks . 1-star baby . That 's what you get for your lack of effort .	-1
LOVE the show , but went elsewhre to watch . even premium members are charged additional to watch . could watch on another site for FREE and saw no need to stay her and pay to watch..	-1
Wish he had better writers and co-stars .	-1
The series is beautifully produced and well-acted . But the grisly focus is creepy and offensive . It 's just porn in a pretty package .	-1
Lacks character depth and relies too much on shock value . For a series to be successfulit has to have more than this one provides .	-1
For the first few episodes , my wife and I were really enjoying it . Then , well , it dawned on us that the FBI was more stupid about things than we would have been , or any cops on any TV show we 've ever seen would 've been , or even Barney Fife would 've been . They do n't screen people to see who has visited the villain , which would sort of be an easy thing to do . It would give them a short list of suspects , would n't it ? They have a never-ending string of folks to serve the same purpose as the red shirts on away teams for the original Star Trek series . Hanging out with Ryan is certain death for any character you 've never seen before . Bad guys show up everywhere . 90 % of the people Ryan has ever spoken to seems to be a part of this cult ... yet they wo n't just scour the prison visitor logs ? Half of the law enforcement community seems to be in the cult . It did n't take long for this to get to be a bit silly.Finally , some members of the cult itself are portrayed as `` Constitutional Radicals '' . There is a `` Do n't Tread on Me '' flag on the wall of the cult 's training camp . Seriously ? This show is about people who love the US Constitution who happen to really like to kill people ? Where did that come from ? It 's nonsense , and it is the straw that broke the camel 's back for me.I love the acting and the casting is awesome . Too bad the writers have n't the brains to make the story credible and to keep their socialistic bias in check .	-1
I think this series is the main cause of why my blood pressure is escalating whenever I pay attention to it . I was never fond of Police/Investigation/Crime shows except for a few here and there . My friend insisted this was a good show to watch and do n't get me wrong for the first 5 or so episodes it was thrilling and engaging but it does n't take long for the viewer to realize that the plots just keep dragging on and on and are quite repetitive . In short the fault does n't lie with the actors but with the plot itself , it 's ridiculous even for a TV show.Joe Carrol a former college professor , is well the villain the title `` The Following '' is based on his ability to reach out for those unloved/unwanted/outcast civilians who also suffer from a disease called psychopathy or otherwise known in today 's pop culture Psycho . He more or less uses these people to form an organization that 's going to follow his lead of serial murders , kidnappings , torture and all the inhuman activities ever invented to help him write the greatest novel alive which will be based on the real life of these murders . Not Only that he also chooses Ryan Hardy the former FBI agent who had an affair with Joe Carrol 's ex wife and was the reason behind his capture a couple of years ago to be the patroness of this great work of literature that he 's preparing . But that 's not the point . The Point is the bad people are all intellects , sophisticated , dominating , sneaky and have a good strategy . While the good guys on the other hand , are hopeless and by hopeless I mean they ca n't do anything to save their lives and as a ramification of that the bad guys keep winning over and over while the good once lose everything.I just got bored , the endless killings of civilians in the name of this literally work while no one 's able to catch them in the act is a tad unbelievable . The ability of Joe Carrol to brain wash as many people to join him in his little killing spree is just unrealistic and strange especially when we come to realize he was doing it while he was behind bars through the internet ? Seriously ! Come Join me in my quest of criminal activties and you 'll get a chapter in my upcoming book ! Yeah , no one will buy that ! The minions are pathetic , losers who killed their ( -- -- -- - ) and ran away with it cause the authorities are so dumb to catch them especially when they 're already suspects entering a freaking Jail to visit a death row criminal who 's responsible for the killing of 14 young girls . Did You get that ? He 's a mass murder and still gets unlimited jail visit times to interview his minions.Just , do n't let me go any further I could go on and on and on about how stupid and impossible this situation would be in real life but I do n't think my ramblings will end.Not to mention , he escapes prison again ! and his followers fly him through a helicopter do n't ask me how they afforded it unless they killed it 's passengers to a huge mansion where he 'll be crowned as their King . If this was happening in some medieval legend I might have bought that but in the real world in modern times with all this technology ? I do n't really know what the writers of this show are trying to portray by doing all of this ? Is it for the sake of entertainment alone ? Cause if it is let me tell you it 's quite repetitive . Unless the writers have this hate for the FBI and just want to portray them as useless then fine . Whatever ! I do n't think I 'll be watching the following season . What a waste of great potential !	-1
One of the most precious atributes that distinguishes us from any other species is our ability to empathize with our fellow man.I was barely able to get through the first episode of THE FOLLOWING , at which point I decided I would not be able to bear the agony of continuing to watch -- and vicariously experience -- the gut-wrenching terror of one person after another being so realistically tortured , then brutally murdered.Shameless , unpardonable trash , which can only serve as `` creative '' inspiration for the most deviant among us .	-1
What can I say ? I really was expecting more from a series that had Kevin Bacon and James Purefoy in it . I love both of those actors and I 'm a big fan of E.A . Poe , so I really was looking forward to this . Unfortunately , I was unimpressed .	-1
I 've watched 3 episodes and can feel some of the storylines a mile away . Just wait until they reveal that the young FBI agent is a follower . Could n't see that one coming.This is just more romanticizing death and gore , elevating the serial killer as a genius . I ca n't imagine a plot twist that would be engaging enough to `` follow '' this program through 12 more episodes.Even the marvelous Kevin Bacon ca n't save the show . I wish he could because it 's been too long since we 've seen him on the screen . This role is too one dimensional for him . There 's no emotional rangei in the role . All he gets to do is grimace his way through the episodes as the tortured hero . Snore .	-1
The show managed to be apolitical for the first half dozen installments , but two militia psychos were introduced and the only explanation we get for their murderous and evil vocation is & # 34 ; we are Constitutionalists & # 34 ; . Oh I feel so shunned and associated with psycho-murderers because I know what is in the Constitution and that most of modern government violates it . If you are not going to discuss something seriously then do n't bring it up . Just using your show for some not-so-clever name calling is not impressive it is pathetic and indicates an intellectual and honesty deficit .	-1
Watched it for FREE on Netflix . I usually look for a show there before I buy on Amazon . Netflix NEVER has all seasons of ANY show & never current episodes . Amazon does , however , have ALL episodes of every series they sell the day after they air on TV . Well anyway ... . I watched season 1 there , if it were any good I would have bought season 2 on Amazon but this show was NOT good . I gave it 2-Stars because it DID keep me from being bored to death while I was working . So 2-Satrs is me being & # 34 ; nice & # 34 ; .Too much in this series annoyed me . Like how useless law enforcement was . So many idiotic mistakes & unrealistic behavior . Several FBI agents were kidnapped . How does this happen ? One of them KNEW something was up ( right before they snatched him up ) and did n't respond the way someone with FBI TRAINING should have . He just scurried on up to his hotel room like a scared civilian frantically trying to open his hotel room door . I said & # 34 ; They 're gon na be in his room . Watch ! & # 34 ; , then *BAM* soon as he walks in the cult members are in his room waiting . Too predictable . The & # 34 ; bad guys & # 34 ; kept getting away ! Even in situations where there 's no way in hell they should have . In a hostage situation , since WHEN does FBI , SWAT , Local law enforcement leave ( or pretend to leave ) when the bad guys demand them to do so ? How do 3 guys take out 3 dozen FBI agents with ease ? Why do the & # 34 ; bad guys & # 34 ; ALWAYS get away by sneaking out the back door when the house/building is supposedly surrounded by cops ? Even with a police officer RIGHT THERE in the hallway outside of Clair 's bedroom ( while her door was open ) a FAT cult member slowly drops out of the ceiling ( like Spider Man ) kills the cop with out making a peep then takes her hostage ... .. Really ! ? Joe Carrol & Clair 's son , was a smart-DUMB kid . One minute the kids does something extremely clever , the next minute he does something extremely dumb ( even for a kid ) .The main thing that irked me is ... .. No one behaved as if an infinite number of anonymous serial-killer-cult-members were running around killing random innocent people , blowing up stuff , kidnapping kids/women , and kidnapping & torturing FBI . No one was taking this seriously enough for me . Like when Ryan & Claire were held up at his FBI friend 's cabin . Soon as they found that a GPS tracking device was planted on Claire ( by a cult member ) they should have LEFT IMMEDIATELY . Instead they stay and plan on leaving in the next day ( WTF ! ? ) in the meantime Ryan 's friend finds ONE shot gun and a half-empty box of shells . Mind you , they know that they 're being hunted by select cult members with extreme military/C.I.A training ( and military grade fire power ) that just murdered 3 dozen FBI agents an hour ago . Of course , soon as night falls here comes the bad guys AGAIN.The one victim that survived being attacked by Joe Carrol ( forgot her name ) did n't act like someone who just found out the serial killer that almost stabbed her to death just broke out of prison . This girl ( and her friends ) acted like she just lost her cat/dog and was a little bummed out over it . If that were me ... After the attack , I would 've already had an arsenal in my home . After being notified Joe Carrol escaped , I would n't take a piss without a 9mm ( loaded with hollow-points ) sitting on the vanity . I would 've purchased two highly trained German Shepard dogs , that would 've slept in bedroom every night . I also would 've spent the last 7 yrs doing some type of NavySeals/C.I.A/JasonBorne combat training , and at the riffle range 5 days a week . This is the type of behavior you 'd expect from someone that had gone through such a tragic ordeal.Police protection or & # 34 ; Protective Custody & # 34 ; is a JOKE in every low budget movie/series . Am I supposed to be surprised that the 50 cops outside & inside of the victim 's home was n't going to stop the & # 34 ; bad guys & # 34 ; from getting to them ? Has n't this scenario been done to death in movies ? DISCLAIMER : Being that Amazon & # 34 ; comments section & # 34 ; is becoming too much like YouTube comments due to ignorant people with no lives , I have to make this disclaimer . F_ _ _ YOU in advance to anyone that feels the need to criticize my review , as well other peoples review . I turned the & # 34 ; notification & # 34 ; feature off because I could n't careless about anyone 's feedback . So your stupid commentary WILL fall on deaf ears . So STFU in advance also . Have a good one : )	-1
The characters are good , acting is good , however , this is a graphic , gory television show . The carnage detracts from the story . I wonder how long it will be before some sick person wanting attention starts to copy the crimes in shows like this one and Criminal Minds .	-1
Parts of his performance made me cringe they we so awful . He 's a terrific actor , so I do n't know what was happening here . He did n't have chemistry with any of the cast and the whole thing seemed awkward and forced . Pilots can be a little rough around the edges , so maybe this will get better with time . Overall , I 'm did n't like it enough to make it 'appointment ' TV .	-1
YUCK , negative five is more like it . UNBELIEVABLE SERIAL KILLERS WITH PERFECTLY COMBED HAIR ... unplausible . BLOOD , BLOOD and more blood for no good reason . Hannibal Lector was a much more classy act .	-1
The best thing about this new series is the cast . I was drawn to the series by K Bake , J Purfoy and Maggie Grace . Whoever made this show needs to put them in something good . The concept of the ultra genius serial killer with a following has been done to death . We have the same nutty professor and flawed but brilliant agent who must catch him . Buckets of blood but not not fun blood like `` Dexter '' . The end of the first episode is predictable . I can not see spending any time with this show unless I get drunk and pass out . Plus POE ? Give me a break ... .if you are a smarty pants professor pick someone less obvious like Proust , or Joyce or Norman Mailer ( who would have made a really interesting serial killer ) . Please Canadians release the New Primeval !	-1

The plot is a typical , predictable Archer having to get out of the `` Day After '' consequences of his latest drunken escapades the night ( s ) before.Plot negatives : -- Ending falls flat . Ron ( the old dude Mallory married ) is at the opera with Mallory and he 's air-conducting to the same song as Archer who is doing his air-conducting in a hot tub while supervising Woodhouse eating a bowl of spider webs . Like much of the episode , it 's rehashed material.Best line : -- When Archer says , `` It 's not a phaser ! '' - Ca n't have enough Star Trek references.Worst line : -- When Woodhouse says , `` Sometimes I think I should just run away . But who would take me in ? '' - Sad . Not amusing at all -- unless you 're a sociopath.Ratings scale : 1 to 5Season 1 = 3.9Season 2 = 4.5 ( Best Season thus far ) Season 3 = 3.5 ( Episodes 1-3 = 4.5 Episodes 5 , 6 , 7 and 9 = 4 , The rest = 2.5 ) Season 4 = 3.0 ( Episode 1 = 2.5 , Episode 2 = 3.5 , Episode 3 = 2.0 [ Way too much gore , perversion and absurdity . ] Episode 4 = 3.5____________________*Back in the day the pitch by the cable company was `` Look , it 's worth paying for because there are NO ads ! ... well except for the local over-the-air ( OTA ) stations that we pipe in for free ( cable companies paid nothing for OTA at that time ) . But hey , we ca n't do anything about that , we 're just providing you with the convenience of not having to have an antenna too . '' They did n't mention that MOST people were getting cable to fix the problem of having to risk their lives installing antennas only to get notoriously unreliable lousy reception . So , like frogs thrown into a pot of cold water that is slowly heated up will fool them into staying in the pot , people just dealt with the gradually increasing temperature of the water i.e . ads , ads and more ads that were promised not to be there . Then , simulcast sports events came and the cable company said , `` We ca n't do anything about it , the networks are forcing us to include the ads . Besides , what do you expect us to do when they cut to ads ? '' Then they said , `` Inflation ! Everyone has to raise prices . You can either pay higher subscription fees or put up with ads on heretofore commercial-free stations . '' And the frog stew was ready to be served.So go ahead and submit to be boiled alive . The rest of us are jumping out of the pot . Rivet , rivet .	-1
Please stop the commercials or we will stop buying these . Clearly someone has lost sight of why we buy these videos . If we wanted commercials we would watch regular tv . We pay a premium per episode for a reason . If you take away that reason we stop buying videos . It 's not rocket science .	-1
This cartoon is bad in so many ways . The dialog is poorly written , the use of that stupid chimp noise drives me crazy , the stories are lazy . Aunt May 's house turns into a death trap . It 's not just insulting to older watchers but to young viewers . Every week it is pretty much the same . These guys are powerful and they spend 15 minutes getting beat up and then coming together as a team and winning in the end . Boring.I need to stop watching this show . It is a waste of money and time .	-1
This movie was so slow I had to turn it off . It had bad acting and the storyline was slow as molasses .	-1
I heard a whole lot of comparisons between this film andThe Cabin In The Woodsbefore I decided to give this one a try . And why not ? The latter film is probably one of my top three favorite `` horror '' films of all time , and definitely the smartest nod to the genre I 've ever witnessed , regardless of how funny or scary you think it is . This film , written long before CABIN IN THE WOODS , tries to approach that same level of wit and insight into the genre , but the problem is that the script is just too shoddy to pull it off.The film follows two gentlemen in a cabin in the woods ( natch ) . One of them -- a young husband and father-to-be named Michael -- has come to visit Chris -- his old , estranged , meth-smoking friend -- in an attempt to finally wean him off of the drug . Michael takes an old-school approach to rehab , handcuffing his friend to a pipe and letting him sweat it out , and as the two bicker ( with fairly repetitive and awkwardly curse-laden dialogue ) and relive old times , strange pictures , films , books , and recordings begin popping up around the cabin . Where are these things coming from ? What do they mean ? Will Chris -- the healthiest-looking meth-addict you 've ever seen ( check out those biceps ! ) -- be able to kick his habit ? Will Michael allow his own pride to blind himself to the fact that something seriously creepy-deepy is going on ? The idea behind the film is great . I give it five stars . I do n't even fault the film for its low-budget execution , which is pretty solid , all things considered . The film is a mediation on the art of story-telling , especially with regards to horror films , and its constant nods to various horror tropes -- aliens , strange disappearances , Native American burial grounds , ghosts , creepy religious types , foreign scientists -- is cute enough , but none of it is particularly compelling . Even when something pretty creepy does happen -- a mysterious person stares at our leads through the window or a recording of them appears unannounced -- one or both of the characters inexplicably does n't care , which effectively neuters the response of the audience . If viewers are supposed to be yanked to the edges of their seats , so should our characters , and what they mainly do is just argue about drugs , friendship , and life.Not until the last twenty minutes of the film do things begin to gain some kind of steam , but it 's an old fashioned case of too-little-too-late . By then , the bizarre occurrences of the film have become very obvious ( i.e . heavy-handed ) symbols . This is further hammered home by Michael 's insistence on referring to every set of photos , every scratchy record , every cave painting as a `` story . '' This kind of overdone symbolism is especially weird considering the film 's general insistence on remaining aloof from the typical spoon-feeding you get from most scary films . Smart viewers will get what 's going on , but there 's bound to be a sizable chunk of the audience who will finish the movie and wonder , `` What was that last shot about ? '' In case you missed Michael pounding it into the dialogue : it 's about something , somewhere that wants a story.The trippiness of the overall story just does n't hold enough water to compel the plot , is the problem . And in a movie that is all about the things that make a story worthwhile and that even cause stories to exist to begin with , it 's a shame that the producers focused so much on creating a powerful ending without thinking about what it takes to have an equally powerful beginning and middle . As a result , you have a movie that 's too smart for its britches , that seems to have been made backwards , with its strongest and greatest ideas placed at the end . But like a powerful anchor attached to sewing thread , this film 's ending is stuck to an hour of quiet nonaction that is not particularly creepy , interesting , or even all that sensible ( did I mention that our film 's meth-head looks like he could be a lightweight boxing champion ? ) , and so the density of the finale makes the preceding hour of movie seem even fluffier and more pointless than it already is , rendering the entire experience kind of a rip-off .	-1
I gave up after 45 minutes . Even bad movies I watch to the end , but this one was just weighing me down with the meandering and lack of action . This was recommended as horror , but I like actual horror and not paranormal .	-1
This in no way is a horror movie . I finally got a chance to watch it for free and it stunk worse than a dead road kill on a hot New Mexico day . Best advice is to stay away from this movie unless you want to watch a man handcuffed for days and when he 's released by his best friend he forgives him as if it never took place . I would have been pissed and started kicking some backside . I 'm awarding this movie the worst D- rated movie of 2013 .	-1
Do n't be fooled by any good reviews ... .This is definitely the WORST piece of garbage I have ever seen ... No explanation , no closure ... Just one of those endings that not only gives ZERO explanation of WTF just happened ! ! ! ... Not even slight innuendo , I am truly shocked at just how bad this was	-1
Oh no , `` Ancient Aliens '' again . The *fifth* season ? ! How many silly seasons can there possibly be ? And all the true believer reviewers again ! `` Lots of cool facts '' . Geezus . Good people , there are arguably *no* true facts in this series *at all*.True to form , I 've only watched one episode , `` The Von Daniken Legacy '' . I admit that I hate Erich von D & auml ; niken . His ideas or `` question marks '' about aliens visiting Earth in ancient times ( in pyramid-like UFOs , to boot ) must be *the* worst superstition ever spawned . Homeopathy and reductionist materialism , come back , all is forgiven ! D & auml ; niken 's `` theories '' are so remarkably ridiculous in a kind of inimitable folksy style , with the main protagonist playing the role of fat German bar-owner spewing `` common sense '' , that they almost make me weep ! The fact that I used to believe in ancient aliens myself only ads insult to the injury . OK , I was only eleven at the time , but hell , I 'm a perfectionist.And yes , I need to chill and have a candy bar , I know ... OK , I 'm back . Has `` Ancient Aliens '' become any better during my coffee break ? Well ... no . So here goes ! I 'm not necessarily opposed to rejected knowledge claims ( avid readers of my reviews , all two of them , may have noticed a certain soft spot for Bigfoot and ... ahem ... John Michael Greer ) , but D & auml ; niken 's speculations really are annoying and extremely unsophisticated . D & auml ; niken , a romantic adventurer of the classical kind , has no formal training in archaeology , anthropology or comparative mythology I 'm aware of . Yet , he goes around the world , see mysterious stone structures , declare them `` impossible '' and ... voil & aacute ; , this proves that aliens built them ! The magnificent stone structures at Puma Punku in Bolivia are declared `` impossible '' , when a more reasonable hypothesis is that they *aren't* impossible at all - I mean , they are there , are n't they , and they are made out of sandstone , not moon rock . That the local Natives ca n't build them , and point to the sky as explanation for who did , leads D & auml ; niken to conclude that ... well , aliens did it . It 's all so breathtakingly simple.Another example is Lord Pakal at Palenque in Mexico , debunked at least 10,000+ times , but still going strong . If looked at horizontally and with some creative imagination , the lid of Pakal 's tomb looks like a guy manning a space rocket . If looked at vertically , using scholarly knowledge of Mayan mythology and iconography , the magnificent artwork shows Pakal being symbolically sacrificed . But no , D & auml ; niken 's folksy immediate impression simply must be true , or else no ratings for History Channel ... Indeed , it 's precisely the populist style , pitting independent researcher against the scientific establishment , which explains part of D & auml ; niken 's appeal . D & auml ; niken is our `` audience substitute '' . While everything you read in peer-reviewed journals is n't necessarily true , there *is* a reason why archaeologists need formal training , not just the ability to run around inside megalithic monuments gasping at the sheer `` impossibility '' of it all . There is another salient feature of the ancient astronaut milieu , too , one D & auml ; niken is at pains to explicitly deny in this documentary . D & auml ; niken says he has n't formed a new religion . In a purely formal sense , he is right . He is *attacking* religion by a modern form of euhemerism , in which the gods are explained away in `` naturalist '' fashion as space travellers in nuts-and-bolts craft . What D & auml ; niken does n't want to see , but what surely almost everyone else spotted long ago , is that the belief in ancient astronauts is *in effect* a new kind of religion . At the very least , D & auml ; niken is offering the masses a potent substitute for religion . The large amount of spiritual types who have climbed onboard the fiery chariot surely shows what we are dealing with . As for D & auml ; niken himself , he even claims that the aliens created us and will return one day ! Thus , he is specifically tailoring his speculations to an audience used to the *Christian* religion . I do n't think Taoists , Shintoists or the Dogon in Mali eagerly awaits `` the return of the gods '' ... Claude Vorhillon and his Ralians are the most obvious example of how `` ancient aliens '' can be turned into a religion ( a religion which claims to be materialist , in fact ) . In their case , the quasi-Biblical traits are very obvious . Zecheriah Sitchin is another example of a person forming what is really a new religious movement around ideas presumably inspired by D & auml ; niken 's . And D & auml ; niken himself ? Is n't he really the exoteric attractor of the new creed , its Aaron so to speak ? If you take the bait , I 'm sure more `` esoteric '' people are waiting in the wings . I 've heard that the Ancient Astronaut Society , which started as a D & auml ; nikenite fan club , ended up as a New Age group . Thus , paradoxically the appeal of D & auml ; niken 's message could be seen as a combination of both populist anti-science and elitist `` hidden knowledge '' , both modern irreligion and post-modern religion . An interesting object for a comparative religion study , I 'm sure ! These people do n't understand that *they* are the ones that should be placed under the sociological and psychological microscope ... The religious/Meaning aspect is surely the reason why so many people are oblivious to the ( easily spotted ) contradictions in D & auml ; niken 's books . How can aliens ( that 's *aliens* , for heaven 's sake ! ) breed true with humans ? If they can , why has no alien DNA been found in our gene pool ? ( Albert Einstein does n't count . ) Why would aliens need to build stone structures at Puma Punku , if they have super-advanced technology light years ahead of us ? Why are n't there any *real* traces of a high technological civilization in India , if the Vedic peoples interacted with aliens ? D & auml ; niken 's supporters point to `` mysteriously '' charred stone walls as evidence for ancient A-bombs , making you wonder why the bombs did n't obliterate the whole town , rather than just charring its walls ... Seriously , should I continue ? Are there real , unsolved mysteries in the universe ? Oh , definitely . You already know which ones : where do we come from , why are we here , where are we going ... And why *this* fun house of a planet ? I 'm willing to contemplate the erroneousness of materialism , the existence of Spirit , even one or two paranormal phenomena ( although hopefully not on my favourite Swiss hotel ) . But literal , flesh-and-blood ( or green jelly ) aliens scaring the living daylights out of Moses , breeding true with female ape-men , and erecting stone structures of a suspiciously-looking human provenance all around the globe just for their higher amusement ( and ours ? ) ... naaaah . It 's bad archaeology , bad anthropology , bad comparative religion , and - when push comes to shove - probably even bad spirituality.Erich von D & auml ; niken and his fiery chariots is a legacy I would rather loose . One star .	-1
I ca n't believe they charged me $ 2 for this 2 minute `` free sneak peek # 2 '' ? ! Any `` sneak peak '' should be free and this series is already running out of interesting topics .	-1
As with all episodes in this increasingly silly series , a quick internet search reveals that there is no credibility to the claims of `` crystal skull enthusiasts '' . The peddlers of this series do not give their audience much credit . They think we will not check them out . They are wrong.I do check them out and their production does not check out.The only reason to watch this episode is to see how biased and inaccurate these `` Ancient Aliens '' are . When you are done watching this episode you will be left with the `` Ancient Alien Enthusiasts '' conclusions that mystical crystal skulls of ancient origin have been found and are sizzling and popping with paranormal powers and that the mother of them all is the `` Skull of Doom '' .Here are the true facts that were easily available and well known to all of the writers , producers and commentators of this program are NEVER presented in this program . These facts were unearthed by a legitimate set of producers , writers and commentators at National Geographic who aired a well-documented legitimate documentary two years before this illegitimate and completely undocumented nonsense was put together by the `` Ancient Alien Enthusiasts '' .The National Geographic documentary is called `` The Truth Behind : The Crystal Skulls '' and it completely debunks the nonsense of crystal skulls . Crystal skulls have been conclusively proven not to be ancient . The first crystal skull every produced was manufactured in the latter half of the 19th century . Crystal skulls are not something ancient people had anything to do with . They are irrefutably not of any paranormal origin and they certainly have nothing to do with extraterrestrial beings which of course do n't exist except in the imaginations of people with hairdo challenges.Crystal skulls were never created by ancient people for any reason at any time in any part of the world.The purported origin of the most famous crystal skull peddled as the `` Skull of Doom '' and officially known as the Mitchell-Hedges Skull is a 100 % pure fabricated hoax . But the little old lady peddling the hoax seemed utterly believable . Even some of the best legitimate scientists were unable to summarily dismiss the little old lady 's story.The skull was the icon of Arthur C. Clarke 's Mysterious [ X ] series and is shown on the opening screen of each episode . If the little old lady piqued the interest of the totally legitimate scientist Arthur C. Clarke ( who did not know the facts of it 's fraudulent origins and only presented what was known at the time ) there is reason to investigate the story in a serious way.It was difficult to do hard probing when the hoaxer was a very believable cute little old lady named Anna Mitchell-Hedges who seemed so instantly reliable that on first meeting her you 'd trust her to babysit your kids without any further references.But she was an absolute fraud ! Whether deluded or wickedly deceptive , and in possible collusion with her father , she fabricated a fantastically believable story of how she acquired the crystal skull by seeing a glimmer in the depth of some Mayan ruins in Belize on her 17th birthday ( a detail she always included in telling the story which I thought a bit unusual ; you 'd expect to find her leaving out the birthday detail once in awhile but she never failed to mention it ) .We now know she never visited the site of the excavation in which she claims to have found the skull . Another clue that something was amiss is that she always mispronounces excavation as `` escavation '' in interviews . This always made me wonder about her and her father 's actual level of training which we now know was nonexistent . Her father was nothing more than an exotic traveler who had no professional training in any field even remotely related to archaeology.The truth is her father bought the skull at auction and the records of the sale exist to confirm it . The skull was made by a European sculptor who used a European person 's skull as the model . Anna Mitchell-Hedges was either delusional or deceptive as was her father . Although her father seems to have held back on perpetuating the hoax , he did include a false reference to the skull as being Mayan in his first autobiography but removes the reference in subsequent editions . And he did not peddle the lie about the skull being an ancient Mayan artifact found in Belize unlike his cunning/delusional daughter did her whole life.My personal opinion based on Anna Mitchell-Hedges obsession with stating that she found the crystal skull on her birthday is that her father gave the skull to her as a birthday present . And he did not just give it to her but planted it in some genuine ruins that Anna Mitchell-Hedges had to actually dig through and so she got to feel the thrill of finding an ancient artifact which she also mentions each and every time she tells the story.The `` ruins '' were known by Anna Mitchell-Hedges not to be in Belize and the skull was known not to be a genuine ancient origin . But Anna Mitchell-Hedges wanted the story to be true and so she embellished it and elaborated a bit more each time she told it . Every other so-called mystic crystal skull has an equally faulty story behind its origin and paranormal properties.None of the above facts are presented in this episode and remember : all of the above facts were readily and easily available to anyone with an internet connection at the time they produced this utterly valueless episode of `` Ancient Alien Whatever '' .What a waste of time this lowest quality program has become .	-1
I detest streaming videos . Where is the DVD set for the 2013 Dallas season 2 ? I want the hard copy . Not some virtual version controlled by a 3rd Party . Consumers need to stand their ground to ensure we continue to have the option of DVD 's for our movies & TV episode seasons.Fortunately , I did tape every episode on VHS as a precaution just in case they pulled a dirty trick like this . Season one was immediately available on DVD at the end of the broadcast season . But season 2 is nowhere to be seen . No evidence they plan to offer DVD 's at all for season 2.I do n't use DVR 's because those are worse . As an example , the network was able to have the cable & sat providers delete a controversial episode of Jesse Ventura 's conspiracy theory from every DVR it had been recorded on . These deletions surgically occurred across multiple providers who claimed it was a software upgrade glitch which deleted this one particular episode on the same week , about 2 months after it was aired , from the DVR 's of every customer which had recorded via DVR . Fortunately , mine was on VHS where they could n't get to it . There were hundreds of viewers complaining in the online forums how that episode was deleted on all of their DVR 's despite using different providers . You can probably still find these complaints online.This is just one example of the drawbacks of soft copies like streaming video , DVR & instant episodes . Even if the DVR was disconnected , a command can be inserted to delete an episode the next time the unit is accessed . At any future point , these can be remotely deleted with simple commands . Many years ago , I was on the original design team for these DVR & interactive set top boxes for the cable & sat companies . The capabilities for these devices are far more invasive than anyone can imagine . Why do you think they give away these DVR boxes . I specifically purchased plain set top boxes from direct TV which do not have DVR 's . Also , by owning the equipment , they can not arbitrarily upgrade or change anything.This info will likely mean nothing to you until it is too late ; after one of your recorded episodes has been deleted without warning & blamed on some glitch . All it takes is the fear of a lawsuit for a network to order the discreet elimination of some episode without warning.Also , avoid Ultraviolet DVD 's which install spyware on your computer & can delete other movies & videos on your computer which is determined not to meet certain standards . You should be able to find comments on this website which pertain to the drawbacks of Ultraviolet.Fighting to insist on DVD versions for movies & TV just may be the last vestige of control remaining between the public & absolute control of providers . Once you lose those freedoms to choose ; they wont come back.Welcome to the `` 1984 '' version of a controlled society .	-1
This character continued to act like a spoiled brat & even with a 'stellar cast ' it just got to tiring to watch . He did n't even change . It just became wooded & let me be clear I 'm talking about the lead 's acting . The father and all the others , a stellar cast , changed and grew . They were effected by the events that transpired . The lead did not .	-1
As most people find themselves rooting for the underdog , a couple who are Russian spies in the U.S . I ca n't root , nor watch this , I 'm in conflict over the fact that I 'm an American . I 'm caught between rooting for the FBI guy to catch the couple and the couple . Would n't recommend any American to watch it .	-1
The show starts out with a scene of consensual sex ( oral sex ) . Later , the woman who was performing the oral sex is shown in a flashback.. being raped . I did n't even make it through the first episode . I am concerned about so many people tolerating so much these days . Fairly graphic sex and violence in shows like this can lead to an increase in appetite for more intensely graphic sex and violence . I realize most people do n't care at all what they watch , or give any thought to what they watch , and will just sit there and absorb anything . It 's too bad . I think it is wise for all of us to be careful what we put in our minds . I do n't think the average person will watch a show like this , then go out and rape someone . But , I think watching such things does have a negative effect on us in some way .	-1
I do n't mind suspending my hold on reality to enjoy a good show . But this show asks too much . These spies are so devoted to the & # 34 ; mother country & # 34 ; that they jeopardize their kids . I 'm sure Russians love their children , so what 's up with this absurd notion ? Then they just happen to have a new neighbor who just happens to be an FBI agent recently back from deep cover and assigned to counterespionage . I mean c'mon . Then the scene in the garage getting the jumper cables out of the trunk where the hostage is lying bound and gagged for days and the agent gets close enough that the smell coming from that trunk would have knocked him over ! Then the spies dump a body in the drink and proceed to have sex at the scene ! ! ! And the ending was just plain ridiculous . Seeing the husband spy in the shadows after the agent leaves his garage was laughable . What 's he live in there with his gun at the ready ? No thanks ! You have to do better than this .	-1
This is a very good series but there seems to be a sex scene every few minutes of spies having sex with other spies etc . This takes away from the show and becomes very irritating .	-1
The show is entirely too graphic when it comes to the sex scenes and half of the show involves sex scenes . Also , the show would much more fun if the star characters had a good relationship instead of what they have .	-1
Two things to consider when playing a spy . Don ; t act like one and do your homework on that particular country . This series is seriously horrible , rediculous and unbelievable . Also , the sexual content has no redeeming features which is also known as a description of pornography . A caveat to the producers and directors . If you do n't know what you are talking about do n't put it in the script .	-1
Did n't ever get past the second episode . Seemed a lot of it centered around sex scenes and talk.Do n't recommend it .	-1
Just a bad show overall . I tried to like it , but a lot about the show was just off . VERY off . I could suspend belief and understand that the family was deep undercover . However , once you look deeper , you will see how poorly constructed the plot is . It 's a color-by-numbers ripoff of the Breaking Bad and Shield formula , except it 's not about meth or crooked cops . These so-called undercover spies operate like the mafia . All of it is ridiculously transparent , plus guess what , the FBI agent on the lookout for guys like them lives next door ! ! ! I find it hard to believe anyone could possibly enjoy this show !	-1
We will NOT watch just any piece of garbage they come up with to put on TV ! I always preview anything for my family to watch to make sure there is no & # 34 ; surprises & # 34 ; . This & # 34 ; surprise & # 34 ; was right there at the very beginning of the show ! that is as far as I got . If you want . good , decent , quality viewing ... .do not watch this.If you enjoy trash and garbage..this is for you .	-1
I HAD NO IDEA HOW OVER THE TOP with sex and violnce this series would be . i will not watch again	-1
A potentially good story , good premise , however the producers once again succumbed to using & # 34 ; lessons in how to perform sexually & # 34 ; in order to capture the attentions of those who still need these lessons . Oh , how I wish a story could be told without the explicit demonstrations of all types of perversions . The British seem to be able to do so - subtly , and often with humor . I watched 3 episodes before getting sick of it .	-1
I am a God fearing woman and sex scenes are not what I want to watch so I changed the show immediately .	-1
I loved the pilot , and I thought that I had found another Breaking Bad/Mad Men quality tv show . Great characters , plot , acting , etc . However , episode after episode after episode made me lose interest and my disgust for the characters increased . Now , I am about mid-season and I really do n't want to watch anymore , but I still have a little bit of hope that it will get better . There are so many things wrong with this show.1 . The Americans in the show are all completely and utterly stupid . I always suspected the FBI and CIA were not very good at dealing with people from other countries . It 's our culture 's lack of foreign language ability , arrogance , and ignorance of other cultures . But I just ca n't believe that everyone in the FBI is this stupid and incompetent and naive . It 's really hard to watch stupidity.2 . The Russians are all extremely intelligent . Their martial arts and fighting skills are above everyone 's elses . They never make a mistake and they are always ahead of the game . It 's frustrating to watch one side be so dominant ( and it 's the side I do n't like ) and the other side be so stupid . They win every fight they are in . They outsmart everyone around them . Blah . Boring.3 . The story and the characters are implausible . I am a foreign language teacher , and no one can learn English that well after 12 years old , and I am pretty sure these Russians were not speaking English when they were in elementary school . The two main characters speak perfect accentless English like someone who was born in the US to two native born parents . Their actions and behaviors are 100 % American . They do n't even look slavic . It 's just not realistic . They fit in too well . Also , do n't their children wonder where their parents go at night ? ? ? ? ? ? I just ca n't recommend this show .	-1
The main characters are too new or too blase ' because I found it boring . They have no believable drama when it calls for it and look like actors on a stick . Sorry but I fail to see why it was renewed .	-1
I DO N'T CARE TO WATCH PEOPLE HAVING SEX OR KILLING EACH OTHER . MIGHT BE AN INTERESTING SHOW WITHOUT ALL THAT . I WATCHED THE FIRST EPISODE AND WAS N'T IMPRESSED MUCH . DECIDED TO GIVE IT ONE MORE CHANCE SO I STARTED TO WATCH THE SECOND EPISODE AND SHUT IT OFF AT THE BEGINNING . LIKE I SAID : TOO MUCH SEX AND VIOLENCE . NOT ENTERTAINING AT ALL !	-1
I got so bored that i turned the thing off about 1/4 of the way through . Sorry , not for me	-1
The summary write up was intriguing . The open action sequence was excellent . The fight choreography great . Listening to Fleetwood Mac in the background added a good pulse-generating touch . So tell me , Mr . Writer and Mr. Producer , is it really necessary to throw in oral sex within the first fifteen minutes ( with another round for good measure minutes later ) ? Just what did that add to the plot ? Is this the `` art imitating life '' that we hear , over and over ? I do n't consider myself Mr. Moralist but I know that where there 's smoke , there 's fire . As I am told repeatedly , if I do n't like it , I do n't have to watch it . So , I 'm not watching it . You took a perfectly good story , with good acting , and urinated on it .	-1
The story was interesting but there were a lot of scenes I did not consider even with the rating ( I figured it was on family tv )	-1
I lived in this era and it is particularly hard to watch such a bad portrayal of the events and the times .	-1
This show qualifies as a brainless cult garbage tv series . Wooden acting , cartoonish looking cover and makeup , the writers would n't know a good script if they saw one , and this is just directionless , pointless and stupid show .	-1
The core device of horror in Would You Rather is n't terrible : desperate people are competing , and getting paid to do horrible things to one another . Many horror movies these days have populist and/or & # 34 ; game show & # 34 ; angle . Recently 13 Sins and Cheap Thrills played with this concept in a pretty satisfying way.Would You Rather unfortunately distinguishes itself from those movies by not making much sense . The title suggests something like Fear Factor , where participants torture themselves . But what they actually do is choose which other participant they will do something awful too . That said , there is no consequence for choosing wrong , or a real way to lose -- -except not participating.Players die incidentally because they are tasked with stabbing , hurting , and mutilating each other -- -not because of some wicked twist in the game or whatever . The ending is also plain old stupid , and there are continuity errors in the film . And perhaps the biggest issue of all : the gore is very weak .	-1
Intended as a brutal , cruel installment to the torture porn subgenre , it felt like the intensity was declawed , domesticated and rendered family-friendly . However , at times the character dynamic in this ridiculous scenario makes the movie at least watchable , although still falling short of recommendable.Iris ( Brittany Snow ) is a good person with a good heart who finds herself in a difficult situation . Her parents are dead , she has no money and no job , and she is left to care for her terminally ill brother . Philanthropist Shepard Lambrick ( Jeffrey Combs ) offers Iris an opportunity to change her life in the form of an invitation to a dinner party that offers a solution to all of her foreseeable problems , financial or otherwise . Upon arrival , Iris finds herself among similarly desperate individuals all looking to make some money . Basically , this is Dinner for Schmucks if the schmucks were financially desperate and the hosts wanted to morally bankrupt them one sadistic challenge at a time.The guests include a mix of transients , gamblers , young and old , able and wheelchair-bound , friendly and unfriendly . Completely out of left field , one of them is played by porn star Sasha Grey . But the real wild card in this rated-R truth or dare is going to be the sweet , naive old lady in the wheelchair . What is she going to do to people ? What are people going to do to her ? It starts out with mean-spirited intentions -- masked as helping people -- in the form of paying a vegetarian to eat steak and fois gras and coercing an alcoholic to binge drink fine scotch . But they quickly graduate to things like `` would you rather electrocute yourself or Iris ? '' Then lashings , stabbings , drowning and some other seemingly mundane , poorly executed , unshocking punishments . Even things that should have been hard to watch ( in the hands of a different director ) were presented in subdued , PG-13 form . Really , I could watch this with my grandmother . She 's seen Goodfellas and The Godfather , both of which have more scares , shocks and brutality than this.Iris is clearly meant to serve as the audience 's moral compass . But I never found myself rooting for her , nor caring about her or any of the other characters ... except for maybe the transient , selfish Amy ( Sasha Grey ) , the first one who realized how to get out of this alive . In fact , from the start Amy really embraced the concept and celebrated the challenges as a malevolent force.Fledgling director David Guy Levy likely intended this to be a brutal , cruel installment to the torture porn subgenre . However , I felt that the intensity was declawed . I felt no suspense . But I did enjoy watching the character dynamic as people tried to rationalize their `` would you rather '' options . A task that , again , Amy really owned . So while I was disappointed by the near gorelessness , watching the `` game '' still offered sufficient entertainment.A major shock was that the best performance was n't by horror king Jeffrey Combs or Pitch Perfect ( 2012 ) favorite Brittany Snow . The only convincing character was Sasha Grey 's coarse portrayal of Amy . But there were no shocks from schlock , gore , moral corruption , torture , cruelty or even the lame attempt a surprise twist ending . Oh , and the old , sweet nave lady in the wheelchair ? Totally under- , or even un-utilized ; mishandled by too much restraint while directing a film in which there should be no restraint ! What a waste.If you are looking for jaw-drops , you wo n't find them in Would You Rather . I would only recommend this to someone who watches no fewer than four horror movies per week . Really . Like four . As in , you probably systematically try to watch all horror ever anyway and wo n't listen to me as I try to warn you away .	-1
This movie was really rather predictable . Even the ending , I had a sense of the last minutes of the film , in the first 10 minutes.Really interesting idea for a movie , but it was not executed very well . It is a little like SAW films , but less entertaining , and with a plot that is totally transparent.The acting was pretty poor , the characters where never developed , you never even find out the reason each character is there except the main one . It is almost a half finished film in that regard . It is very short , I can not help but wonder if they chopped off an hour or so of the film.While the camera work is not low budget . Everything else about the film is . A lot of opportunities for any kind of special effects are skipped with the camera cutting away , then the results seen.At the time of me writing this , the movie had 5 stars . Though the movie is not exactly 1 star , it is more like 2 , I can not justify giving it two stars . Because someone might actually think it is worth renting . IT IS NOT.At best this is a Sci-fi channel movie . It is as bad as a B-Movie but with none of the charm , or quirks that really make those types of films enjoyable.Please do not rent this movie . But if you do , be prepared to write a review , so others do not make the same mistake . If proving me wrong is worth $ 6.99 by all means go for it . But there are much better ways to spend your money . This is not worth 6.99 to own let alone rent .	-1
There will be some people who instantly dismiss the low budget shocker `` Would You Rather '' based on its rather unpleasant conceit . Indeed , the movie was brutalized by most mainstream critics upon its release . It currently averages a dismal 20 out of 100 possible points on the review aggregate site Metacritic . Despite this fact , I was never deterred by its ghoulish premise . I embraced it and it was a major selling point ! I 'm not squeamish , I welcome an experience that will shock and disturb me . Truthfully , I did n't hate `` Would You Rather . '' I did , however , feel that it fell far short of its potential . At 2 1/2 stars , I 'm giving credit to one of the B-movie greats . Jeffrey Combs ( always the Re-Animator in my heart ) gives an unexpected and offbeat performance as a bored millionaire that uses real people in his sadistic entertainment . He made me laugh on occasion and his interactions with his staff and his son are quite funny ( although to be fair , maybe some of these sequences are unintentionally amusing ) . The overall experience was so dire and monotonously downbeat , I welcomed each instance of levity . After all , are n't games supposed to be fun ? Combs , as I mentioned , plays an unorthodox philanthropist who hosts exotic dinner parties . He scours the city for likely invitees and brings them together for one unforgettable night . Brittany Snow plays an enterprising , but struggling , young lady who has moved home to care for her terminally ill brother . Treatment is expensive and hope is thin . When Combs proposes a chance for her to win financial independence and stellar medical care , it is an offer she ca n't refuse . Upon arriving at his estate , she meets other equally needy attendees . As the evening progresses , Combs seems intent on pushing everyone to their limits . How much would it take for a diehard vegan to eat meat ? A recovering alcoholic to get blotto ? This is simply a teaser , though . When the game of Would You Rather begins , contestants are pitted against each other in a series of events that escalate in gruesomeness . Who will be the eventual winner and what will winning cost ? Absolutely terrific idea , right ? For the movie to truly succeed for me , though , I needed one of two things . Either I really had to care about the characters or the competition had to be far more imaginative and fun . Snow is fine , if a bit drab . While she is supposed to be our moral center , I found myself rooting for Sasha Grey ( as no-nonsense Amy ) instead . Combs is a joy to watch , but the game lacked something overall . I wo n't spoil the individual surprises , but the realm of torture porn cinema has really raised the stakes in films of this kind . This is brutal and unpleasant , but surprisingly toothless as well . Touted , I suppose , as psychological horror -- there is n't undue gore . But again , the characters did n't give me a lot to care about . Add the unnecessary and poorly developed subplot about the doctor , the intriguing father/son dynamic that is forgotten when necessary , and an ending telegraphed a mile away and I wanted to like `` Would You Rather '' much more than I did . I guess I 'm officially jaded . This did n't really shock me , but its relentlessness did depress me . KGHarris , 7/13 .	-1
I would rather eat toe jam football from the south end of a northbound rhino , or smell the breath of a stank , non brushed whino , and that would all be just fine'o , rather than ever watch this movie again ! ! ! ! Not even close to Hostel , or Saw quality ... .save your money folks ! ! ! !	-1
Talk about a drab , colorless , senseless film.I adore horror thriller based films but this clunker falls short of most any genre you can think of . It 's washed out cinematography is only surpassed by even more washed out performances - it 's as if they borrowed the premise of the Saw franchise minus the gore and genuine tension of the first and then proceeded to steal , at least to some degree the story line of `` The Game '' - and pulled the eyeball slicing right out of the classic horror/thriller `` Repulsion '' .There is nothing here you wo n't see coming and nothing you have n't seen before .	-1
it was an unknown to known movie to be known of i did not understand the opinion of the flick and i want to give it a one star for the grouping ...	-1
Basically you have a lot of wasted time each episode . The hosting is boring , the guests are dull , the laughter is sometimes obviously fake.The videos are funny , though . They get less entertaining because of the lead ins , but they are the ONLY reason to watch this show.It would be better for you to spend your time searching Youtube . That is basically what this show is -- a Youtube search -- with a ton of inane and unfunny discussion added to it .	-1
Disappointing English language remake of the classic 1976 Spanish horror flick Who Can Kill A Child ? about a young couple on vacation who land on an island that seems to be completely deserted except for some children . Stephen King co-opted the basic premise for his famous 1977 short story Children of the Corn so what seemed pretty novel and shocking in 1976 is much less so now . This version follows the old Spanish flick very , very closely but where the original was extremely creepy this version is hamstrung by lousy acting ( from the adult leads and the children alike ) and never manages to generate any suspense whatsoever . In this film the first victim the protagonist sees killed by the children is stabbed and bludgeoned with rocks . In the original film the first victim was hung up like a human pinata while a smiling little girl slashes at him with a scythe . Which sounds creepier to you ? Like the 2004 version of The Manchurian Candidate this ultimately comes across as much more timid and less imaginative than the original movie it 's a remake of .	-1
The film begins with a young man wandering down a large , Mexican thoroughfare with a stricken expression on his face . A massive carnival -- fireworks , puppets , costumes , crowded frivolity -- billows around him as he stops and asks , over and over , where he can get a boat . Everyone points him down the street a ways . He wanders in that direction for a bit before stopping to ask yet another person . Over and over . Finally he finds a man in a bar who agrees to rent him his personal boat that he uses for work . The man goes back to his motel room ( and pregnant wife ) pleased . The next day , he finds the man at the dock , and without making any kind of real arrangements -- no paperwork , no discussion about where he 's going , no ID , just a wad of cash handed over -- the couple takes the boat and sails off into some seriously bombastic opening credits , the kind that think volume is a good substitute for craft.I 'm not sure what the point of this very drawn-out , very misleading intro was meant to be , but it neatly summarizes a lot of what 's wrong with this film . It has a broken-ankle pacing , too much information is left out and what is n't is both repetitive and misleading , and never is there a real sense of who these people are , what they want to do , and what 's going on around them . It gets worse when they land on an island that appears to be populated only by children of sinister intent.I 'll grant you , the bones of the story are n't too shabby . In abler hands -- with stronger dialogue , more believable characters , and kids that can actually act -- the film could 've been quite a thrill . It 's just that the movie has nothing more going for it than its central concept , which is really just a kernel of what it should be . None of the concepts or ideas that surround it are explored . No real lessons are learned . Even when people are ( ostensibly ) running for their lives , it feels like nothing is at stake . Perhaps that 's because the editing is so choppy , or the soundtrack is so inconsistent and in-your-face , or the characters are so featureless , or the attempts at gore and shock are mostly just intrusive and laughable . In any event , the end result is just dull .	-1
Come Out and Play ( Makinov , 2012 ) I first heard about the Spanish exploitation/horror flick Who Can Kill a Child ? When Eli Roth touted it in a Five Films segment on the late ( and much-lamented , at least at Goat Central ) Rotten Tomatoes Show . At the time & # 8212 ; this was probably five years ago now as I write this in November 2013 & # 8212 ; it was pretty much impossible to find in the United States Fast-forward to 2013 and I still have n't managed to catch the original . Unfortunately , I was unaware that Come Out and Play , directed by one Makinov ( rumor has it this is Mexican director Gerardo Naranjo under a pseudonym , but I have not seen firm confirmation of that yet ) , was a shot-by-shot remake of Who Can Kill a Child ? until I was about ten minutes into it . By that time I figured I would give it a shot , no pun intended . While I watched , I half-perused the vitriol unleashed at the movie on the IMDB message boards . I did n't hate it nearly as much as a lot of people did , it would seem . But then , I repeat , I have n't seen the original . For all I know they are completely justified , and let 's face it , how often are shot-by-shot remakes successful ? ( Let 's put aside the woeful remakes that would have been infinitely better had their directors opted for that approach . ) Plot : the members of The Offspring ... no , I kid ( though I have had that song going through my head for hours now ) . A young married couple , Francis ( The Lake House 's Ebon Miss-Bachrach ) and Beth ( Vinessa Shaw from the The Hills Have Eyes remake ) , are taking one last vacation before they become parents , looking to get away from it all on a secluded island . When they get there , they notice a few kids fishing on the pier , but do n't see any adults . They think nothing of it and head for their hotel , which is , again , oddly deserted . Eventually they realize there 's a pattern here.My favorite thing about the movie , by far , was Makinov 's attempts to get that seventies vibe going . There 's a scene where a character is trapped in a radio hut with frosted windows , and you see hands banging the windows over and over again . That 's nice stuff , right there , and for the most part there was no attempt to go young-and-beautiful with this cast ( that would have actually not made a great deal of sense & # 8212 ; after all , if your & # 8220 ; adults & # 8221 ; are only a few years older than your kids ... ) . That , too , contributes to the seventies atmosphere . On the other hand , and this may seem contradictory , one of the few reasons one would consider watching a remake instead of just going back and watching the original is seeing how a director will take advantage of the updated technology available thirty-five years later to come up with gorier special effects . And yes , I 'm the first to admit I 'd probably be yelling at him for destroying the atmosphere if he actually had , but I end up asking the usual question : why did this movie need to get made in the first place ? It 's rather pretty , save some ridiculous , overdone scenes ( wait till you see the hilarious opening shot of the end credits ) , and the acting is at least competent , but there 's nothing here that would set this apart from about three hundred other horror films currently on Netflix Instant that either never made it to theaters in your area or never made it into theaters at all , and they all have the advantage of not being remakes . This is one of those & # 8220 ; if you 're drunk and have nothing better to do on a Friday night ... & # 8221 ; selections . **	-1
This series is about what 's wrong with America . A Popeye 's employee , who should have been fired on the spot , is given a `` mentor '' , and put on the fast track to becoming a trainer . It 's probably all a big lie , but maybe it is n't . Employees who work hard and do their job see other employees who are terrible get away with it , so why work hard at your job ? After watching a few episodes , I do think it 's all fake . There 's a guy who walks an hour each way to work , so Popeye 's gives him 10 grand to buy a car . I 'd have given him $ 20 to buy a used bike . He ca n't figure out to car pool with someone , take the bus , or get a bike ? Give me a break . I 've worked lots of jobs . I have n't seen lots of people who work real hard , but do n't get recognized . What I 've seen is lots of people who do crappy work , steal from the company , and should be fired . Yes , the show is fake .	-1
Anyone with an interest in the minds of sociopathic serial killers would of course be fascinated by Jeffrey Dahmer . And I would imagine captivated as I was by the in depth Stone Phillips interview series with Dahmer , his father and his mother.Unfortunately , `` The Jeffery Dahmer Files '' tells us nothing new , poses no new questions nor does it leave you thinking much of anything aside from wishing you had you had that hour and twenty minutes back . Documentaries are a genre which I adore . Brilliant film makers such as Enroll Morris know and understand that the subject weaves the story - there is no room what so ever for hokey `` re-enactments '' and staged self serving dialogue.Director Chris James Thompson never moves past a dull and hollow presentation , there 's no insight into Dahmer just a huge dependence on over played news footage and again community theater level `` re-enactments '' all this makes for is pretty awful story telling and worse movie making.Take a pass on this dreadfully dull failure and watch the Stone Phillips interview series on Dahmer I assure you it 's riveting and I believe it 's also available in it 's entirety on youtube .	-1
This show had some potential , but it was cancelled by the network . Not worth the time to watch just a couple of episodes .	-1
But poorly acted and directed . Shame . The story line has a lot of potential but it seems the casting director missed the mark and mbecause it appears to be so poorly directed , the actors do not seem to have much to work wi\th .	-1
Nothing else to say that aside of the plot is very unclear ... and probably as amateur of SCIFI it 's simply not my treat .	-1
I always thought Meagan was a bit arrogant , but since she was a neurosurgeon I was willing to give her a break because it comes with the territory . However , this current season , she has gone well past the lines of ego right up to hubris . She is no longer amusing to be around and if the behavior ( read writing ) does n't change , I will be leaving this show , even if they did bring a hunk on board to play Tommy .	-1
As much as I love Mark Valley as an Actor ( Human Target ) , and I think bringing him into the mix here was a good idea , how Delaney treats him and her own character has totally changed the show . Her attitude is just disgusting now , and they lost me as a viewer after the third episode . I dont see it as making it to season 4 without MAJOR changes in her attitude towards others .	-1
I could find nothing to commend this film . Photography , script , screenplay and direction is poor . What could have been a suspenseful story was a bore . Marisa Tomei 's performance was lackluster , principally because of a sparce script that left her little to work with . She is described as starring in the film description , but her character has only a weak supporting role . Other actors seemed to be reluctant to act . Not even a `` B '' movie . Most disappointing . This film should not have been made .	-1
It is sad , but I could n't watch it with my kids , because of the language and some of the videos with nudity . I really think it should be rated PG13	-1
it seems they are more interested creating a serial like drama than any semblance of an accurate historical tale . another complaint would be that 50 percent of the time you are left looking at a black screen . i guess you save a lot of money on setting , make-up , costumes and so on , but really is not amusing to watch .	-1
Was very disappointed . We were looking for a series we could watch w our teens . Had too much offensive material to continue .	-1
I can tolerate a certain amount of graphic violence & understand that Viking life was n't all sitting around looking for 4-leaf clovers - but this was WAY , WAY TOO MUCH !	-1
this just did n't excite me . poor language skills . characters were n't exciting . I did n't even make it through the first episode	-1
My son started to watch it and told me he skipped some parts . I just shut it off . Could have been so much better without some of the shots .	-1
I guess the most disappointing aspect that I really found despicable and I watched most of the series - was the obvious hatred of Christians written in by series writers . All male Christians in the series were portrayed as sniveling cowards that cried like & # 34 ; little girls & # 34 ; throughout the series . In addition , there was an obvious flaunting of sexual perversion against the priest that , although a sniveling coward is kept like a pet by Ragnah . He and his wife mock the priest by inviting him in their bed , something Vikings of that time would never have done . Just some more Hollywood perversion portrayed as historical fact by anti-Christian bigots .	-1
Since it was a FREE show I clicked and watched . I really tried to get into this show , being a fan of this genre and all , but nope it sucked . I will not be buying Season 2 . Same ole ' plot Hollywood tends to lace EVERY piece of crap movie/series they create with . They can write a show about Neanderthals ( cavemen ) and it would be the same crap ( oh wait , they did ! ) ... ..I can name at least 15 movies that are EXACTLY the same as this ole ' mess . Besides that , the show was very violent & bloody . I understand that Vikings were filthy disgusting uncivilized feral savages , but d @ mn ! I felt some kind of way , about seeing a room full of defenseless cowering & # 34 ; Priests & # 34 ; being butchered while crying & begging for their lives ( anyone who enjoyed that , and judge me for not , is nothing but a sick sadist ) Then the horrific scene at that Viking temple ( good lawd ! ) Seriously , the & # 34 ; fake blood & # 34 ; expense must have accounted for a 3rd of the budget . I found nothing likable about ANY of the characters on this show ... . I smh at how these Hollywood writers ( as always ) try to make the villains look favorable ( but then this is part of the & # 34 ; agenda & # 34 ; to further desensitize people to violence & sexual situations ) . That Ragnarock ( whatever his name was ) and his crew were nothing but a bunch of savage serial killers & rapist . I also REALLY did n't enjoy looking at dirty sweaty greasy gross lice infested people who looked like they smelled like cattle . Whom all slept in the same beds & had sex in the same room where their children were sleeping . I keep seeing reviews comparing this show to & # 34 ; Game of Thrones & # 34 ; . G.O.T is messy & bloody with similar plots , but between the two , G.O.T is 5-Stars compared to this one.For all of you that feel the need to defend Viking culture & the like . If HALF of what I 've read about Viking culture is true , there is absolutely NOTHING to be proud of being a descendant of these people . They were horrible violent feral savages both male & female.P.S . I could n't careless about those of you that have nothing better to do than criticize peoples 1-Star reviews . So ! @ & # you in advance . Good night .	-1
Our 'hero ' is n't particularly heroic . The British are portrayed at insufferable just for defending their homeland . The idea of a shield maiden is n't developed enough to mean anything . A main character is both a boatwright and a seer without explanation . Our hero is about to dump his wife for lack of a long string of male heirs . I do n't expect anyone to clean up history , such as it is , but some illumination might work . Given this is a history channel exclusive , we could have woven in some explanation of the levels of technology we are witnessing .	-1
My title says it all . Perhaps I just did n't have the patience to get further into the story but , after the heroine ( wife of the main Viking prince ) dispatches two rape-intent clods so neatly , I knew I was in no mood for fantasy . Maybe episode two would have been better but I did n't care enough to sample it .	-1
Although hopes are raised by some parts of the opening episode , rather like the opening of Gladiator , the episode and the series rapidly discards its potential for excellence and becomes a humdrum piece of nonsense . Reminiscent of Nicholas & # 34 ; one expression & # 34 ; Cage , the lead actor does little except adopt his Blue Steel face and look knowingly heroic and invincible through the rest of the series of implausible confrontations , illogical plot sequences and anachronistic feminist episodes . They may have got the haircuts right but the larger representation of the Viking style and culture is laughably misunderstood and misrepresented by standard plot mechanisms that could be transported to any age , such as the lone hero/Roman/detective/office worker who stands up to the one-dimensional evil boss/lord/king/Caesar , while supported by the strong woman and the loyal side kick , proving others wrong at every turn and always being right in his single-minded and , again . one dimensional righteousness . Abnormally disappointing .	-1
I love cooking competition shows . But this one gets on my nerves with the ( really bad ) & # 34 ; jokes & # 34 ; and with the Chairman 's antics ... .really did n't like it . Obviously a lot of folks disagree with me as it is now in its 8th season . Just was n't my taste .	-1
It still amazes me how little people prepare themselves for making what is probably the biggest investment in their lifetime . They worry about little things like the color of paint , or cleaning the carpet . One couple liked the look of ivy climbing up a cinder block wall which faced their back yard . It did n't bother them that the wall was part of the industrial building next door . They did n't stop to realize that the price of the house , which was lower than typical for that street , had a reason . The higher priced houses were farther down the street from the factory , Other people liked the furnishings , or other items in a house , which normally do not go with the sale of the house unless those items are in a separate personal property sale agreement . Finally , I do n't know many people who purchase a house after looking at only three houses . This program has too much repeating of names , locations , and other facts , and in general is a poorly made time filler . When I was a sales person , if I made as many errors in a sales presentation as most of the agents in this program do I would have starved and quickly gone out of business . Buyers do n't care what a sales person likes as the term , & # 34 ; I like ... & # 34 ; is used over and over again during the sales presentations . The buyers were also about as competent as the sales person as they lacked basic knowledge and common sense .	-1
My wife and I got some great ideas for decorations and we like the & # 34 ; contest & # 34 ; aspect of the show , but ultimately the prissy attitudes of the judges ( especially the French guy ... go figure ) are tough to swallow ( pun intended ) . I will give the show 2 stars only because of entertainment value and nothing more . You can find better ways to spend your time and energy than with this show . I 'm sad that I will not be able to regain the lost hours of our lives having been spent on this . : - (	-1
This shows takes about 4 breaks and at each return totally recaps the entire previous segments . Not just with talking but showing all the houses they 've already seen , over and over and over again . After each break we hear about the couple , why they are looking for a new house , what are their needs , why they liked and disliked the previous house . The result is that you do n't spend much time seeing the actual houses . This was a great idea for a show , part travel show . But I could n't stand all the recaps .	-1
How can they rename a movie and then say it is being released before in theaters ! That is really a rip off . That is so insulting , this movie was made in 2009 and is not being released in theaters . We are being played for money ! They should be more honest with us the renters and viewers . I am seriouisly offended , because I have spent a lot of money on Amazon rentals and purchases and trusted them .	-1
6 Souls used to be called Shelter but after hemorrhaging cash at the global box office the producers changed the name and foisted it off on the streaming crowd to see if we 'd give it a second chance . Fortunately , I watched it on Netflix for free but there 's little redeeming about this poorly paced , confusing mess of a plot.Julianne Moore and Jonathan Rhys Meyers are both excellent and struggle to keep the fun going as the screenplay slowly gives up the ghost and unfortunately for these guys they 're in practically every single scene . The psychological claptrap quickly disappates to JRM showing us how many American accents he can do as he gets possessed evermore frequently , and somehow the `` scientists '' involved do n't decide to call it quits and go home before something really bad happens.Something really bad does happen , of course , involving a random dartboard collection of a preacher , a crazy-blind-old-woman-witch-doctor , skin breakouts that need urgent medical attention and bucketloads of exposition to fill in all the gaps . In darting between deciding what sort of story this is going to be , the audience gets thoroughly confused and the film treads a line where it never manages to be scary , interesting or gripping . Despite good performances from the two main characters , they ca n't save this one - skip unless you 're very , very bored .	-1
This is a movie worth watching . I personally do n't care for Juliann Moore 's acting . Good for watching on a night when there is n't anything else on .	-1
Too much ... everything , my sense is that the writers were a bit immature for the subject matter that could have been brought into the plot but was delayed to bring out points for shock value as soon as possible .	-1
We watched only one episode but found this to be too dark and depressing for us . A bit uncomfortable with the relationship between mom Bates and her son Norman . Not recommended .	-1
Yuck ... were do I start . Nothing made me want to watch the ten episodes over . The scences of mother and son sleeping in the same bed are really creepy . Poor guy .	-1
When I first became aware that `` Bates Motel '' was coming to A & E ; , I was fascinated ( as a huge fan of Alfred Hitchcock 's `` Psycho '' ) to see what direction the show would take the Bates characters . Unfortunately , there is too little of that juicy dramatic material in this show ( at least so far ) and far too much `` stand-alone '' stuff that just is n't interesting enough to hold my interest.For a basic plot summary , the show sees Norma Bates ( Vera Farmiga ) and her two sons Norman ( Freddie Highmore ) & Dylan ( Max Theriot ) trying to start a new life after the death of Mr. Bates by opening a motel in a small-town community . What they do n't know , however , is that the town has more mysterious within it than those already bubbling to the surface of the crazy Bates family itself ! The trouble with this show is that it could almost be considered false advertising for fans like me ( e.g . those watching for the nods to `` Psycho '' continuity ) . The series is 75 % focused on original dramatic plotlines with only 25 % on the real `` meat '' of the mother-son relationship that really should fuel the story . Basically , every episode would leave me mostly disappointed ( and not raring to watch the next , by any means ) but also with a nugget or two of really good canon material.On the one main positive note , the acting in this show is excellent . Farmiga is chilling as Mrs. Bates , while one could easily see Highmore turning into a picture-perfect Anthony Perkins Norman.Of course , that is just one man 's opinion . I have a brother who also watches the show ( he has never seen Psycho ) and he loves the original plots . So , perhaps it really in this case does depend on why exactly you are sitting down to watch the show in the first place . If you just want another mini-series type drama , it might be okay for you . But if , like me , you have high expectations of the showing becoming true `` Psycho canon '' material , then you 'll likely be disappointed ( I actually consider the events of `` Psycho IV '' to be just as , if not more , interesting than this show so far in terms of explaining the backstory of Norman Bates ) .I 'll probably be back for the Second Season of this show , but it will be grudgingly and with a short leash . If it continues to only tease and tease with very little `` payout '' , I do n't think I could give it an entire season to play out again .	-1
This film got off to a great start . Great scenes ; great cinematogrphy ; grerat acting ; great direction.The the two Brits show up and do NOTHING but pick fights , try to assert themselves very obnoxiously , and be generally very irritating . mean -- -it 's just not believeable that you 're going to be real argumentative with two Lugers pointed at your face . When guns were pointed at my face a couple of times , my basic thought was , & # 34 ; I hope this b*stard does n't get nervous and make a mistake ! & # 34 ; Ergo , you don ; t want tpo be arguing and yelling at the guy with the gun in your face.Also , I could n't understabnd a word the two Brits were saying . At least the Germans had subtitles . The Brit captain became so absurd in his demands and arrogance that I found myself rooting for the Germans.I turned this dog off . It 's just made up , preachy , silly , absurd crap that I suppose will entertain the much-younger than I am . Seeit if you want .	-1
I bought it and after watching it I thought will I ever watch it again ? ... .no it was good to watch one time and that was it . so I sold it asap . very sad movie and do n't let the plane on the cover art fool you , i did n't see them in the plane lol	-1
Even though I know that military families move regularly and often , I still find the changes in cast a problem . The dramatic spark at the beginning of the season is not well handled . I wonder how long it will last now ?	-1
my daughter got this show without asking..i dont even care to see it..It looks like hype to me . I didnt see any bevies of smokin hotties ( like on the cover ) at the Navy Exchange , but rather what they refer to as small herds of dependapotamus 's roaming the aisles blocking traffic with their extremely wide pondunkadunks ... just sayin ... ; - )	-1
The quality definitely shows its age and there are no educational value from it other than your kids will learn to call a big lizard to help solve manmade problems . Story lines are simple and may be boring to kids that like today 's computer-animated shows.With that said , it 's a safe way to introduce kids to Godzilla .	-1
The premise had some promise , but the computer could n't decide if it should be a law abiding style or a lunatic . The character development was lacking and all in all I would find more satisfaction by watching an infomercial .	-1
Zero stars if I could . Actually , NEGATIVE FIVE stars if I could.Wow . I ca n't believe how bad this film was . It actually became excruciating about halfway through . I had to force myself to keep watching it , so that I could write a review . This film should be taken down immediately , and all copies , draft materials , and anything else related to it should be destroyed . It can not be salvaged . You 'd be better off starting from scratch , than trying to save this film . This is one of the most detestable , deplorable , despicable movies I have ever seen that has tried to tout itself as a `` family film '' . Good grief it was bad . How bad was it ? The most morally admirable character was the VILLAIN , `` The Flamingo '' , and he 's obviously not that morally upright . I would say that this film was written by a disbarred lawyer , but even disbarred lawyers are familiar with the basics of ethics and morality . The writers of this film seem to have no understanding , nor familiarity with ethics.Perhaps the greatest reason that superheroes are a classical storytelling device is the fact that they offer the opportunity to draw clear delineations between what is right , and what is wrong . Superheroes often face moral dilemmas , but what makes them superheroes is the fact that they make the right choices , no matter how hard it is to do what 's right . Otherwise , they 're superVILLAINS . Superpowers , super abilities , and super tech do not make superheroes . CHOICES make superheroes.Now let 's examine the choices that this `` superhero '' family makes.Although the father recognizes that he needs to `` protect his family from a murderous mainframe '' , when faced with the financial repercussions of possibly losing his house , he caves stating `` fine , just do n't blow up my house '' . So , finances trump family ? Got it.Furthermore , the father loses any reluctance about the arrangement with the `` murderous mainframe '' once it becomes obvious to him that he can use the Grim Avenger tech to make his personal life better by using it for chores.After seriously scorching his neighbor 's house using a laser to trim hedges , rather than try to repair the damage , or make reparations , or even confess to it , he runs and hides like the deadbeats who hit someone 's parked car in the parking lot and leave without taking responsibility.The wife agrees to go to ( in her own words ) `` a dinner date '' at one of the most expensive restaurants in town alone with her gorgeous playboy coworker . All of the professional , married women that I know do n't eat meals with nor travel with male coworkers alone , but only in a group.When it becomes apparent to the father that `` The Flamingo '' is rampaging across the city in order to force a showdown , the father chooses to address largely invented family emergencies instead , at the cost to countless other families.To spy on his wife on her dinner date with Richard , the father implants a Grim Global Positioning Tracker in Richard , even though he 's at first horrified by the danger of implanting it in someone 's spinal cord ( but , hey , it 's okay if you do n't like the guy , right ? ) because he 's `` protecting his family '' . Evidently , trust for your spouse is n't requisite in protecting your family . ( And later he ironically berates the computer for invading his daughter 's privacy by checking Facebook . ) The father , rather than allow Richard to drive away with his wife , destroys Richard 's Corvette.The son , upon acquiring one of Grim Avenger 's power gauntlets , and after destroying a neighbor 's treehouse , rather than make reparations , or a confession , cuts and runs ( perhaps taking a cue from his father 's lack of moral compass ) .The son uses the power gauntlet to bully a bully ( becoming the evil that he had resented and detested ) .The father constantly shirks his end of the bargain , doing everything that he can to avoid training and crime fighting.The father uses the `` Hypno Spray '' to brainwash the most popular boy at his daughter 's school in order to completely reform him and force him to be his daughter 's boyfriend , then congratulates himself with `` THAT 's how to parent ! `` The father uses the x-ray goggles to cheat at the scratch-off lottery , by finding winning tickets.The son and daughter abandon her tasered , unconscious boyfriend on their porch , because they 're busy fighting over who gets the power gauntlet.The father uses the Grim Avenger super car just to get to his wife 's dinner in the city , then uses the Grim Avenger persona to save her presentation by offering the persona for marketing purposes . ( Then berates his children for using the super car to cheat `` whenever things get hard '' , but never realizes how hypocritical that is . ) The father allows his children to use the super car to get to school , so that he can continue to do marketing as the Grim Avenger for his wife . ( Then is surprised when they abuse it to skip school and become more popular . ) This also potentially endangers his family by exposing his secret identity , but the show never addresses this . It also eventually leads to `` The Flamingo '' gaining control of the super car , but fortunately for the city all he cares about is revenge , otherwise the city would have been screwed , no thanks to our `` heroes '' .The daughter uses the automated super car to cheat and pass her driver 's exam.The son speculates about selling Grim Avenger tech on eBay for money.The son uses tattling about his sister 's using the super car to pick up friends so that he can get out of trouble for skipping school.The father puts his children in danger by pursing criminals with them just to show them how important of a responsibility it is ( even though it 's the first time that he 's bothered to do any crime fighting ) .In answering his last chance questions , the father makes it clear in his answers that his family comes first , no matter the cost to society and the city . The movie deems that to be a virtue . What happens to the superhero ( or superspy ) families that were willing to put their families on the line for others ? That viewed the well-being of society as higher than their own well-being ? Since when is selfishness a virtue ? Disregard for others ? Unwillingness to sacrifice ? The family abandons a helpless , tied-up Richard in the same warehouse that had previously exploded and killed the prior Grim Avenger.The movie tries to have a huge moment at the end in the final fight where the father `` realizes '' a bunch of things like `` heroes do n't need masks '' , but he does n't actually realize anything meaningful . He comes off as a groundlessly cocky jerk , not someone who has been on a revelatory journey . It 's trite , with all of the moral goodness of twinkies.The movie ends with the family continuing to try to find ways to pimp out the Grim Avenger persona for marketing money . ( Then the father laughably asserts at the end of the film that `` This city needs us '' even though the opposite has been shown throughout the entire film . ) So how 's `` The Flamingo '' the most morally upright ? He goes out of his way to make sure that his actions do n't cause physical harm , almost to a laughable degree . On the other hand , the `` superhero '' family runs him over with a car , uses the `` Hypno Spray '' on him to brainwash him so that he can become their personal lawn care help rather than turning him in to authorities , and when the `` Hypno Spray '' wears off , they have a deadly robot ready to threaten him with physical harm if he does n't trim their hedges . Nice . I 'm so glad that a family with such a high regard for human life , and no propensity for abusing power has been granted so much power . ( Please note the sarcasm . Please ? ) Much of this would have been fine if there had been morals to any of these experiences where the family learned that what they had done was wrong , and that there are more important things in life than themselves . This is n't the case at all . It 's the opposite . Everything works out despite them not learning any lessons , and merely reinforces that they can cavalierly do whatever they want at the expense of any others . Most of the immoral and unethical things that this family does end up having ZERO negative consequences for the family ( although , the same can not be said for the innocent public who is saddled with this supervillain family ) .The problem with this film concept is that the family is detestable . The computer is right : they do n't deserve access to the Grim Avenger 's tech . They abuse it , and constantly put others in danger as a result . Their most dominant trait is family selfishness ( they are n't necessarily selfish individually , but their family as a group acts selfishly towards the rest of the world ) . They act as if their family and the happiness of the family justify any other type of action , no matter the repercussions for the rest of the world . If this family has to choose between either doing the right thing OR being happy , this family inevitably chooses to be selfishly happy . This family is closer to a family of supervillains , then a family of superheroes . Like supervillains , they use their powers for family gain rather than for the betterment of society.This show is detestable for its lack of ethics , and tone deafness , and is likely unsalvageable . Relegate the whole concept to the trash heap , or be honest , and make a show glamorizing a supervillain family .	-1
Mom 's the bread winner , dad 's the well meaning idiot , the kids are witty , and there 's a superhero involved . I ca n't take these formula CGI proposals anymore . After a plethora of superhero flicks and CGI animation , with cross pollination of the same , I ca n't say that I found a whole lot of originality in the first twenty minutes of what I saw.It did n't hold my attention for all of the character reasons I mentioned in the first paragraph . Maybe it 's just me , but I 'm really sick and tired of the man in the family always being the double digit IQ stay at home dad , and equally tired of the kids and mom knowing more than dad does.And does the world really need another superhero movie ? Well , one more could n't hurt . But domestic issues , to me , do not a movie make.I may try to give it another shot , but for now it 's lost me.Rescreen ; July 4th , 2013It 's as bad as I thought it would be , and worse . The `` villain '' is n't much of a villain , and the overall film is flat and lacks vision . And the alleged superhero does n't do much superhero work . With a script put together by a committee and a market research team , thing is as sociopathic as they come.Having said all that , I 'm sure it 'll recoup its cost in the market , but returns will be modest at best at its current status.Avoid this thing or watch it with some comfort food , because you 'll need it .	-1
This is a seriously awesome concept . More Americans need to be aware of what life is like in Burma . Unfortunately , since extremely significant reforms have occurred in Burma , this film would no longer be nearly as powerful as it would have been 2-3 years ago . Aung San Suu Kyi 's party has members who have been elected to parliament . She is no longer under house arrest.The film also suffers from extremely generic , stereotypical characters . I could have overlooked this and enjoyed the movie , if the message had still been wholly relevant . However , it isn't.I suppose that this movie could be reworked to take place in Tibet , or North Korea , or Chechnya ... or Syria ? But , I doubt it . No jungles . Different opposition organizations . Unfortunately , this film probably just needs to be indefinitely shelved . It 's too bad . It had potential .	-1
Did bot finish watching this it was a boring cartoon . Amazon made a mistake this one . Should habe had real people and real breast .	-1
Repetitive images and interview clips tire me out . Sure I believe something happened to this guy , obviously he 's traumatized . But the film is thin , and filled with too much of the same over and over again . Better to watch any other paranormal show than this .	-1
Let 's face it ; when a person dies , most likely he just vanishes into the ether . And no matter what people think , that same person probably did not exist before birth either . ( I 'll accept life at conception as well . ) But good luck trying to prove life after death , heaven or hell , etc . etc . Any of these positions is unprovable so arguing is just a waste of time.I did think about the film `` The Exorcist '' while watching `` My Amityville Horror . '' If you 've ever watched that much-earlier-and-much-better film on disk , William Friedkin gives a very nice introduction beforehand by saying something like , `` What you bring to the film you will get out of it . If you believe in evil , it will affect you in a certain way . If you do n't , then your experience will be different . '' I 'm paraphrasing a bit , but that was pretty much the gist of it . But in retrospect , I do believe that Mr. Friedkin was n't exactly correct ; I believe that `` The Exorcist '' is a danged scary movie no matter what belief system you have.And this documentary tries to spook you a little bit as well , but I do n't think that it actually works . No , let 's say that it fails miserably . Just because someone such as Lorraine Warren makes some assertion does n't mean that I will necessarily believe that assertion myself . And let 's face another fact ; without going for some cheap ad hominems -- which I could easily do and have seen others try with this film -- I did n't find Daniel Lutz to be exactly the most credible witness ever . It made me think of another documentary that I did n't much like , `` I Survived BTK . '' Both films should have been quite gripping , but in reality , I found both of them to be quite suspect , mostly because of issues with the main characters in both films.I have seen the original `` Amityville Horror '' quite a few times , and I still remember watching it the first time . While I was much younger , it did scare the hell out of me , especially the scene in the basement where the dog gets dragged down to hell , assuming that hell exists . It 's too bad that this film did n't get my attention as much as that one , at least in other ways . After thinking about it for one night , I 'm changing my score from a 3 to a 2 , and that 's mostly because I turned it off with about 10 minutes to go . It 's just almost unwatchable .	-1
Nothing really happens , no new information . Thought this could maybe be a little interesting but turned out to be essentially pointless . Though it was humorous how they kept cutting to the guy playing his guitar , I laughed quite hard whenever they did that . Boy is this guy a weirdo though . I would definitely not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I have always been intrigued by the Amityville killings and the hauntings ( i.e . `` Horror '' ) . I have found the film itself to be one of the better made horror films in its genre due to its supposed true story . I even red the Jay Ansen book and found that just as scary . Even if in the back of my mind , my beliefs through the years have turned a little cynical with the validity of this tale , my child-brain still believes in a fascinated way . So I continue to explore some new information.This new entry into the world of the Amityville Drama is about Daniel Lutz , step-son of George and son Kathy Lutz . Throughout the film , Daniel emphasizes his hate towards George . He is filled with anger at almost every step and seems to never let go of this , despite his therapeutic efforts to either resolve the issue or at least get to the truth of it.This documentary does neither to explore the truth or his own personal anger , but rather carries the torch that George and Kathy had started out in 1979 about the hauntings of the house . His descriptions of the happenings in the house are virtually a verbatim of either the book or the movie . If anyone knows anything about Hollywood `` true stories '' they almost never follow the reality in favor of embellishment for the entertainment value , as well never follow the narrative of a book as some things are unfit for movie adaptations for purposes of translating . So what we are left with is an angry guy who decides to take his own cut of the Amityville Horror in the wake of his parents death.The documentary filmmaker , Lauren Dido ( ? ) , does not seem to uncover anything . Nor does she ask the right questions . But just incites Daniel half of the time . It is almost as if this is just another scam , in the same way George , Kathy and Jay put together the book and later the movie . This telling , however , is much less successful . I think for those who just need to find out what is in this documentary will want to watch it despite any review will have to decide for themselves about what is in this . Even though I fall into that category , I personally found it dull , boring and insulting .	-1
One of those things you watch on Netflix when there 's nothing else to wawth - I agree with the other reviewers that this should be seen as a character study of a disturbed individual . I do n't believe he is lying - I believe that HE believes what he is saying - like one of the speakers ( a psychologist ? ) states - chidrens ' memories are filled in by what they see and here until they become reality to them . It is interesting that although Danny claims to have been in therapy - he still harbors such deep hatred toward George , as an adult he has n't been able to move beyond it . As an agnostic , ( who believes in the paranormal ) , they lost my interest when Lorraine Warren whipped out her 'pieces of the cross Jesus died on ' - yawn.But all and all , enjoyable enough to finish . And laugh of the day - the reviewer that gave this one star because she bought this thinking it was THE Amityille Horror movie - people never cease to amaze me .	-1
Daniel Lutz is probably the most annoying person I have ever seen in a documentary . He comes off as obnoxious and immature . To make matters worse it seemed like a vanity piece for him and because of that the rest of the movie felt and probably was a sham . It was just a way for him to make a quick buck and get some attention . The shots of him playing guitar were totally unnecessary and I really could not find one likeable thing about this man . I have never seen a documentary where the main subject has not one redeeming quality . Well , this was a first for me because by the end I still couldn & # 8217 ; t see anything about Mr. Lutz that made me want to root for him . In fact it was quite the opposite . I hope this was his 15 minutes and we never have to hear or see from him again.It was very hard to sit through and I didn & # 8217 ; t believe one word he said . He actually reminded me of a prison inmate that would say anything to get parole .	-1
This is not a horror movie but documentary . For some reason if I remember it correctly , this was previously categorized as a horror movie . But right now Amazon changed it . Not clear though since I watched this on my Roku.Pretty much an interview with one of the involved individual in the incident .	-1
Firstly , a big fan of the doctor , been with him since , well the beginning.Russel Davies , and `` his '' relaunch , loved that stuff ( if you get the chance , read his book ( s ) on the matter , very interesting behind the scenes anecdotes ) ... I liked Eccleston ( sp ? ) , and it sounded like there was a lot of behind the scenes politics behind his leaving . To this day , he 's still not spoken openly on what drove him or forced him to leave . ( Yes , Virginia , I 'm getting to it , give me a bit more time ) .Tennant and Davies leaving at the same time ... . Well , that smacks of more unpublished background anecdotes that I would love to hear about some time.Moffat 's first run , okay , the man overused paradoxen ... paradoxies ? anyway , those seasons in conjunction with Davies and immediately after jumped several sharks , but were still very good.Then there was an announcement that `` we 're going to go simpler now , no extended episodes , plots , etc . '' lived through a lot of that.Then we get to the whole River Sung wedding and beyond ... . Extremely unlikely , contrived , but enjoyable 4.5 rating . ( Let 's call it Season 7 ) For the most part , it was to my mind an overly maudlin , drawn out farewell to Rorey and Amy.I loved those characters , really really enjoyed them , but a whole half a season with cruise control on to bid them a farewell ? And the way that they were eliminated ? ! ? Really , I could drive a Mac truck through the logic holes in that whole thing.Doctor ca n't bring them back ? So , what , he could still in his world go visit if nothing else.And River ? Doctor married , then *poof* gone.Budgetwise I can understand it , plotwise , not so much . ( that part , I 'd give a 3.5 on the Lou scale ) Brings us to this second part ; Clara , decent actress , but the lines they feed this poor girl and the vapid plotting ... .Had been trying to get my son on the Doctor Who wagon , just ... about ... had ... him ... snagged ... . until these episodes ... ..He rolled off the couch and made it out the door ( need to check on that , it 's been awhile ) I thought well , it 's Moffat , so maybe he 's trying to lull the audience into a false sense of knowing what is going on by re-using old plot devices , but to new purpose.Mysterious girl companion that is `` impossible '' Doctor having some idea of an overarching mystery in place that no one knows about . ( ad naseum ) Even if that is the case , the episode by episode suspense build up just is n't there . At this point , I could really care less.I think the thing of it was , Davies was a control freak , and as such if the plot jumped the rails , he took the time to rewrite it to meet the `` flavor and depth '' of what he thought the Doctor should be.Moffat , not so much.Still enjoy the Moffat penned episodes and hoping the Neil Gaiman one is going to be good , but quality control just is n't there ( in my opinion ) .I think the recent reviews are looking at the series through rose ( no pun ) colored glasses and remembering better days.But just wondering ( yes , I am a fan of conspiracy theories ) , if there 's more to the story of what is going wrong with this series ... Dunno , but when looking for that sort of thing outweighs actually watching the show ... ..Well , still subscribed to it at this point , but honestly thinking I 'm wasting my time .	-1
I am looking forward to the opening season this weekend ! Matt Smith as the 11th regeneration of Doctor Who is not my favorite , simply because I can not figure him out . Is he a lover , is he just a dork , is he a fighter , is he brilliant or just lucky ? Totally confused and his bumbling is a little unnerving , but for some reason - it still works .	-1
It really feels like Moffat is squeezing everything and the kitchen sink into this part of the season . I 'm interested in Clara but do n't really care about the mystery surrounding her . It feels like the showrunner has lost his passion for the series and it makes me wonder if the 50th anniversary is going to be what long time fans hope . Classic Who needs more than a mention and a shove under the rug like it 's getting on the show this year .	-1
I 've only enjoyed one episode so half for the second half of season 7 . I still find Clara very charming and quite interesting , but sometimes she can be very much window dressing . Kind of just there to look at and admire how charming and pretty she is . I do n't feel she 's been given enough to do compared to Amy Pond . This is only the beginning of her journey and I look forward to following that journey . I would recommend that people give this half season a try because we all have different taste . I will continue to watch until the season finale , but after that I do n't know if I can continue purchasing such low quality episodes .	-1
I will start by saying I am a big Doctor Who fan , and do n't buy many TV episodes of other series , but I always buy these . And when Russell Davies stopped being part of the creative team some time ago , there was a noticeable decline in the charm/whimsy of the episodes but I still enjoyed most of the Rory/Amy storyline . But the Rings of Akhaten was n't just boring ( which it was ) , the director really turned Matt 's characterization of Dr. Who into an angst-ridden simpleton for this episode . Clara 's character is still interesting and dynamic , but Dr. Who has been left two-dimensional and out of character in many ways . The story was simple , predictable and there was no real sympathy for any character other than probably some for Clara -- but even then , it is only her stage presence that holds any real emotion.I did n't care much for the previous Bells episode either , but I gave it latitude in developing a new story-arc without two well-loved characters ( Rory and Amy that is ) . The same way I let go of Rose Tyler and Donna Noble and all of the Doctor 's previous companions , I figured it will take a couple of episodes to integrate Clara ( though she was fabulous in her earlier appearances before this current second part of Season 7 ) . But that does not account for the poor writing/directing and over-acting ( I blame this on the director and not Matt ) that this episode is full of . Huge disappointment . I only hope that they find their legs in a couple more episodes or I might decide I 'm no longer a fan and stop buying them . Honestly , I wish they 'd get Russell back because his storylines with Moffett were the best ( except of course the Doctor 's Wife by Gaimon which was one of the best EVER ! ) , but I 'd settle for the better episodes of last season than whatever drivel this episode was.If this is your fist view of a Dr. Who episode , DO N'T DO IT ! Go back to Rose Tyler to discover this wonderful series and hopefully this episode ( and the previous one ) is just a fluke of bad craftsmanship . I 've never before given a Doctor Who episode less than four stars and all of the Rose Tyler and Martha Jones seasons ( and most of the ones after it ) five stars !	-1
I wanted to like this show so much , but the recipes are so far off the mark of what I imagined would come from a Pioneer Woman 's kitchen ( vegetables , meat , unprocessed cooking tips ) I simply could not . Even though the host was sweet and charming , her food was absolutely full of sugar and chemicals . There was a point during one episode when they were camping out when she was making banana boats ( ? ) for her kids that I was stunned . I get that everyone needs a treat now and again , but her show is loaded with high calorie , high sugar , sweets . This show should be named The Sugar Woman .	-1
This show has always had a nice premise.But , the constant attempts to be witty , funny and dramatic regularly ( constantly ? ) get in the way of good television and keep the show from being really interesting .	-1
The shows is good for riches who are affordable to pay too much for rent or own ... I think it is a waste money to pay too much for rent .. or purchase ... It is not worth to watch anyway as it ; s my opinion .	-1
Great CGI and a compelling idea , and a great disappointment . They could have developed so many themes from this premise . but they chose to make it a tale of emotional relationships . All of the cliches are there : the rebellious teenage daughter , the young lovers , the Hispanic man defending his family , the clever witch , the cardboard males and the powerful women who , between running all the world knock out grown men three times their weight . This soap opera cum CGI seems suitable for teenagers and women , if they are into examining their emotions ; adults interested in exploring larger questions need to be warned : this is dumber than Castle . For myself , I 'm on to other and better shows , say Crossbones .	-1
Had this show aired in the 60 's or 70 's it may have been a hit . But , today 's standards ( unless yo have been in cryostasis for a long long time ) is a flop .	-1
This series had promise , but the story is very weak . Feels like & # 34 ; Terra Nova & # 34 ; all over again . Okay , it is a little better than & # 34 ; Terra Nova & # 34 ; , but not much .	-1
I like a different kind of sci-fi as opposed to this . Defiance seems more to me like a western set with aliens in the nearly wild frontier of a terraformed Earth . Seven alien races all at once ? That is a bit over the top . I like sci-fi programs that have a bit more imagination to them and that are adventures.I know plenty of people like this new series in that it is linked in with an interactive game , but for me , this one just does not fly . Finally , the same old theme with love triangles just bore me to death .	-1
Perhaps it 's because I 'm a Fire Fly and Star Trek junkie , but this series was not impressive to me at all . I got tired of the constant close ups of the girl 's ludicrous eyes . Whatever plotline the series was supposed to have never advanced an inch . I felt like I was swimming in mud with each episode I watched .	-1
It 's been a while since I gave this a try , but ... just no . SyFy keeps trying to turn out the next big sci-fi hit but keeps missing the mark .	-1
This show has a well worn plot . The ousted good guy who is on his own and ends up trying to save the town , the county , the world because his good side wins out over the old selfish nature . The twist for this show ? Instead of your normal ethnic races of earth they threw in some aliens for the big diversity card . Ho Hum .	-1
The CGI is good , artistic , believable . But the costuming and make-up are a throw-back to 60s Star Trek . And the storylines ! We 've been there before ... kind of a mix between Mad Max and the worst storied part of Walking Dead ( you know , when the heroes were battling the tyrant of a walled city . Glad that sequence is behind us ) . But Walking Dead is a great show . This one falls flat . I watched fifteen minutes of the first episode and already knew what was going to happen next -- so I shut it off . Are there no good writers with original scripts out there ?	-1
Ca n't really say why this show did not appeal to us as we enjoy shows with an unusual twist . This show centers aroun survivors on Earth after an apocolypse . This show has a twist , in that there are aliens in the mix . Just could n't get into the plot of the show .	-1
I have given this show three chances to be something more than mundane , regurgitated science fiction tropes ; unfortunately it still has yet to break-free and form its own identity . The story is dull , the acting is sub-par , and the cgi is atrocious ( even the biggest fans of the show have to admit this ) . There are several other options in the Amazon instant video store that far surpass this one . I can not recommend this show .	-1
ANOTHER after the world has gone to hell show.good acting tho and could be better but it 's beendone a hundred times and I just got tired of themakeup and the script wore on me..which is a shameas the lead guy is a decent actor..but it just misses themark and is nothing to write home about..but that 's just me .	-1
This show looked promising so I gave it a shot . It greatly disappointed me . With each episode watched I grew less and less interested ; so much so that by the time the season finale came I did n't even care to watch it , not even to avoid having wasted my time watching the episodes that came before it . The show is quite simply a bust and not worth watching .	-1
The premise sounded good , and the story line for the premiere was also very good , but I find the needless nudity that was in the premier and then again in the second episode made me decide I did n't want to watch this series after all . It and coarse language are always a sign of a weak script . When the writing is good , these elements are unneeded . I was very disappointed .	-1
Story line sounded good but fifteen minutes into the first episode the show & # 34 ; lost the plot & # 34 ; and became just another soap opera with sex taking up way too much time .	-1
I started watching for Mia Kirshner who does a lot with her medium to small part as a brothel/saloon keep . The albino aliens are shockingly degenerate - the rest of the alien races are just wearers of recycled stock costumes from the wardrobe department.ETA : rewatching this episode AFTER I learned of [ [ ASIN : B0007K2SRG Piepel ] ] which is probably the reason for Joss Whedon'sDollhouse : The Complete Seasons 1 & 2as well as learning of the companion book , I realize WHY Mia Kirshner is playing a willing prostitute ( named Kenya Rosewater to hint at her heritage ) and why in this episode , she says to a dirty blonde customer that ( 1 ) he does n't have to pay because he is `` fun '' , ( 2 ) the wife of the zombie-looking Castithian `` customer '' is hugged and THANKED for sharing her wonderful husband with the girls of NeedWant and that ( 3 ) Kenya Rosewater calls her fellow prostitutes `` Night Porters . `` The racist , elitist Castithians claim to be seeking refuge on Earth from their inhabitable situation at home and to be against the Volge but really they are a menace intent on taking over and ruling over others . Defiance is about the balancing and unspoken brinksmanship that goes on against these would-be comrades.This is from House of Dolls which is available to read on the web - Fella reminds me of Kenya Rosewater : '' Fella never forgets for a moment that agreat miracle has befallen her here . The Camp Commander ispleased with her . Fella knows how to win the heart of the GermanBeast And when Yaga has had a few drinks , she pours her heartout to Fella as to a close friend . Fella has already heard fromYaga the most intimate stories of her life : about her beau , thecommander of nearby Camp Niederwalden , who is two-timingher ; about her youth , which she spent in a whorehouse in Dres-den . In her drunkenness she often sympathizes with Fella forhaving been born a Jewess . If not , she would n't be a prisoner buttake it from Yaga commander of a German concentrationcamp . She 'd have seen to that Fella is her only true-blue friendin the whole wide world. ``	-1
The special effects are really poor , even for SciFi . This series is tied into a computer game , something that is going to be the next con job ( like action figures became , where the made a series just to sell toys ) . Maybe the graphics are so bad because they wanted to match the 8 year old consoles graphics ? I watched the pilot in 3 sittings because I got bored and started doing something else.They should have kept Alphas , or some other good series , instead of making this .	-1
This show lacks originality , the movement of the storyline is weak , the characters are not engaging , and the special effects would be ok for cutscenes in a 90s videogame . It feels like a typical tv series that does n't stand out in anyway . I apologize for suggesting that a 7 year old could n't write a better show , I know plenty that could .	-1
I know its a show but the graphics are sub par and the story line is boring . For some reason , I do n't like the main male character in this show . Sadly , I only watched one episode so I may be judging too early . The game on the other hand is great ! First true MMORPG for a first person shooter . I give it props !	-1
It was drivel so I quit watching . Really if there was a point to it all I would have hung on . It was a & # 34 ; wan na be & # 34 ; cross between the show Revolution and Falling Skies . But not nearly as good .	-1
I just dished out a $ 1.99 for this GARBAGE.This show is full of bad acting , bad make up and a bad story line.Unfortunately this seems to have become the norm among TV.I have never been so bored in my life , even on fast forward this thing goes nowhere.I bought it because it got 4 stars - just who is rating this crap ? People over 12 should have a bit more sense.And please - Where is the Science in Sci-Fi ? It was a waste of major time and little money , but I sure am NOT watching any more of this crap.SyFy had a lot of decent shows in the past that got cancelled , I can just hope this one does n't make it past the few episodes they have .	-1
I wanted to like this show , I just lost interest after three episodes , it just does not hold your attention , not mine anyway , I find the story to have been told before , not original , the effects are good , the actors are good , it 's just the story .	-1
terrible - how do people even get money to film this PC garbage ? why must i drone on about how bad this is just make the minimum word requirement ?	-1
Okay ... sometime within a span of 33 years . around the present time , planet Earth gets colonized by not just one , but seven ( yes,7 ! ! ) different species of aliens in addition to the human population . Then the Earth presumably experiences all kinds of catastrophic wars and gets completely `` re-terra-formed '' , not just biologically but geologically too . Major cities are also suddenly transformed into vast expanses of what resemble `` Wild West '' towns - except for the Saint Louis arch , which seems to have survived intact , albeit in some disarray . ( Although the Mississippi River bed seems to have been long dried out and lined with tall , rocky cliffs . ) And to top it off , everyone of every species dresses in clothing appropriate to the 1700's-1800 's while carrying laser and pulse weapons more powerful than anything seen before , even in the most outlandish sci-fi . And of course , all clothing ensembles are complete with the usual holsters and bandoliers of bullets across everyone 's chest . And everyone seems to drive off-road vehicles that look like something Detroit decided not to produce back in the 1950's.Finally , the graphics tend to like video games rather than high quality CG and green room work . I ca n't decide if this production is supposed to be animation , soap opera , or cinema.I like science fiction as much as the next guy , but this one is way too much and I do n't even want to try to follow wherever it is going . Bad writing , bad acting , and bad cinemetography .	-1
I rented this movie exam a fan of the leading man . I 've always enjoyed his work . In this movie I did n't get involved and I do n't think he got involved either . The movie was shot for lighting very little character development I did not seem to care about the story the characters or the cast . I hope others find it more entertaining than I did !	-1
After a time of see this serie i wonder what happens with the subtitles . Is no a bad serie of the universe but the millions of people who are deafmute will no apreciate .	-1
I just watched the my first episode of Kitchen Impossible and Robert actually made the place worse . If I was the owner , I would have sued him for putting the final nail in this dated restaurant 's coffin . The decor looked cheap and very unprofessional . There is no way you can do what he attempts to do in 48 hours and in this case he proved that right . Having said that the owner of the restaurant gets what he deserves if he trusted this guy in the first place.At least when Gordon Ramsey takes on a restaurant he gives them a professional remodel not a cheap job that will probably fall apart in less than a month . It 's just totally reckless the way they slapped this place together . My bet is that most of it is destroyed by now.He was right about one thing . The chairs looked disgusting . I would not hire these two so called decorators to do the men 's room in the subway .	-1
I have special interest in real state and this show provide me a good points to get to know the value of properties in North America , and also ideas to improve my own property .	-1
Improve the show by-only picking peeps who will actually BUY a house-show home after buyers have improved it	-1
This show seems more realistic than most DIY shows . However , it is pretty boring because the producers show the same scenes over and over because of the way the commercial breaks were cut out . It also seemed pretty over dramatized . I would n't recommend watching this one unless you 're looking for something to help you fall asleep .	-1
I would not recommend this show . It 's all about her and her problems . I got weary of hearing about her problems while the renovation was being done . I wanted to hear discussion of the project .	-1
This is the kind of movie that gives criticism a bad name . I appreciate its existence , but in no way could I recommend it . Of course we all see and derive different opinions from various forms of art , it 's all subjective . But some forms of opinion that are displayed in this film are not only idiotic , but somewhat offensive ( the holocaust ... really ? ) . There are things to read in the Shining for sure , but for the most part its just an effective ghost story with haunting visuals . Look if you believe 9/11 was a cover up for us to go into Iraq or that Neil Armstrong never landed on the moon but on a constructed Hollywood set then you 're the type of audience for this film . Me I live on planet Earth .	-1
This presentation is in documentary form with odd people that spend time speculating on supposedly purposely hidden messages permeating Kubrick 's film `` The Shining '' ( 1980 ) with some compare and contrast to the Stephen King novel.There is a montage of clips from : '' Foust '' , Friedrich-Wilhelm-Marnau , 1926Demons 2 ( 1986 ) Demons ( 1985 ) Video from the U.S .

Did Stanley Kubrick incorporate nasties into rug patterns ? Are you going to waste one hour and 43 minutes and four seconds on this claptrap ?	-1
Just an awful , AWFUL boring disappointment of a movie . I was expecting a film expert ( s ) insights on what the movie meant , on-screen interviews and a real dissection of what the movie meant and the hidden meanings of things and what went in to it by people who really know what they are talking about . Instead I got scenes from other Kubrick films , played against random voiceovers of people who sound like they were nerds sitting in their barcaloungers in their parents ' basement talking about how much the movie meant to them . A huge , HUGE letdown pile of nonsense . Real disappointment .	-1
As the camera slowly moves in on Danny brushing his teeth , there , on the left side of the wall is a sticker of Dopey from Disney 's Snow White and the Seven Dwarves . Later , after Danny is revealed by Toby some of the incidents that will occur at the Overlook Hotel , it would appear that the sticker is no longer there . The `` theorist '' , by way of narration , explains that Danny is `` no longer a dope '' . Yup , this theory and more abound in ROOM 237 , a supposedly insightful , highly subjective , examination of Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining.I was not really sure what to expect . Will I hear about symbolism ? Hidden gestures by Kubrick to reveal the larger truth of the film ? An explanation of the film itself and what some of the more mysterious moments meant ? You will not be treated to any of these things that one might assume at face value . In fact , nothing that is `` revealed '' has anything to do with the movie . Apparently all of the theories relate to some outside dilemma that Kubrick ( presumably ) was grappling with and felt the need to embed these ideas in this film . Why that is the case no one answered.If anyone has seen the documentary Kubrick 's Odyssey , they will well learn that Kubrick faked the moon landing for Nasa using the same effects as in 2001 , and that , for keeping this a secret , he revealed clues laid out throughout the movie in this film . In ROOM 237 , the same author retells much of that theory in this film so it might be redundant.Other theories regard its a film about the Holocaust , the genocide of the American Indians , or the mythological Minotaur . Or you just need to watch the film forward and backward simultaneously . All of these theories might be interesting on their own with no regard to content or context . Together they are just a mash of ideas with no thread in place . One even wonders if The Shining is a basis for their conclusions or if its just their own fanatical ideas being projected onto a very psychological playing field.It becomes clear that these 5 people who admire Stanley Kubrick 's The Shining , know how to inspect the film and its intricate details , but do not seem to know how to watch a film . Or at least interpret properly the language of cinema . What they explain gives the view no insights into the film itself , nor of Stanley Kubrick . Beginning with the obvious , that Jack Nicholson 's character slowly goes mad from isolation might be a good place to start to draw the viewer in their thinking . Instead we are slapped with obscure objects in the background that is faintly paid attention to by most casual viewers.Because of this , I cant help but feel that all these interpretations are complete non-sense and have no place in a serious discussion of the film . The film is almost a joke and I wonder if the director is exploiting these people who seriously believe in their theories ? It would be sad that Kubrick 's film was used to make such a joke by the director . If he believes anything these theorists propose , then the director needs to revisit a book on symbology . I ca n't recommend this film , but I suspect ardent Kubrick fans will want to see it and understandably so . If that is the case , then it is not a terrible viewing . Have a beer , friends and some good laughs .	-1
... is how someone actually put up money for this cavalcade of half-baked theories ? Clearly someone had too much time on their hands . Why not help to fight hunger or illiteracy ? I stayed with this until the deconstruction of the & # 34 ; secret hard-on & # 34 ; scene . Maybe the producers have enough time on their hands to make it , but I certainly do n't have the time to sit through it . Life is too short . Really dumb .	-1
Someone said in the long time ago that people see what they expect to see . If & # 8220 ; Room 237 & # 8221 ; proves something , it is exactly this famous saying . The film is a documentary about five avid fans of Stanley Kubrick & # 8217 ; s classic & # 8220 ; The Shining , & # 8221 ; who present through voiceover their theories about the hidden meanings by analyzing the details.The idea is great . Execution is not . Each commentator & # 8217 ; s analysis is introduced in a random way , and there is no sense of structure and narrative development in the whole film . The documentary goes on and on jumping from one theory to another without exploring any of these contents.I believe Stanley Kubrick paid attention to every single detail , down to the number of the room , even though I do think some part of these details is accidental . Still , I admire the passion and enthusiasm of these five fans , and some of their analysis are really interesting ( about a wrecked red Volkswagen beetle , for instance ) , but most of them are just far-fetched and uninteresting . Fakes moon landing ? Oh , please.There is one good thing about the documentary , and that is it has a lot of footage from the original film . After all the merit of watching & # 8220 ; Room 237 & # 8221 ; is that it reminds us of how great & # 8220 ; The Shining & # 8221 ; is .	-1
Although James Mcavoy is an awesome actor I found this movie pretty boring . the story dragged the plot kind of stunk . the movie did not get exciting until the last ten minutes of the movie then it just stopped with James 's character putting his hands behind his head . I wo n't go into anymore detail so I wo n't ruin the movie for who wants to watch it . but all I can say is that I found it dull . if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do n't	-1

Here & # 8217 ; s the thing about comedy : if you beg , borrow , or steal it , it usually isn & # 8217 ; t as funny the second time around . No matter how hard you try . No matter how everyone involved tries . It just won & # 8217 ; t work the same way . Ever have to explain a joke ? Ever notice how & # 8211 ; in the process & # 8211 ; everything remotely humorous about it gets sucked away with each passing word ? Same thing . When you pilfer from the best , you & # 8217 ; re at least playing solid odds that whatever audience shows up will give you only gracious laughs but not necessarily ones all that legitimately earned.Humor works best when it comes from an original inspiration . When all you do is take bits and pieces from what others have done before you ( especially when it comes to comedy ) , then you should be fully prepared to be called a & # 8216 ; hack. & # 8217 ; You deserve it , after all , and so does everyone who shows up to help you out . ( NOTE : The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters . If you & # 8217 ; re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free , then I & # 8217 ; d encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment . If , however , you & # 8217 ; re accepting of a few modest hints at & # 8216 ; things to come , & # 8217 ; then read on & # 8230 ; ) From the product packaging : & # 8220 ; A Russian space station crashes in Amsterdam , releasing a deadly virus that turns everyday citizens into flesh-craving psychopaths . Aziz ( Yahya Gaier ) , his brother Mo ( Ouled Radi ) and several strangers emerge from jail , oblivious to the mayhem until they team up with a local police officer ( Gigi Ravelli ) . After receiving a desperate call for help , this unlikely band of heroes sets out on an insane rescue mission & # 8211 ; and it & # 8217 ; s going to take a seriously crazy plan if they want to get out alive & # 8230 ; & # 8221 ; I & # 8217 ; m a stickler for comedy , and , if you learned anything from what I wrote above , you know that I think it works best when it & # 8217 ; s fresh , original , and timely . That & # 8217 ; s a mighty big success to achieve , and directors Martijn Smits and Erwin van den Eshof give it an affable try in a script that barely hints at anything original in it . Sadly , we & # 8217 ; ve seen these characters before ( in much better films ) ; and we & # 8217 ; ve seen this set-up and situation all too often ( again , in far superior outings ) . If this represents the best they have in their arsenal of entertainment , then the Dutch might wan na leave zombie comedies to the rest of the world.Naturally , there are a few tweaks here that work quite well , so KILL isn & # 8217 ; t a complete failure . Amsterdam has never looked better ! A Cold War era Russky soldier gets some of the best one-liners in his five minutes of film ! Aziz & # 8217 ; s & # 8216 ; Holy Grail & # 8217 ; turns out to be the official & # 8216 ; Office Skank. & # 8217 ; At times , KILL musters a recognizable charm ( that we & # 8217 ; ve seen stronger elsewhere ) . The problem is that it never mixes up its ingredients enough to force this mixture to congeal into the confection everyone involved probably thought it was going to be.For example , leading man Yahya Gaier seems all wrong here , so much so that he looks like he isn & # 8217 ; t having all that much fun . Likewise , his big screen brother ( Radi ) grins and goofs through his dialogue , though he never quite seems to tap into proper comic timing to make the best of the dire circumstances . Dare I say , the only one who seems at home here is the fetching Ravelli & # 8211 ; she dominates every scene she & # 8217 ; s in the way a leading lady should & # 8211 ; an actress who clearly understands what the script and directors wanted out of her and delivers in a big way.Too bad they couldn & # 8217 ; t have used a few bucks from whatever budget they had to hire a decent continuity person , as the forever-changing blood stain patterns on Gigi & # 8217 ; s clean white blouse gets downright irritating in the second half.Or was that a joke , too ? KILL ZOMBIE ! ( 2012 ) is produced by Launch Works and Talent United Film & TV . DVD distribution ( stateside ) is being handled by the stellar Well Go USA Entertainment . For those folks needing it spelled out perfectly , this is a Dutch spoken language release with English subtitles available . As for the technical specifications , this is a very well-made release , and it dishes out some high quality sights and sounds ( though a few effects sequences are pretty bad ) . Lastly , if it & # 8217 ; s special features you want , then you & # 8217 ; ll be sorely disappointed : there & # 8217 ; s only a theatrical trailer to make your day . ( MILDLY ) RECOMMENDED . As charming as KILL ZOMBIE ! is , it & # 8217 ; s also quite obnoxious . Unfortunately , the script by Tijs van Marle borrows only the best ideas of vastly superior films but never quite puts them to good use . As a result , the story never metastasizes into anything so noble as those films it derives its narrative and situations from , practically sucking the life out of screwball moments that go on for too long . Still , fanboys are likely to swoon over the unintentionally luscious Gigi Ravelli , the single-best Dutch treat ever to put on the police uniform . Be warned : she & # 8217 ; ll have you wishing for the Apocalypse in no time at all.In the interests of fairness , I & # 8217 ; m pleased to disclose that the fine folks at Well Go USA Entertainment provided me with an advance DVD copy of KILL ZOMBIE ! by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review ; and their contribution to me in no way , shape , or form influenced my opinion of it .	-1
I hoped this would be interesting but it was simply too low-budget for the idea of pre-WWII spies in Warsaw .	-1
I really wanted to like this , but the story development seemed dis-jointed and dull . The lead actor would have been excellent as a British spy , but he was playing a Frenchman and did not seem French . This made the whole thing unrealistic .	-1
David Tennant seems to be sleepwalking through the role , and while it 's one thing to be gallant and devil may care it 's another to be completely devoid of any emotion and convey absolutely no sense that one 's life may be in danger . Alan Furst , the author , writes meticulously researched and detailed novels , focusing on Europe during WWII , and has a wide fan base . Personally I find his books overly detailed , his writing wooden and the immense array of poorly developed characters that come and go non-compelling . Overall I found this production lifeless , but if you like the books , give this series a go -- perhaps you will enjoy it .	-1
I like psychological thrillers and from time to time it intrigues me , but it gets very macabre and over the top gross .	-1
I was intrigued by the dramatization of the series at the movie theatre but this TV episode is just awful . I have had enough . Nothing further need be said !	-1
What type of sick mind can think up this type of serial killer garbage ... probably the type who should be locked up	-1
Hannibal is bad , unless you like to see body pars being prepared for food and classical music playing in the background . Very boring , should be canceled very soon . Networks would do better with Zombie projects like the Walking Dead , Please no more CSI network programs .	-1
I suffered through 3 episodes of this show with an acid-filled stomach , and then it became too much for me to bear . I do watch other crime-solving shows , but there was something just insidiously ... .evil about this one . I understand on an intellectual level that the premise of the show is clever , but it was n't enough to overcome the disturbing feeling that stayed with me for hours after I watched an episode . I can not POSSIBLY be the only ex-viewer who felt that way . Films and TV shows are getting more and more disgusting and extreme , to the point where I wonder if Hollywood will make actual `` snuff '' films sometime in the not-too-distant future , in order to maintain the sick thrill for the viewer . This is one show that will have to go on without me .	-1
Okay , this is very well written and acted but the character of Hannibal is so evil and depraved that I never want to watch another episode .	-1
Hey america this is the dumbing down you demand . This show is complete trash . Just glorifies murder and cannibalism . Its not clever or unique and it is repulsive you will love it .	-1
This film offers some valuable lessons about autism but it 's execution is uneven . The character he worked with ( the owner 's son ) was simply not believable . Luke 's character was much more engaging and believable . The early parts of the film are slow to develop . In my view , the story probably could have been told in less time but it 's worth seeing .	-1
I have watched and loved DC from the beginning but just as some of the fisherman I have grown pretty tired of it and am retiring from watching it Since the Cornelia Marie is gone things seemed to have gone downhill from there with the story lines . I have watched faithfully until the last 2 years though . Sad about it !	-1
Breaks the first rule of good story telling , namely telling . Explains everything , showing noting . Cutesy is n't necessary for kids . Cutesy is what adults create for kids because adults think kids are cute . Kids do n't think of themselves as cutesy . They appreciate silly humor and things they can identify with . Stop explaining everything , just show it . Kids will get it .	-1
I found this to be a bit slow and nothing special , but if you are looking for something that 's none offensive for a family to watch together , this my suite you .	-1
Please do not equate science to bombs ... this is very bad timing , I must say having a relative severely injured by a bomb in Boston .	-1
Silly attempt at some veiled social statement . Diversity 101 on Steroids ? Exceptionally cheesy and without merit . A junkyard kitchen ? Girls do Science poster movie ? It is great to give kids a break from reality , but when it becomes so deluded by the politically correctness and social massage that it is delusional , then kids lose . A pidgeon with a rocketpack ? Okay -- what did Nancy say ? JUST SAY NO !	-1
First , I liked the premise of a little black girl and boy brother sister team solving problems . I view shows before my children . It seems the show was written by someone who does not know children . I was offended that you would have the gall to have two black children solving a math problem and have it end on a watermelon floor . You cant have a show without a male that is doing something positive . Really ? ? ? ! ! ! a young black male child named sam on a watermelon floor . Just say sambo and get it over . sam could not speak up for him self , he lost his rabbit , he never acomplished pushing a button and his sister solved the problem . you also have the white male bully . Nice premise . racist delivery.Pilot [ HD ]	-1
The dog puppet is not as cute as the other Jim Henson 's puppets and the story was not original or captivating . My 4 yr old loves the Pajanimals but lost interest less than 5 minutes into the pilot episode . The graphic of the hand drawings is not great either and that could be another reason why she lost interest so quickly . Would be better had at least half of the pilot is done with the puppet/animation ( this comment also applies to all the children animation pilots ) . Need some work on several aspects for this show to work for us .	-1
Because I do n't let my kids watch too much TV ( or me for that matter ) , I make sure the kid shows are either something that I 'd like to watch with them ( `` Phineas and Ferb '' ) or something that is of educational value ( `` Super Why '' ) . `` Positively Ozitively '' does not meet that criteria . If this show were to be watched in my household it either has to have smart humor for both adults and children , OR it has to teach something other than a `` life lesson '' - it needs to teach reading , math , science , or science.I was looking forward to this show when I first heard about it , but I am afraid I 'm going to have to pass .	-1
Standing on the shoulders of the Wizard of Oz is not enough to make this show interesting . There 's plenty of better/new ideas that warrant an entire show , like Tumbleaf .	-1
This pilot revolves around Dorothy going to Oz in order to snag a birthday present for her Mom , but the inherent problem was how her mother knew about Oz immediately without question or concern . Along with how each of the character were already familiar with Dorothy . Setting the story in Kansas with tornadoes with Dorothy `` landing '' in Oz mysteriously would 've been better . Putting more of the Oz mythos would 've helped a great deal here . As does adding mystery , conflict , or a moral lesson . Also , the switch from traditional hand drawn animation to stop motion/claymation , and finally to preliminary sketches was more than a tad jarring.That being said ... I do think subverting the ruby slippers in favor of the golden magical hat was a nice change.Hope to see some improvement as this moves forward .	-1
Interesting concept - based on Wizard of Oz characters but do n't see anything interesting beyond that . Also should have at least 1/2 of the pilot done in animation ( gorgeous , by the way ) . It is really difficult to use imagination to continue watching the show when the story was just ok and with parts in black and white sketches ... .	-1
I will only let my daughter watch shows that I can stand to sit through . Creative Galaxy is not one of them . It 's so dumbed down , as are most things for kids . It felt like it was geared towards the mentally retarded . I was looking for a segment that was visually complete , but I do n't think there was one . Everything looked half done and a mishmash of ideas . It was just plain ugly . I 'll just stick to Pocoyo .	-1
The show is to slow for my 4 year old son . The art is choppy and lacks emotions on characters . The educational value is low , which shows that the show is neither fun nor educational . So far the only original Amazon show that I see has potential is the Annebots .	-1
Had to take some convincing to get my five year old to watch this - her brother pressured her into doing so . Something about the alien is a little blah , generic . Once they were watching , they were interested in the art , especially the explanation of pointillism , but they both lost interest in the entire show about halfway through .	-1
I watch a lot of these paranormal shows . Some I really enjoy . Other shows can be interesting or have something to offer . Some , I just ca n't handle . Like Ghost Adventures , it has some great evidence but the dude annoys me so much I ca n't watch . This one , well I actually like these good ol ' boys . But to be honest , in the two episodes I watched , I did n't see anything that impressed me as far as their techniques or evidence . Lights popping on on a rim pod a couple of times brings hoots and hollers and bell ringing from the old dude . A dead bird is counted as evidence when there are cats on the farm ... just seems like a lot of nonsense . I have family in the south and this feels like not much more than their superstitions . Do they collect real evidence ? In the two shows I 've seen it has been a lot of muddin ' and playin ' but not a lot to impress.I like these guys . I wish they would do less playing and more real ghost hunting . Their personalities would come through without ten minutes of 4-wheelin footage .	-1
Not a bad joke or anything , but they make fun of a show you may want to creep you out . Random characters , names , and personalities .	-1
Not as good as some of the other ones like paranormal witness and Stranded . What evidence they do get it seems they hardly show . It 's kind of laughable how they want the spirits to react to them and then freak out when they do . Not as good as the previously mentioned two , but will watch because it 's about the only paranormal show going on right now .	-1
While the animation and voice acting is fairly , there needs to be a small bit more development in the plot and character . It 's great the main character tries to learn and figure out how to do things , but there needs to be more `` meat '' behind it .	-1
This is a show that would be good to watch at the wee hours of the morning after returning from the bar . Course , turning on my Amazon is not the first thought that I have at that time , so I 'd probably never watch this show.The Indiana Jones reference was fun , but after they go to the mall it was just banter . Since that is the main setting for the show , most of it will become just banter quickly .	-1
Even though I do n't usually enjoy animated series , I thought I 'd give this a viewing . The show was silly , the characters a bit too stereotypical , and the animation was n't the best . But I think the main probelm was I am not the right demographic , too old probably . this will probably appeal to a younger audience .	-1
It just is n't a show for me . I could barely finish it . This may be a show that others enjoy .	-1
I did not like this at all . I do n't really like the modern adult cartoon comedies and this is just as bad or worse than the rest .	-1
Oh , good religious icon ! This was hella bad ! I will say that the animation was good , writing was pretty crisp , and voice acting was acceptable . However , just the premise alone was enough to make me want to click `` x '' on my screen . Basing an entire pilot around the crystal skull from `` Indiana Jones 4 '' Is that the best they could do ? Say what you want about the sometimes-amusing racist depiction of just about everyone involved , that was hardly the worst offense here . I really wanted to see amazon.com succeed in their first animated show , but this was something even the worst show on Comedy Central could n't compare to . It reminded me of an old MAD TV sketch with Nicole Sullivan doing her thing , and I did n't care for that show either . I guess you could compare it to The Boondocks with lady characters , but they could have made them at least somewhat appealing . The pop culture references made me think of the now-canceled `` Ugly Americans , '' which worked on about five levels above this . I got the feeling even Adult Swim would n't wash their hands with this pilot . Out of all the amazon.com pilots I have seen , this is the only one I would n't even consider watching if it somehow got a series order . Maybe other people would watch it b/c they know `` so many people just like '' the two leads , but that does not mean I would watch a show about them . Consider this a vote of UN-confidence .	-1
This was just painful to watch . I am reminded of the repetitious stereotypical-based skits that make up the majority of the bile-generating torture that is Saturday Night Live ; however , SNL has the occasional performance that makes all of the suffering worth while . This show has no saving grace .	-1
The two leads are a bit obnoxious . The pilot overall was n't that interesting and I do not believe I would watch this series .	-1
I think I laughed once during the episode , but it was n't a `` laugh out loud '' laugh . This show sounded funny . It really sounded like something I would like ... but I just do n't care . Ca n't quite put my finger on why . I was n't offended by anything . Would 've been more appealing if it was hand drawn . The computer generated animation felt really generic . The voice acting was sub-par too . I would give it another chance , but the next episode would probably follow the same patterns . Too bad .	-1
I could n't even bring myself to begin to start to even consider thinking about maybe watching this show . I seriously have no idea what the other reviewers saw that made them want to watch this but everyone is entitled to their own opinion I suppose . I hope to never see this preview , show , picture of the show or hear the dumpy white character talk like she is from the ghetto every again or I may turn into a serial killer and murder all the cartoon characters in the world . Really Amazon , this is what you think people will watch ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Jump over to Netflix and check out House of Cards .	-1
The premise of this show , in which two seemingly everday females tackle supernatural evil , is an intriguing one . However , it 's obvious the show is written by men , and so I think that will lose much of any female audience it could have otherwise snags - a market that is poorly unaddressed in the world of animation . I 'll give it a couple more episodes , to see if they work out the kinks , but at this point - it might as well be two male heroes yet again .	-1
If you like adult swim you 'll like this , it 's not for me and I did n't find it funny , but I 'm sure many people will .	-1
became quickly bored with the episode and did not even finish watching . disposable characters which did not generate any feeling of attachment	-1
Not good . From the hood accent females to the blatant political incorrectness ( which I wish was funny , but missed the mark ) to the odd storyline ( mall workers moonlighting as international artifact hunters ? ) to the contrite villains , this was not good . Nice try , but try again . REDLIGHT	-1
Did n't really like this one . Granted , there were a few cute moments , but they were overwhelmed by the constant gabbing of the lead protagonists . I just got really annoyed with the ghetto accents . The animation is nothing impressive either . Mostly crude drawings ; something you 'd find more on adult swim I think . There were too many pop culture references and not enough supernatural aspects to the show . Nothing about this really impressed me and probably would n't watch this again .	-1
Not particularly good . Looks like flash animation and not that good . The dialog is bad . It sounds like the two women doing the voice acting just read the script while it was recorded . I think it is supposed to be about two sassy street smart girls , but it comes across as one wannabe and one not so smart . Overall , just bad .	-1
I do n't think I 'm the right audience for this . I laughed a couple times , but maybe there 's something I 'm missing . I dunno . I just do n't feel right about reviewing it . If you like Adult Swim , or Ugly Americans , watch this show . You 'll probably enjoy it . As for it 's odds of getting picked up ? Not a chance in hell .	-1
I really wanted to like this one , but it did n't work for me . The voice talent was great - it 's the writing and jokes that let them down . Too many stereotypes , old cliches , the central premise seemed totally recycled ( one capable character paired with one not capable character ) , fast and furious `` jokes '' that came across as trying to hit the target instead of actually funny and , frankly , everything seemed to have been warped in from the late 90 's . Also , that was the longest 20-odd minutes . In spite of all the fast-talk , the episode dragged .	-1
I ca n't imagine anybody would think this has ANY redeeming qualities . Not smart . Not funny . Not clever . Not entertaining . Not gon na get made !	-1
Price , I 'm a big fan of your reviews on TV.com so it pains me to say this , but I did n't find this funny . The tropes are tired and played out , and frankly it 's lazy writing . The pilot set up a story line for the season , but just barely . I will not be sticking around for future episodes if it gets picked up . This reminded me of Ugly Americans and the same kind of lazy plot lines .	-1
When the white chick sprayed the giant spider and said & # 34 ; Spida , please & # 34 ; , I was done . Cliche , annoying , you name it .	-1
This was not very entertaining . I was done before the show was . Anybody giving this more than 3 stars must be stoned .	-1
Amazon , please stop trying to make TV shows . You are bad at it , and will lose tons of money . This show has ugly actors , ugly production values , and they sing . I skipped the opening song , turned it off after they broke out into another one . Bad Amazon , bad .	-1
Bebe Neuwirth is a wonderful actress , and I applaud Amazon for snatching her up , but this insipid show is terribly written and awkward to watch , and by God the actors playing the interns are either terrible or being given terrible material . Hold on to Bebe , but fire this show .	-1
The songs are horrible . The premise is that we are cool if we figure out that it is a parody of HuffPo . The writing does not make me happy . I love Bebe Neuwirth as an actor , but I just must stop this waste of money . All of the actors seem funny and capable and they sing well . The talented writers need to find something they love and believe in so it will not ring so hollow . Great quality in execution ; the script should have been negated as not being funny .	-1
Terrible show and I do n't know why they added the music . Music is like adding something bad to something worse .	-1
There are so many other better shows that are coming out right now , please do n't waste your funding on this . This represents everything that is wrong with all the terrible shows on TV right now . If we could stop wasting our time on terrible shows like this , and start focusing more time on better shows like Those Who Ca n't or Onion News Empire , then we would have better TV . I vote no thank you for this one .	-1
The songs are forced and not that good . Then to make up for it , the characters are too over the top.I would not watch this show if it was the pilot they chose to produce .	-1
From the moment the first terrible song began ( off key ) , the treacle began . Could n't finish it . If you 're the type of person who would watch this regularly , my God prevent us from ever hanging out ...	-1
This was a waste of time . Not only was the premise tiresome but also the musical bits . None of the characters was interesting . This is not a show I 'd want to see as a series . Awful !	-1
could not finish it , it 's a musical , felt like glee , and I hate glee ( yeah I know it 's popular ) .I find myself not caring about any character in this show at all .	-1
Aside from the stoner asian who is epically funny ( `` Donuts '' LMAO ! ! ) , ( and maybe the Rachel from Glee knock off , who is cute ) , this show and the cast is TERRIBLE . So sorry Bebe , but what were you thinking with that voice ? There 's no way you could sustain that for an entire season ... she must know this is not going anywhere , LOL.Had to really struggle to get through the entire show , was turned off right from the beginning and only stuck in there because the asian girl showed up just as I was about to click it off.Good bye , do not make more episodes . Winnowing week should take them all !	-1
During the opening , after I found the disclaimer 'warning : actors will break out in song ' somewhat amusing , my initial reaction was -- I hope these intro numbers are just that , and will never be shown again . Unfortunately , the characters break into forgettable pop sounding tunes that are a bubble left of plumb.When I watch a comedy that does n't quite work , I often feel as though I can see the thinking , see it on the page , and it was probably a good idea at the time . The execution does n't work . On a show or skit that IS working , a viewer can forget that this was on someone else 's page , as the actor makes it his own.Like watching SNL , when some skits take off and others just lie there , good ideas gone wrong.The set up is fine . Unpaid internships . Varied foursome plopped into a HuffPo environment , headed by a Bebe Neuworth ( Huffington ) who has n't found her character . Horse 's behind intern from the previous bunch lording it over everyone . He 's pretty good . The 28 year old employee who disses the lanky geek was nicely underplayed.I could n't finish watching it after the fourth number . Oh , no ... ... ..NOT another dumb song.Points for the setting , the difficulty of new grads trying to ooze into a biz they are already in debt for after 4 years of college , and not getting paid . More realism can still be funny . So far , this show is NOT .	-1
I guess if you 're a Glee fan , maybe this type of show works for you but I only lasted 2 minutes into the intro when I wanted to change the channel . I guess I have n't enjoyed a show with singing since Ally McBeal . Sorry , I 'll have to pass .	-1
There was nothing about this one that I liked . The characters are obnoxious , the singing is terrible , and the plot makes no sense .	-1
Bad songs . We 've seen this before.I like the idea of the interns at a magazine , but it 'd be much better as a comedy and lose all the songs .	-1
I do like musicals but I was n't real thrilled with this and watched 20 minutes before I moved on to something more interesting . I thought the introductory songs lingered on far too long ( except for the coughing part -- most humorous ! ) . Probably should of watched the entire thing before I ranked this ; it oould of been a decent show -- -maybe clip each solo so they are are not so lengthy ...	-1
Missed opportunity to be really good . I always like to learn something about the inside of an industry when I watch something like this . Nothing presented itself . The concept was good but the delivery was pretty yoki .	-1
Not the worst show I have seen on Amazon pilots list , but clearly not the best . I had no idea Babe N. was still alive - as an actor that is - yowsa ! Show was boring and unfunny .	-1
It 's like there was an ad put on Craigslist calling for a glee clone , but not set in high school . The thinking process after receiving response on must 've been , 'The internet 's a popular thing and this show will be on the internet . Why not make it take place at an internet-based company ? ' . It 's racist , and it 's supposed to take place in New York City . The non-Caucasian characters are given less songs . It 's predictable and the songs are n't great .	-1
So this may not be a fair review , since I turned it off during the opening song , but I really do n't want Amazon to waste their content space on what appeared to be a Glee rip off show . Please no musicals about whiny , entitled millenials .	-1
Cross between Glee x Ugly Betty , yeah , I do n't think so . I believe in diversity , but you ca n't always appease to everyone .	-1
The characters are clich & eacute ; the acting is sub par , the script needs work and do we really need another musical that no one will watch . Does anyone remember the cop musical , how about the musical that revolved around a small casino outside of Las Vegas . Even Smash , a very well done musical about musicals is being canceled . Only Glee has any staying power and that 's because of its pre-pubescent fan base .	-1
I really wanted to like the characters , but just when I thought they were interesting , they broke out into song which did absolutely nothing for the plot or the character . Sorry guys , this one was n't for me .	-1
Is this an updated version of Ugly Betty ? ? It sure has the look of that show . I dislike all the characters . I would never watch this show again . This is 25 minutes I will never ever ... get back !	-1
Now I know why I had never heard of this maybe the dumbest story line ah is there even a story line ? And shame on great actors doing this third rate show	-1
What were they going for ? High School Musical but with expletives ? Who wants to watch a comedy/drama with songs and dancing that are done by reality stars . Not one of these actors is a Gene Kelly , John Travolta or Jennifer Lopez . I just did not feel that the younger cast was up to the task of a musical , nor were the songs and choreography up to the standards of a 1st rate show . If Amazon wants this to feel like a real High School Musical on a weekly basis they hit the mark . But , I will not be watching . I like musicals , when they are done professionally .	-1
This was honestly the WORST pilot of them all . I watched it twice because the first time I zoned out , but yeah it sucked the second time around too . The pilot is lame : the characters ALL annoying , the concept weak , and the singing a big FAT joke ! It 's GLEE meets Friends set in the work place , but fingernails across a blackboard irritating on every level , without any enduring qualities . What an utter waste of Bebe Neuwirth 's amazing talents . There 's no potential here , smh .	-1
This wanna-be glee in the workplace is not worth your time . Very disappointed . Expected more from BeBe . Terrible stereo-types . An insult to music lover 's ears .	-1
This mash up does not work . It 's office meets smash . Ass in all thats wrong and not funny on Office meets all the bad things that happen on smash . I turned it off half way thru .	-1
Probably too close to reality to be a sitcom . And it really does n't play well as satire even though one of the songs does riff off the old theme song from the Mary Tyler Moore show . Really do n't care for any of these characters . Just superficial fluff without a solid center .	-1
The music was fine . The plot seemed a bit forced to me though . I ca n't see this being successful . Not sure who the demographic would even be .	-1
This show is definitely not my thing . I do n't mind musicals , in general ( as an aside : the musical episode of Scrubs was probably my favorite of that entire show ) , but I could n't stand this . The characters were too cheesy for my taste -- they were all very generic caricatures that lacked depth . Trite is the word I 'm looking for . Additionally , the songs felt forced and were always jarring . The songs in a good musical should come naturally . These really did n't , in my opinion . I also did n't find the singing to be very good.Honestly , I had a hard time getting through the episode . I made sure to finish it , but I found it unpleasant . I know some people enjoyed it , though , so I must just not be the demographic it 's targeted at . For me it was grating . Your mileage may vary .	-1
The song had some semi funny lyrics , but I 'm not really a huge fan of musical tv . Never watched Smash and could n't get through an episode of Glee . During the song it looked like there was some bad lip syncing going on by the asian girl , and I could let that slide since it 's not always easy to do . But after the singing was over it still looked like she was lip syncing , when nobody else did.The writing was alright , the cast was kind of annoying . If this were made into a show I would n't watch it .	-1
The acting itself is great , but my interest was honestly lost within the first 4 minutes of the show..might appeal to different audience , but remember what has happened with similar shows , i.e . Glee..started strong , but now fizzled . : - (	-1
As soon as the show started , I knew it was n't going to go well . The musical arrangements in the musical numbers lacks all originality and the lyrics are n't funny or interesting . It seems that they decided rhyming was enough to make the songs work , but they are n't very good songs and I am not even sure they were trying to make them funny . The rest of the writing is pretty similar -- while it 's not atrocious , there 's just no substance and nothing really works . The premise is decent and the actors all seem capable , but I do n't see how this show could work as a series ; it 's just not funny . There might be a funny show somewhere in this premise , but the pilot does n't even show enough promise to warrant a reworking of this material .	-1
A Glee influenced satire of The Huffington Post ... can it honestly get any worse from here ? Musical numbers aside , the young actors just are not very good . Remotely , the only saving grace is the actress parodying Ariana Huffington , Bebe Neuwirth ( who has done much better work than this ! ) Sorry , but this is a series I do NOT want to see -- nothing original about it !	-1
The show is trying to be similar to a & # 34 ; Glee , & # 34 ; but no where close . The acting/singing is sub-par and the story line is dismal .	-1
The only thing that kept me from making this a one star was the fact that two of the actresses were well played and well cast . That being Constance Wu and Bebe Neuwirth . Other than those two , the cast was simply stupid . Most of the songs were ridiculousness and the direction of the show was like a wet washcloth.If you do n't like stupid comedy skip this one , or rather watch it and rate it so junk like this does n't get made .	-1
This show is a disappointing production overall . Story , acting , singing , and direction all pretty bad . How do you make Bebe Neuwirth look bad ? She is an amazing singer/actor and she could n't shine in this terrible production .	-1
I 'd normally write in detail why this was bad but given that I could only watch half the episode I just ca n't tell you how bad this was indeed.Watched every other pilot too.Find something better Bebe . You deserve it .	-1
i was out by the second `` song '' this is a joke ... '' every where i look i see a chimpmunk on a waterski '' ... ..ugh	-1
It was just kind of weird . The singing audio did n't quite match the video , so it did n't look like people were really singing . None of it was very funny .	-1
This was the only pilot I could n't finish . It was bad on several accounts . Here 's a short list -1 . It 's a musical . I love good musicals , but I hate bad ones . This is a bad one . The songs are n't catchy and they do n't add anything to the story . We do n't need another `` Glee. '' 2 . The idea is boring . A show revolving around an internship could be promising . But when the internship only involves searching the web , it 's not doing anything for me . It 's SO dull.3 . The characters fall into cliche stereotypes and I just do n't end up giving a damn about any of them.Nothing about this catches my attention . I 'm passing on this one .	-1
I made it through almost half of the opening song ( probably about a minute and a half ) . I should have turned it off after the first 30 seconds.This must be some kind of goof right ?	-1
I did n't like it . I 'm not a fan of musicals . This would be a good show without all of the singing . Just not my cup of tea .	-1
Well what else is there to say about a show that starts with `` warning : show contains musical numbers '' . I would never watch this show , I could n't make it through even one episode . I found myself horrified and disgusted . Musicals are for Broadway , not TV .	-1
The balls on the creators of this show are as big as I 've seen since ... I dunno , Viva Laughlin , or Glee maybe . When I say this show is a musical , though , I do n't mean like those two , where you have the characters singing whatever song from the last 40 years that works in this particular situation , but a wholly original creation ( with all of the good and bad things that entails ) . You do n't end up having stupid things like a character singing a slow , `` moving '' cover of Girls Just Want to Have Fun ( ask the Glee fans about that ) , or ... well anything that happened in Viva Laughlin , because the songs are written to what the characters are thinking , so you have the inner monologue moments that come with having a musical ; the characters emotions truly come out in the songs . Needless to say , if you have a show that relies on newly written songs that much , it would help if they did n't suck , which is the unfortunate hole that Browsers has fallen into . Even Bebe Neuwerth , the original Morticia Addams on Broadway , among many others , could n't save the song she was given , which gleefully finds a whole bunch of things to rhyme with *Word I Can not Say in Amazon Reviews* , while failing on a level as a song , and really not doing a good job of telling us about the character . It 's a shame she 's not used more , as she 's channeling Ariana Huffington by way of Portia DeRossi 's character in Better Off Ted ( look at that costume ) , but leaning in to neither of them . The other four leads are some variation on a stock comic character , the Rachel Berry , the Stoned , Weird , Net-Friendly Asian , The Awkward Dork , and The Organized , Righteous Black Man . They each get a song ( save the latter ) , each song is uniquely bad in it 's own way . Mercifully , they 're all much shorter.The plot points are all very familiar , the characters are all very familiar , and the show does nothing with them because it takes time to tell in a few minutes what it could tell in 30 seconds , and the normal saving grace of the musical , catchy , emotion-rending songs , are not there . It 's a fascinating failure , and it 's definitely Amazon swinging for the fences , but it 's a pretty spectacular whiff .	-1
Preview [ HD ] I did not enjoy this rather silly comedy/musical . It did not hold my attention and I would not watch it if it were offered on Amazon Prime . The actors spontaneously breaking out in song did nothing for me . There are musicals out there that are worth the price and time to watch ... .but Browsers was not one of them . I have never cared for Glee either , so I guess its just not my cup of tea when it comes to comedy/musicals in general .	-1
This just did n't do it for me . I thought the jokes were lacking both lyrically and in dialogue . Actually I think in the first few seconds the lip syncing was just really not in sync at all which made suspension of disbelief almost impossible ...	-1
I could only hack ten seconds of this show . It actually made me very nervous and anxious . Singing on the streets of busy NY ... Not a good combination ...	-1
I can see how some might like it , but it was not for me . All the ( not great ) singing really killed it for me , I did n't make it through the pilot . But I wo n't give it one star , because I think I 'm just not the target audience for this show .	-1
I 'll be the first person to say that I 'm normally not big on musical numbers , so admittedly there is some bias in that department . But even for people who enjoy them , I just do n't think they 're done terribly well in 'Browsers . ' Also , all of the characters fit very tired and cliche ' archetypes ( stoner , nerd , gay guy , iron lady , etc. ) . The concept of the show itself is n't that bad , and the way the characters interact is very reminiscent of 'Scrubs , ' which was a very good show . Overall I do n't like the show mainly because it 's weakest point , the musical numbers , also happens to be the only real memorable thing about it . You would think just getting rid of the musical numbers would make the show better , but in actuality , it would just make the show completely forgettable .	-1
This was n't my cup of tea . I 'm not into musicals , and I ca n't stand the real Arianna Huffington , let alone a fictional one .	-1
Clearly not for me since I am not a Gleek or a fan of musicals in general . I fail to see the necessity of of breaking out in song that does n't enhance the overall storyline , and can not imagine a show of this calibre having the staying power to survive a season .	-1
Terrible.Seems like it might have promise but then they bust out an `` impromptu '' song that is terrible.Also , if you 're going to reference social media ( @ modernvaljean ) it helps if someone has actually created some content for that account .	-1
It was a self indulgent vapid display of every thing that 's wrong with modern entertainment . It tried so hard to be clever and hip that it wound up being neither.It has potential I in that there was obviously talented players .	-1
My wife and I turned Browsers off just 10 minutes into the show . We could n't watch another minute . Bad songs , bad dialogue , bad characters .	-1
I was embarrassed for the actors in this . The writers must have spent about 15 minutes on the concept and script , the songwriters maybe 5 minutes on trite , stupid , and clumsily trying to- , but failing to be clever lyrics with equally banal tunes . Unsure at first whether this was a comedy or a satire of a comedy ( which is what ? ) or a satire of musical comedy in general , I gave it ten more minutes and then just shook my head and stopped watching . Not a single thing original about this show . It misses the mark on all levels .	-1
Writers and composers - musicals are HARD TO WRITE . A song can not simply be words that rhyme and happen to have notes attached ... they need , like any other story , depth , layers , actual people not just caricatures , and something we can relate to , then they need to have good music to help tell that story . When you have a seasoned Broadway and TV actress like Bebe Neuwirth unable to make it work , you 're missing something . This is really painful .	-1
This was so incredibly annoying that I could n't stand to keep watching . The singing was mediocre ( I 'm being nice ) , the lyrics were lame , and it was boring .	-1
A musical TV series ? OK , at least it 's not & # 34 ; World 's Most Boring Job that We try to make Interesting by Featuring an Obnoxious Prick to Yell at the other People & # 34 ; , or a forensic crime show , but still does n't quite make it.Maybe I 'm not the target audience , but I only made it to about 15 seconds into the 2nd song before I went into diabetic shock .	-1
Sorry guys , didnt like this one . I hated Lez Miserables because it sang EVERY word . I felt a little dread during the opening scene of Browsers . Not sure why there is this mash-up of SMASH & THE OFFICE . For me , it doesnt work . What does work for me is Bebe Neuwirth . She was great !	-1
From the get go , Browsers actually 'warns ' it 's viewers that it is a musical show . If your goal is to immediately turn off 60 % of your potential audience , then this is a great plan . BeBe Neuwirth ( Frasier 's Wife ) is the star associated with this Amazon Original . Her accent is n't appealing . I should note that i 'm not a fan of music based shows , and this one , based upon interns at a news website , is not impressive . Expect songs about internet meme 's that wo n't have any meaning in a year . Such as the horrible song `` When I Tweet '' . The Dance sequence at the end is just lame during a song that could be funny , but falls flat on an empty premise of a show .	-1
The idea is cute . It 's a sitcom , but it 's a musical . It 's got quirky personalities thrown together in a dysfunctional workplace . What could go wrong ? Well , it 's rude . To me , the F-word is for extreme situations and for ignoramouses who lack the vocabulary to express themselves any other way . These characters are smart and articulate , so why is their dialague riddled with F-bombs ? Bebe Neuwirth is so watchable -- a consumate pro . I ca n't understand her agreeing to do this . She even gets the best musical number in the pilot -- except it 's framed around the F-word . Show some creativity , people ! Lose the language , and I might watch .	-1
It had me for an Internet minute abd tehen I stumbled away . I really like Constance Wu though - she was like 'Far out ' . . more please .	-1
There are a couple of tv shows with music successfully included in a drama and/or comedy show . It always seemed to me they go downhill when the singing stops . This pilot goes downhill from the opening song and either stays there or goes further down . The songs and singing were mediocre . The acting and writing was amateurish . I am embarrassed for Bebe Neurwirth . She deserves better but should also have known better than to allow herself to be dragged into this muck . Perhaps out of work older actors have to take jobs beneath their skill level just like a lot of other workers in this economy . Sad .	-1
I think that this was the my least favorite of the pilots , I like the actor from Paranormal Activity 3 , but other than that nothing seem to mesh on this show .	-1
Are they really singing ? Really ? Maybe that 's just the opening or something , maybe that 's the last of the singing . Nope ! Singing again , aannnd , I 'm done with this show .	-1
There are just so many things that are wrong about this show . I was expecting 30 Rock funny and sarcastic , not cute musical . I could n't believe they were serious with the music . I thought , `` O.K . any minute they 'll break and let us in on the music joke . '' But sadly they did n't . Good voices but this was a mish mash of wrongness .	-1
I do not like many musicals . The idea of people singing will at work all day . Is stupid . Thumbs down on this one .	-1
If you are n't into modern musicals , you wo n't like this . If you are into modern musicals , you 'll probably be 50/50 on this show . That does n't leave a lot of room for the development of fans.A show about interns from around the country , working at a Huffington Post-esque web company , could maybe sort of work . But the singing is thrown in with the intention of making it stand out . It does stand out , but in a way that makes it entirely too niche to catch on for most people.From the very beginning , it just feels like a bad Glee ripoff . I would not watch this show .	-1
Let 's make a show like Glee but in an office setting . Instant gold . Right ? No.I 've got nothing against musicals , but I never liked Glee , and this obvious copycat does n't do it for me either .	-1
I 'm sorry . I so wanted to like this show since Bebe Neuwirth is starring ! But I could not make it past the first scene when she broke out into song . For reference , I do n't watch `` Glee '' or `` Smash '' either so this just may not be my thing .	-1
I did not even make it to the end of this POS . The gym teacher dude should have been Thomas Lennon . The one with the beard is tolerable . Tattoo man needs to go ; rather the whole character . As a teacher , I hate the name of the show . Do not make any more of this show .	-1
What public school in America has only young white male teachers and principal -- except for a token elderly female who apparently has narcolepsy and dementia ? ? ? ? There are two attractive young white females ( the cafeteria lady and the librarian ) as sex-interests . The pilot included racist , sexist , homophobic , and age-related allusions ; what the ratings call STRONG LANGUAGE , and a lot of sex talk . But the awful part is that it was not funny ... barely got a chuckle or two . This show probably wo n't appeal to a diverse audience , and certainly not to anyone with taste .	-1
I watched this and thought it would be funny , but most of the recycled jokes and lack of any truly funny moments made it boring .	-1
This piece of garbage is totally offensive , not funny in the least , and I could n't bear to finish it . It epitomizes everything stupid , sad , and dull . I can not fathom how someone got paid to make a pilot of this , and how it made it to the final set . WORST EVER !	-1
There are no likeable characters.The tattooed guy is totally not believable , and what the hell : In the dialog where they are talking about reading books , the tattooed guy is insulting getting an education , while being mockingly called Henry Rollins WHO IS SUPER EDUCATED.Sloppy bad writing , unfunny , boring.do n't do it .	-1
As a fan of high school comedies ( Election being almost perfect ) this pilot disappoints . Nothing seemed real about it . Juvenile teachers or actors imitating juvenile teachers , it was just dull . Made me wince . The principal has possibilities , but only if the teachers are much more on top of things than he is.At least two of the three teachers seemed like warmed over Joel McHale imitations . Nuh , uh .	-1
The best I can say is that at least with this pilot , I made it more than half way through the program . The problem is that the more I learned about the characters , the less I liked them . Now I 've seen some pretty funny sitcoms based in school ( such as Boston Public ) , but at least then I could identify with the protagonists . In this case , I found myself not caring at all . Oh well , I guess you ca n't win them all . That 's why we make pilots .	-1
This is not a well written show . It 's unoriginal , the characters are bland , and it 's not funny . It 's not the worst of the pilots but it 's near the bottom .	-1
This is the type of comedy I do n't really enjoy , over the top silly and a bit mean spirited . I could n't finish the pilot , and wo n't watch more if it goes to series .	-1
This has to be one of the worst pilots I have ever seen . At no point was the dialogue remotely funny .	-1
I must be too old , this does not seem funny to me at all and I just stopped watching half way in .	-1
You ca n't be serious . This was awful . Turned off after 5 minutes . Geared to an adolescent humor level . Nuffield said .	-1
I think this show is OK . But I felt like it lacked the strong humor and cast of a show like 'It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia ' . I also thought the main characters looked too much alike , which created an odd contrast from the diversity of the children in the school . While I found the show amusing , it 's nothing special , I would n't go out of my way to watch an episode . I got the sense the writers were trying way too hard to be funny here .	-1
NO . Amaz on made 8 comedies . Of them 5 were pure crap and 2 were mostly crap and 1 was partly crap . This fell into the first . It was not the worst of them but it is still crap !	-1
If you like Scary Movie or Date Movie or Blue mountain State , shows in that vain , you 'll like this . I did n't laugh once , I did n't enjoy the banter . It 's trying to do workaholics without being as talented or believable as those guys -- not that workaholics is believable , they just have great delivery .	-1
This episode was n't very good . Similar humour to Workaholics , but definitely not as funny . If it got picked up , I might give it another chance . The characters are decent and the premise might work , but not many of the jokes land .	-1
As some others have said , I am baffled about the high rating for this show . I almost stopped watching at the halfway mark , having not laughed once , but then finished watching just to give it a chance . The second half managed to make me smile once or twice , and that 's it . I really enjoy `` It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , '' but this , unfortunately , is like Sunny minus the strong writing and great acting ( although what appears to be not-so-impressive comic acting may just be the result of sticking good actors with bad material ) . And , except for the existence of bullies , it does n't feel as if it 's drawing from anything real about high school , either from the perspective of teachers or of students . ( I did like the principal 's secretary -- but she 's on for perhaps two minutes . )	-1
Three male high school teachers have total disregard for their jobs , their students , and their superiors . Here 's the punchline that ought to have happened in this show , `` You 're fired ! '' Dumb situations , drugs , anti-gay slurs and behavior , everyone misbehaves , no one has any feelings or gets punished for their misdeeds . I do n't doubt some particular drug-addled viewership will like this kind of men-who-won't-grow-up kind of sitcom . If I had a remote to change the channel , I would certainly use it on this .	-1
Could not follow such a stupid theme . Doubt it will get much further than this pilot . Not funny at all .	-1
I felt the jokes crossed the line and made fun of certain populations . The script also played into stereotypes , which will not benefit society .	-1
There is nothing good about this show ! ! ! It 's offensive , dumb , not funny and unwatchable ! ! ! I would never watch this if you ordered it ! ! ! !	-1
Looking at the reviews I 'm definitely counter to most poeple watching this show , but I found absolutely nothing redeeming about the show . The actors were poor , the direction pointless and I did n't laugh even a single time . When did pure stupidity become funny ? This is one of those shows that you watch and regret because you are now almost 23 minutes dumber than when you started and you will never get that time back .	-1
This was an average American sitcoms . It made me laugh a few times , but it 's not something I would watch if it became a series .	-1
I simply do not understand where all these 5 star reviews are coming from . I could see how this type of humor is not for everyone . But this type of humor IS for me - I 'm a big fan of It 's Always Sunny , Workaholics , The League , and all this aspires to be.But this is just not good . I think the problem lies with the actors ? Primarily the history and PE teachers - they 're not funny ( what they 're doing could be funny / the scenarios are funny in theory , but the performances are just not believable / real / authentic ... which makes them not funny ) . I did enjoy the Spanish teacher though - he was quite good.Wanted to like it ( particularly given how it came to be ) , but it just is n't good . I have n't read any positive `` official '' reviews [ newspapers etc . ] either .	-1
I can imagine the thinking : let 's get some self-absorbed characters to push some boundaries on the cheap a la It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia . And I think there is some funny dialogue here but the actors are simply too obnoxious . IASIP does n't have likable characters but it has likable PERFORMERS . These guys are n't funny , the are n't appealing , and I would n't watch them again.A lot of shows with middle-of-the-road writing are elevated by perfect casting . This is middle-of-the-road writing crippled by terrible casting . For all I know , these guys actually wrote the show , again a la IASIP , which is why they 're here . I do n't know . I did n't look .	-1
Who are the target audience here ? ! It is offensive , and not funny at all . Could not continue for more than 10 minutes . Tried to give it a chance but the show never got better . Had bad teachers but this is just outright awful . It gives teachers such an underserved bad rep and for what . Sorry but I do n't get it nor see any comedy value in this .	-1
Didnt NBC try this show already ? What is this show going to be about ? Here is the cast of the show : Lead singer from Likin ParkPoor mans nick swardsonsuper poor joel mchale.How is this rated so highly ?	-1
The title says it all . I stopped watching this only 10 minutes in . Immature is a step up for these teachers . Totally unbelievable and not very funny . Not interested in seeing anymore .	-1
Offensive just for the sake of being offensive . Which I would understand them doing if the show was actually funny . But it was n't . It was just sad . These teachers represent everything wrong with society . It is not entertaining to watch them swear like a bunch of 5th graders who think they 're grown up .	-1
This felt pretty average to me . It managed to get a few laughs , but I pretty much forgot about is as soon as it ended . The thing is , it 's too much like several other shows/movies out there , `` Workaholics , '' `` It 's Always Sunny in Philadelphia , '' `` The Hangover , '' and for some reason it also reminds me of `` Horrible Bosses . '' Basically three screw ups with crap jobs doing horrible things throughout the show . Been there done that . Instead of doing something unique , it 's just cashes in on an already saturated genre .	-1
I ca n't stand comedy that is stupid for the sake of stupid . Dumb and Dumber and it 's ilk make me vomit . 2 minutes into this show I could taste the bile and that 's as far as I got .	-1
These are some smart , talented actors doing what they can with bad writing . Bathroom humor is not funny , it 's lazy and a huge turnoff . Yuck .	-1
Really I could n't . From the very beginning the characters were not funny and were unoriginal . Also , I do n't understand the need for graphic language in a comedy show . I did n't make the show better .	-1
I found this show so unappealing I could n't stand to waste my time on the whole thing -- in an effort to be fair I skipped ahead to various points , but it only got worse . Potty humor for grownups is funny ? Life would have to be REALLY boring to make this interesting to me -- and fortunately life is n't .	-1
It seemed like a long 22 minutes but there were some occasional laughs . Some in the cast appear talented . The humor is alternately slap stick and adolescent . Just who do they see as their audience going forward ? I suspect it may be pretty narrow with this type of humor . I would suggest they go back to the drawing board and re-think this . A couple of times I thought the show had possibilities but it kept lapsing back into silliness . In the long run , that wo n't cut it .	-1
The most amateur production quality of all of the & # 34 ; Amazon Originals & # 34 ; that I tried out . I love the concept , and the title , but the show was very obviously poor , very quickly .	-1
Not sure why , but I did n't find this very funny or entertaining at all . I guess the jokes were n't very clever , the plot was unoriginal , and the characters were unrealistic .	-1
THE Writer who wrote this should go back to the bathroom and finish what he was doing . This show does n't ` deserve to be called bad.If I could spell atrocious that would be more appropriate .	-1
Stupid movie ! But it was in good condition it did come by the date given . I would purchase from them again . It 's not their fault the movie is lame . But customer service was AWESOME !	-1
yes agree with everybody well done Terrible Picture Perfect Horror yes is a terrible horrible horror movie ... cheap low budget movie , no head or feet nothing.. this guy try to speaks like Marlon Brando but is terrible terrible , terrible FX , terrible places , terrible actors , terrible dialogue..worst than SCI FI ... ..one of the worst movies I ever seen in my entire life ... terrible terrible ...	-1
I did not care for this movie at all . Thought it would have been much better . Subject line of this movie did n't make sense at all . Sorry I paid $ 6.99 to watch it .	-1
Sometime in the near future , some people get obsessed with celebrities so much that some companies start providing these admirers with a new way to get closer to their `` stars '' : getting infected with the same virus as their favorite celebrities . Young Syd March ( Caleb Landry Jones ) works for the Lucas Clinic , a company that owns the exclusive rights for such super-celebrities as Hannah Geist ( Sarah Gadon ) .I know this is a satire - not a very good one , but a satire nonetheless - so I decided to keep watching , ignoring the film 's unbelievable premise . But when Syd smuggled the virus out of the company 's lab by getting himself infected , I lost interest in whatever was going on . `` Antiviral '' tries to depict a near-futuristic world that is bleak and captivating , but with its underdeveloped idea the result is simply pretentious and boring.Caleb Landry Jones , better known for some movie fans as Sean Cassidy / Banshee of `` X-Men : First Class '' turns in a compelling performance , but his character is not given enough depth for the viewer to really care what is happening to him . Same can be said about the celebrity Hannah Geist ( Sarah Gadon , who played Emma Jung in `` A Dangerous Method '' ) , whose back story should have been much more interesting.The director 's flair for visuals is on display throughout `` Antiviral '' with some stomach-churning moments that feel like going on forever , but what Brandon Cronenberg needs a tighter narrative and a less-is-more approach to the subject matter .	-1
Terrence Malick is one of those directors that I don & # 8217 ; t always click with . I know that he has a very large and supporting group of rabid fans and yet I have yet to be truly mesmerized by him since his debut , & # 8216 ; Badlands & # 8217 ; . What I have always admired about Malick is that he tries to come at very deep rooted and intellectual subjects from a vantage point of almost complete detachment , allowing us to hover over these subjects without beating us over the head with them . He & # 8217 ; s focused on war and faith and death and celebrity and in each of these instances , even when I don & # 8217 ; t feel the film worked as a whole , you find this otherworldly atmosphere thanks to Malick & # 8217 ; s thickly laced scope of ideas.I & # 8217 ; ve said this time and time again , but Malick is a director who tends to get in his own way. & # 8216 ; To the Wonder & # 8217 ; is , in my eyes , the most disjointed , distracted and overall uneven film Malick has directed . While I & # 8217 ; ve grown accustomed to his use of visual imagery and whispered voice over to create his & # 8216 ; point & # 8217 ; , the use of those images and whispers only reduced & # 8216 ; To the Wonder & # 8217 ; to an elongated commercial for Zoloft.The synopsis here is rather simple . Neil meets the free spirited Marina in Paris , where he sweeps her off her feet and brings her and her daughter back to his home in Oklahoma . Their relationship starts to crumble almost immediately and soon Marina and her daughter pack up and leave . In her absence , Neil starts to court Jane , a former flame , only to have Marina crawl back home and convince him to marry her , leaving Jane out to pasture . Marriage doesn & # 8217 ; t fix the crack in their marriage though , and soon they find themselves at violent odds . While all of this is happening , the Spanish pastor in their town is , apparently , struggling with his grasp on his own faith.I & # 8217 ; m honestly not sure what Father Quintana has to do with this story , at all ( completely reminded me of the useless Sean Penn segment in & # 8216 ; Tree of Life & # 8217 ; ) , but Javier Bardem was easily the best thing about the movie so I hate to say it should have been removed from the film . In all honesty , this felt like a really bad editing issue . Terrence Malick is notorious for chopping his films in half . There was that controversy over & # 8216 ; The Thin Red Line & # 8217 ; where he actually cut Adrian Brody right out of the film , and he was slated to be THE STAR . So , it & # 8217 ; s no surprise that Rachel McAdams has like three scenes , but it is disheartening that the Father Quintana storyline feels like a poorly developed subplot . There is absolutely no flow between these two storylines , despite having Marina briefly confide in Father Quintana about her relationship with Neil ( and by & # 8216 ; briefly & # 8217 ; I literally mean for about five seconds ) . Instead , these two stories feel ripped from two separate films and so I really feel like there is very important footage that was left on the cutting room floor that could have developed this into a more cohesive story.Or maybe Malick just wrote a story void of those essential bones.I think that is a major issue I take with this . Even from a purely spiritual or emotional standpoint , & # 8216 ; To the Wonder & # 8217 ; feels vacant . In dissecting the relationship between Marina and Neil , the film goes nowhere . Their issues are never explored , their fights are never revealed and their tumultuous relationship is pretty much a repetition of pictures that reduce Marina to an obnoxious woman who prances around and wants to be tickled and Neil to a grump who pouts at the camera or walks out of the room with his eyes cast down at his feet . There is no meat here , no actual character development and so we can & # 8217 ; t care for them at all . The spiritual angle of faith feels like an afterthought , since Bardem & # 8217 ; s scenes are sparse and feel like such a tack on I almost couldn & # 8217 ; t take them as part of the same film.Yes , & # 8216 ; To the Wonder & # 8217 ; is beautiful , but it has nothing to say .	-1
After visiting Marina ( Olga Kurylenko ) in Paris , Neil ( Ben Affleck ) brings Marina and her daughter Tatiana ( Tatiana Chiline ) back to the states with the intent of getting married and allowing Marina to get her green card . However their relationship hits a rough patch and Marina and Neil both find themselves traveling their own paths . Marina encounters a priest named Father Quintana ( Javier Bardem ) , who seems to have a struggle finding his own happiness . Meanwhile Neil rekindles an old flame with childhood friend Jane ( Rachel McAdams ) .It was difficult to anticipate a film like `` To the Wonder '' since Terrence Malick films are generally pretty abstract . `` The Tree of Life '' felt like half a dozen storylines competing for your attention and none of them felt like they were properly resolved . `` To the Wonder '' continues Malick 's streak of featuring incredible cinematography in his pictures . Cathedrals , trickling streams containing slumbering rocks , walking along the beach , a rose bush covered in snow , and an endless array of impressive shots of the sky and animals in their natural habitat ; a National Geographic special is like the secondary storyline to Neil and Marina 's relationship.The narrative of `` To the Wonder '' feels extremely erratic . It 's not that it ca n't decide who to follow or where to go , but the path it travels seems so random that it feels like someone just closed their eyes , spun around , and pointed and then followed that path for awhile before jumping back to the previous path . The characters are practically driven by indecisiveness . Neil does n't want to be alone , but ca n't seem to commit . Marina wants to be with Neil and then she does n't . She wants to live in the States and then she wants to move back to Paris . Father Quintana wants to help people , but refuses to help himself . Even when these characters get what they want , it 's like a flip switches on inside and they ca n't accept it . It becomes extremely frustrating.What you end up with is constant visits to the drive-in restaurant Sonic , repetitive trips to the grocery store , and frolicking through grassy field that seem to last a lifetime . Affleck seems to only have a handful of lines and spends most of his time lurking about ; pacing around , not talking , and looking disgruntled . There is something in `` To the Wonder . '' Something about blossoming relationships always falling apart just when they seem to be at their peak and what appears to be two different lifetimes lived by one man . A priest is able to make others feel good about themselves yet is so empty inside and a woman is in love with a man who 's in love with another woman . You 're just kind of left dangling when it comes to Jane and Father Quintana and even though the story between Neil and Marina is given the most time its conclusion is massively unsatisfying.While it may be filmed beautifully , `` To the Wonder '' does n't exactly move its gestating 112-minute duration along any faster with everyone on-screen galloping around their front yard or a field full of slow moving bison genitalia . So embrace that obnoxious ten year old of yours , hold a rooster , and lick a tree branch because `` To the Wonder '' is a romantic drama that wanders around so aimlessly it ca n't decide where to go next .	-1
Pretentious . This movie tries so hard to be intense , brooding & deep but fails to deliver . No wonder it went straight to DVD . It would have bombed in general release . Such a disappointment . Do n't waste your time or money on this snooze fest .	-1
One beautiful shot after another ... Paris , Mont Saint Michel , ... .plus moody music and a French woman 's voice whispering & # 34 ; poetic & # 34 ; words . Many , many shots of the woman spinning , prancing and dancing , with arms outstretched in all of the above sites . We get it ... .she 's a Free Spirit ... .She 's French ... .she 's adorable ... .she 's romantic . After a long stretch of this we see the same woman back with her stolid polar-opposite , square-jawed , decent , Oklahoma guy , a man of few words . And he does n't spin . The woman 's daughter , though , also frolics and spins with her arms out . She 's adorable , too , and has an adorable name , Tatiana , in case you missed the fact that she is adorable . This goes on for quite a while . The French woman tries to spin and dance for the guy in their house , using a scarf , but he is beginning to lose interest . She does manage to frolic and giggle when he puts the hose on her but that is short lived . If only she could do something else ... like cook or make conversation or read a book ? Her repertoire of tricks is limited to being adorable , spinning and sometimes biting ... .very feline and French I guess ? Meanwhile Javier Bardem is a Spanish priest who is having a crisis of faith . He is the most interesting character , so far and I had hopes that he might interject something of substance into this thin romance . But even his presence did n't do it for me . I was relieved when the French woman went home and the Affleck guy met a local girl . She looked amazingly like the French one ... same sweetheart face , petite body and long hair ... .only hers was blond . And , thank God , she did n't spin around ! I had hopes for that duo but when she started giving her version of the same hard-luck story that the French woman delivered , I had enough . I 'll never know what happened to any of them and I 'll never care .	-1
`` You got me out of the darkness . You gathered me up from earth . You 've brought me back to life . '' Neil ( Affleck ) is an American who is traveling in Paris when he meets Marina ( Kurylenko ) a divorced mother with a ten year old daughter . Striking up a fast romance they both move back to Oklahoma . Not long after the move the relationship begins to stale and when her Visa expires Marina and her daughter return to Paris . When she moves back Neil reconnects with an old friend and they begin to fall in love , until Neil hears troubling news about Marina . I 'm not going to lie , the only reason I can write that summary is because I read it off of IMDb . I did watch the movie but I could n't really understand what it was about , even after reading the summary I still would n't have guessed that was the plot . I also am not sure if the movie was told in present time or one long flashback . I did have a feeling this is what I was going to get going in though because this is a Terrence Malick film ( his last one was Tree Of Life ) and his movies are very different that everything else . There really is n't much I can say about this , mainly because I did n't understand what was going on . I can usually follow movies , but Malick 's are much to smart for me . Overall , if you liked Tree Of Life or movies like that then you will like this one too . I just thought it was boring . I give it a C	-1
The photography and locations are wonderful but the actors are wasted in what is basically a very long ad for no product at all . Lots of navel gazing and internal monologues regarding the breakdown of a couple .	-1
Only watched this because a visitor was interested in it . Bullies at the utmost . While they can be gentle at times only because they have you handcuffs , these people are not model citizens .	-1
Yay ! Another show glorifying pure white trash ! I 'm talking about Beth , not the people they take into custody . My wife watches this crap . Shame on her .	-1
I 'm done with VH1 and these trashy classless shows . This did not make any sense at all and most of the scenes did not seem real at all . It seemed as though they were acting this time .	-1
This show is a'right but what makes it difficult to watch is Stevie . He gives off a super creepy vibe , not only is he controlling but it is clear that he only see 's these two women as either sex objects or means of making him money . He really is a gross modern day pimp . HIs daughter 's mom needs to leave him and separate herself from his destructive ways . That Joseline women will learn her lesson in time , I mean he would n't even show her , her very own contractw- yeah controlling . Very scary that so many women get locked up into these types of relationships .	-1
it is 2013 , can we have something that looks halfway decent ? I turned it off within 5 minutes , not funny , did n't like the voices . Amazon you did the right thing and let us tell you these shows are terrible before sinking anymore money into them . I usually do not like claymation , or stop-motion shows and this was no different . In cartoon type shows , how good it looks is just as important as any character or script . It is the first impression one has of the show and needs to be visual striking to keep peoples attention .	-1
There 's nothing spectacularly wrong with this show , but there 's nothing spectacular about it either . There 's not even really anything solid or good about it -- this is a show about on par with `` The Cleveland Show '' or whatever : mediocre and instantly forgotten . If Amazon , like Netflix , is trying to show off its ability to order pilots , maybe it does n't have to break new ground , but it should at least strive to do better than what Fox has one eight times a week .	-1
The stop motion was great . The premise looked & sounded good , too . There were a few funny moments , and several dead/boring ones . Maybe it will get better over time .	-1
Conceptually this sounded like something I would like and I thought it might be along the lines of an animated Dr. Horrible , but I was very disappointed with the pilot . It just was n't funny . The claymation was ok . The characters were mostly annoying and did n't make me form any sort of attachment .	-1
Maybe this show could 've had a home on Cartoon Network or wherever stoners go to watch stupid things like this , but I do n't think it 's worth it to pursue this show , when there are much better shows in this lineup . Please do n't pick this up for series , I 'd rather not have to lose faith in humanity again .	-1
This show was hard to follow so I was n't sure when to laugh . Think it would have been better if the show had a bigger budget .	-1
I could only watch a few minutes of this , it was painful . It does n't work on any level . It 's clearly aimed at 9 year olds except that it contains content that 's inappropriate for 4th graders . If they 're intent was to do a show for children then they should clean it up so that children will be allowed to see it .	-1
This animated sci-fi pilot waa n't all that interesting to me . I like sci-fi but only occasionally watch animated series . I do n't think I am the right demographic for this show . This would likely appeal to young adult males . So I do n't think I 'd watch any more of this .	-1
Stopped watching about 5 minutes in , not at all interested . Never grabbed my attention and the animation ( even with the disclaimer ) seemed really terrible .	-1
I really wanted to like this one . The premise of a stop motion cartoon about slacker storm troopers has a lot of potential . Unfortunately the whole pilot is incredible lazy . It 's a lot of obvious stoner jokes ( `` Sorry I was n't listening because I was SO HIGH . That 's the punchline . '' ) and jokes where the humor is supposed to found in characters talking about regular stuff BUT IN SPACE : `` You went to high school on JUPITER ? I knew a guy there ! I made out with him in his SPACE SHIP . '' Not a lot of effort.Aside from the evil galactic middle manager who ca n't call his death star a 'Planet Buster ' for legal issues , all the characters are really bland and generic too . The main character is another downtrodden everyman , his sidekick is a fat underachieving stoner , and the love interest is `` the girl who just understands . '' Once again , not a lot of effort put into it.In fact there does n't seem to a lot of effort put into any part of this pilot : the majority of it is n't even animated ; just an amateurish-looking animatic . I understand that animation , especially stop motion animation , is time consuming and costly , but if that 's the kind of show you 're planning on making , do n't show me cruddy temp footage and expect me to care . It 's too bad though , because the scenes that were fully animated looked pretty sweet.I 'm disappointed to give this one a bad review . It seemed like a really great idea . But it was bad instead .	-1
I really did n't like this at all . The concept was alright , and the animation was very nice , but the jokes and characters did n't hold up at all . Not interested in this as a series .	-1
Love the team ( Big Bang Theory ) behind the show but the show has no where to go . I am bored .	-1
I did n't mind so much that the animation was only partly finished . And there were some good voice talents in this ( although perhaps not directed all that well ) , however , the writing was just sub-par . Wanted to like it , but could not care less about the characters , the story , the premise , or the presentation .	-1
The premise , a couple of future slackers become unwilling minions of the evil galactic conglomerate , is so clich & eacute ; , so uber-PC , so lefty Hollywood snarky inside-joke stupid it might have been funny . Except that the jokes fall flat or are flat out distasteful ( `` I 'll get you a hooker with five vaginas '' ) . For heroes we have a fat , dorky stoner and his friend , an even more pathetic , down on his luck looser who is looking for love . Hilarity does not ensue . The highlight of the episode , and the stand-out in the cast , is the rebel chick . Unfortunately she comes with a stereotypical self-absorbed , narcissistic pretty boy sidekick -- a total poser who loves to get stoned and quote Chairman Mao . Instead of being witty Dark Minions is banal ; instead of being edgy it is foul mouthed ; instead of being good it is simply bad . What makes shows like Big Bang Theory geeky and good is they have real science jokes and plot devices , matched with sympathetic characters possessing depth and believability . This pilot has none of those characteristics .	-1
Mind you I love Scifi , the 3 stooges , and buddy films but this came off very flat . The verbiage and the gags did not gel together in any LOL way . There is alot of room for improvement , but the way it is written and the voices acted , I will not invest anymore time into viewing , nor would I recommend Amazon investing $ into this story line .	-1
Terrible show . Way to much cussing which does n't make the movie any better . Do not watch your wasting your money .	-1
I was really excited for this one . I love stop motion animation . I love high-concept comedies . I loved the opening explanation of the two different animation styles in this pilot , but I did n't like anything about this actual show . I 'm not surprised the writers are actors from Big Bang Theory ; the show has a similar feel , but I hate that show . It feels like they are trying so hard to make funny jokes , but very , very little is funny and some of it is n't even really jokes . I 'd have a hard time sitting through another episode of this .	-1
This pilot was an animated sci-fi comedy that I struggled with watching to its conclusion . Part of the issue was the fact that the animation was not completed but getting past that the story was thin and the characters were just not all that endearing . In a future world an egotist makes decisions in trying to eradicate rebels and is inept in his leadership . The rebels are led by an equally inept individual . In between are two mismatched characters who accidentally volunteer to go to a suspected rebel held planet for a reconnaissance . There they run into a girl rebel who thinks they are also rebels ( ? ) . Of course one of these two bumblers falls for the girl immediately and then it becomes blah blah blah . There is an attempt for subtle humor that is neither funny nor subtle . Not something that I would want revisit .	-1
I was so un-impressed with the preview I did n't even watch the pilot . Sorry but animation has been so over done the past few years that it just does n't hold the same draw for me that it once did . Another miss in my book	-1
I usually do n't mind & # 34 ; comic-like & # 34 ; shows , but this one was not good . I disliked the story line/writing and it was challenging to watch the entire episode .	-1
This show about the minions is ok but could be better I think the show would be better if it was In Animation Cartoon Animation	-1
I did n't laugh once through the entire episode . I think I smiled a couple of times but that was a bout it . Not a bad concept , although not all that original , but not well executed . Just not funny .	-1
Most of the jokes are retreads from other sci-fi comedies and-or drug movies . the animation was fresh , though , but that was all because the writing needs re-tooling . Most of the writing was significant when it was in mel brooks ' , BLAZING SADDLES ( ah , yeaah ) ! the two stars are for the animation because it reminds me of , SPEED RACER , and the claymation , such as , WALLACE AND GROMMIT , JASON AND THE AROGNAUTS and JASON AND THE GOLDEN FLEECE . i liked that stuff .	-1
The comic laziness of this episode was only paralleled by the similarly slow advancement of the show 's frames per second . The humor was lost , lost in space as it were . This show was just plain dull . Just really , really incredibly dull . The characters were dry and uninteresting , worse than a bad British sitcom . It seemed like the creators thought that parading Star Wars tropes in front of the viewer in a comedic setting would be good enough to get us to throw money at them . It was too forceful , overemphasized . Like the totalitarian state that is the empire.Two thumbs down .	-1
I found this show a little annoying with the cursing . It might be ok but I did n't feel like watching the rest of the pilot because of the language used . It was a little over used . I do n't mind a few curse words but for they used it too much .	-1
Not funny . How many puking gags can you put in one episode ? ? ? I 'm guessing the target audience for this series is 9 year old kids . They *might* think it 's funny . Most of these pilot episodes seem to be targeted for the under 25 crows . Older people watch TV on the web too . Please develop something for grown ups !	-1
I feel like this is n't the right venue for Dark Minions , but then again , I 'm not sure what would be . It 's not quite off-kilter enough to be an Adult Swim comedy , though it does have moments of very Robot Chicken sensibility ; It 's too weed/cursing focused to be a show for adolescents , though I feel like with a little adjusting down , this would go over very well with the 12-15 set ; It 's got a little too much plot to be a video game , though I think a Ratchet and Clank-esque platformer with these characters would be pretty funny and have endless options for gameplay . Given that 75 % of the show is still in animatics , it just screams unfinished , but I think that extends to the thought about the show as well . There are some great laughs in there , as a Galactic Overlord dealing with normal people needs and ( to even greater success ) bureaucracy is just inherently funny , but the weed jokes are lame ( as they are most of the time ) , and something about the format ( both claymation and the storyboard animatics ) just does n't play well to most types of humor . There 's a kernel of a good idea here ( and some great voice acting work by Richard Kind and Clancy Brown ) , but I do n't think this is the right outlet .	-1
All I could think of watching this is how Space Janitors ( geek and sundry ) was so much better , and that I did n't need a second star wars spoof in my life .	-1
Designed for the tech employee who feels their creativity is stifled by working on mundane coding or trouble shooting networks , and riding off of the Star Wars rift ( rebel alliance fighting empire kind of thing ) , this show does n't offer anything new or unique . The theme here is that if that tech/computer-person , who is likely a sci-fi fan , is feeling down in the dumps about his job , then the solution is to hook up with some hottie to `` fight the system '' : Or , in lay-speak , get a woman to make your life feel easier.That 's not such a bad message , but it 's nothing new , and it 's tiring . That , and the the humor is predictable and fairly flat . Maybe it 's because I 'm an older viewer who 's heard all the jokes , or maybe it 's because as a science fiction fan I did n't find a whole lot of science in this fiction and did n't think the setup all that unique , but I did n't so much as grin at any of the humor.Well acted , well animated , good concept drawings , well staged , I 'm sure this program will find a niche audience , but it feels a little spartan in the writing department ( that , and drop the space nazi at the five minute mark who hands out the cyanide capsules ... or make him something other than a paranoid Bavarian knockoff ) .It 's not a production I would back .	-1
I love sci-fi , I love comedy , and I love animation . Combine all 3 and I 'm there . The voice acting was awesome and the comedic timing was solid.What I do n't enjoy is the evil corporation trope and freedom fighter quoting Mao and actually supporting Communism . I get it , I 'm old and hating Communism is SO last century . But , Communism is evil and it 's not funny . It 's especially not funny when thinly veiled as comedy and satire .	-1
The show seems like it struggled to get off the ground , the storyline tried to be adult-oriented , but is too ignorant and simplistic to attract its target audience .	-1
I was hoping for something funny , but this one did n't work for me . I found the Boss to be quite funny - but the two main characters were not only *not* funny , but ranged from annoying to uselessly annoying . Too many cheap jokes , not enough really funny stuff . Unfortunately , I ca n't recommend .	-1
I only made it to the 4:30 mark on this one . Any longer and it might have done permanent brain damage . The fat guy showed his butt ... hardy freakin ' har ! There 's graffiti on the spaceships ... oh , stop ... my side hurts from the hilarity . Too dumb for adults , too filthy for the kiddies . That leaves you with no audience dumb wits !	-1
This pilot , although not fully fleshed out , just felt like a flat Tripping The Rift . Not to much to impress or care about in these characters .	-1
I guess I do n't watch much animation which is oriented at adults ( at least that 's who I thought they were aiming for ) and after watching this it would still hold true . The idea of the show is different with the two main characters earning their living with the galactic conglomerate . It starts out in stop motion/claymation but then switches to cartoon animation . ( If I read it correctly it 's supposed to be all claymation if the show gets picked up but do n't quote me . ) Either way I just was n't interest enough to continue watching further episodes . It just did not hook me in .	-1
I viewed several of these comedy pilots and none have achieved mediocrity status for me . As with the others , there may be some potential but there just is n't enough quality humor to justify anyone putting money into this at present . Concept is a little vague and writing ( the key inadequacy of most of these efforts is the writing ) is spotty at best . I 've watched House of Cards on Netflix and while it is not a comedy the quality is vastly superior to what I 've seen here . If it is Amazon 's intention to compete with Netflix in developing their own programming it is like a Rookie League taking on the Major Leagues . Since I regard Amazon as a generally high quality operation I can only suggest they go back to the drawing boards and focus on upgrading the products .	-1
Do n't like the animation style , the humor is cliche as can be , and in great abundance already on TV . What does this add ?	-1
Which is to say , if you 've got a lame sense of humor and do n't like to watch actual good comedy , then Dark Minions is where it 's at for you .	-1
It stunk , now that is my opinion . I '' m sure that some people who do n't care about the dirty language in a cartoon would find this some what appealing . Dark Minions is not for the heavenly hearts .	-1
Did n't care for the claymation aspect . Too much unnecessary swearing , it 's as if it were added just to appeal to an immature viewing audience . Characters not interesting - bordering on annoying .	-1
Did n't the Onion News already have a failed TV show and a terrible movie ? Why are they trying this again ? Would work better at 15 minute length at 1am on adult swim . so far not impressed with the pilots Amazon , NBC would crush you in the ratings and they suck .	-1
My issue with this series and for the & # 34 ; Onion News & # 34 ; in general is that they believe that crass humor is the way to go in their fake reporting . While people do seem to like some of this I do not . I find it offensive for the most part . When a company thinks it is okay to attack a young child that is up for an Oscar you start to question their taste level . This show made me question it further . What could have been a rather interesting & # 34 ; News Show & # 34 ; pilot falls flat because of its attachment to the Onion News . I enjoy the actors in other shows and even enjoyed the introduction of the segment producer that I had n't seen anywhere else to date , but this is not the show for them to find their next move in the business because simply put it is a horrible show about horrible people . There was simply nothing redeeming for this show because of how crude and crass it decided to be .	-1
I really enjoyed the Onion News Network and was disappointed when IFC cancelled it . Was hoping for something like that here as a second chance . Or even Sports Dome . Was n't expecting it to be a serial comedy instead of a parody . Maybe the creators wanted to go a different direction because they were tired of being cancelled.I wo n't knock it for that . But it was too frenetic and disjointed for my taste.It came off more as MAD magazine than anything else . There 's nothing wrong with that . I was just hoping for more satire and less wackiness.A lot of great talent well played . A lot of funny lines . But I was gritting my teeth more than laughing.If this were up against fewer shows that were better , I 'd like this to have a shot . But I would rather other shows like Alpha House , Betas , or Those Who Ca n't get the shot over this one if it comes to that .	-1
How is it that such a funny periodical can never be that funny on TV ? The shorts on their site are considerably better than any of the shows they 've put on television . Even with gloss and star power there 's no denying that this is supremely underwhelming . Too bad .	-1
Pitiful , juvenile attempt at satire of cable news . There are REAL cable news networks that are funnier and more entertaining ... writing is very poor and acting is worse .	-1
I have high hopes for this , because the onion were really funny . I watched it till the end , but when the credit rolls out , I dont think I care to watch the next episode , if they have any . It has some funny moments , but It feels like it was just ... okay , nothing special that makes me care about the show . I like Jeffrey Tambor from Arrested Development , and the other guy from 30 Rock , but this pilot fet like it needs something more , imo .	-1
I love the Onion 's website but it never seems to work in long form . They 've tried full length TV versions in the past and they have n't worked . This one has a better cast than their previous efforts but it 's still only funny for the first few minutes . If this were a 10 minute show instead of a half hour it would be OK , but then it would be no different from the website . They should rethink this program , just doing an extended version of the news broadcast from the website is doomed to fail , they need to go a completely different way . The National Lampoon , which had was the same type of publication as the Onion , did n't try to reproduce their magazine when they did movies which is why they were so successful when they changed genres ( Animal House and Vacation are classics while the original magazine is unknown to anyone under 50 ) .	-1
So many possibilities . But this was n't it . Every single bit of this pilot was OVERTHETOP . There were no sentences spoken - there were `` incredibly clever lines '' delivered at manic speed . When every situation is over-played for its own well deserved hilarity ( in the minds of the persons who wrote the bit ) , it stops being funny and becomes tedious . That and the level of sophistication was teetering between high school and middle school . For instance ? There is no such thing as a nano-millimeter , so the character who had one eye smaller than the other by that amount - lost the intended impact -- presumably aimed at the marketing of appearance of news anchors . If you assume your audience is too stupid to notice , you 've done your audience a disservice . I 'm more inclined to think the writers were too sloppy to check . The whole show was like that , too 'too ' to care . What a waste of all those talented actors.If possible , I wo n't give this thing a single star , it would only give them a false sense of accomplishment.Nope it 's not possible , I had to choose at least one star . Fine , one star for having the chutzpah to put this pilot out there .	-1
Sorry I can not describe it much , could n't watch it for very long . Its just not the show for me .	-1
I get the characters , do n't care for the individual actors . This story concept has been done far too many times .	-1
This is a perfect example of how hard it is to be silly and stupid yet still be brilliantly funny . The movie Airplane pulls off that feat with panache , while by comparison Onion News Empire is left fluttering limply in its wake . Watching this pilot , I could almost hear the conversations in the writers ' room -- where perhaps some of this actually sounded funny -- with each writer trying to top the other , until rising levels of absurdity completely squelched any actual creative dialogue . Having someone say or do something ridiculous is , in and of itself , not humorous . Jeffrey Tambor comes the closest to rising above the meager material , but even his comedic gifts can not save this show from itself . To paraphrase Gertrude Stein , when it comes to this show , `` there 's just no *there* there . ''	-1
This was horrible right from the get go . I love the Onion news , but this just does n't translate the same.Good luck next time .	-1
A few of the jokes were funny , but an entire show like this ? Not for me . I just did n't get the world it 's created .	-1
Was all ready to eat a rib eye steak at the fabulous new restaurant ... .only to find out they only serve vegetarian food . Eh , this show is not for me . It started out ok , but the snippets of humor developed into a desperate reach . It became weird & cheesey . Kinda like when your Grandpa tells jokes at the table on Thanksgiving . You only laugh out of sympathy , but ca n't wait to get the heck outta Dodge ! It moves along at a quick pace , but could n't keep me interested long enough to want more . I wo n't be watching it . Check please !	-1
I found this one a bit wierd . It was hard to grasp how the characters were so hard souled . I still wonder why I watched the whole thing .	-1
This show is just bad ! It does n't even make sense ! I would probably never watch it again as its tacky , rude And annoying ! Tried to give it a real chance and just could n't get through the whole thing in only lasted 15 mins before I had to turn it off ! !	-1
I dislike jokes that slander Christianity . Showing a picture of Jesus on the cross and telling someone to get a closeup of the bulge . If you did anything like that to any other belief system you would be characterized as a bigot and you might even be fired for it . Not so if your bigotry is aimed at Christianity . There is an American Pastor imprisoned in Iran who has been sentenced to 8 years in that prison because he tried to bring a message of love instead of hate to that country . They are torturing him for that . He will probably die in that prison at the hands of his torturers . There are reports that he is bleeding internally from constant beatings but the Iranians wont get him a doctor . So whoever wrote this crap that is supposed to be funny is a Christian bigot . I 'm sure your very proud of yourself .	-1
This show is only funny if you are satisfied with witless , trite humor . I watched it because , with such a good rating , it was bound to be entertaining . I consider it a waste of my time . The writers really went for the low hanging fruit . Truly a letdown . If this is the caliber of humor we might expect from this show , I hope Amazon wo n't pursue it .	-1
Most of the jokes were fake headliners , which maybe only made me laugh once . I did n't like how it was shot either . It 's hard to explain . It has this hand held camera sort of thing going on and a dark and gritty look . It did n't mesh well with the jokes for me . The story was pretty uninspired too . Kind of bland .	-1
A few funny jokes but that 's about it . I do n't think it 's sustainable over the long haul . I 'd watch it if there was n't anything else on , but I would n't go out of my way to see it .	-1
The writing was full of puns that were intended to be funny , but it just came off as corny -- very unpleasant to watch . I tried to force myself to watch an entire episode , but I could n't make it beyond about 15 minutes . I realized that it had n't gotten better by then so chances are that it was n't going to happen by the end .	-1
I love the Onion site but not this tv show . I wanted to like the show but could not it was just not as funny to me . They do a lot more riskier jokes on thier site I think .	-1
There was nothing 'biting ' or 'sharp ' about this . It was so boring I hit the back arrow so I could write this review before I forgot I 'd watched the thing .	-1
The jokes in this show come at you really , really fast , but they start to become tired after a while . I felt like this show was trying to be 30 Rock , but lacks the character it needs to generate better dialogue between the characters . This show , like Alpha House seems to be more concerned with being a satire rather than getting people to care about its characters , or develop an interesting story .	-1
This show is horrible . I love satire , but the writers here seem to think that satire is the same as intentionally offensive . I would say the jokes are bad , but I do n't see them as jokes . You also ca n't call it childish because of the graphic language , which does nothing to make the show better . Bad acting , bad writing , bad behavior , bad show .	-1
As a fan of The Onion I had high hopes for this but it let me down big time . The best part of the whole things was the girl reading the news over the closing credits . Other than that it just seemed like a bunch of scenes spliced together from other `` zany '' comedies.Besides , is n't a spoof of television news completely redundant given that Fox News is already on the air .	-1
Could n't get past the big twine ball kill . Really ? I love satire , but I like it to be subtle and intelligent . I like it to fulfill the purpose of legitimate comment upon the ironies of life . This was just dumb and uninteresting -- a few good one-liners , but they were n't enough to sustain life among the flotsam of over-the-top stupidity .	-1
The people who produced this had an opportunity to make an intelligent , adult satire/comedy . If this is the best they can do it 's time they all made a career change . This is stuff class clowns come up with in high school . I 'm surprised this junk made it this far .	-1
The actors try to use foul language to make up for a generally poor story line . I watched two episodes .	-1
John Goodman played my favorite character of all time , Walter Sobchak , so this pilot caught my attention above some of the others . Unfortunately , it 's not very funny . It just seems to be a lot of `` Are n't Republicans dumb ? Is n't that funny how dumb they are ? '' jokes . I 'm not partisan at all but funny is funny , and this was n't .	-1
I love John Goodman . I just do n't happen to like the style of humor in Alpha House . It strikes me as too obvious , not particularly clever , just does n't make me laugh . But this is just about my taste . I am sure their are millions of other people out there who will like it just fine . Seems well produced , acting is good , etc .	-1
And most of those opportunities were wasted . The actors are good , but the writer ( s ) should have been getting shots in on both parties . Instead it was all shallow hits to one side that was so over the top that it lost me 10 minutes in . I watched the whole thing , but just because I was really needing to fill some time .	-1
This only superficially has any resemblance to the real life experiences in the software industry . This is a very fantastical script . It 's like they did n't use one technical consultant . But , being as betas is produced by Amazon , that is unlikely . So , betas must have been deliberately dumbed-down and hipsterized for some reason . Smells like the writers are trying way way way too hard to be hip and trendy . betas is total fantasy .	-1
A group of extremely stereotypical & # 34 ; nerds & # 34 ; comes up with an idea for a facebook & # 34 ; killer & # 34 ; app , joins a & # 34 ; farm & # 34 ; of other beta products being hosted by an & # 34 ; industry leader & # 34 ; ( Lord help me if I ever run out of quotes ) and there you have it.All about getting the & # 34 ; beta & # 34 ; out the door as a product and the struggle to get it done.You have the classic disheveled outcast that overindulges in things and gets in trouble on twitter , et . al.The Nerd with a bit of business acumen who tries to connect with some sort of female technical reviewerThe female reviewer who is hard as nails , but really is a softie with an oversized libido underneathThe Indian coding genius , who has no social skills and latent / unconsummated homosexual tendencies is going to get thegroup in trouble.The geeky uncoordinated guy , who has the hots for one of the female members of the team.And the elder statesman , who is overseeing all of this.Nothing new there to me , seen it tons of times before and done considerably better ( revenge of the nerds , real genius , hell , even sneakers ) Since I 've had experience ( 30+ some years in the IT industry ) , the boy claims I am a geek/nerd and should love this thing as he sees it as a & # 34 ; heroic portrayal of all people technical & # 34 ; .I view it more as episodic cheap shots that if it were a comedy about minorities , they could n't get away with today .	-1
This is an insult to anyone with half a brain . The excessive foul language IMO shows a total lack of originality on the part of the writers . The second star is because this is not a bad idea , however it is badly executed .	-1
The geeky indian just feels like an Abed knockoff from Community . I did n't care about these people . The wiseass had his moments , particularly in the bathroom talking about his age ( although I would peg the actor as being closer to 45 than 35 in real life ) I liked the ValetMe app idea better than the BRB one . An app to help you find parking spaces would be really helpful .	-1
I checked it out since I 'm a big fan of the Big Bang Theory but I guess I 'm not nerdish enough for this one . I guess I 'll have to pass if it actually ever comes to TV .	-1
Poorly written , terribly acted . Only Jon Daly 's character is remotely amusing but the cringe-worthy & # 34 ; nerd & # 34 ; dialogue written by someone who clearly gets all their nerd info from the internet in 2010 and Big Bang Theory reruns completely overshadows that one bright spot . Terrible .	-1
I just did n't think it was very funny . The writing was n't bad , just some of the acting left something to be desired .	-1
I like the concept but the show is filled with totally unlikable characters . The humor is all based on uncomfortably weird characters ... there can definitely be quirky , likable characters in a show but these are n't them . I understand this is supposed to be a comedy for `` mature '' audiences but there are plenty of mature individuals who get tired of F-bomb laced dialogue .	-1
This show is insulting to anyone who knows more than 5 words about computer science and pop culture . I wanted to like it , the premise was interesting , the characters were tolerable , but the writing was bludgeoning . The stuff they say is so poorly written I could n't get further than half way through the second episode . It 's so glaringly obvious that the writers have no freaking idea what lingo people in the industry use or care to do 30 seconds of research to check . I lost it and gave up on the show when one of the 'tech savvy ' girl characters wants to start taking bets and while holding a piece of yellow coin shaped plastic says 'I got a BitCoin on Bollywood ' . BitCoins are not actual coins , for anyone wondering , and if you spend more than 3 hours on the internet you would know that . This show is somehow more of an insult to nerd culture than Big Bang Theory .	-1
This show felt like it was trying to be a lot of different things , yet succeeded at none of them . It was never quite funny or entertaining to me . I liked the one actor from a previous episode of Workaholics , but the cast just never clicked for me . There are funnier alternatives to Betas out now that deal with the same technology world .	-1
