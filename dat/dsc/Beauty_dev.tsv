This product has such a pretty effect on your lips ! The color is soft and natural , really just a hint of the color with one quick application -- and the shine is to die for ! You can also put on extra layers to intensify the effect of the color . The good news is that it is not all gloppy like some glosses can be , even the expensive ones . So , for a drug store price , CoverGirl Lipperfection Jumbo Gloss Balm Blush Twist is a super good choice . However , please do a little checking around at the shops to see who has a fair price.I would definitely recommend this to a friend !	1
My favorite & # 34 ; lipstick & # 34 ; now . Feels good on my lips and keeps them moist . The colors are great . I prefer the non-frosted variety of any lip product .	1
The color of Mauve Twist is a great everyday & # 34 ; better than your natural lips & # 34 ; color . I wear this everyday to school as it is moisturizing and the shade is natural yet pretty . To get the best color payoff , apply over lips in multiple layers . Also make sure to not twist up the balm too far up , as it can easily break . That is the only frustrating thing about this product , the packaging could have been better at keeping the product in tact .	1
I have this in shade 230/berry twist . I love everything about the color , texture , and moisturizing properties . It also has the benefit of being paraben free , not to mention slightly cheaper than Revlon 's version . I want more colors !	1
I picked this up in Target on a whim , and was surprised by how much I love it after using it for two days . The color is sheer with just enough pigmentation to produce a very natural shade on your lips . I have a shade that is n't featured online at Amazon or most other retailers for some reason , but if anyone comes across it , it 's called Cupcake Twist and it 's a beautiful , natural coral-pink . It definitely produces enough shine and is not sticky at ALL . I feel like I 'm wearing plain old lip balm ! I noticed how moisturizing it was before even finding out about the great ingredients ( shea , mango , etc ) and I love how it does n't stain your lips with its color .	1
I hve tried just about every stick style `` gloss '' , `` balm '' and `` stain '' out there and was never very impressed . I decided to buy this on a whim and try it out . WOW ! ! This is the best stick I have ever tried . It is super easy to apply . It goes on smoothly and evenly . I did not even need to use any lipliner , it just went on that precisely . I have seen other reviews of this product where people have complained of it being broken straight out the package . I did not have that problem . The formula to me seemed like a even cross between a gloss and a lipstick . My lips felt very moisturized and had a nice shine . I really liked that there was no stickiness at all . I can not speak for every color as I only purchased two . I bought scarlet twist and ballet twist . Both had quite a nice color payoff in my opinion . Scarlet twist is a very bright color that seems to me to be a little bit on the orangey side . Ballet twist is a nude frosted color that has lots of gold shimmer in it . It was a pretty color , but for me personally I felt that it just washed me out a little bit ( I have super fair skin ) . I left this product on for a while to test it out and it seemed like it will stay on pretty good . I think I did n't make the greatest choices colorwise , but the since the application and formula are so good I think I am gon na pick these up in a few different colors ( there are lots of colors in the line to choose from so one of them has to be a keeper ! ! ) .ADDENDUM : Since writing this review I purchased two more colors : Rose twist and Jam twist . From the caps I was expecting something different colorwise . Both caps have a little shimmer in them and seem a little metallic but both glosses were had no shimmer in them whatsoever . The cap for Jam twist is very dark and so that was what I was expecting a deep dark plum color . It was not . It was a very bright much lighter shade in actuality . The Rose twist was also lighter than the cap indicated but to a lesser degree than the Jam twist . So basically I think it is a dice roll as to what the color inside actually is . I still like the the actual product I just wish the color was more accurate .	1
Nice color !	1
i got the satin and spice which has a bit of an orange tint to it which i do n't like so i have to make sure i dont put on too much other wise it will look weird .	1
Just great , great coverage , and color . It has to be good if Queen puts her name and face on it .	1
I really liked this item . I need a light color and Twinkling Toffee was the lightest offered . It was not sticky like a lot of gloss balm.For myself I would buy it again , just wish they had ore light colors .	1
This is a really nice mascara that defines the lashes and does n't clump . ( At least I have not had that problem ) !	1
I 've tried many brands of mascara , both expensive and cheap , over the years . I just adore this stuff ! It does n't clump , flake , or smudge . It combs out perfectly and truly makes my lashes appear longer . I apply this after setting my makeup withSkindinavia Makeup Finishing Spray , 2 Ounce , so that I do n't lose the curl after crimping . After putting a coat of this on for length , I then apply several coats ofCovergirl Lashblast Fusion Water Resistant Mascara Very Black 885 , 0.44-Ounce . These two work beautifully together , and I 've even been asked if I was wearing fake lashes . I believe the tools you use can make all the difference , so immediately after I 've applied my mascara , I 'll comb through my lashes withTweezerman Folding Lash Comb . My lashes turn out perfectly every time . *Note : if you do use this type of *needle* comb for your lashes , you must be extremely careful not to poke your eye out .	1
After years of buying a $ 25 a tube mascara , I 'm going back to Covergirl . This mascara is pretty great . The wand has very stiff ridges that comb through your lashes as you apply it . It 's basically impossible to clump . It also gave my lashes great lift without having to use an eyelash curler , and even by the end of the day , my lashes were still lifted ... that never happens . The formula is thin , so if your looking for crazy volume , this is n't going to deliver . But for extreme definition and lift , this mascara is fantastic .	1
Something was just off about my appearance when I was using Very Black ( or whatever the darkest black shade is ) . I 'm Asian and my hair is a very dark brown with a reddish warm hue , so even though subtle , the blackest black shades just looked a bit artificial . This Black Brown shade is amazing . I love that my makeup looks softer , more natural , and without any clumps in sight - are they natural ? Is she wearing mascara ? I love it . The brush is just perfect , too - very rarely make mistakes and I manage to get every hair I want to . Sometimes reaching the hairs near the corners can be frustrating with other types of brushes , but this gets every one , and I do n't end up with clumps in the process !	1
I am a mascara junkie so me rating this as my second favorite is a pretty big deal . First of all I love the bright green packaging totally cute . I have this in very black in water resistant . I love the shape of the wand because it makes it easy to get every eyelash on your eye . You can get the outer corner and the inner corner with ease . Also if you flip the brush upside down it is perfect for your bottom lashes . This mascara does n't clump , smear , run , or anything bad . This is my go to mascara !	1
I 've been using this mascara the past week or so , and the nice thing is that it has not clumped , so that is great . But it does n't seem to volumize my lashes at all . It also seems just a little sticky to me . When I put it on , I often have to use my finger tips to separate some of my lashes that stick together as I am applying it . That is always a pet peeve of mine when it comes to mascara , so for that , I just ca n't give it five stars . But it is not clumping , they are true to their word about that point . I am still looking for an inexpensive mascara that does n't make lashes stick together , clump , or run if your eyes water a little , and that can add a little volume and length .	1
I 've spent my entire life looking for a mascara like this ! I have thick , medium-length lashes , so I need a bit of a boost in the length department without insane , clumpy thickening . Every mascara I 've tried that claims to define lashes without clumping has ended in one thing : clumping . I wind up having to go through my lashes with a metal eyelash comb in order to avoid looking like a drag queen . I 've tried so , so , SO many mascaras ( I ca n't even guess how many ) , from high-end lines to drugstore brands , with no real luck . But the second I put on this mascara , I realized it was time to dump every other tube in my collection . If they discontinue this line , I 'll be heartbroken , because I already know this is my mascara holy grail.Update 4/24/13 : I still love this mascara , but I have discovered that you ca n't sleep with it on . Whenever I do , I wake up with black smudges under my eyes . Yes , I know I should n't sleep in mascara -- I 'm not reducing my rating based on this , but merely pointing it out since I used to sleep inCoverGirl Lash Exact Mascara : Black Brown # 910all the time with no problem . That being said , it 's still my favorite mascara ! !	1
As a regular fan of original lash blast , this one is an absolute winner ! Brush is great for fanning out lashes and does exactly what it claims , builds non-clumpy volume ! It even helps elongate lashes which is definitely a major plus ! This is just an all around great mascara !	1
I have started using this more and more as my drugstore Mascara for me and people I do makeup on . I did notice some flakes but no more than other popular choices . I am still debating on if I will start using this overCovergirl Lashblast Fusion Water Resistant Mascara Very Black 885 , 0.44-Ouncewhich is currently my favorite drugstore mascara . I am big on waterproof the fusion lasts better and gives a bit more volume and is water resistant , which is not up to my holy grail mascaraBenefit Cosmetics BADgal Lash Mascarabut does add a bit more staying power . clump crusher will stay well , but do n't get caught in the rain . Over all I think this mascara is a excellent choice for people who have sensitive eyes like my ex who can not use waterproof mascara 's . Definitely worth a serious look and consideration .	1
This is a great mascara , and gives a very natural look . The mascara goes on thin and the brush definitely does not produce clumps . It does not give a bold or thick look ( not much volume ) , but it gives a nice , moderate curl and looks very natural . Great for everyday wear , but maybe use something more exciting for a night-out look .	1
As promised , absolutely no clumps . Goes on easily and quickly . Stays on all day with no flaking or smudging . I 've tried many kinds of mascara , and have been sticking with this one for awhile now .	1
It does n't clump , the brush is slightly arched for great application , and easy to take off with simple make up remover wipes . It makes my lashes look longer and thicker but still natural . Highly recommended !	1
This mascara is billed as a no clump product , and I have found that to be true . The brush allows the mascara to be applied lightly . I consider this the perfect casual or office mascara , as it gives lashes some definition without an overdone look . This is not the one to use , though , for a night out when you want a really `` heavy '' lash look . Recommended .	1
I absolutely love this mascara . It 's true - no clumps ! - just full , gorgeous lashes . I highly recommend this to any mascara-lover who is sick and tired of clumpy , awful mascara . This one truly lives up to its title . Great mascara .	1
Love that this has a curved brush and does n't clump . My favorite inexpensive mascara for daily use . I use the regular ( not waterproof ) and even through working out , it stays on and does n't run . ( yes , I will wear mascara to work out if I go directly after work ... ) : - ) Great product . Better than the CoverGirl in the orange tube .	1
Goes on easy , seems to catch most eyelashes . Does tend to crumble after about 9 hours , but other than that , just as expected . Two coats needed . Those that have the white primer are great , but sometimes white is leftover , ugh .	1
First , I ordered black and was sent brown . I tried it for a day anyway just to see if the product holds up to its claims . It 's a pretty good mascara but tends to flake , which I do n't like . I do like the brush but am not sure if I will reorder in black . I 'm on the hunt for the perfect mascara - one that does n't leave smudges or flake or dry out fast - but so far have n't found it .	1
I have a difficult time with mascara clumping and find the look so awful that I often go without . So far this is not clumping and also seems to stay on very well . No specs in the eye or ugly smear underneath . This will make me use mascara more frequently and look for this product in the store next time I shop .	1
Works extremely well ! Love my lashes after using this ! It is rather difficult for me to put on my bottom lashes ( the brush hits my skin ) but nothing a q-tip ca n't take care of ! Great product !	1
This is a good mascara , easy to apply , stays on , it does n't crumple or smear , but at the same time , it does n't have any overly impressive effects and I 'm looking forward to try something else once I 'm done with it .	1
I was a devoted fan of Covergirl 's Lashblast Volume ( in the orange tube ) as it gave my lashes the fullest look for the best price , but I always had issues with a coating of flakes beneath my eyes before the day was even up ! I decided to give this a go based on the other positive reviews ( it 's the highest reviewed drugstore mascara I 've seen on Amazon ) and it was worth every penny ! ! It gives my eyelashes lots of length and volume and to my complete amazement ... NO FLAKES ! HALLELUJAH ! After years of searching , I 've found my mascara soulmate !	1
The product does exactly what it says ... you 'll get volume without your eyelashes clumping together , and the enjoy the added benefit that your mascara wo n't flake off or smudge during the day . It is n't waterproof for those who prefer waterproof mascara ; it does come off very easily when washing your face . I actually like this better than a few of the higher priced brands , but must state that I do n't wear contacts , so am not sure how it would work for those who do . It has n't seemed to dry out my lashes ( causing breakage ) as some mascaras have . It 's a basic , budget-friendly mascara that does n't go on in globs and seems to hold up well throughout the day .	1
I had previously been using CoverGirl Lash Exact for my first coat ; then Maybelline Falsies for the second coat . It was kind of a pain using two different mascaras , but I liked features of both of them - the plastic brush of Lash Exact and the curve of Falsies . Then I found this one - plastic brush and curve all in one mascara . I also like that it 's not a super skinny curved brush , but a little more substantial . I think Clump Crusher is kind of a stupid name , but this is fantastic for maximizing the length of my lashes .	1
Love this mascara . It lengthens my lashes and does n't clump them together . My favorite mascara that I 've tried so far !	1
This is definitely one of the better mascaras I 've tried in a long time . It goes on smooth , so clumps are pretty hard to get ( unless maybe you put on more than two thick coats ) and it adds volume to the lashes . Although it 's not waterproof , I wore it out in the snow/rain much of the day and in the evening there was n't a single smudge . That never happened with the other mascara I used . The mascara removed easily with a regular eye make up remover . I have sensitive eyes and many mascaras cause my eyes to become itchy or they dry out my lashes . I did n't have either of those problems with this mascara . So far , this one 's a winner. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -UPDATE 2/25/13 : After using this mascara a few months now , I still like it , but I 've changed my rating to 4 stars instead of 5 because although there are n't really any clumps , it tends to flake a little or smudge later in the day .	1
I bought Cover Girl Clump Crusher mascara last week , after seeing a recommendation in `` Vogue '' magazine . The model used in their photoshoot had gorgeous eyelashes , and I 'm pleased to see that this mascara really delivers ! ! You 'll get your own runway-worthy eyes with the long , thickly emphasized lashes this product delivers.I 've tried a number of other mascara products , and this one is my favorite by far . I 've also got sensitive eyes and skin , and need cosmetics that do n't cause an allergic reaction . This is a gentle formula and I 've experienced no flaking , so contact lens wearers do n't need to worry.It does n't smear much even if you have to rub your eyes , and washes off easily at the end of the day.I also enjoy Million Lashes by L'Oreal , but Clump Crusher beats it . The price was a little lower than L'oreal here as well . Try it and love it !	1
This mascara 's curved applicator does ensure non-clumping and I really like the way it looks . I will be buying again .	1
Another find from Allure Magazine , I was tired of trying brand after brand of mascara only to find that it , too , was prone to clumping . The brush is the key and it works beautifully .	1
I dont need expensive mascara ... .I love this Cover Girl Mascara ... .I have tried all them in the 59 years I have been here ... .this one is the best for the money	1
I really like this mascara by Covergirl . It is a good , low-price mascara for daytime wear . However , this mascara is NOT going to be a plumper ... it is a good basic mascara for length . I have n't had any issues with clumping or with smudging with this mascara .	1
This has become my HG mascara . I love the original Covergirl Lashblast in the orange tube but was n't a huge fan of the large wand since I have small eyes and lashes , so I decided to try this one for the wand alone . They do n't lie when they say it does n't clump . I 'm one of those people that puts coat upon coat on to bulk up and darken my light , thin lashes and this one does n't clump no matter how many times I coat ( provided I do n't let coats dry in between , but that 's just common sense that you do n't do that ) . I have n't had any problems with smudging on my eyelids or underneath my eyes despite getting the regular formula . I like that the brush is n't some gimmick-y contraption like alot of the wands being introduced lately . It 's a sturdy brush that 's slightly curved and fits the curve of the lashline to get all of the lashes easily , even the hard to get inside ones . I 'll no doubt keep trying other mascaras because I ca n't help myself and i 'm a sucker for clever marketing , but I will always have a tube of this on-hand in addition to any other ones I try . I hope they do n't discontinue it anytime soon . That seems to happen with anything I really love .	1
I give it a 4 star rating because goes on smoothly but it does n't make my lashes look as long as I 'd like them to be .	1
I have very puny lashes and this mascara made my lashes look thick and amazing ! So just imagine how much it would enhance thicker fuller lashes . I consider this mascara a 'must-have ' from now on and will not be without it .	1
Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara delivers just what it promises -- there are no gross clumps in the finished look.You can go from daytime to a more dramatic look by layering the mascara on , and there are truly no clumps . Good thing for me , since I usually love to wear lots of mascara but hate those little globs you have to slowly remove with a cotton swab . Especially when you consider the price , this is a really good mascara that delivers just what Cover Girl promises.I will purchase this again , and certainly would recommend it to a friend .	1
Aging baby boomers , my wife and I do n't get out as much as we once did , but we do still go out occasionally . My wife has always used very light makeup , but she still uses mascara to highlight her eyes and long lashes . When she developed a slight tremble in her hands a couple of years ago , she was concerned about applying mascara for fear of injuring her eyes , so I volunteered to apply it . Surprisingly , she accepted my offer . One of her biggest gripes about mascara is its tendency to clump and look messy , so she was glad to try Clump Crusher.The product comes in a sealed bottle with a separate brush that you can see through the packaging . The brush is slightly curved at the applicator end , which has dozens of very fine bristles about 1.5 mm long . The round brush 's handle is about 0.9 '' in diameter , which makes it easy to hold . That 's the obvious stuff.In use , we both appreciated how the fine bristles separated and coated her lashes evenly with no noticeable clumping . I applied one coat of the mascara to both her eyes around noon yesterday , then we left the house for about seven hours to deliver Christmas presents and have dinner at a restaurant . When we returned , we both examined her eyes and found no smudging or flaking , even with a few tears shed at one stop . Later that evening , my wife removed the mascara with a washcloth and warm soapy water . It removed fairly easily with no visible traces left.Overall , the Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara appears to be a fine product that works as advertised . My wife is sold on the product .	1
This is my second favorite mascara after max factor 2000 . As the product says , you get no clumps , and I like the fact that it comes in brown shades . While this lasts on your eyes longer than max factor , it 's not as build-able , so you get less dramatic eyelashes . If you are just looking for a little emphasis and no-fuss mascara ( for work for example ) , but do n't need super big lashes , this would be a good product for you .	1
It is a good product . Great for lengthening lashes . So much so that I get mascara on my brow bone when I blink after application . It does n't clump even when applying second coat , but does n't thicken lashes any way . They just get longer .	1
Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara is designed to give you the ideal length of a good mascara without the clumping , and that is exactly what it does , according to my 17 year old daughter . She wears mascara not for increasing apparent length but for `` definition '' and she was pleasently surprised at how well this product worked , and how many compliments she received . This is a very versatile and satisfying product .	1
This works great . The color is good and my lashes are never clumpy or sticky . With a lot of mascaras they run into my eyes and bother me all day . I never have a problem with this one . Great for a night out or for work .	1
I have a real problem with raccoon eyes after hours of wearing mascara , even with powder under my eyes . Cover Girl has always been better than the rest . I used to use the orange one , now I 'm hooked on this one . Goes on nicely even with one coat . Washes off easily with cleanser and water , which is important for me with my contact lenses .	1
Everyone 's got a clump-free mascara these days , but most do n't live up to their advertising . This one actually does . The well-designed brush has a curve that allows easy swiping of both upper and lower lashes without a single eye-poke . That 's key . Many makers have tried brush shapes that , while they apply a lot of product , sometimes without clumps and sometimes with just a few small ones , there 's either a poke factor or an angulation that 's hard for even the most deft to achieve , let along arthritic older types like me . This is easy , the product covers nicely with little effort , and there are no gyrations involved in application . Until something better comes along , I 'll call this the Best of Show .	1
I 've always had a problem with mascara clumping . A trick I learned from a makeup artist is to very gently roll the wand in a tissue before applying ; it works . This mascara is really good at NOT clumping right out of the bottle . However , it does n't seem to build & lengthen my lashes as much as my L'Oreal Voluminous mascara . I needed to apply 2 coats to get my lashes thick looking ( like the L'Oreal does in one coat ) and after doing that , my lashes were mostly uncurled . I 've always felt that the CoverGirl mascaras are too wet/thin . They tend to make my eyelashes `` uncurl '' /straighten out after curling & applying the mascara . This new formula is better than others but still uncurls.The positive part is this mascara did not clump even with 2 coats . But , my nicely curled lashes were no longer very curled . It does wear well ; minimal flaking & no smudge after a long day . So I guess if you prefer minimal thickening/lengthening of your eyelashes , this would be a good product for you . I 'm not sure I 'll keep using it because I prefer a thicker looking lash but it is a good mascara & worth a try if you 've had problems with clumping .	1
Okay , I 've been wearing this for 2 days now and I am loving it . I have 5 different mascara 's bc I wear mascara a lot but not too much other make up . This one so far is my favorite.Here 's why:1 . It 's cheap ( almost always my # 1 reason ha ha ) 2 . It goes on smoothly with little to no clumping3 . It 's dark ( love the black brown ) 4 . The color of the tube is cute - green ! There is not much to like about this product . I 'm glad I bought it.My 2nd favorite is NYX Doll Eye Mascara !	1
This truly does crush clumps . The wand is curved , with a thinner inner side , to lay down product , and a fatter outer edge that can comb and separate lashes , not that they needed it . I got the results that would normally require a lash comb.Unlike the other fat wand CG mascaras , I also did n't poke myself in the eye trying to reach the base of my lashes . No flaking all day and my lashes are as soft as if I were not wearing mascara . A great product , and I find other mascaras to be a compromise . Good stuff , !	1
The following review is based on my wife 's use of the product : I 've been using this product for a couple weeks and love it . It goes on very smoothly and evenly with no clumps at all . My lashes are evenly coated and clearly separated every time . It stays on all day but comes off cleanly with my makeup remover . I was sent brown instead of my usual color black . I was impressed by the way the brown looked . Dark enough for my taste but still clearly brown . My only criticism is minor- the handle is wider than most other mascara 's . It makes it feel a bit awkward in my small hand but ultimately I think it helps me apply the mascara better .	1
I liked this mascara a lot . It lets me build length without a bunch of clumps . The only bad thing is that it is tough to get off . I use facial cleanser at night , wash my face again in the shower in the morning , and still have a little residue from it under my eyes that I remove with a damp cotton swab .	1
I tend to have a terrible time with mascara . It either smears , clumps , gives me raccoon eyes , stings , or just does n't do much . But this product lives up to the claims . It gave tremendous volume , and good length- with only one coat ! It goes on clump free , does n't make my eyes itch , and stays put all day . I was out in the wet for hours today , and there was not a trace of raccoon eye ; yet it removes easily with soap and water.I have not tried it when wearing foundation , and it 's been pretty cold , so I do n't know how it 'll do with oily skin/foundation , but I 'm really hoping it holds up to that because this just became my new favorite mascara . The only complaint I have is the giant container , but I realize it probably has to be large to hold the curved brush .	1
So ... we have a lot of different mascaras but you buy the one you believe will help you achieve the looks you want . With this mascara specifically you get a lot of presicion , and coming from me thats a lot to say ( always need to rescue my makeup with Q-tips because I simply ca n't apply the mascara without a mess cuz my hands shake a lot ) , I couldnt believe how easy was to apply it on my lower eye lashes and no clumps either , cant say is the best one I 've ever used but its pretty good ... . The bad part about this type of brush is you can not roll it over into your eyelashes but I guess this one makes it up .	1
While I occasionally splurge on Buxom Lash mascara , my tried and true mascaras seem to be the newer series of Cover Girl ones that have come out in the last few years orAlmay One Coat Get Up and Grow Mascara , Black , 0.21-Ounce . While some folks hate the large brush and tube of these newer ones , I do n't mind them , and I love the new bristle brushes that coat without leaving clumps . I 've already had good luck using the regular Lash Blast ( the one in the orange tube ) , but I thought I 'd try this new one to see how it works . I really like it , and it really does leave zero clumps ! The curved brush on this also does a nice job of adding a gentle curl to your lashes . The non-waterproof formula stays put , even when my allergies are acting up and my eyes are teary.I bought this in the Very Black color , and it 's still natural-looking.Like all Cover Girl mascaras , this also comes off easily , with just some eye makeup remover or face wash and water . You do n't have to tug or pull at your eyes.It 's a keeper !	1
I 've been using this for the past 2 days and am very happy with the results.The color is evenly distributed by the brush so that when I use my lash curler they look very full with none of those annoying globs of mascara you have to pull off or smooth away . My only complaint is that I wish the applicator was a little thinner for better control . I have small fingers ( like a lot of women ) and it 's kind of a pain using the brush on the bottom row of lashes.The color is a true black and I have n't had to do any touch-ups since I applied it 10 hours ago , and my lashes still look great.UPDATE : 1/30/13I just had to update my original review to 5 stars after using it for over 3 weeks.The brush separates my lashes each and every day without any clogging , clumping or flaking . I 've used other brands that have cost less and some that have cost 4 times as much and have never had such consistant and exceptional results . I keep waiting for it to fail but it never disappoints.As someone who has always used an eyelash curler , I 'm used to having to feather my lashes each time I curl them - but not with this mascara . Not once . I put it on , use my curler and I 'm done . And they look fabulous ! And as for my original complaint about the applicator being to thick - forgive me for being an idiot . Who cares about a little inconvenience for brief minutes when the results are outstanding and last for hours . Not me anymore .	1
It was time to try a new mascara , because the `` lengthening formula '' I 'd been using ( L'Oreal Telescopic Lengthening Mascara ) clumped terribly , almost gluing my lashes together . ( Uni-lash is not a good look ! ) I 'm so glad I tried Covergirl Clump Crusher Mascara . I LOVE it , because it adds a ton of lush , natural looking volume , has an intense black color , and it DOES NOT CLUMP.It also stays on all day without smudging , and is very easy to remove ( I use a basic foaming face-wash product which is safe for use around the eyes ) .I 'll purchase this product again , because it is the only mascara I 've tried that is truly clump-free .	1
This mascara separates the lashes well , but it 's very stiff going on and hurts my lashes and eyelids when I apply it . I even put a little saline in it to try to soften up the formula a little ( pinterest trick ! ) , but it did n't seem to help much . It gives good definition , but I would n't want to use it everyday .	1
I 'm a fan of Cover Girl products because they work well and are n't overly expensive . This mascara does n't disappoint - it goes on smoothly with the brush and does n't clump on my lashes . I like that it colors and defines my lashes without thickening them too much , since I 'm a little too old to pull off a dramatic super-huge-eyelash look.This mascara stays on all day without flaking or ending up smeared under my eyes , and it washes off easily with soap and water or cold cream.My only complaint is the odd shape of the container . It 's small on one end and top heavy so it wants to fall over , and angled at the other end so it ca n't stand on that end either . And it 's too fat in diameter to fit in the openings of my makeup case . I do like the bright green color , since that makes it easy to find in a purse .	1
I have tried a lot of mascaras , but the Clump Crusher is one of the best ! It separates my lashes beautifully and distributes lots of colour with no clumping . I bought it in brown/black . I will definitely repurchase !	1
This is a mascara that I will purchase again . I loved the curved brush , it seperated all my lashes and reached every single one . The color is very black but I did not think it was too dark at all ( I have fair skin and dark blonde hair ) . It stayed on all day and did not smudge which is always a good thing when it comes to mascara ! I do n't think it gave my lashes 200 % more volume though , which is why I am giving it four stars instead of five .	1
I 've tried the plastic brushes before and did n't like them . For some reason this one is different . Easy to use and get to those lashes in the corner.Depending on what you want will make or break this review . I was using the 'Falsies ' and was happy with the product , but this one was a bit different . Does n't seem to add a lot of length , but it does separate quite well and I 'm finding I like the look . I do use 3-4 applications while it 's still wet and it gives a bit of a spikey look.I also find it does not wash off easily , but that could be my choice in removers.I will , at least for a while , be using this product again.Thank you.MEF	1
I do n't always wear mascara . Only during special occasions or during date nights with bf . Bf wants a natural look so I have to find a mascara that enhances but is not so obvious . This one can open up my eyes and does n't smudge . Gives an enhanced look that my bf likes since I do n't have the effort-investing look	1
I 've used Covergirl products for years . I 'm pleased with this mascara . It really is a Clump Crusher ! There 's nothing worse than clumps of mascara joining 2 or 3 lashes together . The curved , plastic brush is easy to use and keeps lashes defined . My eyes look great behind my glasses . I recommend Covergirl Clump Crusher.It 's not just for girls - I have n't been a girl for decades but still like to use natural looking eye makeup . I think it 's almost more important as I 've gotten older so I do n't look faded or cranky.Well done Covergirl .	1
This mascara is in an easy to see , green container . The product does not clump as stated from my several days of wearing this . It goes on really well , not too thick or thin . The brush does a good job of getting my lashes evenly coated . The one flaw is that after a few hours of wear , if I accidentally touch my lashes , the black mascara starts to flake off my lashes . I 'm not talking about rubbing my eyes or anything fierce , but just touching my lashes -- black flakes . It 's not horrendous , mind you , but still annoying as I expect my mascara to stay on even if I touch my eyes a little bit . But still , I do like that it does n't clump , looks greats on my eyes , and is in a cute little green container ( as opposed to a black one which is hard to find in my makeup bag ) .	1
I 'm super picky about my mascara and have used the same brand forever but after trying this it is now my new fave ! The brush is really good not your typical super bristly kind . It does n't clump at all and gives you long pretty lashes that last and do not crumble . Like this stuff is so good I 'm telling everyone .	1
I 'm very impressed with Clump Crusher ... it 's probably the best Cover Girl mascara I 've ever tried . It definitely gives me great volume , without flaking or clumping at all . I like a more dramatic eye , and I need at least three coats of this mascara to do the job , but my eyes look great after three coats , and again , no clumps . Love it , especially for the price !	1
This mascara does as it describes . There are no clumps no matter how many times you apply it . Volume starts at about 3-4 strokes , the wand brush has many teeth to help seperate . Wears nicely with no flakes and easy to remove.Highly recommend ! Update 2-26-13 ... Have noticed lately very small clumps have appeared but are easily removed . I still love this product .	1
nice brush , nice shape , nice mascara ... not much of a legnthener but great at making your lashes thick without clumping ! ! !	1
I really like this mascara ! I HATE clumps and I have long lashes but I like them thicker . This lets me use a few coats to get the thickness I want without the creepy clumpy spider leg lash look .	1
I like all of Covergirl 's Lashblast line . I have used many brands of mascara in all price ranges and I prefer these . I love mascara and use it daily and this brand is my go to . I also use the Lashblast Volume ( Orange tube ) and love it . The wand is nice and the mascara lasts all day . It is not clump-free , but it is less clumpy than most mascara .	1
After I used the product , I went on Amazon 's site to order the mascara for my daughter and some friends . I was more than pleasantly surprised that if I purchased it through Amazon , the price was ultra reasonable at $ 6.00+ . I have used all types of mascaras and for the money , this is really worth it . I have tried it for a few days , and it does NOT clump or smear below or above my eyes . I can not tell you how many expensive mascaras I have used only to be told , `` you have some black stuff on your face and in your eyebrows ! `` Since my eyes tear , I expected some runny marks , but there were none . The mascara separates the lashes but it does not add volume , so do n't expect a fuller lash look.I must admit I was skeptical because of the packaging . It comes in the hard-to-open bubble wrap , or whatever it is called , which takes a scissors and patience to open . It cheapens the product . The casing is also tinny ; Covergirl did not put the money into the quality of the tube but I like the green color , I will always find it in my purse ! The wand can be used for different strokes to apply or replenish the product . For the money , Covergirl is providing the consumer with a quality cosmetic .	1
Sometimes I skip foundation , sometimes I skip eye shadow ... I NEVER skip the mascara . It 's the one item of make up I truly care about wearing . ( Well , that and lip gloss . Anyway ... ) This mascara is amazing . Though I have n't tested it in the rain- I CAN say that it is long lasting . I worked a 14 hour day and was too exhausted to take off my make up before hitting the sack , when I woke up in the morning my mascara still looked great . I have n't tested it in the rain yet , buttt it comes off very easily with some generic make up remover I have . ( The easier it comes off , the better , for me . ) This mascara does not clump . I love it . My eyelashes look long and silky- they do n't look like gross spider legs with this stuff . No flakes , no smudges . Highly recommend this one !	1
Exactly as advertised . Wonderful , no clumps . My daughter loves it and she tries all kinds of make-up . Will buy again .	1
It 's nothing amazing but it does the trick for everyday mascara . I might buy it again because it 's fairly cheap .	1
This is not the best Mascara ever . Just so you know , the best is the basic mascara made by ColoreScience . It 's perfect . You get long , long lashes , no clumping , the wand is so good you should never throw it away . Just clean it with rubbing alcohol every now and then and use it instead of whatever wand you find inside any other mascara you are using , which you should n't be . ColoreScience is the best . But boy , does this come close.I do n't want too much `` volume . '' How thick should your eyelash be before you start looking like Tammy Faye Baker . We want length and color . If your lashes are so sparse you look like Minnie Mouse , buy artificial lashes or , even better , get them individually applied by a make up artist for special occasions . But do n't clunk up your lashes so they look gummy . This gives the right amount of lengthening and thickening , even if you put it on with a heavy hand.CoverGirl Clump Crusher goes on easily . To challenge their `` no clumping '' claim , I slathered on four coats . Two coats of mascara should be the limit . Three ... you 're pushing it . Four ... get your diploma , you are a Clown College Graduate . But even four layers did n't make my lashes stumpy or weird . They were starting to look overdone , so I stopped there . If you wait a few minutes and let the mascara dry , you can use your lash curler ... even a heated one , without creating a mess . YOu get a little flaking and flecking , but not too bad . Still , it 's always better to do the curling first . I like the brush , it has an interesting angle and the bristles sweep away a lot of excess product when you brush it on . The curve follows the curve of the eye , so one stroke goes from one end of the lid to the other . Straight brushes can be tricky because they reach only a portion of the lashes . When you go back to do the middle and other end , some lashes end up with too little , some too much mascara.By the way , I got a great tip from a make up artist : If you use eyeliner on the inner eyelids , your eyes look smaller and harder . Instead , use white or very light blue . It makes your eyes open up and look bigger and younger . Use it on the inner lids top and bottom . Also nothing gets rid of eyebags ( I do n't mean temporary puffiness from staying up late or partying , but real undereye suitcases ) , so save your money for the surgery . BUT caffeine does temporarily provide a little bit of shrinkage . Soak cotton balls in cold coffee left from breakfast and place on the bags , lean back and relax for 20 minutes . It should make a difference . I have also heard that Preparation H works , but I believe the formula has been changed . Perhaps we should be checking out the hemmerhoid cream reviews ! Thanks for your patience . I think this mascara is a good deal , easy to use whether you use make up often or only occasionally , and is fairly foolproof .	1
Before purchasing this product for myself , I asked myself if I needed another mascara . With the plethora of drugstore mascaras , there are certainly plenty of & # 34 ; fails & # 34 ; . I did some simple research before I bought , so I will share them with you along with my own experience.I did n't compare ingredients or anything like that , but simply abused the power of Google and YouTube , and searched through countless reviews . You might think that 's a lot of work put into a mascara , but hey , that 's just how women shop , right ? Anyway , I found that it was very well liked among all the people who tried it . It 's even sold in Costco in a 3 pack ! My experience is that this formula is drier than those of say , Loreal Voluminous Carbon Black . The bristles are rubber and rather short , but a good amount of them . They can get product gooped on it , but just make sure you scrape some off on the rim before applying . It really does n't clump very easily . Of course , any mascara can clump , but this one is really nice about being hard to . It definitely builds volume , and I 'd say about 150 % ( not 200 % as packaging says ) . If you have thin lashes , this will emphasize lashes by darkness ( I bought Very Black ) and slight thickness . Length-wise , this is only decent . Not crazy like some other Covergirl or Maybelline , or Loreal mascaras can be , but WITHOUT CLUMPS ! Application tip : The wand is curved , so I 'll call it concave and convex for the the respective side of the wand . The convex side ( bulging out ? ) is great for lengthening , and the concave is fantastic for bottom lashes . Use the convex on your upper lashes to define them easily , and the concave on the bottom , for a great smudgeless application of the shorter bottom lashes . Try it ! Personally , I 'd rather take no clumps and fast application over high volume and lengthened spider lashes . That 's just personal preference .	1
This mascara is amazing ! ! ! I have long , blonde eyelashes & this make them look even longer , curls them & makes them look thick all while separating them & really does n't leave any clumps ! ! I absolutely recommend this mascara if you 're not into the clumpy eyelash look . You can use 1 or 2 coats to make them look natural & 3-5 coats to make them look thicker & blacker . Love this mascara ! ! & # 60 ; 3I used to use the Maybelline falsies nascar which is terrible compared to this mascara . You will really love this wand & # 8230 ;	1
Speaking as one of the 11 % of Scotland ( and their descendants ) that has red hair , I 'm convinced we have our own type of contact dermatitis . I ca n't wear a lot of commercially produced eye makeup -- only NYX Doll Eyes and this wo n't leave me with itchy , runny eyes.It 's also very natural looking and goes well with auburn hair . It does n't flake off over the course of a long workday . You can even nap in it , and it wo n't leave racoon eyes.I think it 's my new favorite mascara .	1
I bought this mascara after seeing rave reviews of it all around the Internet . I do n't like spending more than $ 10 or so on mascara , and am a fan of stuff you can easily get in drug stores , so I tried this out when I saw a display of it.Right away , you can see what you 're getting through the packaging . The wand is separate from the actual ( sealed ) bottle , so you can see its length and width and the fact that it is curved slightly.The first time I used it , I could tell I would need more than 1 layer if I wanted to add a bit of volume , but I tried one , two , then three layers ... and no clumps at all ! Even the eyelashes that were starting to stick together from my somewhat disorganized liquid eyeliner application separated easily with the included applicator . This mascara definitely made my lashes look longer without adding gross clumps.For the price , and the accessibility , AND the end result , this is a pretty great mascara .	1
I like this mascara a lot . Love the black color and it really does not clump . Handle is bulky but I do not find it to be an issue . I like the curved brush too . Will buy again - have bought three additional so far .	1
i just got this mascara its great , it crushes well the clump looks very natural good color , great product would recommend to everyone	1
I received a full tube of Clump Crusher Very Black by Cover Girl Cosmetics to review for the Amazon Vine program . In my 56 years , I 've used a lot of mascara : different colors , different brands , expensive-to-cheap , curling , thickening , waterproof , etc. , etc. , etc . For years , I used my favorite , a mascara by Lancome . It is no longer made . For the past five or so years , I 've been searching for a replacement that is as good as Lancome 's product . I think I 've found it . Clump Crusher ( which is a name a teenager would have come up with ! ) works beautifully from application to removal . Application is easy , pull the applicator out of the tube and brush it on upper and lower lashes . Since the applicator is curved , you need to apply it `` with '' the curve , not against it . The applicator does n't get all clumped up with eyelashes and mascara -- it stays clean , somehow . As I apply the mascara , I can see that the product is lengthening my eyelashes , and I am impressed with how separated my eyelashes remain . No clumps , no spiky lashes with blunt ends , no globs on the lower lashes , just nice separation and length . I have been using a prescription product to lengthen and thicken my eyelashes ( Latisse ) , and Clump Crusher brings my `` new eyelashes '' to deliciously-long proportions . How wonderful ! The product stays on all day . No flakes , no raccoon eyes , no smudges underneath my lower lid . When it is time to wash it off at the end of the day , it rinses completely with water and a washcloth . I 'm not left with dark residue under my eyes or on my pillowcase after a good night 's sleep . The case is a fairly obnoxious lime green , but it fits in my rotating make-up organizer on my vanity , so I ca n't ask for much more than that . The mascara 's SUPER and the Cover Girl ( vs Lancome ) price is awesome . I recommend this mascara to those who like lengthening and separation .	1
I admit , I put on a ton just to test it and THEN it clumped a little , but normal use , no clumping , good for use with an eyelash curler , which I have to use , no black clumps on your curler . It 's not screamingly perfect , but I 'd say one of the best brand name mascaras I 've tried . Definitely good value for your money !	1
This mascara does n't clump and it wears nicely . The brush is a little awkward to hold because it 's big and bulky at the end . Nice color ( brown/black ) that lasts all day long and does n't flake off .	1
I love this mascara . It gives great volume without the clumps . Not to mention , I only paid $ 7 . I 've already bought a second tube to use when the first runs out .	1
This is my favorite mascara ever . I almost never have to worry about clumps and they make my lashes look nice and thick .	1
There 's a reason this one won the Allure & # 34 ; Best of.. & # 34 ; award . It 's smooth , truly clump-free , and fast drying without getting spike-y . I got black and the colour is not too harsh or artificial . Great purchase .	1
Wow - a mascara that actually does n't clump . This is a great product.The lengthening properties are exceptional ! I was n't expecting suchgood results , as mascaras do n't usually live up to their claims.This one does - really lengthens without the clumps . I will definitelyre-purchase this item when I start running low . 5 stars to Covergirl !	1
I know that so many women like that very famous brand of mascara that comes in the pink tube but I was never a fan . I hate , hate , hate mascara that clumps and leaves lashes feeling sticky or gummy and that particular brand always left my lashes feeling that way . I never understood they hype.Recently , my favorite mascara has been Cover Girl Lash Blast Volume ( in the orange tube ) but after trying this new Clump Crusher Mascara I now have a new favorite ! I tend to get a lot of compliments on my eyelashes . They are very long and pretty lush . A lot of times people think I am wearing false eyelashes when all I have on is mascara . Still , this does present a problem . Most mascaras will leave my eyelashes feeling heavy and gummy and sticky . Cover Girl Clump Crusher Mascara completely avoids those bad feelings . My eye lashes were nicely defined , darkened , and just thick enough . The look is very natural but still dramatic enough to see a difference . I also liked the fact that my lashes felt soft and supple - not stiff or sticky . This mascara also is great at resisting smudging and smearing and does n't flake . I was able to apply multiple layers of this product and it truly did not clump . My lashes stayed define and did not bind together . In short , the product works just as it promises.The tube is thick and chubby so it feels a little different in your hand . It does take some getting use to but the product is still easy to apply.I think you will like this product .	1
Covergirl Mascara produces a good product . I am a senior so I did not expect fabulous lashes since I 've lost them , but the mascara goes on nicely .	1
I have blonde sparse lashes that are n't very long . I need a mascara brush that is fine with bristles that are n't too long or the mascara between the bristles never makes to my lashes . This brush does that on the end bristles but then gets a little fat for me . The mascara itself is a good consistency , not too thick nor too thin . I may look for other Cover Girl mascara 's with a bit smaller brush .	1
Absolutely the best mascara I 've ever used and I 've used some expensive and cheap ones ! ! It does n't clump ! ! It defines almost every lash ! ! I 'm in my 60s and have been using Rapid Lash Growth to grow lashes for the past 3 months . Now that I have great lashes , I need a great mascara and this is it ! ! Try it ! !	1
I 'm in my 60s and never had great lashes until I bought Rapid Lash on Amazon . Now I have great lashes but the trouble I 've had was finding the right mascara . I bought expensive ones and cheap ones and this one by far beats them all ! ! No clumping ! ! ! Fantastic ! ! !	1
love this product ! CG mascara rocks , never clumpy , goes on great , stays put , keeps me looking fab ! good purchase over all , fair price , came on time , satisfied by my purchase once again . amazon has done it again , thanks !	1
By comparable , I mean they both do n't clump , they both elongate and thicken , and they both have the same hard bristles . Granted , Benefit 's product has more body , but the same can be achieved with Covergirl 's mascara after a few applications .	1
I have short eyelashes , so when I apply mascara , usually they clump up . This one is really a clump crusher . My favorite mascara before was from BareMinerals because my eyelashes looked natural but fuller with it . However , it was $ 20 for a small one . This one also does the same but I pay less ! I totally love this one , plus the color of the barrel is green which is easy to see when it 's in my purse .	1
This mascara goes on cleanly and , as the product promises , without clumps . It removes easily and does n't smear too much . It does n't make short lashes ( like mine ) long , but at least they 're not all clumped up .	1
1/31/13 UPDATE : I have been using this mascara in Very Black ( rather than Brown ) and I have upgraded my opinion from 4 to 5 Stars . This is a very good , well priced , every day mascara that is easy to apply , dries quickly and gives one 's lashes moderate volume and length.ORIGINAL REVIEW : I am quite specific in my mascara preferences and I usually do n't care for curved brushes . This brush , however is excellent . Shaped like a smile or a wedge ( thicker in the center and tapered at the ends ) , the brush is composed of many short plastic spikes that move easily through the lashes while depositing lots of pigment at the lash roots . The shape of the brush allows for quick and even application even at the more difficult to reach areas : the inner and outer corners , the lower lashes . It is because of this innovative brush that I would recommend this mascara overCoverGirl Lashblast Mascara , Very Black 800 , which is a very good , everyday product.This mascara is smooth and somewhat glossy in Brown and matte in Very Black . It applies evenly without much clumping as long as you kept the brush moving . `` Build-ability '' , the ability to apply multiple coats one over the other was not a problem as long as the mascara had not dried fully . Once dried , the mascara would clump somewhat when a fresh coat was applied ... ..not terrible but not exactly what I would call a `` Clump Crusher '' either . My current favorite `` dime store '' mascara isL'Oreal Paris Voluminous Million Lashes Mascara , Blackest Blackand I can apply it in the morning before work and then at 7 pm reapply a coat for a more dramatic effect before going out to dinner . You also can do this with `` Clump Crusher '' , but not with the same voluminous effect.This mascara comes in four shades : Very Black , Black , Black Brown , and Brown . I originally tested the Brown which I found to be extremely , surprisingly light in color , even lighter than my normal lashes . I would only recommend the Brown for extremely fair , light blondes or perhaps strawberry blondes with pale , pale lashes who are interested in a casual , natural look . Otherwise , for anyone else , I would not go lighter than the Black Brown.This mascara is an excellent choice if you are interested in natural looking lashes with moderate volume and length .	1
I 've tried high end mascaras and I always end up going back to this . I have long lashes and this mascara is wonderful and definitely does not clump at all .	1
I AM 42 w/ever shrinking eyes . This went on easily with litterally no clumps . It did not make my lashes super long , it did however make it seem like I had twice as many lashes as I do .	1
A fan of the Covergirl Lashblast Volume in Waterproof , I decided to try this guy out and was glad I did . It 's an affordable mascara offered on the site and you can sometimes even get this for cheaper with a Covergirl coupon that Amazon likes to give out . This was exactly what I needed to get beautifully separated lashes . The formula was good and lasts throughout the day , and the brush is awesome !	1
This is amazing . I have straight Asian lashes , but they are long and thick because I use latisse . I like to use this as a base coat or a standalone . Does not flake , does not stick , is lightweight and does not rip out lashes when you wash your face . Really separates and volumizes each lash from base to tip . Works great under coats of other mascara ( depending on occasion , I use a couple different , more expensive mascara s ) . For example , I will do two full coats of this CG Waterproof right when I start my makeup routine and a few minutes later , I add a coat or two of Smashbox 's full exposure mascara and my lashes look incredible . Careful though- this is $ 6 or less at Walmart ... but it changes prices on amazon all the time from $ 4- $ 11 ! Ps in my opinion- lasts longer than other lashblast versions .	1
Works really nicely on my sparse eyelashes . It thickens and builds them up without clumping . I love it ... What more can I say ...	1
I always wear waterproof mascara ; something about my eyes makes regular mascara smudge no matter what the brand . But waterproof is drying and can be difficult to remove . So in my search for a non-waterproof mascara that does n't end up under my eyes , I decided to try this.Pros : It is water resistant , not water proof , but it does stay on all day and comes off easily.It really is clump free , really . I have not had to use the little comb thing to separate clumps even once while putting this on.Great brushCons : It does not thicken or lengthen , not on me anyway even though I did a couple of coats . For a dramatic look I will go back to Maybelline waterproof heavy duty mascaraI recommend this to anyone who wants a good everyday mascara that does n't clump and lasts all day .	1
I tried this based on the fabulous reviews , and was not disappointed . Other mascaras I 've used tended to be either clumpy and volumizing , or smooth , and adding nothing but color ( no volume ) . This mascara is both smooth and somewhat volumizing . It also keeps lashes fairly separated , and the black/brown color is perfect for my light complexion and casual style ( it 's dark but in a more natural-looking sort of way ) . It 's not perfect , there are occasional clumps , but it 's the best I 've found so far . I am a shameless product junking who is always looking for an excuse to buy something new and different , but I will be sticking to this mascara . Highly recommended .	1
This mascara is my favorite mascara because it leaves no clumps on my eye lashes . The mascara is water resistant and do not smudge . It makes my eye lashes look much fuller and longer . I always buy the black brown color because I love the way it looks on my lashes . The brush is so soft and nice with a curve design to it that will separate your lashes while evenly distributing your mascara on your eye lashes . This mascara is suited for all ages , so do n't hesitate and give it a try .	1
This was a fluke purchase ... .normally use Loreal or Maybelline mascarras but the bright green package caught my eye ... .so glad too because it is the best so far.Love the brush ... love that it applies quickly ... love that it does n't smear under my eyes after wearing it all day ( and I use eye cream ! ) . Another plus , it removes easily with soap and water , no need for my eye makeup remover .	1
This goes on so nice and clean , honestly I was so surprised ! I did n't have to wipe down the brush to get a clean look . It just happens . It does not flake on me , I use two to three coats , only , and it looks beautiful . Not a clump or lump to be found . Thank you so much Cover Girl , another great product from your line that lasts all day . I love it !	1
love the wand . the mascara goes on clean and stays on . I 've worn it for almost 5 hors and my lashes are still soft to the touch . lets see how it holds up over the weekend . but off the bat I would say its great and worth the price .	1
I am very picky about my mascara because my eyes water a lot due to allergies . I need something waterproof that does not harden on my lashes . I saw a commercial for this featuring Pink ... and as crazy as this sounds , I just love her . I decided I wanted to try this since the only mascara I like is sold out through Avon ... not sure if it will be discontinued . It does n't really matter anymore because I have found my new favorite mascara . It goes on smooth & easy with the curved brush . My lashes stay soft & its easy to wash off . I definitely recommend giving this mascara a try !	1
It 's a pretty mascara . Very black . The formula is n't soaking wet which I ca n't stand . It does n't get all over your face . The reason I gave it four stars is that it does n't hold my curl . That 's a bummer in a & # 34 ; water resistant & # 34 ; mascara . It is easy to wash off and lasts forver without flaking .	1
This does a fantastic job separating my lashes , defining them and lengthening as well - I would *almost* compare to benefits They 're Real , but not quite . Definitely waterproof , but do notice I ca n't wear on lower lashes without transferring under my eyes into my concealer as the day goes on - boo . I have yet to find a mascara that does n't do this , so that 's why I still give it 4 stars ! With S & S it 's a great savings and usually can find digital coupons to go with it !	1
You guys realize it says water resistant and not water proof . This means it wo n't smudge or make those raccoon eyes but at the same time it 's easy to take off the mascara without the use of harsh makeup removers . Just warm water and soap will be enough .	1
Does not run , and does not clump . I use the waterproof , but when I wash my face , it comes off nicely . I feel it is a great product for the money . I am on my 4th one .	1
This is the best drugstore brand mascara I 've ever had . No clumps , with 2 or 3 coats you will look like you have fake lashes . HIGHLY recommend , you wo n't regret it .	1
This is very cute and for the price was a great choice , I recommend to anyone who likes bright shadow	1
When I first saw this product online I was hesitant to try the color . However , I am so glad I bought it and took a chance . The color is very different from what I usually buy , and I love that slightly darker color . I have very dark brown eyes and this color really makes my eyes pop ! I highly recommend this product .	1
This is a good base color or a good color for someone who wants to go with a more natural look .	1
Its very very very light.. so for me its good as I am not that bold to pull off very bright color.. its good enough for me as it doesnt show too much but still one came see the difference : )	1
This blush offers a nice warm pink color . I like the applicator on this one , it is soft yet firm enough to apply evenly .	1
This and Tea-Lightfully Clean are my new favorites . Thorough cleansing , great lather , no silicone , no conditioning agents , just clean hair . Your hair will be light yet not stripped . The matching conditioners are really nice too , adding softness without grease .	1
I guess there 's not too much to say about this product . It is a nice clarifying shampoo , and I enjoy the smell .	1
It can be so hard to find a decent shampoo for oily hair . Everything seems to be made for dry hair . So far , this shampoo is the best I 've found for oily hair . It gets the oil out without over-drying it.My hair is somewhat fine , naturally straight , very long , and very oily . I have to wash it everyday or it 's just unbearable . I used to love Aussie 's `` Cleanse and Mend '' shampoo , but they changed the name , and something about the shampoo itself changed as well . This has more than replaced it . My hair feels SO clean after using this shampoo ! It also leaves my hair much more manageable than most shampoos for oily hair.Another reviewer commented on disliking the smell . I personally like the smell of this shampoo . It is somewhat strong smelling while in the shower , but it leaves a very slight smell in your hair.This shampoo is NOT for you if the strong-ish smell in the shower might bother you . It 's also not for you if you have dry hair , as it 's not very moisturizing at all .	1
I have really long hair . when I shampoo it , normally I feel all the dirt doesnt come off easly . I just tried this yesterday and I can really feel how it does wonders on my hair . Its still smelling so good and also is dirt free ... the only thing is that I was used to shampoo my hair twice and when I did that with this shampoo it felt like plastic and when I ran my fingers into it , sounded like plastic ! just use it once and this will work sooooo good .	1
Great inexpensive shampoo that will clean your hair of all that residue and build up . It will cause your hair to have static afterwards , so use a good conditioner . I use this product about once a week and it great ! Seems to do just what it claims and clean your hair . My hair actually squeeks !	1
Simply- this stuff works ( at least on my oily little scalp ) The downside is the smell - Personally I do n't really like it . It has a green tea + passion fruit smell . It 's really the passion fruit that has a sharp scent that is n't really pleasant.But really , who cares.. I care more about the functionality of it and plus the sharpness fades and my hair smells pretty good the whole day	1
This product made my hair so soft . I used it on Wednesday , and it lasted until Sunday morning . Please note that I was pineappling my hair at night , and I exercised three times ( intense cardio ! ) . In the morning , I used a bit of oil and fluffed my hair . I got compliments on my hair . I really really love this product . It may not have the best ingredients but somehow it works on my hair .	1
I was intrigued by Miss Jessie 's products since there is so much hype around them . I 'm Caucasian and have naturally curly hair . As other & # 34 ; curly girls & # 34 ; will understand , I regularly have to layer 3-4 products to get my curls & # 34 ; right & # 34 ; . Even though the bottle says to apply generously , I think you should use this product with a light-hand or it does build up . It creates more of a loose curl . I think this would be great for women w/ wavy hair .	1
Helped to make my hair less 'fro ' and more FABULOUS ! It made my curls into voluptuous , barrel curls . Love it !	1
I got a deluxe sample size of this pillow soft curl cream from my monthly Birchbox subscription . I 'm Latina and I have curly waist length hair . I usually use mousse from Pantene , Dove , Suave or Herbal Essences . However , they all give a wet look that leaves my hair crispy . I just wanted my hair to feel soft to the touch but still curly . When I use those expensive leave in conditioners my curls look weighed down and not bouncy . I absolutely loved this ! I used a little and my hair did not frizz at all . The curls were long but bouncy and curly . ( Think Shirley Temple ) . I could cry I am so emotional about having grown up curls and not looking like I 'm 19 anymore . I pinned up my curls when I went to bed and when I woke up today my hair still looked great but my hair no longer smells like Downy ; )	1
Bought this for my SIL who has curly hair and she really loves it . She says it makes her curls soft and not crunchy like most curly hair products .	1
Ths is a little too light for my very fine curly wavy hair . It would probably work better on fine dry hair . My hair dresser loves it .	1
I have frizzy hair that ca n't decide to be wavy or curly . I put a tiny bit in my palms ( about nickel size ) and work it into my damp long hair . I could use more , but the smell is quite strong . I find that a small amount works . When it dries , it has a nice beachy wave look to it , and it 's soft ( not crunchy ) and clean feeling to the touch .	1
I have 2c-3a colored , right above the shoulder length hair . Without product my hair is very flat , frizzy and droopy . Not so great . The products I 've used in the past always leave me with the wet or crunchy hair look , or they do n't hold enough to manage the frizz.When I first tried this product by itself , about a quarter sized amount , it did not provide enough hold to give good definition . My hair was still a little frizzy , but at least it did n't look wet . On my next attempt I used more product , ~half-dollar amount , which I scrunched in , then towel-scrunched to absorb excess , then diffused . It was way too much and my hair looked greasy . Next try , I used a dime-size amount of Pillow Soft with a dime-size amount of AG Recoil ( which I was previously using , but it gave the wet look ) , scrunched into wet hair , towel-scrunched , diffused , et voila : I found the right combo ! The AG Recoil gives just enough hold , the Pillow Soft gives great soft-curl definition and smells very nice . I also have the best second-day hair I 've had with any other product . I recommend giving this one a try , it may work well for you on its own , or in combination with another product .	1
I purchased this product after receiving a sample through a subscription service . I have generally unmanageable hair and needed something to help define my curl without weighing my hair down . This totally fit the bill ! A little goes a long way in damp hair , and curls can be quickly refreshed with a quick spritz of water . I 've also found that this product practically eliminates the need to condition my hair after every wash . I 'm very happy with the purchase and will be reordering as soon as my bottle runs out .	1
I just finished a bottle of this product , and it works great . I ha e naturally curly hair that I wet-set for manageability . This product leave my hair so soft , and it smells great- like baby powder . This will be a staple from now on .	1
First off , I am just now realizing this is a product designed for African-American hair . But I am caucasian with curly hair , similar to Sarah Jessica Parker early-SATC ( I 'll try to post a picture above ) .Anywho , I got a sample in a birchbox and tried it out . I use a big ol ' gob of it after I wash and put leave-in conditioner . It 's really amazing ! ! It kicks any gel , cream , or mousse 's butt ( my last fav was Bed Head Curls Rock and this is 10 x 's better ) .I have to agree about the smell . I am so NOT a fan of it . It reminds me of an old lady going to church . My DH does n't like it either - so much so that he 's commented on it several times . But since I only wash my hair 2-3 times a week , I 'm willing to live with it those few days and not deduct any stars ( I would take off a half star if I could ) . Miss Jessie , consider a better fragrance ! Overall I really love this product and encourage ANY person with curly hair to try it .	1
I ca n't think of enough words to describe how good this product is ! After searching and coming up short my stylist recommended Miss Jessie 's to me ... .it is perfect . Fresh scent ( may be strong for some ) , light weight , and minimal build up . I normally bought at Target but they are almost always out so I ordered from Amazon and the product was delivered very quickly ... .and TG , I was running on fumes .	1
Great color the polish applies great it arrived in perfect condition love it . It 's a beautiful black green with sparkle !	1
Beautiful dark green with gold shimmer . Long wearing with a glow about it . Love , love love it . Think wagon wheel only with shimmer	1
This might be a new favorite . It 's black with gold sparkle , but sometime it looks a bit dark green . Reading that description I just wrote I realize that sounds like a horribly ugly color but it 's now my new favorite . I got A LOT of compliments on it . I 'm pretty pale too , and it did n't look awful or too Gothic . I wore it for Halloween time , but it will have to be broken out again soon . It wore really well , but to be honest , I sandwich regular colors over a Gelish manicure when my Gelish color grows out , then put the Gelish Top It Off ( then cure it ) on top . Gelish never chips ( for me ) so my experience may not be indicative of `` regular '' polish wear .	1
This nail polish has a charming and fun color . I love nail polish with sparkles . It goes on smooth and easy with a nice brush , and it dries super quick , what more could you want from a nail polish ? Positives-Dries Fast-Great Color-Goes on Easy	1
This color is really dark but the shine in the color makes it pretty . If you do n't normally wear dark colors then you might not like this .	1
I would wear this everyday . Beautiful purple blue that just glows . 2 coats is all you need . One of my faves from china glaze	1
This polish is a royal purple shimmer with just a hint of blue shimmer at some angles . With a lot of light and a close-up , the blue is visible , but not really noticeable at arm 's length . Still , though , a beautiful color , different from other purples I 've seen . Consistency is normal , along with dry time .	1
This color has and amazing formula and color payoff , the formula is great and i have absolutely no complaints at all	1
It came very quickly and in great condition . Thank you so much , I would so order from you once again ! Wearing it now , and it is so dark , and amazing . I highly recommend this color to any nail polish enthusiast !	1
I love , love , love this color buy I am a big fan of purple and blue so I could n't go wrong with this one . : ) . I am wearing it right now and ca n't stop staring at my nails ! !	1
This purple is bright and bold , with 2 coats you 've got a solid color to use as a base color or for accents . Looks exactly like it does in the bottle on the nail .	1
I really like this stuff- does n't weigh my hair down and leave it clean and soft . I 've also gotten multiple complements on the scent . One thing I will say though is if you need a good moisturizing conditioner this probably is n't the one for you . It 's good , but I would recommend getting something specifically for moisturizing . Overall a great product and I will buy again . Keep an eye on drug store sales- they do a buy one get one half off from time to time .	1
I love the way this shampoo and conditioner keave my hair feeling like pure silk , soft and managable . My hair has always been COARSE , this stuff make it feel so GOOD ! !	1
I love the smell of both of these things and I think it really helps my hair to feel soft and shiny and bouncy . it cleans my hair well and I do n't feel as if it 's rough on it .	1
This is a good quality of Rosehip Seed Oil and it works well . What I like most about it , however , is the bottle . On the picture , they show a translucent , orangish bottle . It 's not . I realized that the bottle is actually an opaque black bottle with a pump dispenser . How convenient is that ? The bottle does n't allow light to get in to ruin the oil . If you keep the oil cool ( I do ) , it should stay good for the entire life of the bottle . Great seller ; received the product quickly . I will absolutely be purchasing again .	1
I love , love , love this oil . I use this as my nighttime moisturizer and it works awesome ! It makes my skin soft and supple . It also helps regulate my monthly breakouts . I highly recommend !	1
This is the real deal Rosehip Oil ! It is downright fabulous . WAY better than NOW brand . It goes a long way as well . Love that it is a pump bottle . I have definitely noticed a difference in my fine lines . Really gives a great amount of moisture to my skin as well . I sometimes mix with my other face products in the morning and at night to give that extra bit of moisture .	1
I 'm happy with this purchase and I 'm planning on getting more products like this from them . I 'm hoping it will help with my skin condition . Thank you for your prompt service !	1
This is the first bottle of rosehip seed oil I have ever purchased and I really find it very nice and moisturizing..I do n't have anything to compare it to since I have never used it before..but I plan to reorder when I get low on this bottle as I am very happy with the results I am seeing on my face .	1
I 'm very pleased I bought this , I was looking for a dry oil to give my moisturizer some extra oomph during the winter months and this did the trick . I wash my face in the shower and slather a pump or two on , once I get out I pat my face dry and get dressed . Once I 'm dressed and ready to put on my make up this oil is completely absorbed and my make up goes on smoothly and stays matte and moisturized all day . I has also faded many of my old acne scars , I have only been using it for a month and I 'm about half way through the bottle . I will purchase again .	1
The AINHOA HYDRA LUXE ABSOLUTE FACE & BODY SET is good , but the price is much too steep for what you get.I 've been using the set for about a month and a half and I like the facial cream better than the one marketed towards men ( AINHOA Men Vitality 24 Hours Cream , 1.7 Fluid Ounce ) since I found that this one moisturized way better and did n't have any greasy after-feel.Both the `` body '' cream and the facial cream claim to have caviar in it which is supposed to help nourish and moisturize the skin while helping it to regenerate itself according to the box . Both have a strong sea salt scent , so maybe that 's the caviar ? I 'm not sure but if you 're really sensitive to smells then this might make you recoil . It is n't bad , but it is a sharp scent and smells like products claiming to have sea salt in it . It goes away pretty fast though so you wo n't be smelling salty all day long. -- FACIAL CREAM -- * Absorbs fast and smoothly . * Glides on the skin 's surface so no pulling or tugging on delicate skin . * Non-greasy . * Leaves face feeling soft and smooth. -- BODY CREAM -- * Use as a spot cream only . The size of the tube is n't big enough for full body use because you 'll be out of it within one-week if you use it daily , so this is best used on a small to mid sized trouble area . I 've been using it right under my pec muscles because I had mild gynecomastia , which left me with too much fat in my chest area that caused it to sag a little . This created a wrinkle that runs across that area and I 've had surgery to correct my issue but the wrinkle is still there . I used the AINHOA BODY CREAM on that area after each shower and it seems to be less noticeable . * Absorbs fast and is light with no greasy after-feel . * Very fluid like water type of consistency.The facial and body cream has n't irritated my skin or caused me to breakout so that 's another plus.It 's very difficult to tell if the AINHOA lives up to it 's claims , but my skin feels smoother and softer.If you want to pamper yourself than I would recommend AINHOA LUXE , but I would just buy the facial cream by itself.However , if you have deep set in wrinkles , stretch marks , or cellulite , I think the best bet would be to see a cosmetic surgeon and use the money towards that because NO BEAUTY cream at any price can correct those issues .	1
I liked both the body and the face cream . The body cream is a thin gel like substance . I 'm used to thick luxurious body cream so I gave the bottle a good squeeze and ended up with a huge glob . Happily it landed on my arm and tummy so I was able to use it all without it ending up on my clothes or the floor , but be careful and squeeze very gently , this is thin . The body cream felt great on my dry arms and legs . The scent is strong , though I did n't find it unpleasant and it dissipated in 15 minutes or so . While the cream felt great going on and soaked into my skin quickly , I do n't find it better than a good quality drug store brand.The Face cream is the best part of this kit and in the future I would order the face cream and pass on the body cream . The face cream is lovely , thick , goes on smoothly , has a pleasant fragrance that I did n't find offensive at all . My skin felt pampered , soft and supple almost immediately . An added advantage is the face cream is for both day and night , saving space on the counter . I like dual purpose products .	1
I 've mainly used the face cream . I have a bit of sagging and some lines around the mouth and wrinkles under my eyes because of my lack of estrogen and now am trying to repair it . I eat healthy but felt I needed some outward help as well as inward . What I can say about this cream is after you put it on , your face is incredibly smooth and silky . I do not have any problems with the smell and I do have sensitivity to some perfumed products , so not sure why the other reviewer had problems with this . It 's non greasy . I 've not tried it long enough to attest to it 's benefits on wrinkles , but mine are bad so anything should help , but it makes me feel good to use it , maybe it will keep them from getting worse . I 'm 56 .	1
I gave this to a freind since I was able to get it and she really liked it . She said that it works very well and smells good so that is always a plus .	1
I would never buy such a pricey cream , so this was quite a treat ! The scent is subtly sweet , not overbearing , and it is quickly absorbed with no greasy film some less expensive brands cause.My skin tends to break out or get hives , so it was a relief to be able to use this a few weeks with no ill effects , especially in the winter when skin gets dry.As some people have noted , the face cream is more substantial , thicker , and longer-lasting than the body cream . So yes , with the face cream , a little bit goes a long way , while the body cream will run out pretty quickly unless you are only applying it to a few areas.Would I pay $ 90 for this product ? Probably not , simply because it 's not in my budget and organic coconut oil works pretty well for most of my needs , but if I had the money , I probably would . It leaves skin feeling very smooth and has a great finish and scent . Luxurious !	1
I 've been using the face cream for a little over one week . I think my skin texture has improved . Wrinkles are still there , but are they lessened ? It 's really hard to tell . Two things I do love about this product though are the scent and the fact that it does n't lay on top of the skin . Rather , it seems to get absorbed . It is not greasy.The hand cream is wonderful . I see a definite , improved difference on the back of my hands and cuticles . In fact , the skin on the back of my hands where the cream has been applied is smoother and where it has not been applied has more of my typical alligator appearance . This product absorbs into my skin quickly . It is not greasy .	1
Wow . Rubbed this on my wife , and she was in Heaven . After 38 years , a husband still needs to do stuff like that , maybe even more so after 38 years.Nearly purring like a little kitten , she said it felt amazing . Many times these products are greasy and not a pleasure for the applier , not so with the AINHOA Luxe . It was non-greasy , and actually a pleasure to apply . ( The steak dinner I got the next night was awesome too )	1
This review is for the Ainhoa Hydra-Luxe Absolute Face & Body set which contains the Hydro-nutritive cream and Body cream . The box comes with a `` toothpaste tube '' sized tube of body cream and a fairly small container of cellular complex which is mostly container and very little product.The hydro-nutritive cream , a.k.a . Cellular Complex is a thick , white cream . The beneficial ingredient is the Caviar Extract which is highly concentrated in this product and provides a wealth of vitamins , minerals and other constituent elements . The premise is ... more of a good thing `` slows down '' the aging process . Not to be cynical , but nothing really slows down the aging process and we all grow old . What this product really does is provides your skin with the nutrients needed to prolong the effects of aging . Anyway , the cream applies smoothly and absorbs cleanly . It has a scent to it , but the scent is not unlike what you 'd find in other higher end creams of this nature . The effects are quite nice - reduction in dry skin , evening of skin tone and smoothness.The tube of body cream has the same sort of scent . Caviar Extract ... so yeah , it does have a slightly `` koi pond '' scent to it . It is highly moisturizing and seems to do what a quality moisturizing cream should do . After you get it absorbed , it seems to last a while and makes the skin smooth and supple.In all , this is a product I would buy again . The results were above my expectations and even with the offputting scent , it is something that can be tolerated given the relatively quick results .	1
This AINHOA Gift Set comes in an attractive box boasting an impressive list of ingredients that I ca n't pronounce along with the exotic sounding Caviar Extract . I had big expectations which were for the most part fulfilled , aside from a couple of small problems . I have been using the face cream and body cream for about a week and have experienced significant improvement with some problem dry skin areas.The face cream is a small 1.7 fl oz container . I must say that a little seems to go a long way , so I expect this container to last for quite a while . The cream has a nice , thick texture that applies smoothly . After applying twice per day , I have noticed markedly smoother skin and an elimination of the dry patches that always appear courtesy of our wonderful Midwestern winter . My one problem with this cream is the scent . I feel that it is far too strong and I certainly would not recommend it for any user who is sensitive to perfumes.The body cream comes is a 3.4 fl oz container and is very thin . Once again , the scent is overpowering , and unlike the face cream , I do n't feel like this lotion will last very long . It comes out fast and takes quite a bit to cover an area . Even with these problems , I have no complaints about the moisturizing results . This lotion has greatly improved my winter skin problems and while I have not noticed anything that would enable me to address this product 's firming and anti-cellulite claims , the moisturizing benefits have been quite impressive.Finally , I must add that even though I feel that the scent for both the face cream and the body cream is far too strong ; my husband thinks it smells terrific . A four star rating for two products that work very well but still have a few issues .	1
I 've been using this for a few months now and I can certainly tell a difference in my skin . I thought I might not be able too so at first I only used the body cream on one arm . After a couple of weeks of using it nightly , I could certainly tell the difference between the arms . I thought my face was fine until I used the facial cream and found that it was smoother and much nicer than usual . It goes on smooth and is n't greasy and dries pretty quickly . Whether it removes wrinkles , I do n't know . I 'm doubtful anything can do that but since it makes your skin look so nice , the wrinkles are certainly less noticeable .	1
I recently have had a bad cold which necessitated much hand washing . This made my hands extremely dry to the point where it almost felt like the skin around my knuckles might crack.I 'm in my forties and while I 've taken good care of my face , neck and chest since I was in my twenties , unfortunately , I 've been extremely lax in taking care of my hands . I almost never use gloves while cleaning , neglected putting sunscreen on them etc . and it shows . I have crepey skin on the backs of my hands and have bought products ranging from 20 to 60.00 dollars and nothing really seemed to work.While I was lolling on the couch one day , hacking and coughing with my cold , I wanted to put some lotion on my red , rough , over washed hands but was too lazy to get up and go get some and had the Ainhoa Lux cellular complex that I 'd left on my coffee table so I used a bit of that . I ended up using it a few times over the next couple of days and noticed that the crepey-ness on my hands was significantly less or at least the cream made it much less noticeable.I tried taking before and after photos but I do n't know how to make my camera show the details more . In any case , I 'm happy with the performance of this cream . I 've been applying it around my eyes , especially the lids and though I do n't really have wrinkles there or crepey skin ( yet ) , since it did such a good job on my hands , I think it would help on my eyes as well and it does leave my skin feeling silky and soft . Also , I have to be careful what I use on my hands and face because I am prone to adult onset acne and sometimes after applying hand lotion , if I touch my face , it 'll begin breaking out within a day or so but I did n't get that reaction at all with this product.Regarding the Luxe body cream : I used it after showering and also before bedtime for about 9 days now and the skin on my legs is really soft and moisturized but I ca n't really say it 's done anything for the bit of cellulite I have on the backs of the top of my thighs . Maybe it requires a longer time of using or something ? ? I like that it 's quite runny because it seems like it soaks into my skin faster than my other , thicker lotion but I must say , it 's expensive if that 's the only result because I can get soft skin for much less.Bottom line : Most likely I 'll buy the Luxe Cellular complex again because the results I got on my hands and face were really good . Better than the Oil of Olay product I tried in the past and better than any of the hand lotions I 've tried but I do n't think I would buy the body cream again because the expense just did n't justify the results I got .	1
The Hydra-Luxe Absolute Hydro-nutritive Face and body cream rolls on like liquid velvet and smells like a rain freshened spring morning . The cream is not greasy or oily . It does n't sit on the skin ; instead , the skin absorbs it ... greedily.I have not seen any firming or ` rejuvenation ' but the petal-soft and luxurious feel of this cream has moisturized my skin and made me feel papered.The tube of body cream was not easy to open so I sawed the top off with a knife and lost a blob of cream in the process.I have not found the body cream to be ` anti-cellulite ' but I did n't expect it to.If you have realistic expectations and love luxury , you will love this cream .	1
I have to admit , I 'm not a high-end gal . Give me some Oil of Olay and I 'm generally a happy camper . But I 'm not above some indulgence , especially if someone 's willing to give it to me.That being said , I 'm now a big fan of luxury like I found in this body cream and anti-aging face cream . So much so that , when I finish up what I 've got , I 'll most likely buy some more . While that might not sound like high praise , it definitely is.The tube of body cream is not thick or goopy , it slides on like silk and absorbs into the skin easily and quickly . ( I have a very poor sense of smell so I ca n't speak to that but if it 's anything like the light feel , it 's good to go . ) The only downside of the light cream is that if you put even the slightest amount of pressure on the tube , the lotion flows out too fast , since it 's actually a bit runny.The jar of anti-aging cream is just like the body cream -- light and airy , smooth as silk . My pores tend to clog easily ( yes , it really bites to have both wrinkles and acne ) but this went on light and smooth and has n't given me a lick of trouble , except to make my skin feel like it did when I was much younger.All in all , quite lovely and unexpected .	1
I guess I am the lone voice reviewing this product that likes it ! I 've been using both the face lotion and the body lotion for a little more than a week . I am always skeptical about things like this , anything that claims to remove wrinkles , brighten skin , etc . I am very fair skinned ( red hair , blue eyes ) so every wrinkle , blemish , etc . shows up , especially in winter when I 'm even more pale than normal.I set about using this in the most scientific way I knew how : by keeping track of my skin tone , fine lines around my eyes and ruddy/red spots starting the day I first used this . I did n't change anything else ( eating the same , sleeping the same , etc ) .The first thing I noticed about the lotion was the scent . It does not , in ANY way , smell like baby lotion as one reviewer mentioned . I have had lots of babies in my life and am very VERY familiar with the smell of baby products . In fact , my 9 year old still likes to use baby lotion to moisturize her skin , so it was easy for me to compare . I agree the scent is very noticeable ... .at first . It fades within about 15 minutes . To me , it has a sort of fruit/floral scent . Not good or bad , it 's just there . My husband says he does n't notice it at all.But the best thing about it is , my skin ! After three days , I absolutely noticed the fine lines around my eyes are FAR less noticeable . It is a marked difference . In fact , I 've had several people who know me well ask me what is `` different '' about me - that I look well rested , like I 've just been on vacation ( and trust me , I have NOT - I just had all 6 of my children home for two weeks from school for Christmas break - anything but well rested ! ! ) The face cream is a very light lotion . It is in a pot ( and honestly , I could n't care less about the hygiene issue , I wash my hands and tons of products come in pots like this ) and it takes very little to spread on my face and the effect is immediate . My skin feels incredibly soft and smooth , like baby skin ( yes , really ) . The skin tone is brighter , more of a `` peaches & cream '' complexion , it looks amazing . The consistency of the face lotion reminds me of very thin yogurt . But a little goes a long way . I use it on my face , neck , the backs of my hands and d & eacute ; colletage area.The body lotion is a bit different . It also has a similar scent , but once again , the scent fades very quickly . I 've had no problems using the lotion and my usual perfume . The body lotion is also very thin so a little goes a long way . I usually useAlba Botanica Very Emollient Body Lotion , Maximum Dry Skin Formula , 32-Ounce Bottlewhich is very thick and creamy , it takes awhile to get it all rubbed in and to stop feeling sticky . The AINHOA body cream went on smooth and very quickly and again my skin feels like a newborns . I took special notice in a weird dry patch I had on my elbow , NOTHING was working on it . After three days of using this lotion , the dry patch is almost gone.I am a frugal person and actually had no clue there was body and face lotion in this price range because it never even occurred to me to shop for it . I useLubriderm Daily Moisture Lotion , 24 Ounceon my face , which is under the $ 10 range . So to try something this expensive was quite a treat . Even more surprising is that after the results , I 've actually entertained the idea of buying more of the face lotion after it runs out . Anyone that knows me would know that is indeed , a very positive endorsement.Long story short : I am fair skinned , in my 40 's , dry skin , younger looking for my age but still have fine lines and I really , REALLY liked these products . I would n't hesitate to purchase them again if the price was more in line with my budget . **UPDATE**Ok , I 've been using this for several weeks now and I 've noticed that there is an odor to it that was becoming more and more unpleasant the more I used it . I could n't put my finger on what it was because the overall scent of the lotions are good . Then it hit me one day : fish . It smells like fish.I hate fish . I ca n't stand the smell of fish/seafood , etc . I ca n't take fish oil tablets because of the fishy smell , I hate eating in seafood restaurants because of the smell ( I do it out of love for my seafood loving family ) . So rubbing fish smell on my body and face was becoming an issue for me because now that 's ALL I smell when using it . And it 's a shame because I REALLY like how the lotion makes my skin feel ! I looked at the ingredients and sure enough , they use caviar essential oils in the potions . I 'm not saying the fish smell is overpowering , but if you 're someone with a SUPER sensitive nose who also ca n't stand the smell of aquatic delicacies on your person all day , you might want to pass on this , even though it 's some of the best lotion I 've ever used .	1
When I received this I loved it . I needed a great gift to give my mother for her birthday and she is always worried about the wrinkles that are on her face . So , what I did was order her one of her own . Not only did she get a great body cream that worked great , but she also got great anti-aging cream that she could use too .	1
I love the face cream ! It is light , non-greasy and my face feels feels silky smooth after use . The instructions advise to apply twice a day . Nice light floral scent.The body cream is thin and does need quite a bit to cover , my legs feel smooth and silky ; however I am not sure what anti-cellulite effect would be with short term use.I would recommend the face cream and will hold back my opinion of the body cream until I finish the tube.Update 1/19/13 ... .I love the body cream , it may be thin and not go far but after a few applications I noticed how smooth and silky my skin felt . I stopped using the cream and within 2 days my skin was tight and rough again . Product does the job nicely .	1
I do n't have many wrinkles and my skin looks more like a 35 year old than a 47 year old but I have issues with dry spots and flaking . I have a few fine lines around the eyes and some serious lines on the throat with dark spots . I also hate the winter time dry itchy legs and such . The face cream is in a small jar and is a think consistency . It takes very little smoothed over the face and throat at bedtime and again after my shower in the morning . The body lotion is in a small tube and is also very thin . I 'm not as impressed with this one since the tube is so small and there are a lot of body parts in need of moisturizing . I have another product by AINHOA and it came with almost no instructions in the packaging . However , when I read the descriptions online I was able to see when and where to use the product . I suspect this is the case with this body cream . There was a line I read somewhere that mentioned cellulite so maybe this is supposed to be used in areas with cellulite . Regardless , the cream is a little too thin for it to be `` cream '' . It does feel nice with a very light scent . It is quickly absorbed and does not leave your skin feeling oily . The face cream also is very thin and light with a mild scent that dissipates quickly . It leaves your face feeling soft and smooth and absorbs quickly . I used it once or twice a day for a week and was surprised to see the discolored spots on my throat had faded and the lines were gone . The lines around my eyes were also lessened.In summary , I like the anti-aging face cream and will continue using it . If I can find it sold separately for a good price I will continue using it . I will use the body cream until it is gone and then I will go back to using cheaper products , even if they leave my skin feeling greasy .	1
I joked around with my family about slathering my face with fish eggs ( this product contains caviar extract ) , but I 've been pretty pleased with this product.The face cream has a nice , floral scent . It is a little bit strong at first , but the scent fades fairly quickly . The scent reminds me of the cream they used when I got a facial at a spa . I did notice that my face seemed softer after using the product . I did n't find it to be especially hydrating , but I do live in an especially dry climate . Although it 's labeled as a `` cream , '' it 's actually like a watery lotion in consistency.The body cream 's fragrance is not as strong as the facial cream . I 've applied it daily to my stomach ( where I have stretch marks ) and to the good ole cellulite on my legs . I have n't yet noticed a dramatic difference , but it may take time to see full results .	1
I am exceptionally pleased with the AINHOA Luxe Hydra Luxe Absolute Gift Set . The products have a very light , pleasing scent that fades quickly , so it wo n't interfere with other scented products . The quality of the product itself seems wonderful and it really does make a noticeable , lasting difference after just a few uses . The products apply lightly and leave the skin with a silky feeling . Be careful though , because these are n't heavy creams , it is very easy to accidentally dispense too much product from the tubes . The amount you get seems rather skimpy , however , especially the body cream , do n't expect it to last more than just a few applications , so take that into consideration when choosing this product . Keep in mind , this is a `` luxury '' product , and it tends live up to that as it gives better than average results as a matter of course .	1
very light fragrance . The tube has a plastic knob that you have to cut off before use : the viscosity of the cream was a little runny , so dont squeeze the tube hard ! upon application to my extremely dry legs ( winter time ) the cream had a nice elasticity and spread very evenly on the dry surface . now my legs feel little tingly like i have treated to a nice spa treatment ! I kid you not.the second tube is more for the face and the cream is very light and has a coolness effect on the face and has removed the winter like tightness that you can experience at this time of year.a pricy product , but I really like it for the effects : my legs feel and look moisturized and nice for a change ! i think it is worth it .	1
Received this product courtesy of Amazon Vine . I found both the face cream and body cream to be very pleasant . I dislike scents and did n't find the fragrance overbearing at all . The body cream made my winter-dry legs feel wonderful . Same for the face cream . Left my face feeling clean , silky and smooth . Although the face cream does n't come with an applicator , this is not a big deal if you use q-tips . Do n't know what the long term benefits will be , since I 've only just begun using this product .	1
Have you ever looked forward to putting on a lotion before ? Well , I certainly have n't . This was such a nice change of pace . Every time I put this lotion on I feel like I 'm in my own little spa . It just feels so luxurious . I feel like my skin has more of a soft glow about it than it used to . I would n't necessarily say it 's turned back time on my skin , but I definitely can see a softer appearance in my skin . Really great quality .	1
I have seriously dry skin and there are few lotions/creams that really benefit me . The face cream really moisturizes nicely without a greasiness or oiliness and as another reviewer noted , a little of this does go a long way -- the 1.7 oz seems more like 3 or 4 oz . I applied the face cream to half of my face to see if there would be any noticeable difference , the side I applied it to smoothed out a bit and surprisingly was a tad pinker than the other side , I wouldnt have noticed the pinkishness had I applied it to both sides . I 'm guessing that was caffeine or something similar for the plumping of the skin . Most lotions with caffeine or the like make my skin red but this just make my skin a barely noticeable tad pink.The body lotion on the other hand , was pretty thin , almost watery . I am not sure it has any special benefits but am so unenthralled by it that there is no way I would use it regularly enough to observe any pluses or minuses.Face cream-GreatBody lotion-mediocre	1
My face is cursed ... I 'm very fair , oily and dry patches cover on my cheeks , forehead and around my mouth . This cream , unlike others I 've tried before , actually does not break my face out , it really moisturizes . Just feels amazing to find a cream I can use on my face.Normally , I ca n't use anything on my face except a cleanser for oily skin - this one -Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser , for normal to oily skin , 16.0 -Ounce Bottles ( Pack of 2 ) . I try to only use cleanser and stay away from creams except after shower .	1
Packaged in an attractive zippered white faux leather case , this skin care duo is encased in metal tubes . The Extreme Plus Repair has a roller ball tip while the Extreme Eclat Instant has a soft sable brush at the end of the container . Product is dispensed by pressing a button at the bottom of the tube . One or two presses was sufficient for my needs.The Extreme Plus Repair contains algae exptracts , bioplasma , marine plant dna and Hyaluronic Acid . The Extreme Eclat contains ginseng , fruit acids , vitamins , plant and algae extracts.Frankly , I was more impressed with the applicators than I was with the product . The applicators are fun to use and assist in precision application . The roller ball is reputed to assist with lymphatic drainage . The brush had a nice , soft feel . After about two weeks of use , I found the Eclat somewhat more effective than the Plus Repiar . The eclat had a light perfume scent that I did not care for and the results were subtle . It does leave the skin smooth and soft with minimal tightening . The Plus Repair had no scent and its effects to date were unremarkable . I did not experience any irritation or allergic reactions and I do have sensitive skin . However I can not say that the results thus far are superior to even the drug store brands . I intend to completely use both and will update my review if that changes.On the negative side the instructions are skimpy and are contained on a little leaflet . the leaflet has information on all of their products and in a number of languages . It was annoying to have to weed through all the langauages and products to find the english instructions . and then , the information provided was minimal . I also noted that the tubes were not sealed in any manner . Although they are attractive , the metal tube and brush of the Eclat fell apart . I was able to put it back together but it does raise questions about overall quality.This product is worth a try if you temper your expectations . I did not experience amazing and instant improvement but was not displeased with the results . The applicators are genius , easy and fun . The carrying case is cute and sturdy and the black interior and small mirror were thoughtful touches . If amazon had half stars , I would give this three and one-half for superior application of a pedestrian product .	1
AINHOA is a successful European cosmetic company that sells products world wide . This AINHOA Specific Extreme Pack comes nicely packaged and is a high end product for women over thirty and beyond . The two silver applicators come with their own zipper case , great for travel.There are two products included in this package : The Extreme Eclat is a wrinkle and tightening treatment that has a nice brush applicator . This does tighten skin under the chin , around the eyes and laugh lines . It 's a smooth formula that glides on nicely . The second applicator uses a roller ball applicator . Both are silver cylanders that use a pump type action to bring the product up to the applicators . The brush applicator is my favorite . I enjoy using this product under make-up and at night . The roller ball applicator is also meant to message the skin as you apply it.The Extreme Eclat is a very nice cream and the brush and applicator are very innovative . I think it 's a neat idea to have this type of applicators , especially for travel . No messy creams to pack and they come with a nice case which includes a mirror . This treatment has a drying effect due to the Hyaluronic Acid.These products can and should be used sparingly . I think the Extreme Eclat works best and would seek out the product on its own for purchase because I really like the feel of it under make-up and I like the brush applicator .	1
I have always been told I look young for my age but I can see the wrinkles ... especially in the last few years . I like to blame it on the hard water and not my age & lt ; G > , but I have one really big crease in my forehead . ( I wonder why the hard water settled there ... ) AINHOA Specific Extreme Pack comes with two elixirs , each one encased in its own solid-sized application tube . One is for heavy duty repair -- you can put it on at night and in the morning -- that big old forehead crease is actually diminished . The other is for daily application ; you can put it on before your makeup . One comes in a brush , the other a silver roller-ball kinda applicator.You can actually feel the ointments working on your skin . They smell nice , they tighten and relax as needed , and I really like them both . They both seem fairly effective , which is the bottom line . They are n't cheap , but they do what they say they 'll do.Me likey .	1
First , let me say , that my skin is incredibly sensitive to almost everything and prone to quick break outs ; for these reasons I was scared to use this product . However , from the 1st use I had no problems , none : no break outs , no bumps , no burning , none . The first morning after I used the Extreme Plus Repair I noticed a smoothness and a healthy shine to my skin . I was impressed . I washed my face with a face cloth and just water then I applied the Extreme Eclat Instant under my makeup , it worked wonderfully . All day my makeup looked smooth and nicely matted . I was nicely surprised and greatly appreciative of how well these products worked.Now , they are not cheap , about $ 50 to $ 60 bucks a piece , but considering how well they work they 're worth it .	1
The first thing you will notice about this product is the innovative and deluxe packaging . The two products come in a nice leather case that would make them ideal for travelling , and also both feature interesting application processes . One uses a brush - with the cream coming through the brush so you can `` brush on '' the moisturizer . The other has a ball to apply the serum . While both applicators are innovative and interesting , I do worry about the cost that goes into this level of packaging , as I prefer products that spend the money on the actual product . Also , I do n't know if my concerns are valid , but I worry about the hygiene of the brush , since it stays caked in moisturizer all the time.On to the products ... I find skin care is a very personal choice , as everyone has different skin that reacts differently to different products . These feel to be extreme moisturizers that do a great job , and as other reviewers have noted I can see how some skin reacts very positively . However , I prefer a cream that leaves my skin feeling moisturized but relatively dry . With both of these products there was a bit of an oil sheen left on my skin that I did not find as pleasant as other creams I use . That being said - they do a great job at moisturizing.The product would be enhanced if they gave a more detailed instruction sheet . It comes from a Spanish company , and can be a little confusing .	1
I like this moisturizer and it feels great on my winter dry skin . I do wish the instructions included would have 'instructed ' me how to properly use these . There is nothing saying which to use first , or if for day , night , under foundation etc.I like the brush applicator the best , as it easily smooth the product over your face and neck . The roller ball did n't dispense as easily and I 'm not a fan of applying undue pressure to my 40-something face and neck.I simply used this each night before bed for several weeks and my skin feels very soft . I do n't think it diminished the appearance of fine lines , however , I 'll keep trying.I do massage this lotion into my skin after applying with the brush , otherwise it feels like it just lays on my skin.I welcome comments with the correct procedure for use . The company website provided zero help .	1
I 'm not sure why some other reviewers do n't see the instructions , it says for both products to apply them on the face , especially over the express lines , also around and lip lines , leave it to absorb . Both items are serums , which are always used on clean skin , under the moisturizer/sunscreen . They do not specify am or pm use , so you can use anytime.In addition Extreme Eclat Instant can be use under make up , so application over sunscreen is ok ( as a make up primer ) .I think both products are very good , considering the ingredients , absorbency and how my skin feels after . There is no greasy residue , and I like the pen with the roller ( cooling effect and there are no silicones ) .The second wand with the brush seems weird to me , you applying everyday so obviously bacterias will grow there , unless you wipe it with brush cleaner that contains alcohol . I think regular dispenser would be better . The product can be used as a make up primer and it contains several silicones , but also does not clog the pores and it is smooth.There are no miracles or wow factor , but I can say that skin is hydrated , temporary plumped and smooth . Considering the price I feel that it was spend more on the packaging and carrying case though , especially when the Extreme Eclat is only 20 ml ( 0.67oz ) . I like to pay for the item itself not the packaging . IMO the base price is a bit to high for the results I got .	1
I am 46 years old , and live in a very dry area where we also use a wood stove to heat our house , causing more dryness . I am always looking for something to hydrate my skin , face and hair . This AINHOA specific extreme pack is like nothing I have ever used before and I am very happy with the results.This arrived in a very nice hard carrying case that zips close for travel . Inside are your two silver tubes of product with a push button on the bottom to dispense the product into the roller or brush , depending on which one you are using . I am using both and like another reviewer , I noticed ( even my family noticed ! ) a huge difference immediately . You have to try this to believe it . The applicators are very nice , the brush is soft and the roller ball applicator works well . I found that you have to be a little more careful with the ball applicator pen because it does dispense quite a bit of product with one push of the button . One push was enough for me to do my entire face . Once I applied these , I noticed a huge different in the lines around my eyes , and on my forehead . They almost disappeared after just one use ! I know that sounds impossible , and I would not have believed it myself unless I had actually tried this . I would highly recommend this product , my face looks firmer and feels better , so much more hydrated which I think was part of my problem , I do n't have that sallow , dry looking face , but it looks moist and `` plump '' in a fantastic way .	1
This is a great product . I have to say myself . The scent is pleasant and not harsh like others I have used in the pass . I can say I see a small difference after using this for over two weeks . I like the fact that you get two products in one . Day and Evening . I have used a few of their other products for a few months as well and they work great . I guess depending on how many wrinkles you have on your face how good of a product this will be . I have a few around the eyes and this will be the best product for that .	1
First ... this comes in a BEAUTIFUL box . A white leathery zippered case ( which I immediately reused as a make up travel case ! ! ! ! ha ha ! ) The products are big ... no tiny amounts in there . The applicators are a roller ( like a pen ) and a brush that you pump and the stuff squirts out into the brush . I was n't sure about the brush , it seemed like it would get all creepy and stick from the product , but I have actually grown to like it.I tried the roller one on my right eye area and a different roller product ( Garnier Skin Renew Anti-Puff Eye Roller ) on the left . I do n't think it was a good comparison though because one is more for puffiness , and the other is more moisturizing . I did like the Ainhoa much more than the Garnier for dryness . So I abandoned my experiment after 2 weeks and just use this.My skin sort of drank both of these products up . It feels much smoother and the results even last until the next day , which has not been the case for many moisturizers I have used.The price ... sigh ... the price . I do n't understand the price of moisturizers . I mean LaMer is known as the gold standard , but I ca n't afford it at all ... so I do n't even know if it works . I have tried mid-priced items , and like them ... but usually end up with drugstore brands to justify the cost . Now that I am older , I am wondering if I should indeed pay a little more . I am in an odd age where I still get breakouts AND the beginnings of wrinkles ... so I just do n't know . It seems that a very expensive item should show super dramatic results , but I am not sure that is correct . Maybe good products , time and consistency of use are the things that make a difference , but it is something we wo n't know for years . I am seriously leaning towards buying this again . Maybe there will be a sale !	1
This is a very good product pack that I find is one of the few products that actually work as advertised . Application instructions are easy to understand and are supplied on each product . The product is very easy to use , and offers subtle results . The one thing you do n't want to do is use too much product , or you may experience some tingling or irritation , perhaps worse if you are a sensitive skin sufferer . The product itself is not greasy feeling if applied as directed , nor does it leave a sticky residue . As with all skin care products , your own experience may vary greatly .	1
First of all , I could see results after only one application of the repair- amazing ! The skin under my jaw appeared tighter , and the deep line between my brows was far less noticeable . I especially like the applicators- these are the best . Big metal-colored tubes with a push-pen type application dispenses just the right amount into the brush or roller . I love the soft sable brush and is perfect for brushing it on the skin in an even manner . My face feels like silk , and my makeup glides over the top . Also comes with a hard-sided travel case , so no worries in the suitcase . My only caution is to make sure the ends are screwed on well before your first application- one was n't on tightly on mine , and the end shot off ! It was easily screwed back on , but I should have checked it first . These are truly luxury products !	1
`` So Smooth '' is what I would call my face after using this . I feel like the appearance of my fine lines are diminishing with this . Love the way it feels on my skin !	1
So far - and I 've only used this for ten days , my skin is smoother and the tone seems more even . I did n't expect to see any changes so soon , so this is quite a surprise ! I like what I see and hope to see continued improvement .	1
The product makes several skin benefit/anti-aging claims . Only time will tell ... .there 's no way to prove whether it actually works or not within the moment . I have n't seen any clinical test information so , I have to go by my own experience . Several weeks now of using the product and I have n't noticed any kind of results . I like the idea that I 'm doing something good for my skin , so there is a benefit there if only a psychological one.I will say that it does act nicely as a facial moisturizer . It does n't feel heavy or leave an oily feeling . Using just a very small amount seems to do the trick . It has a neutral scent , which I appreciate .	1
I work outside in extreme temps and am ... welll getting a little older . This product is great because it gives imeediate results . My skin feels smooth and satiny without being greasy . The lines just disapear ! it has a nice smell and the container delivers `` just enough '' into your hand . Feel imeediately renewed !	1
When I first pumped this onto my fingers I was annoyed . It 's too liquid , I 'll bet it wo n't even stay on my face ! Well , the joke 's on me . My skin absorbed it very fast and then remained soft for a couple days.I 've been using lotions which unfortunately leave a greasy feel . This does n't and it smells good too ! I have noticed the bags under my eyes are now not quite so dark . Unfortunately I think it 's priced way too high and wo n't be buying it in the future .	1
My skin feels silky smooth to the touch after applying and this glides on with no sticky after feel . I have only used it for a couple of days so I will need to use it longer to be able to tell if it does indeed diminish the appearance of fine lines . But for the cost of the product I can not really justify how good it really feels . I would need to see in the long run how long it lasts and how well it works . I guess it 's better than seeing a dermatologist but at just about $ 100.00 a bottle that 's kind of steep for a bottle that just weighs 1.05 oz . The only reason I got it to try it was through the Amazon Vine Program . If it works amazing wonders and is a facelift in a jar I might buy it , so who knows . Will keep you posted in a month on the progress . It has additives in it and says in English ( below all the Spanish hubla ) at the bottom 1/2 way through Hydrogenated caster oil , caviar extract , pearl powder and a lot of other ingrediants that do not sound natural but it appears a form of retinyl palmitate is in there and a slew of other non-natural things . Made in Spain . But I will use it until the bottle is empty and will update my findings .	1
I have been using the AINHOA Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum for about 3 weeks , and I have noticed a difference in my skin . I wanted to try this product because I have a large dark patch on my right cheek , and I wanted to see if the product would really make a difference . After faithfully applying the serum as directed , twice a day , for the 3 weeks since I received it , the patch on my cheek is noticeably lighter . I was surprised , I did n't expect to see any difference.There is a lot I like about this product . I love the smell ; I see in the reviews that some customers did not like the scent , but I love it . I like the way it feels on my skin , even under makeup it 's light and non-greasy . My skin is noticeably brighter , and smoother . I have very sensitive skin . Most products make me break out , or cause a rash , but I have had no reaction at all from the AINHOA . I do love this product , but unfortunately , I do not have the income to be buying $ 100.00 bottles of beauty products . I think the product is great , with exception to the price , and I will probably cry when the bottle is empty . 5 stars , but minus one star for the price .	1
Based on a week 's use of AINHOA Whitess Caviar Renewal Serum , I am in love with this product . Maybe it was because I was using an over the counter facial lotion , but after using this serum , I noticed the dry patches on my face disappeared , and my oily patches were not so oily . Bliss ! I also use a Clarisonic to clean my face , so the lotion absorbs quickly and does n't feel oily on my skin . I also enjoy the scent of this serum - it 's flowery , but not so overpowering that I feel like I 'm walking through a perfume department.So far , my skin is feeling smoother , softer , and looks clean and dewy after using it . I thankfully have not had any problems with breakouts with this product . I can not say how well it will work in the long run , but I 'm hoping my skin stays like this ( or gets better ! ) within the 3 month period . For now , highly recommended !	1
I have noticed a difference in my skin tone and appearance . I like the way it goes on -- smooth but not greasy . It has a mild , pleasant scent . I gave it 4 stars because of the price and I did n't like the nozzle on the bottle . It looks great -- a nice silver color -- but it is often hard to push the button down and even when you do it does n't come out in the same amount with each push of the button or even in the spot you directed it to go . Not only that , it also splatters everywhere sometimes . I 've found it on my clothes and the bathroom wall and mirror . I just expect much better quality for that price.If you have the budget to keep buying it , I 'd recommend it . However , there are less expensive brands that work just as well for much , much less . But since this is a review for this product , here is my summary.I would say that I do like it and I did notice a change in the tone and appearance of my skin . I love the subtle scent and the fact that it 's not greasy . It makes my face feel fresh and clean ( as opposed to greasy and weighed down with a facial product . ) If you have the budget , then yes , I 'd recommend this product .	1
First off , thank you to the folks at Amazon Vine for giving me the chance to try this product . I 'm generally pretty frugal when it comes to skin care , so I 'll jump at the chance to sample the high end stuff.The caviar serum comes nicely packaged in a pretty silvery box wrapped in plastic , wrapping that 's fairly easy to remove . The serum is in a beautifully designed bottle , and is easily dispensed with a pump at the top ( extra points for that , I hate the upside down tube dispensers ) . The fluid does have a bit more scent than I care for , but I 'm also sensitive to stronger perfumes . It ( the scent ) does dissipate quickly , so that was n't a deal-breaker . The fluid goes on easily , and is not at all heavy or greasy , so it 's easy to put makeup on right afterwards . Does it work ? I 've been using it for about five days now , and have noticed some slight changes ( the skin feels a bit tighter ) , but nothing overly dramatic . At a lower price it is a product that I would consider purchasing , but as always , YMMV .	1
I 've been using this product for approx . 3 weeks now . I find that it does make my skin look a little more even toned and smoother . The product price is a bit expensive but if you can afford it , I recommend it . I used it on combination with another Ainhoa product that left my face feeling silky smooth .	1
I decided to use this product on one side of my face and OlayRegenerating Serum Moisturizeron the other . I already had the Olay , and the color and texture of both products seemed sort of similar . This is very light and translucent ... not greasy , and it sinks in your skin fast . Neither really did anything for darker marks on my face ( hello freckles ! ! ) but both did a good job at moisturizing ( but not erasing any wrinkles . ) I DID notice that my skin seemed to stay softer much longer with this product , so that is a good thing ! Even after 5 or 6 hours , the side of my face where I used this was still soft ( even with makeup..which I did put on both sides equally . ) It does seem that one freckle is starting to lighten a little after about 6 weeks , but it is is still there . I am not sure this is designed to erase old discolorations or only prevent new dark marks . : /So ... I am undecided if I would purchase again . It IS expensive , and there is n't any amazing difference on that side , but it does work much longer than my other moisturizer ( so I use much less over time ) and it has n't caused one breakout . I would seriously consider this if it were just a little cheaper or on sale .	1
This really does feel like something as decadent as caviar and I think it smells wonderful . It 's almost as if your face blooms open like a rose as soon as you gently smooth it on . It was the first thing I noticed , your skin just perks right up , I am so happy to have tried this product and a little dollop on your finger tip or one squirt will cover your entire face . I think it is just the thing you need to start your day with some pep in your step , especially if you do n't wear makeup !	1
You always wonder about those expensive moisturizers that they sell but wince at the thought of spending that much money on it . Since this was through the Vine program , I figured that I would give it a try , even though I 've never heard of the brand . I 'm not sure how much improvement I 've seen in about two weeks ' time ( I tried to wait some time before posting a review , but will probably have to come back in another month to update ) , but I will say that this moisturizer has a light scent to it ( I did n't find it annoying at all , and it vanished after a minute or two ) and it absorbed into the skin very quickly . This has kept my skin from being dry during these winter days , which is impressive , though I 'm not sure if any improvement on fine lines is wishful thinking on my part . A little bit of the lotion goes a long way , so I can see this bottle lasting several weeks/about two months , at least , but it 's still very expensive . Obviously , I would n't be paying for another bottle unless there 's significant results once this runs out . I give it four stars because of the obvious moisturizing quality and the fact that you only need to use a little at a time .	1
Feedback from wife : She likes it very much . The serum works as advertised , and she is astonished and really happy with the results . She does feel that the price is the only factor stopping her from buying it soon . I reminded her that expensive SPA treatments also do cost a lot , and this serum she can use definitely more than once . One single visit to SPA is more than this . That did open up a vision in her mind : ) .	1
This is one of the best mascara products I have ever tried ! Not only does it go on smooth , it stays put for the entire day ! Also , the shape of the wand is pretty unique and makes it so that I do not have to run the wand along the edge of the tube every time I apply the mascara . I would definitely buy this one again !	1
This mascara has a great deal going for it.Pros : Uniquely designed and shaped brush that does seem to comb thru lashesApplying a second coat enhancesLasts throughout the dayLooks naturalAppears to lengthenNon clumpingNon irritatingRemoves at night with any quality eye makeup removerCons : PriceIt may or may not be worth the extra dollars ... will compare with my other favorite brands and will update .	1
AINHOA Passion Mascara does the job and does well under water , but it does n't really stand out among other brands . The color is rich black that looks rich with great coverage . Nice soft brush that goes well with a great-looking case , which travels nicely with you wherever you go .	1
This is a great product , with a twisted brush for easy and full application with just one or two swipes , but I did have a slight problem with my eyelashes bunching together more than with other mascaras I 've tried . Besides that , though , this mascara does n't feel weighty or clumpy , and it was easy enough to remove at the end of the day . I have very sensitive eyes , and this one did n't both me at all .	1
OMG theres really a difference in this mascara . I love love love this . The brush is shaped differently which worried me for a moment but then I realized why it was useful . It goes on correctly without clumping and lasts all day too . The packaging is attractive and this product already has me addicted ! Full lashes with less fuss and I did n't need a sandblaster to get if off my face at night . Enjoy looking beautiful without hurting your eyelashes and skin !	1
I have been using this mascara for a week now to make sure I gave it a good trial before writing a review.On the plus side : - Goes on smoothly- Does n't clump- Lasts all day- Comes off easily at night ( I had one premium mascara that was so difficult to get off that I was losing eyelashes ! ) - Application wand - oddly shaped which took some time getting used to but once mastered , I think it is much better than the typical wand.On the negative side : - It does n't dry quickly when you apply it . I ended up smearing it all over my cheeks yesterday when I did other makeup too soon . MUCH slower drying that any other mascara I have used.- Price - I am not sure it 's worth the extra money	1
This mascara is amazing that it goes on flawless , it plumps your lashes , makes them long , plump , full , lush but it does not clump them and does not smear . Follow the directions and apply from the base to the very tip slowly and precise being careful to get each lash in careful long strokes . Let dry before you apply a 2nd coat if needed . I have thin almost nothing lashes . I used a metal lash brush seperator that I have of my own that I used just after applying the 1st coat when it was almost dry to make sure the 2nd coat would not clump and I barely needed a full 2nd coat . This covered fully , did not clump on the 2nd coat and lasted for several hours . I used this on New Years Eve Night and it did not smudge and I use mascara remover anyway and I always gentley remove any mascara I take off no matter what-you are to NEVER tug , rub hard no matter what you use on your eyes because over time this will lead to increased eye wrinkles I beleive . But this was very easy to take off . I do not beleive in using soap and water , is use only eye makeup remover and cotton balls on my eyes-soak ligthly and then very lightly stroke inwards toward eye . Follow with facial wash product and pat dry , do not rub dry . Will definately buy and use again .	1
I go through a lot of mascaras , my eyes are extremely sensitive and I have trouble finding eye products that do n't irritate me . AINHOA is fantastic , it did not irritate the slightest ! Even when I did the ultimate test - sleep in it . The mascara goes on well with the unique brush and has even distribution and is clump-free . I deducted one star because it did n't have as much lasting power as I would have preferred at this price point .	1
It should be noted that when it comes to cosmetics , I 'm not a name brand snob . In fact , my makeup bag of favorites includes several $ 2 products . So splurging on mascara like this is not something I would ordinarily do . My typical mascara isMaybelline Great Lash Mascara , Soft Black- .43 Fluid Ounce , which costs about $ 5 , or one-fifth the price of this Ainhoa Passion . Getting me to shell out that much more money would require some spectacular results . So how did the Ainhoa Passion fare in terms of my sky-high expectations ? The Packaging : Right out of the Amazon mailer , it was obvious Ainhoa aims to appeal to the aesthetic senses . Cased in a shimmering dark blue box , the mascara itself comes in a metallic silver tube . A nice bonus , but not something that justifies the elevated cost.The Brush : The brush is interesting . There 's an indentation that runs all the way around it about one-quarter of the way down . Even now , after using the product for a week , I 'm not sure what the purpose of this groove is . On the plus side , the mascara comes out of the tube without any globs . At no point have I had to scrape excess product off the brush onto the side of the tube , which I often have to do with my Maybelline Great Lash.The Application : I already have long lashes , so I need volume more than length . In fact , my Maybelline mascara often smears on my eyelid immediately after application because of the length of my lashes . That aggravating tendency did not happen with the Ainhoa . It went on silky smooth , with no clumps and no smudging . All of my lashes were separated without having to comb through them . I liked that . Another positive is that it goes on my lower lashes , which can be tricky , just as smoothly.The Durability : This product held up rather well throughout the day , even after rubbing my eyes . This surprised me . Since this mascara felt so lightweight , I thought for sure it must have worn away . I had absolutely no flaking or raccoon eyes while wearing this product and it comes off easily with soap and water . I 've also noticed that my lashes are n't quite as dry upon removal , almost as if the Ainhoa is conditioning them.Bottom Line : This is a quality product , but I use mascara to add volume and visual impact to my lashes . Cheaper products provide me with both of these aims . I do n't mind combing out a few clumps or wiping away a few smudges when the savings is $ 20 every time I need a new tube . The conditioning aspect has potential , however , so if this product were in the $ 12 to $ 15 price range , I might consider giving up my spendthrift ways for it .	1
PROS : I liked the way my lashes looked . It does make them look longer and fuller . The mascara went on smooth . I had no problems with clumps.CONS : I did end up getting mascara on my eyelids while I was putting it on . I hate that.4 STARS : I did like the effect but I was n't blown away . I prefer to use Loreal Double Extend . No clumps and no issues with mascara on my eyelids .	1
I really like this mascara ! The wand is thin enough that I do n't get mascara all over my upper lid , but it 's thick enough at the same time . It goes on evenly and smoothly and does n't smudge or run all day ! Easily washes off at night with simple soap and water . I have such a hard time finding a decent mascara - most of the time , the wands are too thick and I end up with it all over the place , or it goes on clumpy . Not with this one . Love it !	1
PASSION Mascara Volume Up comes in a beautiful silver container . I have never owned mascara that is packaged quite so lovely . However , the shape of the brush threw me . I thought I had a big clump of mascara on the brush and kept dipping it back into the container to get it off before I realized the brush is shaped like a very voluptuous woman . I do n't particularly like the way it brushes on . I find it awkward getting it onto my lashes . But , once I figured out how to use the brush , I liked the way it coats the lashes thickly , quickly . I have used so many mascaras in the past that you have to apply coat after coat just to get what the Passion Mascara Volume Up does in one application . I like the idea of having Vitamin E that is supposed to protect the eyelash . I do n't think I agree with the description that the `` brush separates and easily applies to every lash '' as I find the shape of the brush does not work well when I attempt to apply mascara in the inner corners of my eyes . But I like the idea of mascara that `` keeps your delicate lashes in excellent health . '' I will have to continue to use it to see if that claim is true . Overall , I do like this product and think that alot of women will as well .	1
Pros : does not clump , my sensitive eyes are fine with this product , does not run , nice black coverage.Con : The brush is a bit awkward , it is bushy and an odd shape.The mascara goes on smoothly but the brush is just strange . I have used fine mascara , trendy mascara , drug store brands and no this one . I will continue to use the mascara to see how it performs over the long haul . Even the expensive ones tend to clump after about a month . So far this one looks good all day and the brush does separate the lashes , I just can not figure out why it is so clumsy .	1
I recently ordered this mascara for my wife . Here is her review : '' One of the best mascaras I have ever used . Manages to be natural looking and glamorous at the same time . Did not irritate my sensitive eyes . Very easy to wash off with Cetaphil . Do n't even need to curl my eyelashes with it ! ''	1
Ainhoa Passion Mascara comes in a lovely , stylish silver container . The applicator is uniquely shaped and applies the mascara cleanly . The mascara does n't clump on the applicator or on my lashes . It does n't smudge or leave my eyelashes feeling hard and stiff . I liked the shape of the brush because it did leave my lashes separated . Initially I did think that this product would leave my lashes thick and long , but to be honest , I did n't really notice much of a difference . What I did notice was that this mascara gave my eyes a clean , polished look . Perhaps with repeated use , I will see some improvements in terms of the fullness of my lashes.Pros ( 1 ) Product contains vitamin E. ( 2 ) Mascara comes in an attractive container . The silver , sleek cylinder makes it look very expensive . ( 3 ) Uniquely shaped applicator allows you to apply the mascara evenly without clumps or smears ( a little but not so much that it is unattractive , it just makes them look fuller ) . ( 4 ) This mascara does n't feel heavy or thick . It goes on clean and even.Cons ( 1 ) Not sure if the average female would pay this amount for the product unless they are guaranteed some amazing results . For the money , I get the same or similar results from my over-the-counter mascaras ( L ' Oreal , Cover Girl , etc ) . The only difference was that some of the other products that I have used in the past will clump on the brush while this one has n't . ( 2 ) Maybe it 's me , but I notice that this mascara has a slight scent . I ca n't describe exactly what it smells like but I smell it when I open the container . However , never fear , you do n't smell it on your face . ( But if you are sensitive to smells , note that there is one.Overall , I am pleased with this product . The Pros outweigh the cons . I wholeheartedly give this product a 4 .	1
Normally when I wear mascara , I spend the day with irritated eyes and the next day I lose several eye lashes . I can not tolerate the waterproof mascara at all and so I normally end up with dark smudges under my eyes by the end of the day . This mascara goes on lightly . Look closely at the picture and you will see that the brush is a little different with longer bristles on the ends and shorter in the middle . The mascara applied evenly and stayed on with no dark smudges at the end of the day . I also had no irritation . When it was time to wash my face for bed , I had completely forgotten I had any mascara on . I am very happy with this mascara and recommend it to anyone with sensitive eyes like mine .	1
The Passion Volume Up Mascara is the first Ainhoa product I have ever tried . I 'm extremely impressed . The color is very rich and dark , and lends a gorgeous dramatic effect instantly . I did n't have any problem with `` spiky '' eyelashes.The makeup separates the eyelashes very well , although the mascara itself clumps toward the base of the eyelash . If you are n't careful , you 'll end up with tiny little clusters in your eye.Overall , I love the look Ainhoa gives . This truly is a pretty mascara that makes your lashes look longer , fuller , and darker instantly . Definitely recommended .	1
I have been loyally using Almay Pure Blends Mascara for about 2 years ... but it gets dry and crumbly , largely because I do n't take care of my makeup the way I should ( i.e . it sits in the car , so for a quarter of the year things get frozen and another quarter , they overheat ) .I also wear hard contact lenses - combined with mascara , this can be rough on the eyes.THIS STUFF IS AMAZING . Goes on buttery-smooth , light ( the Almay stuff is , at best , thick and clumpy , even when body-temperature . Anything colder than body temp and it 's too crumbly ) , perfect , easy to apply even on lower lashes . The shape of the brush is perfect , and it 's a high-quality one . The mascara stays throughout the day without feeling crusty or irritating my eyes - and it washes off fairly easily . No need for eye makeup remover - my regular face wash was enough to remove it.Having gotten this through Vine , I was hopeful of purchasing more ... and then I saw the price and almost fell over . No wonder it 's so great . I guess I 'll have to try a few more brands . But in the meantime , will I be keeping this in my car ? No .	1
This is a high quality mascara that applies just the right amount with NO clumping -- much better than any other mascara I 've used ! It has a unique wand unlike any I 'd seen before and I was surprised and impressed that it coated and separated every single eyelash . I 've always had to use an eyelash comb to separate and de-clump my lashes after applying other mascaras but not so with this one . Since I normally buy Brown Black mascara I was concerned that the Ainhoa Black would look too harsh but it was about the same shade of the brown black that I typically use . It washes off easily too . Definitely worth the price !	1
Most of the mascara I 've tried will make my eyes itch bt the end of the night , but not AINHOA . This was most welcome and the biggest plus of this mascara.It enhances my lashes nicely bringing attention to my eyes . I found I can layer it to extend add volume without for a more dramatic effect without creating a clumpy mess . The color was good for me and I welcomed the range of results I was able to create.The container is a rather conventional silver tube similar Lancme Mascara I had before . It is nice to pack and the cap with the wand feels nice in the hand when applying . The brush on the wand has a curved shape with shorter bristles at the center and longer toward the ends . I think it is to fit the curve of the lash line , but I do n't think it works as well as a simple taper would for me . I feel a taper design gives me better control when applying and seperating lashes.When applying AINHOA Passion I found there was some tendency to clump , but overall it went on very easily and cleanly . The bit of clumping was easily seperated and cleaned-up . The end of the brush seems to come out of the tube with a little blob of mascara on the end . A little touch on a tissue easily removed this.It lasted well for me . At the end of the night it was as nice as at the start . Removal was easy . I think it 's just shy of perfect and that makes it one of the best I 've used .	1
There is alot that I liked with this mascara . The brush is awesome at distributing the mascara , no clumps.. even came out looking good on my lower lashes . The mascara itself was creamy smooth in applying and dried fast enough that a couple coats took no time at all and made my eyelashes look longer and a bit thicker . Worn all day and no flaking or smudging . To tell the truth , I do n't take off my mascara at night..this stuff I can remove all traces of with my moisturizing cream in the morning , no problem . To buy this I would want a waterproof type , only because that 's what I prefer . I see that there are good ingreds like vitamin E..but really , is that absorbed through mascara ? I do n't pay $ 26 . for any of my mascaras and I 'm sure that I may give up some of the quality that this mascara has , but , I like L'Oreal and for the money right now , it 's a better deal : )	1
Love the price for this set . Ordered it as an & # 34 ; add on item & # 34 ; and was pleased . Let 's face it , it 's just some soap and shampoo but for the price point it was good . Came with the shampoo , bar soap , body wash and a small sponge thingy . For 7 bucks and change ca n't beat it .	1
Well worth the money . At Christmas time I bought this as a small gift to go with another one and it made such a big difference .	1
I already use the Dove Deep Moisture body wash and bought this because it came with a free body puff or whatever you call it and some soap and shampoo ( my sister uses the other stuff ) . The Dove Deep Moisture is great . I love it . I have a thyroid condition , so have dry skin . But with this , great deal . If you have any questions , just ask .	1
I , personally , love Dove and this was a great deal for the price ! Dove body wash works so well on my skin and has a light scent to it that just makes it perfect for me ! And the shampoo is one of my favorites . I would definitely recommend buying this as a gift for a friend or a well-deserved gift for yourself : )	1
I was looking for body wash then I ran of out shampoo too and of course I was going to need a puff for the body wash , this was an amasing deal for every here .	1
This is my favorite scent by Dove and since it was reasonably priced I bought it . It is packaged nicely so could be a gift if someone wanted to do that with it , but instead it is for me . All the products are full size bottles . The pouf for washing is smaller than what I now have but not that bad . The only thing I had to add was creme rinse as I always use that with shampoo . A nice set and a good price .	1
divine , beautiful , beautiful wig when use all have to ask where I got the color tones , believe or have the doubt if my hair . is strong , good fit , beautiful shine , haircut , fast shipping .	1
This wig looks almost exactly as pictured . The highlighting is slightly different in some areas . The blonde is a little darker than pictured and the second color is brown , not black . Other than that , it is shoulder length and layered giving it a natural look ! The only downside is the bangs . They are VERY thick and if not styled correctly , can give the wig that & # 34 ; fake hair & # 34 ; look so trim the bangs because they 're really long ! Other than that , the hair is soft and thin , but not too thin so you do n't have to worry about any of the netting showing . The wig cap has adjustable straps and is made of strong material , but light enough so that when you wear the wig , it does n't feel heavy on the head . At times , I felt like I was wearing my own hair ! : )	1
This is a very pretty wig.. a little avante gard , but it is good quality , and , made well.It stays on my head , very well , too.It does n't slip backwards at all . This is my husband 's favorite , and , really fun to wear . The only thing I really have to get used to , is the bangs.. They tend to get in my eyes , and bother me somewhat..I might decide to cut them.Just not sure yet . But this wig is very cute , and , it makes me feel sort of daring . lol The colors are a pretty , ashy , lighter blond , and black.. And , its so soft and silky . I have gotten SO many compliments on my `` new haircut ! : )	1
Most realistic wig and feeling . Its a bit thin but i like it that way and it dose not shed . The color shines and highlights are well mixed and gives it a classy or punk style depending how you style it . Not a huge fan of the bangs but they look great when I put clips in them . People will think this is your real hair and that its beautiful hair .	1
I travel for work and while gone I miss my needle roller . Others say this hurts , but I think if feels like scratching an itch . I use it on my face and neck almost every night and on my legs and buttocks as often as I remember before I dress after a shower . I have n't had it long enough to know if it is doing anything , but my face definitely looks brighter . I also have tried new face creams so I can not say it is this . On my legs it sometimes leaves scratches , but they are very superficial and are often gone by the next day , but maybe there for two days . I will try to remember to update this review once I have had it longer .	1
it takes time for this to work . I will have to update this later . I have high hopes for it .	1
All I can say is : do not spend a lot of money to needle . My first was much more expensive . And not anywhere near as nice as this . The needles are sharper and much easier to use . I will purchase again .	1
This derma roller is not the best however , for the price is good . I bought the 1.0 & 1.5 . The I.0 I use for my face is painless it does n't feel like needles at all . I 've used the 1.5 once in my stretch marks & it has gave me an allergic reaction or something my skin is very Itchy were I derma roll but I will continue to derma roll is weird because I use the 1.0 for my face & I have no problem .	1
I must admit that I do n't see a real difference in using this product . However , I am a big fan of Boots No7 Day Cream and Protect & Perfect Intense Serum , and I use this product in conjunction with those ; So maybe it 's a combination of all three that 's giving me the results I see ? ? ? So the way I see it , every little bit helps . This is a fantastic skin-care line .	1
Very oily and creamy . Not at all what I expected ... ordered this to try to highlight and contour and it just looked awful ! ! ! Plus , took FOREVER to arrive .	-1
I really ca n't tell what exactly this thing is . It 's not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid . And so far I tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face .	-1
PLEASE DONT DO IT ! this just rachett the palette size is not like in the picture , the colors go on sheer , slides on face like wax do n't expect your makeup to stay put with this one . just spend the money for the good stuff . 2 thumbs down	-1
Chalky , Not Pigmented , Wears off easily , Not a Coastal Scents Dupe , Too many highlighter colors , Does not show up on dark skinned women.I would not recommend.The coastal scents is currently on sale . It 's worth the few extra bucks .	-1
Did nothing for me . Stings when I put it on . I used the whole tube and it just did nothing , no Lightening , no Brightening , ... ... NOTHING . Also it tends to dry out my skin and made my face feel weird the next day . I stuck with it hoping it would LIGHTEN , ... ..but it did n't .	-1
Did nothing for my skin . Used as suggested and no signs of brightness . Wish it worked for me , but it did n't .	-1
This gell did nothing at all . I religiously put it on specific areas for weeks and nothing changed . DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME	-1
I used it for anal bleaching and it burned a bit there are no directions on it about time and how long to wear it	-1
I am not a perfume wearer , but I heard that this is very light and unlike any other perfume . I got this in the roll-on and I do n't care for it at all . Just like all other perfumes , it makes me nauseated . I 'll be giving this to a relative for Christmas .	-1
We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner . Had high hopes for it , and it did not deliver.The smell was okay.It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling , but not in a good way , more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.Even in using the conditioner , my hair still looked frizzy . And I do not have frizzy hair ! Mine is fine , thin , and straight . If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.Just can not recommend this product .	-1
I washed and conditioned 1 a week but did n't see much difference . No thickening . May work for thinning but I have actual loss of hair .	-1
Please avoid this product . The conditional is so thick that it does not flow out when you want to use it . As for quality , it is horrible . It makes your hair sticky as if you have n't rinsed your hair for days . I do n't see any good using it . I finally use Dove that I bought at Costco . It is cheaper and make your hair soft and weightless as well .	-1
I have thin fine hair and I am always searching for the `` miracle '' to a beautiful head of hair . This is not it . It may be organic and have less surfactants but , it 's the thinnest shampoo I 've ever used . Ca n't get it from bottle to hand to head without losing it down the drain . Stupid purchase . Oh well , next time .	-1
Rather than leaving my hair softer and more manageable ( which is a conditioner 's most basic function ) , this conditioner left a noticeable , waxy residue in my hair . I wonder if this gross waxy film is what makes your hair feel `` thicker and fuller '' . It does not glide on to hair very smoothly and smells like Pine Sol . Major disappointment . I wo n't be ordering this again and I would hesitate to try any other hair products offered by this company .	-1
I BOUGHT THIS Avalon Organics : Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner , 14 oz AND THE SHAMPOO AND USED IT DURING THE WHOLE 2012 AND NOT ONLY DID NOT THICKENED MY HAIR BUT IT MADE IT VERY DRIED .	-1
Product dried out my hair . I was disappointed since this is organic . I expected it to be better . But , Pantene works better than this and does not dry my hair out . Smell was ok . It was not overwhelming , but it did not smell great either . It did make my hair look thicker , but dried out .	-1
I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner . I had such high hopes , but in only two shampooings , my hair was noticeably stripped of oils , had that & # 34 ; squeaky clean & # 34 ; feeling you get when using a very harsh product , and it became dry and brittle . It started looking very dull . They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair , like orange oil and lemon oil . You might think because it says , 'oil ' that it might add to your hair 's shine , but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers . This product only damaged my hair . Avalon is only 70 % organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me . Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap . Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair . I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price , but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos , I ca n't imagine what it might do to yours . Although my hair is very fine , so perhaps ethnic girls , and women with coarser hair might benefit ? I honestly would n't recommend it . I 'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately , rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me , it blows Avalon out of the water . In just one shampoo my hair regained it 's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair . I ca n't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident . They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues , or who have an increase in DHT . You do pay more than double for that shampoo , but having something that supports your hair , improves the texture , and smells fantastic , was worth it to me . I 'm now quite confident in what I 'm using and plan to go on using it , regardless of the cost . I 'd pay 5x what I 'm paying for it now , I love it so much . And their treatment spray is oil based . I use the system twice a day and I 'm shocked at how long it is lasting . It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system . This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients , can only do so much . Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT . By helping to combat it twice a day , you have a better chance of seeing results sooner . This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on . Once a day just never cut it for me . Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight , can also work wonders . I use it during the day too if I 'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair , and your self-esteem , a little faster and more efficiently . : o )	-1
I was using these in my shower , but got tired of the pumps not working , especially with conditioner . It took so many pumps to get all the conditioner I needed . Worked great for shampoo . Anything thicker than shampoo , forget it . I went back to sticking with the bottles the shampoo and conditioner came in . Yes , it saved space in the shower , but I 'm standing in the shower for 10 minutes trying to get all the conditioner out .	-1
This is the second Better Living Classic Dispenser IV I 've purchased in the last twelve months and these things suuuuuuck . So why , you ask did I buy a second one ? ? ? Because one day recently as soon as I 'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles , one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces . I 'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid would n't have closed in the first place . Also , the unit was never bumped , jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose . So ... manufacturing defect ? I think so.Anyway , I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous , & # 34 ; we 'll send you one free of charge since it 's our crappy product 's fault. & # 34 ; Instead , I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts ( this is likely where they make most of their money ) . At over $ 5 for a cheap plastic bottle that I now know will shatter if dropped three feet , I was loath to buy one but basically had no choice . I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they do n't ship to military APO addresses ( which have California zip codes , BTW ) . I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost . Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break . Do yourself a huge favor and avoid Better Living products altogether as there are many other & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; options out there .	-1
I bought a similar type of dispenser back in 1995 , when I was outfitting my new apartment . Perhaps that was the Dispenser Classic I . That one lasted 11 years without a problem and I threw it out only because it looked old and I was moving . Flash forward to 2011 . I decided to buy one for my condo . A day or two after I put in the bottles , I noticed shampoo from the dispenser dripping onto the faucet . It turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it . It was tiny but enough to cause a serious leak . I examined the bottles closely and realized how thin and cheap the plastic containers really are . Unbelievable . Now I have to decide whether to use Crazy Glue or go through the hassle of emptying the two other containers and sending the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund . If this is the Classic III , I wonder how bad IV will be . I 'd be hesitate to order this again .	-1
I have long , thick , and straight hair . I bought this curling iron because I wanted to curl my hair for special occasions . This curling iron does n't curl my hair much at all . All it does is make a little wave at the very end of my hair and that is when it 's set to the highest setting . Pass this curling iron , especially if you have hard to curl hair .	-1
It gets too hot and is hard to handle without burning myself . It will go out for a garage sale .	-1
I like the size of the barrel on this iron and I like the results I got with it . However the design of the kickstand and its location are horrible and unsafe.When you heat the iron up on the higher settings the kickstand gets very , very hot and it 's very difficult to use the iron without touching that kickstand because of where it 's located . I burned my hand on it while holding the iron and then I burned my face with the kickstand while curing my hair.I 'm not at all happy with this product and I 'm returning it after using it only twice .	-1
I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron ! I ordered it on amazon because of the great price . It did not come in the packaging I 'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase ( last year ) . The first time I used it it worked great . The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me . I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.I re-ordered thinking it was just a defective one and the second time , it would n't even heat up enough to hold a curl . I think Conair has changed it 's product and I will not buy again .	-1
I asked my husband to go out and get me a curling iron with a fat barrel and this is what he got me . It has a large barrel , it heats up extremely quickly , and it has automatic shut-off . Those are some definite pluses , but there are a few things that bother me . The barrel is short compared to my other curling irons . The stand gets in the way , though I can fold it back ; and the the way the handle is designed , it 's not comfortable to hold . I accidentally change the heat settings just trying to curl my bangs.It works , but all the little details make this my least desirable curling iron of all time .	-1
It wo n't curl my hair . I set it at 15 and I wait and wait and wait and my hair falls flat . My hair can curl with curling irons but not this one !	-1
The pencil part is so hard I can not line the rim of my eyes at all and it 's also difficult to use it on my eyelids . It 's fine for the eyebrow if that 's all you want it for .	-1
This is not doing the job I thought it would . Should an emergency occur I may try it again , but to date it has fallen below my expectations.It is hard to apply to the actual area where it is needed and seems only to want to cover ( and stick to ) unblemished skin ... which is kind of useless .	-1
I picked up this concealer to cover up acne , blemishes , pimples , the works . I was trying to decided between this one and the light one but decided to go with this one as the green is supposed to cancel out the redness . This stick concealer is near impossible to blend to a nice finish and it leaves a sticky and waxy residue on your skin . As to no surprise , the packaging is just as flawed as the product itself . Within a week of using this product the concealer stuck to the top of the tube and I could n't get it out . Ick !	-1
It is very hard to blend in to your skin . I have to add moisturizer to it in order to blend it in . Will not buy again .	-1
I 'm no expert at beauty , so this is just one regular user 's experience . However , I put it on and it stayed green , which had me worried . I blended it , and could see the blemish ( red ) peeking through , while the green remained stubbornly green . Given that it 's a stick of concealer , it 's a little insulting to think I did it wrong . Nevertheless , I removed it and tried again . Same result.So I went ahead and did my usual powder foundation/settling veil powder routine , and lo and behold - I could still see the blemish AND the green through my makeup.I 'm not really sure what 's going on . Perhaps I 'm using the wrong color concealer ? Either way , it really did n't behave or perform the way I expected or hoped it would . Good thing it was cheap because it has been sitting , unused in a drawer since day 1 .	-1
I purchased this product to conceal redness . Unfortunately , it cakes so much that it ca n't be blended . On any area where there is not a spot of redness , this product actually makes you look green . Just try to blend it -- if you can imagine trying to budge a layer of crayon mixed with cake frosting smoothly over your skin . Not happening . Also , the scent is a bit unattractive , almost like some kind of clay . Not for me .	-1
I had been usingSheer Cover SHEERCOVER duo concealer LIGHT/MEDIUM 3gthat was gifted to me but when I ran out a couple of months ago , and did n't want to shell a load of money , I decided to try OTC versions.Overall , this version provides 'okay ' coverage but it 's not as dark as I 'd consider 'Medium Beige ' . It 's more like Fair or light Beige . The product is creamy and blends well enough and it lasted for most of the day but I do have dry spots and it could end up looking flaky . I use a mineral or loose power over my foundation and concealed spots but it was a nightmare on any delicate areas where my fine lines exist , such as around the eyes , mouth , nose and even the chin area , made for a scary end result when using loose or mineral powder over it . In other words , the lines become more prominent and it looked really caky , especially under my eyes to cover the circles . It was obvious I was wearing concealer no matter where I was using it . It did best on the smoother planes of my face , just not in the spots I needed the coverage.The lipstick tube shape makes for an easy application and control , but that 's all I really liked about it . Waterproof ? Meh . For the price and results , I was n't impressed and will throw out this one and try something new .	-1
This does n't blend into the skin well and it do n't seem to cover my redness any better than a regular concealer . If you use too much it also leaves a green hue to your face so you have to be very careful . I would n't recommend for large areas .	-1
Unless you have very fair skin , this concealer is to light for Asian color skin . It does n't blend very well with your foundation and looks caky on your face .	-1
So i was pretty excited that i got this in the mail , but seriously ... ..i think its just the color of mine , i do n't know , not good cover stick ... Received it sticking to the top ... so basically it was broken when i opened it because of the air mail looks very pasty ... very white i shall say ... im never buying this product ever..	-1
I have a lot of redness on my face , so I thought I would try this concealer . It is so hard and dry that you pull your skin applying it , especially around the tender eye area . It needs to be a bit creamer to be able to spread . Maybe I got an old one ? ? Anyway , wo n't bother to buy this again .	-1
Ok but am not using it . Does n't seem to cover the scar on my face like I thought it would . Possibly my skin is to fair for it . Just not satisfied .	-1
Not my favorite eye makeup remover ... . It is a bit oily and I was still left with raccoon eyes after using it . I will not purchase this kind again	-1
It does remove most of my eye makeup but not all . When I use it , it seems to remove it all but then I wash my face and see black mascara rings under my eyes . I 'm using as directed , so I feel it 's not that effective . Also , it is moisturizing but too 'oily ' for me . I find myself wiping my eyes on my face towel but still feel a residue around my eyes . I think it 's all right but I would n't purchase again . Almay 's makeup remover pads did a much better job but they were somewhat drying ... so I 'm still on the lookout for an ideal mascara remover	-1
I am not trying to make advertise for the Mary Kay one I was just using it before I bought this Maybelline branded one , this one can do nothing with my waterproof Eye mascara also this bottle is so small , can be only used as a trave sized item ! !	-1
This eyeliner was completely useless . It felt like the inside of the bottle was dried out or the liner was just so light and useless that you could n't even see it . Also , the brush sucks . Overall , terrible .	-1
I heard that this eyeliner had super staying power , and it was super cheap , so I decided to give it a try.This stuff is awful . It smells bad , and the brush is kind of gloppy . I 've been wearing eyeliner for years ( gel is my preference ) , but this stuff was awful especially once it dried . It dried into this plastic strip on my eye , and it just felt awful .	-1
I tried this because honestly it was n't that expensive , but I found the brush applicator to be a DISASTER to apply , it went all over my eye except where I was aiming it to go , not good ! ! ! ! its like a long thin nail polish brush tip at the end , I had no control over the brush because of that ! this is a disaster in a bottle for me	-1
Goes are great ! Unfortunately , the tip is n't a felt tip , its more like a mini-paint brush , so it tends to get all over if you 're not careful.Pros : *Great color ( for a little while ) *Dries QuicklyCons : *Smudges*Rubs off easily*Do n't recommend with OILY eyelids	-1
The brush for this eyeliner is horrible . I LOVE brushes , and prefer them over felt tips but this is the exception . The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft . It 's hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place . Additionally , when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries , it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering . I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was but this is a total fail .	-1
I feel bad giving this two stars- because it really is my fault that I do not like this . I have a hard time doing the quick swipe across the eyelid and typically do short strokes from corner of the eye out , but you need to be fast with this one . It dries too quickly for me and going over , even slightly , removes it or makes it clump up .	-1
For having a bunch of promises about how well it 'll work , this bottle is only about a two-week supply , and it makes no difference in anything -- sweat , breath , etc . Save your money and just use perfume and lots of soap and mints !	-1
I dont like this stuff at all . I dont feel fresh . I have tried other brand that actually works . I will be going back to that one . Very disappointed : - (	-1
The smell is so bad and it honestly reminds me of moth balls , which I can not stand . I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis , and only have a few small patches on my scalp . Decided to try this stuff , bought it at a local grocery store because I had a $ 2 off coupon . It seems to help a little , but honestly , I just ca n't stand the smell . Along with the smell , the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty , not greasy or dry , just weird . When trying to style my hair after using this , I have really bad results . So if you have very short hair and do n't need any body in your style , this may not be a problem for you . If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style , go for it . Would never buy this again and I try never to waste stuff , so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo , to help hide the smell . I am doubtful that it will work , but may give it a try .	-1
This product burns my scalp and doesnt get rid of my dandruff.Ive tried cutting down my use of this product so that I wouldnt cause irritation to my scalp but Im deciding to give up on it because I dont need to be in pain when I wash my hair for no results anyway.I have contacted the company because I am that unsatisified with this product . Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make .	-1
I was instructed to use this 3-4 times a week . It has Not cleared up my dandruff . In despiration I switched to Selson blue deep cleasning shampoo with deep cleasning beads . The selson blue works so much better . I am sticking with the selson blue . My dandruff is not an issue now . This coal tar shampoo did n't do anything for it . A waste of money for me .	-1
I am usually not sensitive with the smells . I am talking about I was never bothered by the Selsun Blue Shampoo smell or even the Blue bottle of Head and Shoulders and they are pretty strong ( that medicated smell lingering on your scalp ) . BUTTTT ... this shampoo is over-the-top smelly and after three days , I could not stand that burning rubber stench on my scalp . I totally understand it 's made partly with tar but I am sure even if you are n't phased by the smell yourself , others might go.. '' Whoa '' . On the first or second day , after a trial/change of shampoo , I would feel my hair or scalp `` feel '' a bit better ( not 100 % , but FEEL ) . I felt like my hair smelled really bad and scalp got a bit more inflamed but that could just be me , individually . If you are out of options beyond the usual scalp treatment shampoos , give it a try , it might work for you . The smell was obviously the factor to say NUH UH for me.By the way , I did n't experience extreme dandruff ( the type that flakes all over clothes ) . I just noticed for the past days , my scalp had patches of red and it was sort of scaly and it had a tad of itchiness . It could have been some weather changes or something but I am better now after going back to the usual OTC dandruff shampoos .	-1
I bought a bottle of this , and they sent me two , by accident I imagine . I have psoriasis , with a few spots on my scalp . Hoped this would help out , but I did n't see a difference , I used both bottles , and let it soak in my hair for plenty of time when showering . Did n't see any results . Decent shampoo though , hair feels clean .	-1
I bought this because the price was good . I was using a store brand for the same item , but since the price was good , thought I would try the name brand . I hated the smell ! It is so bad ! I went back to the store brand .	-1
I very badly want to leave this product a good review , but in the interest of honesty , here goes ... I bought this shampoo solely on the basis of excellent reviews . Many of the reviewers mentioned this product 's ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp . This was my concern too . A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair ( not my scalp ) feel really really clean- it would even squeak when I would squeeze out the water , post-shower . So , I was excited about how well it worked and how quickly.But I noticed within a day of using it that I now had a problem I never had before : flakes ! So many of them , and so disgustingly visible ! Further , after a day of washing , my scalp got extremely oily- more so than it did before . Still , I 've been using it and giving it a chance , at least until I am done with this entire ( small ) bottle.I am about half way through the bottle , washing my hair every other day , and have experienced the same results consistently . However , I will use it until the bottle is empty , and if results change , I will update this review . I am hoping the negative results are just an initial reaction to new treatment . If anyone else has had this reaction and wants to share any tips , I 'm all ears !	-1
I buy the DHS fragrance-free shampoo and love it ( DHS Clear Shampoo , Fragrance Free - 8 fl oz ) . I bought this along with it the first time . Unfortunately , I 'm highly chemically sensitive and could n't use this product because it still has a chemical smell . The shampoo has no discernible smell to me .	-1
This is too light ... did n't do anything for my hair . I also found the shampoo terrible ... left my hair dry . I would n't recommend it .	-1
Williams Lectirc Shave is a great product that has served men 's electric shaving needs for several decades ! BUT DO N'T buy it here ! WHY ? I did n't pay close enough attention to the prices vs weight and when it arrived I was really angry ! This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $ 2.50 , NOT $ 5.62 ! ! ! For $ 5.48 - $ 5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain . DO N'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER ! ! YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET ! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE . RIP OFF ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I bought this Extra gentle sponge in search of a certain texture . I seems like a great sponge but it just too rough for my sensitive skin . I ended up using this as a body sponge so as not to waste my purchase .	-1
It has sylisic Acid in it..It 's really hard on your skin . My Skin was in horrible shape after I used this..	-1
I like putting on face lotion before I put my makeup on . This lotion just does n't feel like it even moisturizes your face ) : stopped using after one use	-1
As the title says , it broke me out really bad . I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here and there ( that time of the month , stress ) but I needed just a bit more of moisture so I decided to try this moisturizer -- BIG mistake . I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots . I can not tell you how upset I was and how itchy my face was . I hate this product and would not recommend this to somebody who has acne-prone , sensitive , oily skin.I only gave it a star because I could not give it zero stars !	-1
I have combination skin and have been using this daily for the past 2 weeks . However , there has n't been any noticeable difference on my skin . I still break out , and my dark spots do n't seem to be going anywhere soon . It moisturizes okay ( nothing special ) , but in terms of treating pimples , this dual-action product leaves its promise unfulfilled .	-1
Seems to rub in well but after about an hour or two my face is greasy all over . After a long time I realized it was this product . I gave it away .	-1
Between this Neutrogena Spot Treatment and Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum , there is no contest ! The Oxy works and the Neutrogena does not , pure and simple . I have only the occasional pimple these days , but want a treatment that quickly dries up the oil and inflammation . The Oxy costs more but is worth the price , the Neutrogena does nothing ( as far as I can tell ) as a spot treatment . A better medicine will prevent scarring and disfiguring marks on your face ! Early application of effective medicine can stop an emerging blemish before it becomes much worse . The Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum did a far better job for me .	-1
Everyone has different skin , but mine tends to dry out and get easily irritated . I thought Neutrogena On-the-Spot would be a good solution because of the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide . Unfortunately the product made my skin red and flaky , so much so that it is taking a few days for my skin to get back to normal . I usually have pretty good luck with Neutrogena products , but I think I 'll be getting my skin care items elsewhere .	-1
I hate this stuff ! It did n't do anything to help my acne . All it did was make my skin so painfully sensitive all over ! I wish I could get a refund . I used it for a good week . I have hormonal acne , and this had no impact on it . It was as if I 'd put nothing at all on ( aside from the horrible dryness and burning ) .	-1
These recent reviews are correct.I never tried the past formula but this one is no good.I did n't care for it the first couple times I tried it , but I had to give this another shot because my usual moisturizer ran out . I was slow in picking that one up because it 's $ 15 ( pretty pricey but oh so worth it ) . I should have just broke the bank because this stuff broke my face.I was wondering why I was breaking out more than usual . I typically break out along my lower cheeks , but it was spreading to my temples and forehead.I just bought my usual moisturizer yesterday , and I already see an improvement overnight . It 's gon na take a couple weeks to get rid of the mess this caused , I 'm sure.Seriously , try to look for a more natural product . Do n't waste your time & money on this.On a good note for Purpose , I do use their gentle cleansing wash which is A-OK !	-1
This product is really runny and watery . I do n't like the consistency of it and does not seem to clean my face as well as other products . I think I will stick to expensive facial cleansers , such as philosophy	-1
I really have only one complaint ; so far as I can tell , in essentials , this bar cleanser is much the same as it ever was , but I could SWEAR that the bar I used several years ago was fragrance-free . I know I would never have even tried it if it had smelled like this then . I mean , part of the Cetaphil brand 's selling point is that its skincare products have no fragrance added to them that would irritate sensitive skin . So why does this Cetaphil product have any fragrance at all ? I usually have no problems with lightly-scented skincare products , provided they are only LIGHTLY scented . I 'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients , but I still have to avoid most of them because for me , strong perfumes set off major migraines . Other than that , some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice . But this ... THIS was like my worst nightmare of every ancient , long-expired bottle of old-lady perfume dumped into a single bar . It 's intolerable . I could n't even just throw it away ; it still stunk up the whole bathroom from the bathroom trash can . I ended up taking it straight outside to the dumpster . And I still had to empty the half-full bathroom garbage to get rid of that sickening , cloying , unbearable scent that sparked off a 2-day migraine.Maybe I 'm just missing something obvious . I would appreciate it if someone could let me know IF Cetaphil still makes a fragrance-free bar soap/cleanser . I 'd like to go back to using an old favorite , but I ca n't find the `` old '' favorite .	-1
I 've been looking for a soap to clear my breakouts and this one was kind of a disappointment . I used it on my body and my face , and did n't get the results I was hoping for at all . It was n't the worst soap I 've tried , but it 's low on the list .	-1
I am so unhappy with this item , I oredered it because It said 100 % aloe , I fell for thepackage info , this is n't 100 % aloe , and when I put it on my face after a derma roll , oh my god , it burned , real aloe does n't burn , because I have used other brands and real aloe . I am returning this , Ica n't believe the waste of money and time getting it through the mail . consumers need tostop deceiving to sell . : (	-1
UHG . How did I fall for & # 34 ; 100 % Gel. & # 34 ; Yuck . As another reviewer pointed out , that does not mean 100 % Aloe ... I tried to use this once , but it just did n't even feel right . Waste of money ! ! !	-1
This product does come with warnings and you should heed them . I used it and noticed immediately that my skin did not like it . It probably is a great product but not on my skin .	-1
I bought several of the Alpha Hydrox line of products and there are a few I really won & # 34 ; t buy again . This is one of them I do not like the consistency of this product . The night replenishing cream is much better .	-1
Alpha Hydrox might as well close it 's doors . I do n't know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price . Now they cost twice what they did then , understandable with inflation , but do n't work worth a darn . Yet another epic fail . I am so disappointed in this product line . I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage . They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion ... here you go . They are just like any other plain old lotion .	-1
You can not use this under make up you can not use this at all . Now I sound like Dr. Suess lol . It peels off as you rub it in I was not happy w/ this at all	-1
I have been searching for a lower cost alternative to DDF 's glycolic acid cleanser and I ordered this one . I found the product to be so weak as to not make much difference in how clean and clear my face was after using it .	-1
Got a very bad rush from it . I might have very sensitive skin.Used it two days and I started noticing my face was itching and a small swelling near my cheeks . I thought it was something I ate or just a bad day.I continued using face wash for 3 days and rash would n't go away . I stopped using it and notice rash disappeared . This is just my experience.I was worried that since is a care product I would n't be able to return it and that I was stuck with the face wash but Thanks to the great customer service of Amazon I was able to get a refund and dispose of the face wash .	-1
I purchased this product because I was so impressed with the Alpha Hydroxy Face Lotion , as it leaves my skin bright and clear and I have minimal break outs , so I figured the facial wash would do the same.. So I stopped using my normal face wash and I used this product instead for about a month and I noticed more irritation if anything ... It was n't really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal . I thought using the both in conjunction would just work best but I 'm starting to think my skin is too sensitive and can not take too much of the same thing ? I am not quite sure ... but I 'm going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion . Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin.. They just tone it.. and I think I need more exfoliation or I wish they had exfoliation beads in this product.. Maybe it would 've worked better ? Idk..	-1
I had high hopes for this product because of all the amazing reviews , but it really let me down ! I switched over from Bliss No Zit Sherlock face wash because this one was cheaper but unfortunately I 've experienced horrible breakouts ever since . My pores are clogged and I 'm getting zits all around my hairline and chin.I would n't recommend this product to anyone who has acne . Very disappointed !	-1
I have suspicions that this may be a counterfeit . I purchased this because it was rated so high . After washing and drying my face , my face starts to burn . I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning . I have also noticed some dry patches on my face since beginning to use this . Finally , my face burns during the day if I happened to sweat outside.All three of these experiences are new to me . I have never experienced any of these things with any other cleanser .	-1
I have very sensitive facial skin prone to acne . I began using this night and day , as directed , for about 1 week . It cleanses well and thoroughly , but after about a week of usage ( washing twice a day ( as indicated in directions ) , I developed dry skin with red rosacea-like patchy bumpy areas on my skin . I think washing twice a day or even once a day with this cleanser , may be too much for very sensitive skin . It may be OK to use a few times a week during the night . After stopping using it , I continued to have red patches and bumps on my skin which took about a few weeks to heal . If your skin is NOT sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid , it may be OK to use , but I have decided after using this , that my skin must be sensitive to the ingredients , so I returned it.Note : you should make sure to wear a good sunscreen since using any products with AHA ( alpha hydroxy acid ) can make your skin more sensitive to the sun .	-1
I was eager to try this after such high recommendations . I was hoping it might help get rid of the post-acne red marks on my very pale sensitive skin . Unfortunately this was waaay too drying ( even for my relatively oily skin ) and gave me a terrible reaction right away . It made me break out in painful rash like bumps on my face . I think I must just be allergic to AHA ... I know it works amazingly for others , but just wanted to share my experience .	-1
I do n't think my skin is overly sensitive or anything but this product caused my neck to start burning and itching , I had to wash the product off of my neck immediately.It also caused my face to break out , I gave it a few tries to see if my skin just needed to get used to it but my skin was not happy.For me this was a waste of money . It also has this chemical smell that even my fiance noticed after I put it on.I would not recommend this .	-1
didnt like it i prob will keep it and later throw it out or give my mum see if it works for her was waste of money !	-1
read the reviews and tried it . used for a month and saw no difference at all . i am over 60 with a few fine lines on my face . i really like dr graf the best which really showed a big improvement on my skin	-1
Should n't really comment because I stopped using this after a week . it stung my face a little . I started using Jan Marini 's Bioglycolic face lotion , a little more expensive but great product .	-1
If you want to live your life like a vampire ... this is the right product for you ! Why ? Well , I found out the hard way , Glycolic Acid increases your skins sensitivity to the sun . A warning was issued on the lable , but silly me did n't think it would be that big of a deal . I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min . of sun exposure ! YIKES ! Not worth it.It does , however , improve the look of the skin , the price is great , and there is no fragrance ( YAY ) . BUT , like most beauty products , it has dimethicone , which is an acne irritant . If you have horrible acne like me , dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you ! Find something with out it ! If you do n't , than this might work nicely for you . Dimethicone is bad no matter what , but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne .	-1
This product did n't say whether it could or could not be used on the face , however , I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA . It broke me out on the forehead and scattered acne on my cheeks and jawline . I recommend acne.org 's AHA lotion . I 've been using ACNE.ORG 's skin line for a year and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly . I actually had to go back to it and it cleared my acne up again .	-1
The product arrived in a timely manner , but the packaging it was in could use some improvements . First of all , it came one of those yellow manilla envelopes lined with bubble wrap . Inside , the product box was crushed . I believe the seller should start shipping the product in a small box instead of an envelope to prevent this from happening in the future.Secondly , the product I received did not match the one in the picture . The one in the picture seems `` newer '' - newer , more modern packaging and font . The one I received looked like a lotion bottle from the 90 's . I 'm not sure if I received an outdated product or it was just in outdated packaging , but the lotion itself left much to be desired . I followed the instructions and applied the lotion to a clean face , morning and night . My face looked really smooth in the morning when I first woke up ... until I had to wash it again and reapply the lotion . It made my face red and made all my imperfections stand out more . Definitely will not be buying/using again .	-1
I usually use luxury products . A beauty book convinced me to try this . I found it sticky and smelly . Did n't use long enough to see if it worked or not . Back to my Kiehl 's , Lush , Dermatologica , and Origins staples .	-1
I do n't know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely . I thought maybe it was just the face wash so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews but it was horrible . First , it does n't blend well into the skin . Within two days of using it I have acne all over my face , blackheads and huge cysts . I definitely would n't recommend this to anyone who has acne . There are waaayy better products , like Bliss No Zit Sherlock.Edit : I had 2 people say this review was `` unhelpful '' so maybe I should clarify . I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all , I 've never had a rash or any type of allergic reaction to a face product before . Maybe this is an allergic reaction , there 's a first time for everything ! Personally , I just think this product is not good for people who have acne , but it could just be me .	-1
This product seems to be doing its job , my skin is soft and smooth and feels great ! However the downside would be the smell of this product . It 's not horrible ... just unpleasant . The offensive odor does n't linger overly long , it 's mostly gone within 15-30 minutes , but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this product.I also purchased the Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Cream , which has almost no odor at all .	-1
I bought this to try because it seemed to have some good active ingredients at a fair price . Alas , as I already know , you get what you pay for . First , the smell is pretty off putting , but that 's not the deal breaker for me . What I really dislike is the watery texture and how it seems to just sit on my skin in white streaks that do n't seem to absorb so much as dry on the face . This just feels icky yo use before bed and it 's definitely not right for under makeup . Once it finally dries , it does sort of tighten the skin , but leaves it feeling sort of tuggy , not soft and smooth.I am generously giving this 2 stars because at least it does n't seem to cause any adverse reactions .	-1
I have what is called kp on my upper arms after the birth of my third child . I read the reviews and was so excited this could be the answer to my prayers ! ! ! ! ! Wrong answer , it did not go away and worst of of looks like it got worst ... I would not advise anyone who wants to buy this for kp , it did n't work for me ... ... ..	-1
I used this twice and had to give up . After using it , I got horribly painful cystic pimples . Not sure if it 's supposed to work like that , but it 's not worth it to me . Wish the seller would refund me , but no luck.I just started using a 40 % glycolic peel and it 's already worked 200 % better than this . If you can handle an at home peel , I suggest it !	-1
I tried this product because I feel like I 've tried everything else for my acne prone skin . While other people reported great results , I did not see any improvement .	-1
I 'm trying to find someone that I know that I can give this to . It did nothing for me . I have other products that I 'm using now that I can tell a difference from right away this lotion did nothing .	-1
I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne . I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me . I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference . It 's on par with using 2 % salicylic acid , which does n't do much . I wo n't be repurchasing this as I do n't feel it 's worth the money.My products : Morning- 15 % Benzoyl Peroxide face wash , 1 % clindamycin lotion ( prescription ) Afternoon - 1 % Clindamycin lotionNight - 10 % Benzoyl peroxide creamI tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off . It 's better than using nothing but barely .	-1
AHA products break some people out terribly , and that 's what happened to me . At least now I know to be extra wary of AHA . I used it for a month , and reduced the number weekly applications once my face started freaking out . Unfortunately it did not get better from there . Based on the research I did prior to purchasing , this is probably a good product to buy if you already know AHA does n't give you evil acne , and you do n't mind a bunch of parabens .	-1
Did n't like the texture of this lotion . I was using it to remove my make up and did n't have any success . I would wash my face with it , then use Bioderma Sensibio H2O and I could see all the makeup I had left on my face . I gave it to a friend that uses it in the morning .	-1
I have normal skin with very minor `` acne '' this mosturizer made my face look so greasy . If you have extreme dry skin then this is totally for you .	-1
Uhh , did I get a bad batch ? I love Cetaphil 's face wash , but this was a dud . I could n't use it on my face because it made me break out . It also was impossible to blend into the skin , leaving a white film for a few minutes until it soaked in on its own . When it did soak in it left a sticky feeling on my skin . Cetaphil failed me here .	-1
I do n't know why people use crap like this.It is full of chemicals that I would not put on my body because those chemicals you put ON your body go into your body.So what does one use instead ? Well just about EVERY brand you can buy online or at the drugstore uses bad ingredients.So it 's better to use natural stuff like : shea butterCoastal Scents Unrefined Shea Butter , 16 Ouncejojoba oilorganic coconut oilYou can easily mix this stuff together and make your own 100 % natural and CHEAPER creams and oils for your face and body and not risk getting cancer from all those bad chemicals.Check out this info : beautyoffood.com/ ? hop=nfopowerUnfortunately the `` beauty industry '' will put any crap into a product if it will make your skin look or feel better but they do n't give a dang about how it might affect your overall health.Do n't be a chump , use your own cheaper better creams and oils - some stuff like cucumbers which you can rub on your face , are So cheap and work better than anything !	-1
This product was delivered on time , however , it made me breakout more . I got more blemishes after using this stuff.It seems to have a greasy feel to it . I found that & # 34 ; Suki pure facial moisture-balancing moisturizer & # 34 ; works much better . It 's very mild on the skin and did not make me breakout .	-1
This product is decent if your skin is mildly dry , but it does n't effectively heal the skin of the moderate-high dry-flaky kind . Even after I apply this to my face or neck , where my skin is dry and flaky , it 's as though it dismally staved off and forestall the inevitable shedding of the skin . I apply this `` liberally '' both in the morning and at night , like it suggests , but have n't had impressive results . I gave this product two stars , because it is decent against mild-dryness , but that 's the limit of Cetaphil 's capability . Also , I will admit , one jar lasts me a very long time . Even after applying a liberal amount , twice a day , it 's taken me months to topically consume the entire jar . It 's probably the most long-lasting/durable product I 've possessed . But there may be a reason for this . One reviewer noticed that his did n't contain a foil seal and may have been a counterfeit product . Looking back , I also do n't remember ripping open a foil seal on mine .	-1
I do n't hate or like this product , but it has n't benefit meAnd I would n't purchase it in the future .	-1
This lotion is the worst lotion that I have ever bought because it leaves my hands sticky and gross feeling . It 's a useless lotion because after I apply it , I have to wash my hands because I ca n't stand that sticky and gross feel . Urg ! ! Going back to ucerin .	-1
Wow this stuff is garbage . I am so perplexed by all the great reviews . I have very fair , sensitive skin with mild/moderate acne . I have been looking for a good facial moisturizer for years and thought this would be my answer . Nope . It 's not a cream , it 's runnier than regular lotion and upon application it feels like a gel . After 10 minutes it feels like I put nothing on my face , in fact it makes my face feel a little tight . I look in the mirror and see dry patches . I am so disappointed , I just ca n't trust reviews anymore . Only good thing about this product is that it has no fragrance and does n't irritate my skin .	-1
I have used the cream all the way to the end . It caused my skin to break out . I will not buy this item again .	-1
you can put make up on after you put on this lotion on . it will cause he make up ( eyeliner or shadow ) smearit is expensive too for just a tiny tubewill not buy again	-1
Given all the great reviews I was disappointed in this cream . It was heavy and left my greasy . The SPF smell is horrible . Cause me to break out and made my roseaca flare up . I could probably use this as a cream for my hands when going to the beach but that 's about it .	-1
I have asked 50 dermatologist about this lotion . Not one of them knows what it is ! It was hard for me to believe anyone recommended this lotion . I saw no hydration . Absolutely none ! I have very dry mature skin . Save your hard earned money ! Do n't spend it on hype !	-1
This applies smoothly and feels good on my skin right after application but it ends up making my skin feel oily and greasy . This breaks me out when I use it on my face but I do n't want to let the tube go to waste so I started using it on my neck . It does n't irritate my neck because my skin is n't as sensitive there .	-1
I have oily acne prone skin and I started getting fine lines around my eyes . I usually like Neutrogena products but this one is a dud . First , it does n't lather at all . I 've had an issue w/ it actually sliding off my hands a few times since it does n't lather . Second it has a weird smell . Third it does n't work . I 'm delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all . Plus my skin is still oily and I 've broken out several times since I started using it . After this bottle I 'm done . I 'm in the market for something new .	-1
The product information says that it may cause some irritation , and it did . I 'll try using it once or twice a week , but I need a moisturizer I can use every night , so I wo n't buy this again .	-1
I have very dry skin and tried this after all the great reviews . I am sad to report that this is not as emollient or humectant as my skin needs to find comfort . The oil feels nice and it spreads well . It takes a while for it to absorb even though it is lightweight , but that did n't bother me . I thought an oil would be extremely moisturizing , but my skin did n't feel or look very hydrated at all . In fact , it felt equally as dry ( as if I had applied a dry oil ) with a bit of a sheen . With a cream or lotion , the skin smoothes and plumps up with moisture . I tried this bc I was looking for something like that but even more effective , but this does n't work . I may try this under a thicker lotion or cream to see if it adds anything as un under-layer . On it 's own , it is not effective.UPDATE ON PREVIOUS REVIEW : I have found that using it in the shower helps it absorb into the skin without leaving a dry oil residue behind . However , even when I tried it with the matching lotion on top , it still did not fully hydrate my dry skin . I 'll try it again in the summer .	-1
PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT . PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER , PER ONCOLOGISTS . DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS . SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS !	-1
Not an effective moisturizer ( for me , anyway ) . It feels and smells perfectly nice . After use , my skin feels even drier and itchier than it did before I used it ; it also seems to create a barrier on my skin : lotion applied after the oil ( later in the day , for example ) does n't help at all . Looks like I 'll be getting rid of this and going back to a shea butter-heavy lotion .	-1
I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin , but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily . The lotion itself is very thin . Instead of my normal one application , with this lotion I need to apply twice , otherwise my face is dry and flaky -- once after getting out of the shower , and another time before putting on my make up . The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion , but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount .	-1
I purchased this facial moisturizer recently , as well as farther back a year or so . Both times I have ended up returning it , mind you I did n't purchase this on Amazon , but rather stores in-person at stores like Walmart and Target . This moisturizer says it is hypo-allergenic although I do n't buy it . I am allergic to basically everything and rely on mainly baby products . I have very fair , sensitive skin and acne . I do not find this moisturizes , but rather burns one 's skin horribly . After using the moisturizer , I had eroded , scabby sores all over my face . I think it made my skin much worse , although I am not supposed to be allergic to any of the ingredients . Also , for you fellow fair-skinned folks , it makes your skin look very red and ruddy in a bad way . Do not buy this , you will regret it , or at least I did .	-1
I typically love Neutrogena products , so I was really disappointed in this . My biggest issues are : -It 's kind of watery , yet leaves your face looking/feeling very greasy . Almost like applying sunscreen.-It has a really nasty , cloying smell ( like sunscreen ) .-Does n't seem to really moisturize , just sits on top of your skin . This makes it difficult to apply make up over it.I now use Clinique dramatically different lotion , and I LOVE it . I do not recommend this product .	-1
I bought this for use on my face which has really bad Rosacea . It made things much worse and really did not help with moisture .	-1
This hand cream is too thick and not spreadable for me . It does n't absorb as well as other hand creams I 've used . The only time I like using this is before bed , when I do n't touch anything throughout the night , I then wakeup with soft hands . It 's just too much for day time use . I end up getting everything sticky . I prefer Eucerin Intensive Therapy Hand Cream to this , at least that spreads and absorbs in to my hands .	-1
I have to agree with the other person it is to heavy and has grease fill you can use it better on your feet but still grease fill not the right lotion for my hands	-1
I applied the cream correctly every time , and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin , BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product does n't have much moisture in it in the first place because it is `` concentrated '' apparently but i need moisture ! ! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM ? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy , I 'm guessing it 's the concentrated bits of dried cream or something , but it 's very unpleasant feeling . It smells like plastic even though it 's fragrance free .	-1
This item does n't adequately moisturize and is greasy for my combination skin . I only put it on my dry cheeks , avoiding my t zone since that 's oily . It makes my dry cheeks greasy and I do n't need that . However , it works well for my mom , who has normal skin .	-1
I do n't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser . I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream . It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either . I do n't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product . It 's really too bad because it is a good price and I ca n't afford more expensive products .	-1
I admit I havent tried this but I do n't have to in order to know it only derserves ONE star ! I have been researching skin care products trying to find out what the ingredients actually are because I am looking for the perfect face wash/moisturizer for my skin . I have gotten so tired of reading labels and having no idea what I am about to be putting on my skin ( and as a result , into my bloodstream ) I have sensitive skin which happens to also be acne-prone and have had a really difficult time with trial & error on different skin care products . TIRED of wasting money ! I want something affordable AND safe ! Is this too much to ask ? ? ? I loved the idea of this cream and was really wanting to give it a try until I got to the 5th ingredient in this product list- Triethanolamine . After a little research on this ingredient I need not go any further with my Ponds Cold Cream research and will not be using this product ! ! ! Here [ ... ] a link to the alarming article I found on this ingredient : I would rather not risk it & if you read the facts on it you probably wo n't either ! If ANYONE out there has any recommendations for skin products that are mostly natural & non-comedogenic ( I mean ALL the ingredients are ) ( NO salicylic acid or any other FOR acne ( DRYING ) agents in them , I am open ! PS-SOMEONE please create a fragrance-FREE , all natural , non-comedogenic , NON-drying face wash that also serves as a moisturizer ( as cold cream does ) ! Thanks !	-1
When I was beginning to look into cold creams a while back , I came across this because of all of the raving reviews about how excellent this product was . Upon looking closer at the ingredients though , I changed my mind . There are formaldehyde agents in the formula -- which is something that anyone should avoid ( unless you are a specimen about to be preserved in a jar ) .	-1
Trying it on face but still has perfume added to it so it 's a no go for me . It did n't do anything but make face sticky .	-1
This product did nothing for me . It is basically a lotion . This did not wash my face or moisturize it . It is not what I expected .	-1
I remember trying this a year and a half ago . Essentially , it made my face red and burn , and small bumps appear near my jaw . This is most likely because it is a cream-based cleanser and it contains menthol , which is not recommended for sensitive skin ( granted , I sometimes use Vick 's Vapo Rub on the very rare cystic blemish , but it is always on a small space ) .	-1
I used this product for a week , my skin ended up extremely dry and burning . It took a good week for my skin to return to normal . I would not recommend this to people that have sensative skin	-1
These smell like rubbing alcohol , and nothing else . It stings slightly as I use the towelette on my face . I am afraid to use these near my eyes to remove my eye makeup . I will not buy again . These wipes leave my skin too dry . And the makeup still seems hard to remove with these wipes.I like the neutrogena hydrating towelettes much better ! They seem better for sensitive skin .	-1
I am 23 years old with combination skin . I have used this cleanser the past two weeks and I had immediate acne flair ups as well as over drying . I was unimpressed with this product and disappointed after the reviews . Just did n't work for me .	-1
Neutrogena has altered the scent of its `` Refreshing '' aka Classic Rainbath formula , probably in an attempt to make the product more appealing to women . What was once a clean , soft and slightly musk fragrance has been replaced with a sweet , grapefruit-citrus fragrance with a floral character . Compared to the product I 've used for over 20 years , this Rainbath smells different when you use it and when you rinse it off - now the fragrance left behind after rinsing is flowery and powder-sweet , not clean . It has some of the character of the old fragrance , but is considerably changed , so much so that I suspect most men who used it previously , as I did , wo n't be using it anymore . I have not confused this product with their other , `` Revitalizing '' scent , which has a pronounced grapefruit fragrance . This is their so-called Classic , but it is no longer classic . Why could n't Neutrogena roll out a new variety , rather than ruining an old and popular one ? Wanted to let everybody know so you would n't waste your time and money buying something that is n't what you expect.Update 12/09 : Called Neutrogena twice ( long story ) about the formula change . The CSRs avoided the topic of `` formula change '' as if they 'd received training in enduring torture . In other words , they would not admit that the formula is changed . What they would say is , `` We 're sorry you do n't like the fragrance . '' Then they asked me to describe the fragrance , and what I thought of it . They asked many in-depth questions about it , like , `` Would you describe the fragrance as being 'classic ' ? '' `` Would you describe it as luxurious ? '' `` Describe what you smell , '' etcetera . I asked them in reply , `` Why did n't you do market research before you launched the product ? '' Then , without my even requesting it , they offered me a cash refund for the product I 'd bought ( I 've already received the check ) . The best part was when one CSR accidentally started to say `` How would you describe the new -- I mean , how would you describe the fragrance of the product ? '' It 's clear that Neutrogena has made the decision to deliberately deceive its customers by rolling out this product while claiming they have n't altered it . Along with the check , Neutrogena sent me a $ 20 coupon for any product , but there 's nothing I want .	-1
The wand is short and the mascara seems too thick . I guess that 's why it 's & # 34 ; thickening & # 34 ; . Will go back to Maybelline Great Lash next time .	-1
Almay make-up remover towelette like wipes are much better than these Almay pads . These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them . One word : Horrible ! I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes and it 's still that bad . I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes . Boy was that a big mistake . Stay-away from these pads .	-1
I have very dry skin and could n't use these , but I have really sensitive skin . I just can not take off my makeup before bed or my eyes get a rash .	-1
I recently bought some more Q-tips . I use them every day . You known when you 're all dry from the shower but your ears are still wet ? Well , these are the only things that will do the job . So , as I said , I recently bought some more . And may I say that I hate the generic versions of Q-tips : the CVS brand or Target version of Q-tips are weak . They bend when you apply any pressure to them . I like Q-tips because they are much stiffer and hold up perfectly when used.~Q-Tips , you have let me down.~My recent purchase has led me to discover that Q-tips have changed their formula : The shafts are now much weaker than before and are identical to those knock-off brands I mentioned earlier . This is a travesty . It 's obvious that they are trying to save money by using less paper in the design of these things , but it 's terrible . They do n't hold up like they used to and it 's driving me nuts . I now HATE Q-tips and will be buying the cheaper knock-off brands since they are now equal in quality.~Q-Tips , shame on you .	-1
The cotton on these unravels every single time I use them ! I did n't have any troubles with the stick bending etc , but the cotton issue is terrible ! ! I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks - but now I regret it.I usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree , for a dollar of course , and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me . I figured for the price , I 'd buy these QTip brand , but boy was that a mistake . I ca n't even believe these things are so poor in quality , but yet the price is premium . Ripoff .	-1
Color is okay . It made my hair a medium brown shade and it did seem to have highlights as advertised . It really dried my hair out and damaged it . It has a strong chemical scent and my hair was shedding out twice as much as it usually does after I used this dye .	-1
I have very dark brown hair and for some reason it took me a while to learn that these feria blacks are just not good for your hair . not only does it strip my color out of my hair ( my hair starts turning medium brown in spots after a week of this product ) but my hair absolutely feels awful ( course , dry , brittle ) immediately after usage . loreals `` last through 28 shampoos '' creme gloss product is longer lasting than this so called permanent hair color . I think this crap needs to be taken off the shelves and they need to try again .	-1
My hair colour is the same dark brown as shown on the box before colouring . I really liked the promised colour shown on the box , Hi-Lift Cool Brown ( almost a caramel colour ) , and so wanted my hair to be the lighter brown shade promised . The actual results are nothing like the colour on the box . At best it evened out and and coloured my natural highlights to a darker shade of brown.I picked up two boxes , since I have thick hair , and took them to my beautician to ask her opinion on the colour . After talking with her I decided to let her do the colouring for me since the shade difference was so drastic . I wanted to make sure it was applied correctly . After applying as directed , 20 minutes in , my beautician checked my hair and said `` it 's not making your hair lighter , if anything it 's darker , even toned , but darker . '' I was quite disappointed as I had flip-flopped back and forth trying to talk myself into this `` extremely '' lighter shade for almost a month.The box promises Extreme Lightening-a promise that did n't deliver . While the resulting colour is not awful ( it 's very similar to the natural colour of my hair in my teens ) , I was really wanting the lighter shade shown on the box .	-1
I used this dye on my sister who dyes her hair red a lot . She 's currently out of work ( recently had a baby ) and had n't dyed her hair in months ( pregnant ) , so we decided it would be fun to do . She chose this color because it 's a bit deeper than she normally does , and she wanted to have a more intense red than she can get away with at work while she does n't have to work . Our plan was to use this and use something like Manic Panic over some pieces to make them even more red ( which we 've done before with her usual reds , and it always works out well ) , but this came out soooo dark it looks black until it 's in the light . It 's like purple-red black . It 's lightened up after a wash or two , but still much darker than she anticipated . We did n't even bother with step 2 , adding Manic Panic over sections , because we know it 's so dark it wo n't make much of , if any , difference . It 's a nice color , but not anything like it looks on the box . She 's very fair ( like me , which you can see in some of my other reviews of hair dyes I 've used personally ) , so it 's a much starker contrast than she anticipated.That said , the dye itself works well , processes quickly , and was n't overly damaging to her hair . The shampoo/conditioner combo that comes with it seems to be working well for her also ( she has very long , thick , curly hair ) . The dye starts out a deep cherry red which lead us to originally believe it would be much brighter than we expected , but it then turned purple-ish as it processed .	-1
The bottle to small to mix products together , my hair was falling apart after just 30 min , did not lighten my roots as described , product is not on my future list , try at your own risk .	-1
This hair color i think is ok.I think it has way too much blue though and should have more black.Everyone was telling me you have blue hair ! ! ! And another negative was that it faded the second day , a week later my dark brown hair was back and my bangs were still blue . Not a good black hair dye . Try ultimate black instead does not fade ! ! !	-1
I have purchased this color from the store before and it came out great , a deep , bright red . But when I ordered it on amazon , NOPE . My hair came out an ugly brown ( my hair was already a medium brown ) . The mixture went on red but my hair did n't come out nowhere near that color , and that usually happens when the product has been sitting forever . Yes , I left it on the recommended amount of time .	-1
Bought this product at walmart for $ 10 ... waste of money ! ! I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out.. I 've used feria before but just the darker brown colors . It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though ... . the damage is horrid ! ! It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black.. save your money and your hair and go to sally 's and get a quality lightening cream .	-1
I recieved this and put it in my hair , the color turned out really odd , and the conditioner that came with this was gritty and did n't really condition . It looked so odd I had to go to a stylist to get the color evened out . I have used bottle color before and have never had this happen .	-1
I will start of by saying that it is difficult to do at home root touch ups for blonde hair . This product turned by light brown roots organish-redish . Although the organish-redish is better then my natural brown roots with my blonde lowlights & highlights it still is not what I wanted nor was it what the box stated . In addition , the conditioner supplied to use after the touch up made my hair feeling as though product was left behind . I have used it twice and made sure I washed the conditioner out the second time and still ended up with the same feeling in my hair and incorrect color . I would not recommend this product for somebody who is doing a root touch up with naturally light brown ( or any shade of brown hair ) . If you 're trying to save money by not going to to hair saloon , I would still advise to choose another product.I give it a 2 star only because my hair was still lightened by the color , even though it was not what I was looking for .	-1
I bleached my hair to a mostly yellow , slightly orange color and then applied this product to take it to the next level , to the color I wanted my hair to be . Instead , my hair is yellow-blond . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a nice color , just not the one I was hoping for . For that reason , I would say it 's not worth the time or money . However , I gave it 2 stars because the conditioner it comes with is FANTASTIC ! It 's a nice purple anti-brass conditioner that works like a miracle at toning brassiness ( to some degree anyway ... ) and leaves your hair feeling healthy and smelling like heaven . But other than that , I 'm disappointed with my result and I 'm sure it 's human error to some degree but I was n't that far off and expected the tone of my hair to cool somewhat to be closer to what was on the package . Will not purchase again .	-1
My hair was already platinum and I was simply trying to get the last of the extremely faint neon-ish banana yellow out , as my toners were not doing the trick and I did not want to bleach again . I thought for sure this would do it , as it was really only ONE LEVEL to lift and this dye promises seven . My hair STILL came out with yellow in it . It 's a VERY THICK substance and even with my extremely short and thin hair , I think it may have worked better if I had purchased 3-4 ... however at that point I may as well go to a salon or just bleach it again , it 'd be cheaper and end in better results . Basically , unless you are already an extreme platinum , this dye will not make your hair the colour on the box . Furthermore , my dark blonde roots turned out neon orange .	-1
I used the cool medium brown color and it 's awful ! I have medium brown hair and always use a medium ash brown color on it . That usually takes it 1-2 shades darker than my natural color . I thought Feria looked interesting because of the highlights . Well , it 's trashed my hair . My roots are oddly lighter than the rest of my hair ( lighter than my natural color ) and the grey hairs did n't take the color AT ALL ! So , now I have this weird looking hair color AND still have greys . I 'll never use this hair color again .	-1
The color is much darker than what is pictured . I am a level 6 1/2 or 7 . It took me to a level 10 1/2 or 11 . It has a yellow cast to it . I was going to try this on my natural non-colored hair before using bleach . I was hopeful to get a bleach blonde color but it was not as pictured . It took me about 3-4 shades lighter but I was hopeful to get past the yellow stage .	-1
1 . I have been using this color ( 74 deep copper ) for a while . I still like it but the shade is different everytime . Sometimes more towards strawberry blonde , sometimes more copper , sometimes more red hues ... 2 . It fades away very fast . Faster than other red tones I 've used.Even if I am lucky enough to get the color advertised on the packaging , it lasts only for a day or two . After about 10 days the hair looses all the luster .	-1
I used Feria 's Starry Night because I wanted to make my dark brown hair a gloss black . After I washed the dye out , I noticed I had brown spots on the back crown of my head . It 's very odd since I 've never had this problem before with the other brands . I thought it was a fluke like I did n't follow the instructions properly . So I tried it again . Same thing happened . I 'm really disappointed .	-1
I wanted a coppery orange color and i had dyed black hair so i picked this up to strip the color out ( this is something i 've done before with other brands with no problem ) however , this formula is so crazy thick it didnt spread at all and my hair turned out so splotchy because of it . This product was not meant to be your standard bleaching kit , its for people with already light hair who want to go lighter , If your dark like me and wanted to go lighter i suggest manic panic bleaching kit or splat .	-1
The color of this is so lovely , a black blue that looks beautiful.The downside is , it lasts barely a week and if you wash your hair even once it will all come out.If it lasted a bit longer then I would definitely use it again .	-1
The R57 is such a lush red color . It looks a bit darker than what 's on the box ( more like the color at her roots ) , but that may be because my hair has been previously bleached . I still like it , its even better looking than the box ! Before using the Loreal Feria , I had tried the Garnier Olia , which ruined my hair . Olia is crap in a box-it will fry your hair like nobody 's business , and the color lasts exactly three shampoos . Anyway , I purchased the Feria to try and cover over the damaged and faded Olia . The Feria did a great job , coloring my multi-shaded and faded hair a deep , uniform auburn color with highlights here and there . I also add jojoba to my conditioner , which is excellent for dry , damaged hair . It has lasted longer than any red box dye , and even longer than some salon colors . In the directions , it says to shampoo hair twice when rinsing out the red dye-I did n't do that . I just rinsed it . This color will continue to bleed down the drain and onto your towels , as any red dye does , but it just has a staying power that most reds do n't have . Always use cool water , as cold as you can tolerate , on your red hair.I am trying to find a more natural red henna dye , and tried one from Mendahi on a sample of my hair , but have had no luck with that . I used only one box , and my hair is fine , dry , and to the bottom of my shoulder blades . I also do n't use shampoo . Once or twice a week , I dissolve a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of tepid water ( make very sure it 's dissolved , or you will end up with white granules remaining in your dried hair ! ) . I wet my hair in the shower , pour this into my roots , massage , rinse , and condition with 100 % pure coconut conditioner mixed with jojoba oil . The first time you sub the baking soda for shampoo , you might not love the results . Just try it once or twice more ; I did , and my roots are silky soft and very clean . It 's also been kinder to my red color , which has the largest dye molecule , making it the most difficult color to maintain.UPDATE ! Please use henna instead of chemical haircolor , it 's such a better option ! My hair is overprocessed , I have been bleaching it for years and had dyed it red with a box dye a few months ago ( loreal r57 cherry crush ) . My hair was breaking , falling out like crazy and I am trying to eliminate chemicals from all of my beauty products , and typical box hair dye is overloaded with nasty toxins.I was afraid to try henna , because people will tell you that your hair will turn orange-its not true ! Henna has saved my hair and I have never received so many complements ! I ordered the burgandy 100 gram from HENNA GUYS , they have a website and sell here on amazon , and it provided me with two applications ( my hair is past my shoulder blades ) . I mixed half of the package with water and a plastic spoon ( no metal ! ) , put it in an empty jumbo hair dye applicator bottle from Sallys , and applied it . It was so easy ! It 's not even messy , just make sure you have a damp washcloth handy to wipe up spills on your face or sink immediately . I saturated my hair , wrapped my head up in saran wrap , and went to sleep . I left it in for 11 hours , then washed it out and conditioned it . When it was dry , it had a bit of a brown orange tone , so I prepared the remaining mix , added a raw egg , and reapplied it on my hair . I left it on for five hours , heated it with a blow dryer for about five minutes , then washed it out . Remember that henna takes two days to fully develop , so be patient . It looked good when I washed and dried it , but WOW , it looked even better two days later ! It has a gorgeous deep burgandy tone , its shiny and soft , and I have not had a bad hair day since ! My scalp does not itch like it does after using chemical dyes , and it looks so rich and healthy ! I am so in love with henna , I just can even describe the difference that it has made ! I will forever be faithful to this henna brand ! Customer service is so helpful , and will respond quickly to any questions about the product . Henna is addictive ! I am trying the blend of burgandy and deep red next ! Love it ! Remember that if you are n't getting the deepness of color you want , or it looks orange , henna it again and again until you achieve the color you want ! Also , if your hair has been bleached in the past , as mine has , it does take more reapplications to keep the color . It 's just something you have to live with until the bleached portion of your hair grows out and you can cut it off . Henna is excellent for controlling oily scalp , which was not a problem of mine , but would be very beneficial for some people . I did n't have any problem with the smell that some people comment about , and even though I left it on for over 11 hours , I did not get a headache . *I have added a picture of my hair with the Feria . You can find it on the main product page , scroll way down toward the bottom and you will see it on the right . I did not have my flash on , so it appears a bit darker than it actually was .	-1
but once I got it it looked reddish so I could n't use it - beware buying dye since when I tried to return itit came up as & # 34 ; hazardous waste & # 34 ; material and not returnable . I have several of these colors now I have to throw out .	-1
Do n't bother ! What a waste of time . On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair . My hair is dark brown/ black . The turnout color would be a bright intense red , exactly what I wanted . What color did my hair come out ? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight . Nothing like it states on the side of the box . I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it . Wo n't ever buy from L'Oreal again !	-1
this review does not address how well the product works or not because I only tried this out one day as a stand alone for the follwoing reasons : The scent of this is reminds me of the beach , sunscreen , or a tanning bed . Since I do n't live/work near a beach or have a need to wear sunscreen all day or smell like coconut I choose not to use this daily by itself.On to condition weight : it 's a light condition the does n't weigh your hair down or make it appear oily in any way . On the negative I have very prone to frizzy hair and this does n't help with that at all.Because I ca n't just use this product by itself due to the reason above , I will not review this any further .	-1
In my quest to find the best products for my hair , I purchased this leave-in on a whim , thinking the spray bottle would add convenience to my overall hair regimen . I was so wrong . This product left my hair extremely dry and difficult to manage . I expected it to work like other leave-ins and provide moisture , but all it did was suck the moisture out and leave behind something resembling a helmet . lol The bottle states that the product contains silk protein , but I think there is more protein than moisturizing ingredients , hence the hard hair . I will not be purchasing this again in the future and would not recommend it to anyone .	-1
This stuff never really worked for me . I have dry , thick hair that 's damaged and comes with frizz and the like . This did absolutely nothing for my hair .	-1
You sent me the wrong shampoo . You sent the Naturals shampoo come on Amazon , get with it . All my orders lately have problems .	-1
I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price . It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this , I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless . When I got home , I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product . I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original , almost-odorless formula .	-1
This is not a clarifying shampoo . Avalon Lemon is much better and the Old Pantene Clarifying shampoo which is no longer available was the best is you have a greasy scalp and dermatitis .	-1
I do n't know if this shampoo works as well as it used to , and I will probably never find out . This is not the same as the Suave Naturals Shampoo Daily Clarifying formula that I used to purchase . Pleeeeeze , Suave ... . remove the scent which burns the back of the throat of other people in the next room , and replace it with ... . well ... . nothing ! By the way , what is the point of the blue coloring ?	-1
I got this shampoo hoping that it would help my dried out winter hair . Well , it made it worse ! I looked like Broomhilda afterwards ; it stripped my hair of anything that it had left and I looked as if I 'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket wet . I do n't recommend it at all if you have dry hair . If your hair is oily , then I think this would be fine . It sure smells nice and clean though ! Save your money for a professional brand - they definitely overshot the marketing on these !	-1
Sorry I purchased so much of this product ... when you apply it ... it looks shiny on ... so you ca n't use it during the day when you need for the puffiness to be reduced . I will use it at night ... and never buy it again .	-1
A total waste of money ( though it 's pretty cheap ) . I do n't know what the rave with this eye gel is all about . The gel is quite thick and hard to spread . It 's shiny and does not get absorbed quickly . Two or three days after I used this eye gel once at night , both my eyes look more puffy and tired-looking . An , for an unknown reason , my eyes are rheum-filled each morning when I woke up after using this . Disgusting .	-1
Olay Age Defying Classic Eye Gel . This popularly-priced product by Olay claims that it is a soothing , cooling gel that will revitalize and moisturize the eye area to minimize the appearance of signs of aging , and that it will work on normal , dry , combination/oily , oily skin . It will , the manufacturers state , replenish moisture in the eye area , helping to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles , or puffy areas . It contains a rather odd list of ingredients , old-fashioned witch hazel , cucumber extract , , fruit extract and flower oil , as well as variations on glycol/glycerine , B Vitamins , and some more advanced ingredients . The makers advise that it should be dotted around the eye area and smoothed in until absorbed.I know it has nothing to do with the important issues of the day , but I have gone through years of problems in my eye area : redness , swelling , tearing up , sparse lashes , and have tried most eye creams out there , I think , from drug store price to department store price to cosmoceutical . I actually tried two bottles of this product , and found its effects to be odd indeed . On the one hand it did feel comfortingly cool . But it did not feel rich and emollient enough ; and it further upset the sensitive skin of my eye area . Not recommended .	-1
This is only for washable makeup not waterproof makeup learned thr hard way still not a good buy it seems like im just using soapy water ill stick to my almond oil removes makeup faster and is gentle on skin	-1
Either i received an old worn out , defective piece or it doesnt do what it claims . It cudnt even hold the oil for an hour for me . Also i broke out in two places . Not pleased at all .	-1
Please do n't buy this product , I bought it and it was completely dry even though the packaging was completely sealed ... . I have n't see it sold anywhere else , so I am guessing its really old , i 'm really disappointed in this	-1
Lies lies lies . I should n't have believed these positive reviews ! ! This is like mascara from early 90s or something , just black stain on your lashes , that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump . Oh yes it 's waterproof so it gets a one star , thats the only good thing about it ... .it definitely is n't pretty ! ! ! ! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME . Wasted my money thank u very much ! Sigh . I want my money backkkkkkkkkk ! ! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding ! ! ! D : & lt ; I should 've gotten l'oreal voluminous waterproof mascara instead ... ...	-1
I 've used the water proof mascara in the pink and green tube 4 ever . this does n't cover well nor does it stay on . you can barely see I have anything on . the only plus is no raccoon eyes and it 's gone by bedtime .	-1
I would not use this simply because it pulls out your lashes and is impossible to remove . I used eye makeup remover as recommended . I still have it on my lashes after scrubbing it of with a cotton balls . My eyes are all red now . DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ! ! !	-1
I guess the coverage is ok , but I do n't like the texture . It does n't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to . It has a dry feel to it during application , but your skin does n't look dry after you apply it . As I 'm applying it , it dries up too quickly , and then I have to get more from the bottle . A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on . It also looks streaky after I 'm done . It 's hard to explain , but I just do n't like it . I prefer cover girl .	-1
This is definitely not new , The cover is broken , the product is totaly not new . I really do n't want to buy this product again !	-1
THOUGHT THIS COLOR WOULD BE A PERFECT CHOICE FOR ME BUT IT PALED ME OUT.IT WORKED A LONG TIME AGO - BUT NOT NOW . : )	-1
I sent this back immediately . There is absolutely NOTHING even remotely `` silver '' or `` red '' about this lip shade . It is pink with orange which means it 's CORAL , not red . Very disappointing !	-1
I am not a fan of this lipstick 's consistency and formula . It easily feathers if you apply on slightly dry lips . I also have to layer it on because the formula isnt creamy enough and tends to slide off the lips . Make sure to exfoliate your lips well before applying this lipstick if you want good color payoff .	-1
The lipstick is a ok color.. but definitely not Certainly red . It comes off so easily even with liner and blotting . I would n't buy it again..	-1
This stuff was expensive and did n't absorb with a darn . No mater how little I used or how much I tried to rub/pat it into my skin , there was a greasy layer on my skin . When I woke up in the morning , my skin was n't particularly soft or hydrated . It has an & # 34 ; old lady & # 34 ; scent and just seemed very & # 34 ; old school & # 34 ; to me. , Like something my grandmother would use . There are better products out there for my money .	-1
The item I received was for a different curler with a black insert and black grips on the handle . It pinched my eyelid . Would not recommend .	-1
I have a Revlon eyelash curler from several years ago that is wonderful and this is not similar . I did n't need to replace my old curler but wanted 2 curlers ( one for my makeup at home and one for travel or purse ) . I thought this would be similar since it looks like my original Revlon one but it is not at all . The handle for your fingers is very awkward- I 'm talking it 's hard for me to use because the handles are so spread out and slide together weirdly . I am a fairly petite woman but I feel this would be a similar problem for most women . The handles themselves are at an awkward angle so it 's weird trying to move the curler to get your eyelashes in it . I literally thought I was going to hurt my eye trying it . Very disappointing - just going to stick to my one curler.The product itself seemed well made and had extra curler pads . I guess that 's nice if you replace them but I never do - I just use baby oil ( buy small travel size at Target ) to get the mascara off then rinse with hand soap and water . Then I thoroughly dry before using . I have used that method since I first bought my curler MANY years and it cleans the curler pad like it 's new . No need to waste money on replacements and it curls just as great as always.I would n't suggest this curler for anyone . Seems like Revlon tried to improve their curler but it 's been at the expense of making it difficult to use .	-1
YUCK ! ! ! Too bad there 's no option for zero star reviews , 'cause this soap deserves one.After three uses , I have broken out in one of the nastiest cases of contact dermatitis that I 've had in years . If you 're even slightly sensitive , I 've avoid this one like the Plague.Two Weeks Later : I still have remnants of the rash on my extremities . I fully expect another week to pass before it all goes away.I contacted Kiss My Face customer service . Here 's their response : Thank for taking the time to write and for your feedback . Sorry that you are less than pleased with this KISS product . I 'll definitely pass your feedback on to our product development team . We love hearing from our customers even when it is less than stellar , and we absolutely do take your input into consideration when developing new products or when tweaking our current line of products . Please feel free to contact me if I can be of further help .	-1
this soap was a completely waste of my money , first of all it does not moisturize at all , it left my skin ashy , dried and pretty much upset . I would not recommend this soap , the soap smell like palm oil soap instead of olive oil soap .	-1
I 've bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone . The smell is light , the formula is light ; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is , either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch . Now , even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face , using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser , I get this weird greasy feeling all over . Shortly after that is what I call `` the water stage , '' where as if by magic , my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top . I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel , because it looks like I 've worked up a sincere sweat . I do n't know what 's wrong with this product , and I 'm holding onto it to try in the dry winter months , but I 'm not optimistic . At this point , I would not order it again .	-1
I bought this to get rid of the crow 's feet and fine lines under my eyes . I 've used this now for about three months with absolutely no improvement whatsoever . It is pleasant to use and does n't irritate my eyes , but just did n't do a thing for me .	-1
I was so hopeful about these . I wanted an alternative to tampons that was healthy and environmentally-friendly ( and cheaper ! ) So I was excited to try them . But it was n't at all what I was expecting . I do n't want to get into vivid details . But basically , I was not warned that this would be such a MESSY ordeal . Not to mention it 's not at all convenient . I do not want to leave it in for too long , because if I do , I know it 's not absorbing any fluid , so I worry about leakage , or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when I try to take it out . GROSS ! Also , the thing itself is absolutely huge . I imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies . I believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods . Sorry , but I 've got to switch back .	-1
I had been using the DivaCup for a while and had a lot of success with it , but when I lost it a friend gave me a pack of the softcups she had used once and did n't like . I thought since I had liked the other brand this would be much the same way ... it was n't I do n't know how many times I tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher/lower inside the vaginal walls , I could n't stop the cup from leaking . It was n't horrible , but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that I was n't saving money on this alternative item and that I wo n't be using the brand again . It was an utter disappointment ... I 'd say try another brand instead like DivaCup or Lunette , I had good experiences with both .	-1
Retrieving these requires gymnastic ability that i sadly do not possess . They are also very messy to remove . I tried them because i have a dermatological sensitivity to rayon , but no . In the trash and done . Never again .	-1
I recently tried Instead after seeing a positive review for it in fashion magazine . I read the back of the box and saw the informational video on their website prior to use so I would know exactly how to insert and remove the softcup . However , I could never actually get the cup in the proper place ! Instead is supposed to be inserted completely into the vagina with the end of the cup 's rim touching the back of the vagina and resting just under the cervix . The front of the cup 's rim is supposed to be pushed up gently behind the pubic bone so that it stay in place . However , I have small hands and short fingers and could only just BARELY push the rim and position it behind the pubic bone . Or so I thought . Perhaps my anatomy does n't hold the cup in place as securely as it 's supposed to ( according to the video ) , but throughout the day the cup would continually dislodge and would not catch everything it was supposed to . Instead only caught maybe 50 % of the blood , and I would spot the rest.I think this may be a really great product for someone else , but I think I 'll stick with regular tampons .	-1
I absolutely love this product . it does n't dry my skin like it did to other reviewers . but , after about two weeks of using the product , i noticed the expiration date . It expired in 2005. that was SEVEN years ago . ( It is Dec 2012 now ) .	-1
it is way to strong for my face , i had use a dime size all over my wet face and then rinse , after i look in the mirror my face was red all over.it went straight in the garbage , but what i do like is clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub , it smell really good and leaves my face super soft , so i will continue to use clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub , as for the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser never again will i put that crap on my face .	-1
I 've had some luck with Clean & Clear products so I had no qualms picking up the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser from the store . However , as soon as I used it I became a bit frustrated.To begin with , the formula is very watery and thin . I prefer something a little thicker and this did n't feel like it stayed on my skin long enough to do a very good job . While it might have helped with acne a little , it definitely does not live up to its name.I also felt that it made my skin more oily and I quickly stopped using it to switch to a different product . Over the course of the day , my skin would become uncomfortably oily . Where is the continuous control in that ? Clean & Clear 's Continuous Control Acne cleanser sat in my shower for quite some time before I finally picked it up again , a sure sign that this product was no doing its job adequately.There are definitely other acne products , some even from Clean & clear , that I prefer of the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser .	-1
While this may work on your skin issues , it will RUIN your towels and sheets that are n't white . The benzol peroxide ingredient seeps into your skin and ruins towels , sheets , pillowcases , and clothes - left our gray towels blotched with pink and purple spots and ruined our sheets.Definitely recommend trying a product with salicylic acid instead - same results , no damage to your linens .	-1
I will admit -- I do feel this product was helping reduce my acne . However , I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in ( sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review ) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen . I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product . I did n't add anything else new to my routine and have n't had a yeast infection in years . May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product , my stomach issues stopped . I think this is a good product , but for me , the side effects were not worth it .	-1
i used all of these and the creme i actually ended up getting few months worth and took them for 3 months and its not worth the money these did nothing for me	-1
Since I am allergic to Benzyl Peroxide , I did not use the cream , so this is a review of the tablets only.I used the tablets religiously twice a day , in the morning and at night . No change in my acne at all . I really wanted it to work , but the truth is that it did not work for me .	-1
Did nothing for my acne ... Used it for 2 months , The pills are surger pills..Do n't wast your money on this itemDo your homework first ...	-1
It 's whatever.Been using the whole month but see no difference , maybe it 's just me ? Anyways , it should n't take more than 2 weeks to clear up your acne and maybe 2 months to completely rid of the scars . The pills did n't do much as far as I can see , but the cream helped a bit . But you have to mix it with moisturizer or you get SO DRY ! And do n't even think about putting make-up on over it because you 'll get cakey as as a burnt biscuit.idk , guess some ppl had success ? It 's cheap so you have a 50-50 chance of it working , it may be worth a shot . but did n't work for me =/	-1
I tried this a few years ago as a teenager , when I had some acne . It was nothing horrible , just a few pimples here and there . I saw this at the store and gave it a try , did everything I was supposed to and the pores under my eyes increased in size . I had larger pores after using this product and it took me a while to reduce their size . I did n't have much acne to begin with and this did seem to help , but the increased pores were a negative .	-1
I tried this product for 2 months and i have to say it didnt do anything for my acne . I am the type that breaks out when my period is about to start and using this pill did n't change a thing . I broke out just as i normally would and this last month even while using the pill was nearly the worst i 've had . I 'm sure must just be a coincidence . I am not saying this is not a good product as we have to keep in mind one thing ca n't and wo n't work for everyone as we all have different skin types . This just is n't for me and i have discontinued using this product and can not really recommend it .	-1
CAN NOT TELL THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS ANY AFFECT ON MY SKIN AT ALL . IHAVE USED IT NOW FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS . IT DOES HAVE A BURNING SENSATION SO THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING ? ? ?	-1
I do not like the consistency . It is like the consistency of yogurt , only with lots of oils . I did not like it .	-1
I did n't read the Ingredients and found this product contain Mineral oil which can clog your pores . The Vitimin E it claims to have is 18th on the list.. my bad for not reading this first . Mineral oil is basically a petro oil , which is something that can make your car run in certain forms . It does not allow your skin to breath..	-1
I washed my face with this once yesterday , and once the day before and yesterday in the evening , a good portion of the right side of my face and a few under my chin broke out in ugly hives ! It itches horribly and it really hurts . To make matters worse , I had to go to work looking like this . I did n't want to put on makeup that would irritate my skin so I was forced to leave the house looking like a pepperoni pizza . : ( And also , when I was washing my face with this , I noticed that the scrubbing beads in this were SCRATCHING my face . Not a comfortable exfoliation , but like sandpaper . And this cleanser has a very noticeable chemical smell to it . I wish that I had never wasted my money on this product , and I wish that I had never put this on my face !	-1
Made me break out like crazy ... in places I never used to get zits . I have pimples on my upper lip , cheeks , underside of nose . Horrible . Waste of money . Cheaper in stores , but still not worth it . This has never happened to me before . I have loved all other Neutrogena products , but this one just does n't work . Now I have to find another cleanser that can get rid of the zits this gave me . zero stars .	-1
i have really sensitive skin , and this was really harsh on my face . it burnt every time i applied it .	-1
The number 2 ingredient in this toner is SD Alcohol which does a great job of immediately degreasing your skin , but in the long run , it will cause your oil glands to produce more oil to make up for the drying effect of the alcohol . I like that it has AHA and beta hydroxy acids , but looking for another toner without alcohol . Any suggestions ? I 've tried the Neutrogena alcohol free toner and need something a little stronger for my slightly oily , more acne prone skin .	-1
I have noticed over the last few years my pore sizes has increased . It is crazy and now it really bothers me ! I tried this along with many other products but I did not notice any difference ! If you like a toner its not a bad one pretty gentle but do n't expect no more pores !	-1
This stuff broke my face out . Maybe my skin is too sensitive or something , but this stuff did n't work at all for me .	-1
I did n't notice any true results from this . In addition , it really , really stings my eyes . My husband tried it as well and said the same .	-1
I have combination skin and this dries it out to the point of being painful . I did n't notice any difference with the appearance of my pores , which are still big . I suffered for nothing .	-1
I have oily , acne-prone skin that is also sensitive and prone to redness when trying new products . Since Neutrogena 's whole advertising campaign from pretty much day one has been all about how gentle their products are , I decided to try this stuff . Well ... my face did n't like it . I used it nightly for 3 days , and on day 4 noticed red , dry patches on my face . By day 5 the patches began to flake , and I stopped using it.Since I did n't use this toner long enough to see whether it made a difference in my pore size , I ca n't speak as to its effectiveness . But if you 're like me and have tried many acne products on your face , and have developed sensitive skin as a result , this is not the product for you .	-1
As a young adult , I have acne-prone skin with some enlarged pores around around my nose . I bought this hoping it would help clear me up , when , in fact , it did quite the opposite . When I first squeezed some into my hand I noticed that it had a very chemically odor . After I used it and rinsed my face , as soon as I opened my eyes they burned like I had just been rubbing peppers on them , so I rinsed , rinsed , rinsed some more until the burning stopped . My face felt clean , but smelled like chemicals , and in the morning I woke up with a few new zits . I was n't sure the cleanser was causing the breakout , so I kept using it . I slowly developed terrible acne and had to stop using it . About a week after I did , I was back to normal . I gave this cleanser to my sister to try and she had very good results , but stopped using it because she was concerned about the chemical odor . I would not recommend a product that has the potential to cause the problems I experienced .	-1
I used this twice just to make sure I was n't imagining the smell . To me , it smells exactly like urine . My fingers reek of it and I can even smell it on my face . I only bought this because it was $ 1 or more cheaper than the others . It is probably just a bad reaction to my own skin oils because in the bottle or on the cotton ball , it smells great.I 'll be buying another brand this evening and NEVER buying this again .	-1
I have pretty sensitive and oily skin , and it burns so much ! I usually love Neutrogena stuff but this is bad !	-1
I tried this a while ago , back when I had bad body acne in my teens . The fragrance only irritated my skin and it was only after using the facial wash that I realized that I was sensitive to salicylic acid . I gave this to a friend , and it worked very well for her because she does n't have sensitive skin .	-1
I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it has absolutely made no difference . I 'm Asian and I have acne on both my chest and back . It did n't make my skin worse , but nevertheless I am very disappointed in this product .	-1
This cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin . Instead of buying a cream , I tried a vitamin C serum . That has worked out perfectly . I so wish I did n't try this and get the horrible acne breakout from it .	-1
This product broke my skin out and I have very strong skin . I am unsure what happened but I got horrible acne . My skin is not sensitive and I use other products without any issues . So be cautious if you have sensitive skin when using this product .	-1
This shampoo works as a cleanser , but it does n't smell good , leaves my hair feeling dry with a very slight filminess that will likely build up over time . I will use it occasionally to purify my scalp with tea tree oil , but I will not use it very often .	-1
I typically use Burt 's Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair , but not for my scalp ( dry and itchy ) . I purchased this shampoo to use on occasion to prevent the itchy scalp it seems to cause . Plus , I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree shampoos.Let me just say , I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product . It has a horrible chemical odor ... EXACTLY like pesticide . I tried a few more times to stomach it , but just ca n't do it . Plus , you would think it would at least tingle a bit , with it smelling like Raid and all , but nope ; NADA.Also , if you are looking for a shampoo that is organic with no SLS ... READ THE LABEL ! This product is not what it is marketed to be .	-1
I bought this hoping that the tea tree would help stop the dandruff and stop the flaking on my scalp ... it did n't . It also left my hair tangled after washing . Would not buy again .	-1
I did n't care for this at all . Not only did I not notice any difference in the thickness of my hair , I did n't care for the way it cleaned my hair either .	-1
I love the foam and how soothing it feels , I do not follow after the first poo since all the product , oils , and dirt is washed out in its first application . My only knock on the product it has way too much protein that causes my hair to tangle and knot up . That 's why the product only got 2 stars , now if you are not protein-sensitive go for it .	-1
Good 4 house hold , but not for the skin.What u pay is what u get	-1
, sodium benzoate , benzyl benzoate , citronellol , fragrance ( parfum ) . Fake fragrance and sodium benzoate . Never understand why they sell this at whole foods and how it continues to pass as `` natural '' . I guess petroleum is natural , too . Too bad they do n't list the multiple chemicals that are in the `` parfum '' .	-1
This smelled wonderful but did not clean me at all . I ended up just using it to clean my bath tub after I took a bath . I would not buy this again !	-1
Sorry but I have to give this product a low rating for pretending to be something it is n't . Sorry , but this stuff smells nothing like lavender . It smells like a chemical cocktail . The `` parfum '' at the end must be the part that makes it smell like chemicals , but do n't expect anything resembling the smell of Lavender . This is closer to the smell of Tide with bleach . I 'll use Jason toothpaste but their soap is n't `` clean '' .	-1
Do n't think there is a significant enough concentration of retinol in this cream to make any difference whatsoever . It has a nice texture and light feel , so I 've used it up as a day cream but that 's about it . No results to report . If you are seeking results , go with Babyface 2 % retinol Night Renewal cream .	-1
The first time I used Avalon 's Vitamin C eye cream , my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours . I thought that maybe I had used too much , so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount , being careful to keep it away from my lashes . My eyes still became uncomfortable . This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do . The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and , if it does , it should not sting . That 's why eye cream is different than face cream . This one fails . I wo n't be using it again .	-1
I tried this product with a lot of hope for quite sometime . I did n't see any improvement what so ever . I would not recommend buying it .	-1
How can people market such crap . It does nothing . Absolutely nothing . Total waste of money . I have tried alot of eye creams . This one is right there on the bottom .	-1
same as all natural oils i think pure coconut oil works better then this i saw no difference using this product	-1
The packaging and delivery time were excellent . But it was not effective for my rashes . Other Aveeno product like skin relief ones has been a great product for their own purpose though and I have been using them for a few years .	-1
Nope . Purchased it a couple weeks ago and every time I 've used it , about 5 times , it has made my eyes burn and water . Like the bestseller and highly-rated Maybelline Great Lash ( in the pink and green bottle ) , this also burns my eyes . I 've read many reviews of the Great Lash , and this happens with quite a few people . No idea what ingredient ( s ) are doing this , but consistent every time , and it does n't happen with my L'Oreal mascaras.As far as the rest of its performance , I find this to be nothing special . If it truly made eyelashes full and soft , I 'd be happy , but I do n't notice either of these things . It seems quite sparse in what it deposits on the eyelashes . I did a test with L'Oreal on one side and Maybelline on the other , and both felt crispy once dried.I do like that the brush is fiber , and not hard plastic like so many are nowadays . It goes on easily and comfortably , though I would prefer the wand to be curved and longer.So all in all , there is nothing here to recommend , and all the other minor points become moot , because burning is not acceptable . It claims to be hypoallergenic but it is not .	-1
It looks ok when you initially put it on , then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull ( not much length or volume ) .	-1
This product does not live up to its name . While the mascara is soft , it is not full . To get a desired full effect , I have to apply the mascara at least three times . The mascara also takes a long time to set and dry . I will not be buying this product again .	-1
I purchased this based on the good reviews I read , and had confidence that it would live up to them . It did n't . This mascara smudges and smears very easily . It 's allergy season , so my eyes tear a little ... but just from that it streaked under my eyes ! Other mascaras do n't do this at all . The mascara goes on nicely and separates your lashes well , but I ca n't give it a three-star rating because I ca n't use it and had to throw it in the trash .	-1
I ended up not even opening the packaging ; I could tell by the look of them they had to be pretty old ; one was actually very yellowed and they both looked like they 'd come from a discount sales bin somewhere . I looked up the product codes from the bottom of the tubes and learned that they had been produced in 2005 and 2007 , respectively . This is clearly well past the `` safe '' three-year shelf life . Now I have to return them in the hopes of getting my $ 20 refunded . This company should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.UPDATE : Third-party seller ( BeautyTime ) claims the product `` never expires '' ( contrary to Maybelline 's website , even ) , and has accused me of lying and that the product `` did n't exist in 2005 & 2007 , '' which is not true ( I 've been using this mascara for YEARS ) . I have ordered this mascara on Amazon before , and not had this same experience . Be careful as to who the third-party seller is . This company is clearly shady .	-1
I 'm in my twenties and just getting started on my anti aging regimen . I used this for a month or so and did n't really see or feel any results . I do n't think it went well with my skin either . I switched to St. Ives moisturizer with collagen and I like it a lot better .	-1
