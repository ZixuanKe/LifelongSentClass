As an anxious mother I am very scared of SIDS . I do n't put my 10 week old in her crib yet , because she sleeps in a bassinets . So the Angel care Monitors wo n't work in a bassinet . I found the Snuza and bought it immediately . It 's small and the baby does n't even feel it hooked to their diaper . It 's worth the money .	1
When I first brought my baby home I never slept because I had postpartum depression and I was always afraid something would happen to him . Then I got this monitor and once I realized I could make it chirp when the baby moves I was able to relax because I did n't have to stare at the baby all night , I would just listen for the reassuring chirp and then go back to sleep . I owe so many nights of great sleep to the snuza.We did get a couple of false alarms when his diaper was too loose but that does n't bother me because at least I knew that it worked . Though we did have a real alarm once . One night I heard the alarm go off and went in the room to discover the straps on my baby 's sleeper/rocker bed had come loose , allowing him to turn sideways , which caused his nose and mouth to become completely covered by the attached pillow , and he did not appear to be moving or breathing at all . I flipped him over and shake him awake and luckily he did wake up shortly . I hate to think what could have happened if the Snuza alarm had n't alerted me .	1
It 's a must have ! ! ! ! I 've an almost 4 months baby boy , he is super healthy but as a new parent , I 'm scared to death about SIDS . I was n't sleeping right , constantly checking on him and after a friend of mine lost her 2 month old boy in march ( we gave birth the same week ) due to SIDS I just could n't take anymore and that 's when I found this.I have the Angel care monitor but is not nearly as sensitive as the snuza . I can take it anywere , and it 's pretty simple to use.Things I DO N'T like:1 . Batteries : are extremely rare , so it 's almost impossible to buy them at any store . We looked everywhere . We ended up ordering it online . So if you are planning to buy it , make sure to order a few batteries too.2 . Sometimes it goes on for no reason or is very very sensitive : my baby is a very very heavy sleeper to the point where his breathing movement are almost imperceptibly , so the Snuza wo n't register it . It happened a few time making jump from my bed and run.3 . It does n't work if your baby is in his/her swing , bouncing seat , carseat , everything that moves . The snuza pick up the movement in general not your baby 's breathing movement.For this reasons that 's why I do n't give the Snuza a 5 stars review but I 'm still very glad to have it ! I think it 's totally worth the investment . My child 's life and my peace of mind it 's priceless.Since I got it I could moved my son to his nursery and I sleep so much better . Thank you	1
I finally decided to use this item when transitioning my baby from my room to hers . I have to say , this has given me great piece of mind . No false alarms of yet ( used it for about three weeks now ) . As soon as you remove the monitor , it starts beeping right away . It is VERY sensitive ! I love it ! ! Gives me great piece of mind that it will go off if there is no movement noted when clipped to my baby . I was hesitant on clipping it to the diaper , I thought it might be uncomfortable or get dirty , but so far so good . My baby does not seem to mind or notice it and it stays nice and clean . I do n't think I could fall asleep without it ... . Now I can fall asleep and do n't need to stare at the monitor or sneak into her room to make sure she is breathing . Money well spent !	1
I absolutely love this product . If I had the means to buy one for every new parent , I surely would . My baby wears it not only at bedtime , but all day long . We are certainly getting use from it . And NO false alarms ! One of my favorite baby items .	1
This is the best SIDS monitor by far . We had very few false alarms and when we did , it was because our big boy was shuffling around . It 's easy to use , portable , and a good price for some serious peace of mind . The click feature allowed me to fall asleep knowing everything was ok .	1
I purchased this monitor because my son ( about 2 months at the time ) insisted on sleeping on his belly . I rested easier using this monitor each night . I used it for the past 3 months every night- not for his daytime naps . It has a loud alert beep that I vaguely heard through winter pajamas & a sleep sack . I am sure if he had on fewer layers I would have heard the alarm easier . If your child is a belly sleeper or you are just over-cautious , purchase this monitor . You will not regret it .	1
I read a lot of reviews before purchasing this , We have not had any `` false '' alarms and so far has worked ! Gives us a peace of mind ! Wish there were more products like this so many mothers worry every night ! Only 4 stars because we have only had it one month !	1
This item is a life saver . Literally . Have not had any false alarms , and if anything else , helps us sleep easier without worry .	1
We have been using this Snuza for 8 weeks now and it 's the most amazing baby product of all time . I have anxiety issues and always woke up to see if my first child was breathing in the night so I bought the snuza for # 2 . I can sleep all night and not worry because I know this monitor will go off if my baby stops breathing.The first week of my baby 's life this alarm went off anywhere between 10-20 times . Since I did n't know exactly how to clip it on ( I 've just figured out little tricks over time ) it slid or fell off or was just not close enough to her tummy and would alarm . I 'm pretty sure that at least one of the alarms was due to the fact that my baby breathed irregularly though.The Sunza gives me peace of mind . I love that unlike other breathing monitors , this one is cordless , portable and really easy to use . I seriously act as a spokesperson for this thing . It 's literately a lifesaver and in my opinion , is the coolest and most necessary baby item on the market ! UPDATE : Before purchasing this item I was conserned about how often the battery would need to be changed or how long each battery would last . My daughter is 5 months old now and we have n't had to change the battery yet ! the battery light/alarm has gone off a few times in the last 3 months . If the red battery light is on , I just turn the Snuza off and turn it back on again . The battery light goes back to green and works like a charm . I 've had a back up battery on hand since the light first went off but I just wanted to use the original battery as long as I could.We 'll probably pack the Sunza away here in the next few days/weeks . At 5 months my daughter just kicks so much the Snuza falls off and alarms when it 's sitting at the foot of her PJs . So back to the battery concern ... In my case , I only needed one battery the entire time I used this for my baby ! I still HIGHLY recommend this item and ca n't imagine life without it !	1
It 's portable unlike the Angel Care systems . You can put it on baby no matter where they sleep . Gave me peace of mind when I moved my son from my room to his .	1
Our baby has not yet been born , but after opening the package , reading the directions and playing with the monitor I am completely satisfied with this purchase . It looks like it will be wonderful peace of mind . I will update once we actually use it in real-life . : )	1
I have used the Snuza Hero with my youngest two children . I only wish I had known about this product when my other kids were young.With our first Snuza , the battery lasted a full year . With our most recent Snuza , the battery needed to be replaced after nine months . Either way , that 's a pretty good battery life for something that is used every day for hours at a time.We had very few false alarms with either unit . With my daughter , it was mostly operator error . We did see a slight increase in false alarms when she began sleeping on her stomach , so we began to clip the unit to the back of her diaper and the false alarms stopped . With our son , he is a much more restless baby when going to sleep , so the unit has on occasion become dislodged.The reason I chose the Snuza style monitor over an Angel Care style monitor is because of size and portability . We travel a lot and we camp quite a bit . Because the Snuza simply clips to the diaper or pants , we can take it anywhere easily , in the crib at home , in the playpen camping , at my mother-in-law 's house in her guest bed , etc .	1
We used a sensor pad type monitor with my oldest child that would give us false alarms when she would roll too far from the center of the crib . We bought this monitor for our newest addition in the hopes of less false alarms and also because I could use it on him when he napped in his swing as a newborn . It turns out that as soon as he learned to roll at 3 months he began to sleep on his stomach and I was so glad I had this monitor . We use it for every nap and all night . I really do love this little monitor and we 've only had a couple false alarms when the monitor has fallen off . We use cloth diapers and since they 're so thick it can sometimes be hard to get the monitor on securely . I also have to put it on his side because he does sleep on his stomach and it will leave red marks if I put it on his front side .	1
My wife and I are Having A baby soon , and purchased this item just for peace of mind . You cant put a price on a newborns life . A must have for anyone having a newborn .	1
I bought the Snuza Halo monitor , now called the Hero , in 2012 for my son . He was my first and I felt like I had to check on him every 10 minutes because I had read so many things about SIDS . My husband would wake up to find me sleeping with my hand on my son 's chest because I did n't want him to stop breathing in the middle of the night . I found this and did n't think twice about buying it . I paid $ 129 for it in 2012 and it came with a 2 year warranty . I did have to have my unit replaced because it had a defective button and I could n't turn it off after a few months . It was quickly replaced without any problems . I used the monitor on my son until he was about 9 months old , and only stopped because he was sleeping on his stomach and would move a lot causing the alarm to pull off his diaper , making the alarm go off 4-5 times a night.I had my second son recently and pulled this out immediately . It had been a while , so the battery was dead . I went to order a new one , but the manufacturer wants $ 20 for the battery plus $ 10 shipping . I went to my local battery store and they found one that was the same voltage and amps that came with the alarm originally . I put it in and the alarm gave the & # 34 ; low battery & # 34 ; warning . So I turned it off and back on again and it said everything was fine . I 'm not sure why that 's happening , but it does with every battery I 've gotten for it since then.The other issue with the non-original battery , is that it does n't last as long as the one that came with the alarm . I had the replacement alarm for over 6 months and never replaced the battery . I would turn it on and off each time I changed or bathed my son . The non-original batteries last about 2 months without being turned off except when my son it bathed . For diaper changes , I just lay it next to him and usually his movements on the changing table are enough to prevent the alarm from going off . We do n't really take it off except for baths because , like most babies , my son will fall asleep anywhere at anytime and I 'm not going to wake him to put the alarm on.The original version of this that I own has problems again with the buttons . I do n't know if it 's because I was turning it off and on a lot with my first , but it pretty much became impossible to silence or turn off , so I had to buy another one . I was very disappointed when it arrived to find that the box said it only had a 1 year warranty instead of the 2 year that they use to offer . That is the reason I 'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.TIP FOR EXTENDING BATTERY LIFE : Do n't turn it off and on again when changing the baby . Lay it next to them on the changing table and there should be enough movement to prevent the alarm from going off . Only turn it off when you are taking it off the child for baths . The on and off seems to drain the battery quicker .	1
I could not sleep without this . My daughter is 3 months old and I have used it since her birth . I did n't like attaching it to her diaper so I cut the elastic band from a pair of her pants and just hook monitor on her that way . Now that she moves a little more sometimes I attach it upside down and it still works fine . Also I just attach it to pants if she has them on and it still works . I have had some false alarms but that 's because it may have slid off but it does n't bother me . I would rather be safe than sorry . I love that is portable bc she sleeps in different areas .	1
As a first time mom , I am terrified of SIDS ! The first night my baby slept in her crib this was attached to her ! It 's so comforting knowing she 's breathing and I do n't have to stare at her all night long ! I thought the fact that it attaches to her diaper would irritate her but she does n't even know it 's there . Luckily we have n't had any false alarms like other members have but I feel comfortable knowing my baby is breathing ! The light can be seen through her pajamas but I ca n't see it through w baby monitor . That 's my only downside but that would just be an extra perk in my opinion : ) Although it 's a bit pricey it 's well worth the money !	1
This monitor has been amazing ! We received it before the expected arrival date . The product was exactly as described . We have had no issues so far . We have been using this monitor and it has provided such a peace of mind . This product was recommended by a friend when the monitor we intended on using became recalled a week before our baby was due . This monitor and the reviews have been extremely helpful .	1
I bought this monitor for some peace of mind when I started putting my 6mos old daughter in her own room at night . She is my first and I had a real problem with seperation anxiety . We are very fortunate that she sleeps through the night with just a fuss here or there . However , going blind staring at the video/audio monitor , trying to see her chest rise and fall after she hadnt repositioned in hours , was making me crazy . So ... I bought the Snuza for my nerves . I 've used it for about two months now and I LOVE it . This model fits in the palm of your hand , it is so small . Very easy to use , simple instructions . The babysitter has no problem using it . I will try and post pics later . I had read some people had false readings with fans , etc ... with some similar monitors so I tested it alone in any area she sleeps around the house . No problems . She sleeps with a fish tank , a humidifier and sometimes a white noise machine or music . Nothing interferes . The design is really cool , the soft rubber tip sets on the tummy and picks up the tiniest movements when they breath . However , it does not pick up digestive activity , I actually watched it one nap when she had gas bubbles . Silly , maybe , but reassuring . There is no way the baby can accidentally turn it off by moving around either . My baby is a tummy sleeper which has presented a couple of challenges ; One , she will dislodge it when she wiggles around if I am not careful to tighten her diaper properly and make sure the clip is fully seated . Two , it is harder to hear and slightly muffled when it does go off because she is laying on it . We have had two alarms so far . One was definitely a false alarm because the monitor came loose . The second one I am not so sure about because my first instinct was to turn it off before I checked her breathing and messing with it woke her up . At least now I know I will hear it and wake up if it does goes off . And I can sleep knowing that even if she hasnt moved in hours , which she does sometimes , she must be breathing because its quiet .	1
We set up our room with an Arms Reach co-sleeper and and Angelcare motion mat before our son was born . Turned out , he was a refluxy baby and a poor sleeper who constantly broke out of his swaddles . We started letting him sleep in his bouncer and swing because the incline was just better for him . This made me nervous because motion mats do n't work in those devices . So we got a Snuza . It gives us peace of mind no matter where he 's sleeping - including friends ' houses and the carseat on long trips . Really wonderful , versatile product .	1
I love the Snuza and use it every night . I think every baby should wear one . I always have clothing on top so it does n't get pushed off and have had a few false alarms from it coming off but I will take false alarms any day over it not working.I always check for breathing , not I just see the flashing light which is right on que with every breath .	1
We love this thing . We were originally looking at the Angelcare pad , but went with this instead because of its vibration feature . After using it for a few weeks , I think it is much more versatile than a pad could be . We would n't have even been able to use a pad at all yet . Our child is just over a month old , and we have not put him in his crib yet . So far , he sleeps in a bassinet in our room where a pad would n't work . This clip works great anywhere though ! We leave it on him anywhere he naps ( bouncer , swing , etc. ) . It is very convenient and great peace of mind for any new ( anxious ) parent . I ca n't even count how many times I 've stood over him looking for the flashing green light telling me everything is okay.There are only two issues that we ran into with this . First , although it is small , it is still huge on a newborn so we did n't feel comfortable using it while his umbilical cord was still attached . Second , when we first started using it his diaper leaked , but I think it was how we had it positioned . After we got used to placing it , we have n't had that issue in awhile.Update ( 09/06/13 ) : Our original battery died after about 8 weeks . We have replaced it several times now with model LS14250 batteries found commonly here on Amazon . I was originally worried about using LS14250 batteries since the original Snuza battery was a CR14250 , but then I found that Snuza 's website recommends using either one ( [ ... ] The LS14250 do not seem to last quite as long though ( about 1 month of nightly use each ) , but they are way more reasonably priced so you can stock up . Five months in , and we still love this monitor !	1
My little one had reflux really bad so a friend of mine recommended the Snuza . One night it went off , he had spit up and was on the side of the bed where he couldnt breath well . He recovered as soon as I got him up and gave hard pats on the back but thank goodness I had the snuza on him . I just had twins and bought another one so they could wear them ! I 100 % recommend the snuza to anyone with new borns , especially preemies or little ones with reflux issues !	1
We use this all of the time . It is so universal on carts and high chairs . It provides more comfort and safety for our daughter . The toys are a little lame but still keep our daughter entertained as needed . Like that it is reversible but the patterned side is still unisex in my opinion . Light and washes up very well . Great purchase for the price .	1
This is great ! ! ! ! ! ! No issues . It fits Target carts to Cosco extra wide carts . On public high chairs it seems kinda big and the back does fit perfectly , but hey it does the job and cover the chair . I mostly wanted it for the dirty nasty shopping carts . The toys are removable and washable . I replaced the toys with the inter locking rings in the loops provided on the cover with my child 's favorite toys instead . I love this and cant see why ANYONE would spend $ 60+ on any others .	1
Bought this for my 8 month old that puts her mouth on everything and it has been great . It fits big and small carts and high chairs perfectly . Love it ! !	1
Bought this for my son when he was about 5 months old and he is still using it at 8 months , every time we go eat , to the store or anywhere we can take it . I have washed it several times and have never had a problem with it ! It fits almost any shopping cart or high chair we have used it with . I would suggest it to everyone !	1
I always thought this was one of those 'fashionable ' things parents get for their precious bundles of joy but when I got to that age when my precious bundle of joy wanted to either put everything in his mouth or gnaw on everything- rusty looking carts and High chairs at restaurants- I said no please ! ! ! ! This cover is extremely easy to fold and wash . Though its reversible we only use one side so that it does n't defeat the purpose . I really like the two dangling toys which help keep the kids entertained for a while at least ... ..Again definitely recommendation as this seems to be the one cover that fits over even ginormous Costco carts !	1
This cart cover is gender neutral and very easy to & # 34 ; install & # 34 ; with one hand ( a big plus when you are holding the baby , diaper bag , etc . and trying to put this contraptionon the cart ! ) The two removable fabric toys are ok , nothing special . Overall I really like this cover .	1
This is hands down one of the most useful baby shower gifts I received . It 's HUGE and the elastic edging means it will fit on anything , from tiny restaurant high chairs to gigantic Costco shopping carts . I just keep it in my car and I never have to worry about my baby licking dirty metal cart bars or picking off old gum from a cart . It also comes with a couple of mildly-entertaining toys , but the nice part is the little loops that the toys are attached to since they allow you to attach your own toys.Other nice features are that it 's machine washable , and it also comes with its own little strap so that you do n't have to use the gross , chewed-up , often broken ones that come on shopping carts and high chairs . Make sure you put the strap through the back of the seat , though , otherwise it 's not really going to serve much of a purpose.The fact that the cover is reversible seems kind of silly to me since the whole point is that there 's one clean side touching your kid and one not-so-clean side touching the seat so you would n't want to switch them around , but maybe that 's just me ?	1
It holds all of my baby 's pacifiers to her outfits or stroller sleeping bag . You just tie it through a hole on the pacifier and clip it right on . Easy to use and constructed well . Really cute for a baby girl .	1
I love the camo look on these pacifier clips for our little man . They clip on easily and securely . They also wash up nicely if something gets spilled on them . I like the loop through the pacifier handle . I think it secures the pacifier a lot better this way . I think for the price , you ca n't go wrong .	1
Great set . Need something for my newborn . This happens to match since of the other accessories that we have for the car seat . So I 'm glad there 's three .	1
These are wonderful so my little one does n't lose her binky or toy on the ground anymore . The quality is wonderful . They clamp onto car seat and stroller straps perfectly and stay in place . Great product !	1
My infant figured out how to detach every pacifier holder we could find until this one . It holds tightly and wo n't let go ! The color is also really cute .	1
These are great for keeping my son 's paci off the floor ! They are a good length and they wash well , too . I just throw in teh washing machine and air dry .	1
These are cute and the clip is strong . Perfect ! We are well versed in the paci strap and we 've gotten all kinds under the sun for our daughter and really these are the best . Do yourself a favor and stick to this style .	1
We 've bought a bunch of these since our daughter was born . She 's 12 months now . It works as intended , but I just wish its shorter . I do n't understand why it needs to be so long.It does n't wrap around my daughter 's neck ( that 's also a worry either way ) , but when she was crawling or when she bends forward , the pacifier would touch the dirty floor and we would need to either wash the paci or place a new one if we 're somewhere that has no soap and water . The paci would also get tangled behind her back when she 's in the car seat and it 's hard for her to pull it out . If pacigrip would be shorter , it would eliminate all these problems.It 's hard to clean this . My husband thought it would be ok to wash them through the washer and it just rusted the metal clips . So be careful of your baby sticking the metal part in their mouth ... Make sure it 's not rusted . Also , after a while of using the same one , the grip tends to weaken until it does n't grip anymore.Overall , it helps us not lose too many pacifiers and it keeps our baby calm by having her pacifier near at all times .	1
These are sturdy , cute , and reasonably priced ( much better than buying each one separately . ) The clip is strong , but designed so it does n't snag or otherwise damage baby 's clothes .	1
I LOVE these clips ! They are easy to use , stay on the pacifiers really well , and do n't leave any marks on the clothes .	1
Pros : stay on clothing but does n't tear or rip ; length is perfect ; design is cute . These clips are so perfect for not loosing paci 's or have them bounce all over the ground	1
This was a great buy . They are very functional and we love the color . We started using them for pacifiers but the work for little toys too .	1
These are such a life saver and only cost a couple bucks . Totally worth it , I would recommend to anyone !	1
These stay on to our daughter 's clothes without ripping even when pulled . They are a good length and the pattern is super cute . We have these on most of our daughter 's pacifiers but they are especially useful in the car . We attach a paci to the car seat strap and so we know that we will never be without a paci in the car .	1
Over the years I have tried many different brands of pacifier clips . The Booginhead clips are my absolute favorite and are the only one 's that have held up over time.Clip : The clip has a nice tight grip making it difficult for baby to pull it off ( with many other pacifier clips my son would give a small tug and they 'd come right off ) . I 've never had any issues with it leaving marks or damaging clothing . The clip can be a bit difficult to open especially when they are brand new.Cleaning : I usually just wipe them down but I 've also put them through the dishwasher and the washing machine with no problems.Durability : Many of the other pacifier holders I tried fell apart after a few weeks or use . I 've been using the booginhead pacigrips for more than two years now and they still work great.Appearance : Some of the other reviewers noted that the pacigrips they received were different from the picture . I ordered the blue pinstripes-they look just like the picture .	1
I 've gotten lots of compliments on these ! I like the color and they do what they are supposed to do . At first it was hard to unclip them , but after some use they loosened a little and are easy to put on and remove now .	1
Not much else to say ! These loop onto any pacifier very easily , and they clamp so awesomely into clothes without damaged the clothes and without slipping.I previously used the nuk and another name brand pacifier holder for our baby 's nuk pacifiers , but it can be tough getting the plastic loops onto the pacifier , and the plastic clips easily slid off baby 's clothes , so I now far prefer these PaciGrips !	1
I bought 1 for my son a while back , love them . They are so sturdy , but easy to clean ( important cos my son loves to chew on it ) . I dont use them for pacifiers but to clip his toys , blanket or sippy cup ( by the handles ) to his stroller.I got these for my friend .	1
Love this crib ! Style , size and color are perfect for us ) ca n't wait to start using it , only few month left ) )	1
This crib is so much nicer than I expected based on the price . It looks beautiful , well made and expensive . I could n't have been happier . There was a paint smell when I first set up the crib , but it was completely gone within a couple of days .	1
We found out we were expecting twins and needed to buy a crib on a budget that looked similar to our current crib - the Oeuf Sparrow . This crib was a good match . It was pretty easy to assemble and is sturdy enough . One of the screws did n't fit where it was supposed to ( it was more oval than round ) . I asked Amazon if they could replace the screw , they could n't . I resolved myself to heading over to the hardware store to look for a screw that would work . ( Amazon offered to send an entire new crib but I could n't imagine taking ours apart and dealing with that ) . Ended up calling South Shore customer service and they sent a new bag of screws in a weeks time . Perfect . Sometimes customer service makes all the difference in how much you like a product .	1
Simple straightforward directions , easy to assemble . 3 settings for mattress height is nice . This is n't heirloom quality furniture but very decent quality for the price .	1
My delivery person slammed down both of my south shore cribs I ordered so I was worried they 'd be damaged . I opened both boxes ( one had a huge tear in the box ) and much to my amazement , they were well protected inside and unharmed . All hardware was included , they assembled quickly with 2 people , and they are sturdy . I got one crib in white , one in espresso . No complaints with either . Great if you are wanting a reasonable modern/simple crib .	1
so pretty and I love it white as you can ue it for both boy or girl . I love this crib its simple and sleek , it seemed easy to assemble but it was a bit trick for one person .	1
I am a new mom and was very paranoid about leaving my daughter in her room alone . This baby monitor is perfect . The video is great and the sound clear . I am very happy with this purchase	1
We have the monitor upstairs and the receiver downstairs . Works great . We particularly like that the sensitivity can be adjusted . For the money , hard to beat .	1
Alright , this is my 4th child , and my 4th or 5th monitor . It is by-far the very best I 've had ! The camera quality is excellent , I love the screen feature that turns it off when there is nothing to view ( and turns it on if there is noise ) . The music feature is cool , the nightlight is great , and I LOVE how lightweight the monitor is ( so I can pin it to my pants without them falling down ... hahaa ! My old video monitor was HEAVY ! ) . The ONLY feature I would add is making the camera capable of swiveling from left to right , as well . But hey -- it 's still great -- and I will live comfortably with it just going up and down ! Got this on a great sale on Amazon -- watch the prices -- they fluctuate often ! !	1
UPDATED from 2 to 4 stars : I had to let the battery drain completely before it would recharge . Now when I place it on the charger after a few hours , it charges fine . I use it every other day and it works perfectly ! Good things:1 . Super easy to put to together and use2 . Good picture quality3 . Like the temp feature4 . Sound is very good5 . Does not lose signal ( house is about 800sqft ) Bad : The charge base for the parent monitor does not charge ! The red light does not turn on . I have pulled the battery out and re-plugged and then placed on charger and it worked . But once you remove it , and put it back on the base the red light does n't turn on . I know it needs to charge because I have used the monitor for several hours.I will be contacting customer service to see about a replacement . Will update review once I hear back from them ...	1
As all of the reviews have said , this is a good camera , I wish the motion was a little more smooth , but I guess this how it goes with digital vs. analog , which I am used to . Reception is good , holds a charge well and is very informative with the temperature gauge . The night vision could be better , but I can see my soon good enough .	1
I like certain elements of this , specifically being able to talk to your baby . My only major complaint is the volume . It 's very quiet even on the loudest setting . Also , to turn it on , you have to hold the power button for a long time , like you 're powering up a cell phone . Finally , I have to keep it on the charger for it to stay on . For some reason it turns itself off after a while if you turn it on when it 's not sitting on the charger . I 've had two Summer video monitors for my first two children , both of which ended up breaking . I would say that when working the Summer video monitor is a better product , but they do wear out ( and we do n't use them very often - only for naps on the weekend ) , so for the price , I think this is a better choice .	1
Our first baby video monitor was a Levana and it was terrific ( 2008 -- the BABYVIEW20 ) . That being said , it did start to have audio problems , then the camera stopped working , but it exceeded our expectations and lasted three years of heavy use.When I have the opportunity to get this , I jumped . As good as our old model was , this one beats it in every way.IMAGE QUALITY/RANGE/BATTERY LIFEThe quality of the image is great -- in the daytime or very dark . In the darkest room , it 's not a green image or anything , the baby is lit by infrared light that allows you to see the baby rather well in black & white . It transmits 15 frame per second , so the video is rather fluid . The range is crazy far . I was able to go about 300 feet away from the house and it still worked great . After quite a few months , we still have n't had it go dead yet ! The book lists four hours of battery life , which is longer than we ever need.CAMERAThe camera is more compact than the other model and it actually has the ability to use AAA batteries to transmit in addition to the AC adapter . It has a speaker for lullabies and the `` Talk to Baby '' feature I 'll write about below . Remarkably , it has an external temperature probe , which is a testament to the designer 's desire to get an accurate temperature . It also has a nightlight on top that is switchable from the monitor . The green power light on the front is rather annoying to us when it is near us when sleeping , so I covered that up.FEATURESThe thermometer feature is a fantastic bonus -- you have to enable it in the menu , but it is nice to always know that it is not some extreme temperature.Talk to Baby intercom is obviously to talk to the baby , and this is not something my daughter likes , but some kids might do well it . This also opens this kit to other interesting uses -- like a front door monitor.You can play lullabies from the monitor -- with five to choose from . My daughter is n't a fan of this feature either , but maybe yours will ! This was a big annoyance on our last model and this one , too -- the button to play a lullaby is the on the side of the monitor , so if you drop it , hold it wrong or bump the button , you could play a lullaby and wake up the baby . NO ! ! I wish they would add an option in the menu to deactivate those buttons.The last options in the menu are to activate VOX ( silent on the monitor until there is noise ) and the ability to change between multiple cameras.This model has a charging base that appears to have an intelligent charging system that stops charging when the battery is full ( or at least the light goes out when it is charged ) . If this is intelligent , it will help the battery life.Overall , I 'm impressed with the changes Levana has made in this model and I 'd highly recommend this model to everyone that is looking for a baby video monitor .	1
I looked around for a while before I finally decided to purchase this prodcut and I am glad that I did.The battery life is great and the monitor is big enough that you dont have to squint to see what is going on with baby.I love this monitor and would definitly recommend it to friends !	1
This is my second Levana baby monitor . The first one was the Levana 32108 Era Advanced 2.4 Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Picture Capture and Digital Zoom . I really like that one , it is smaller , light weight and easy to take around . This on is a bit bigger but still very light weight . It has a bunch of great features some of them include : Temperature monitoringNight visionLED Night LightLullabiesVoice Activated ControlIntercomThe voice activated control is a new thing for me , it was n't on my first monitor from Levana . It is a great tool to conserve the battery power during night monitoring . So , when you baby awakes and starts to make sounds the video and audio pops on so you can see and hear your baby when he needs you.My favorite feature is the night vision . I wake up so early to get ready for work that I do n't want to put on lights to see my baby . With this monitor I can see him with the night vision while he is sleeping in the other room while I am getting ready . It is great . I can see him perfectly on the screen.The camera can be powered using 4 AAA batteries or using an AC adapter , which every works better for you . If you need to put the camera somewhere where there is no wall outlet it is great to just use batteries instead . With batteries it says it has a battery life of 3 hours . The monitor has a rechargeable battery . The battery life on the monitor is 8 hours . I have n't tested it fully for the that amount of time so I do n't know if it actually goes 8 hours.Between this one and the other one I own , I would choose this one . Longer battery life and the voice activated control while sleeping is a great feature , plus the night vision that I already have . This one also comes with 5 lullabies as well .	1
Really good product ! ! Was happy with the price ! Everything seems to work well with the product so far . The night vision is a little grainy but still quite decent . I would recommend to a friend .	1
This is my second monitor . I had first purchased a Motorola monitor that I fell in love with , but when it broke I was very disappointed with the customer service as it could not be fixed or replaced and I was told to just purchase an entire new baby monitor system , well I paid a fortune and decided not to go with another Motorola product after that experience . I looked around and found this one . At first I did n't think I would like it because the price was much lower and figured it was just an & # 34 ; okay & # 34 ; monitor but it is so much more than that ! I love that it shows the temperature in the room and has what is called & # 34 ; peep mode & # 34 ; to save the life of your battery . I can go days without having to charge the battery . With the Motorola Monitor I had previously you could n't go much longer than an hour without having it charging in a wall somewhere which I found quite annoying . My toddler wakes up and is sort of quiet in his crib but when he moves around in his bed or makes the smallest sound the monitor senses it and the screen and sound come on right away . When he is sleeping the sound and screen is silent it 's great . The clip on the back makes it easy for transporting up and down my stairs because I can just clip it on my belt . It has a talk feature which I do n't use because it frightens my son but also has lullaby music also . Overall I am very impressed with this monitor and you ca n't beat the price ! I will soon be putting two children ( a toddler and a baby ) in the same room together and I am thankful that I have this monitor . Highly recommend this product . I know some people mentioned the light on the camera was bright but I found it to be a helpful nightlight if I need to check on my son in the middle of the night .	1
This baby monitor is better than the more expensive ones I have seen . Only issue is that I wish that the screen was a little bit bigger , otherwise it works perfectly ! Has a stand/clip so the monitor can be put anywhere from the counter to your waist while doing things around the house . The music selection is calming to baby and being able to talk to him is fun . The picture was more detailed that I thought it was going to be which is a huge plus . No issues thus far with battery and we have had it for several months now.I see us using this for years as we keep an eye on our little one while playing and napping in his room .	1
Purchased this monitor for our new baby on the way . It was very easy to set up and the instructions were easy to read . I do recommend testing it our to learn all the functions before baby arrives . I thought the lullaby function was n't overly loud as some of the other reviewers had mentioned but maybe that depends on the baby . The monitor picture is very clear and the night vision works extremely well .	1
The Levana Jena Baby Monitor is a great video baby monitor at a reasonable price . The receiver has a fairly standard sized screen with decent resolution . Of course the pictures are not razor sharp but they are more than adequate for a baby monitor ( especially at this price ) . The range is pretty good ( I get a clear signal even outside our home ) . The night vision feature also works well for subjects within 5 feet of the camera . Further distances can be see but not as clearly ( keep in mind that the night vision works with infrared lights so the picture will be black and white when in complete darkness ) . *** Positive Points : ***- Good quality construction for both the receiver and transmitter- Two way communication ( You must hold the talk button for your voice to be sent to the transmitter ) .- User replaceable battery in the receiver ( the transmitter can also work with batteries ) .- Has a temperature reading and sound level LED's- Receiver has a belt clip that doubles as a table stand- Has musical lullaby as well as a night light*** Negative Points : ***- Slow frame rate ( makes the picture look choppy though this is ok for a monitor ) - Menu system is a bit of a pain though fairly simple once you get the hang of it- Night vision does not work well beyond 5-10 feet ( this is true of most baby monitors ) - Noticeable audio delay between transmitter and receiver- lullaby volume can not be adjusted on the transmitter ( it is very low and barely audible ) Overall : This is a very good buy for a video baby monitor .	1
Baby monitors can be very complicated , and many come complete with thick user 's manuals that look more like car manuals . This monitor does have a comprehensive manual , but we did n't need to read it to figure out how to set up and use this monitor . The video picture quality is good , even in very low light . Also , the range of the monitor is quite impressive . We carry the monitor all over a big house and have never had a lost signal or any interference with the sound or the video feed . After trying several high-end ( and expensive ) video monitors , this one is our favorite .	1
I used this as a kitten monitor and it worked great ! The full color monitor was clear and allowed me to see my kittens in their nest with momma cat . I opened it out of the box and was viewing my kittens within minutes ( and without reading a manual ) . I found the battery life great and did not have any problems with the audio as some previous reviewers posted .	1
I have had this for a month now and we use it nightly . Overall this is a great product for the money.Pros : Video camera is clear even at night and has a zoom feature , so you can zoom in on your little one ; Night light ( though is n't that bright , and if you have it away from the changing area , there it really only helps you see your little one for night time feeding ; lullabies , my little one loves to hear the music ! Temp - love that you can set temp guides and an alarm goes off if it gets too hot or too cold ( based on what you input ) adjust screen brightnessTwo way talk - though I do not use this as mine is only 3 months old , this will be useful in the future when he gets older , now my husband just likes to mess with me ; ability to add more cameras ( up to 3 more ) , this was huge for me as we are planning on having more childrenCons : no panoramic ability , so the view you have on the screen is your view unless you zoom and my little one moves all around the crib , so I have had to adjust the camera several times to make sure I can see him ; LOUD beep when parents unit comes on sometimes ( randomly ) or when it reconnects to the camera . ( not sure if it is loud on the childs unit , I do n't think it is , if it is it has n't bothered my little one ) but it is definitely loud on the parents unit.If you use the batteries on the childs unit ( I do not recommend ) the childrens and parents unit lose connection A LOT , I just tried this for the first time and it has lost connection so far at least 10 times in 20 mins . so I would keep it plugged in if possibleno ability to connect to iPhone , ipdad etc.Overall this is a great product for the money . Would I like a bigger screen on the parents unit , sure , would I love to move the childs camera via the parents unit , sure , would I like to connect to my iPhone , sure but for the price , it works well and I am happy with it .	1
I was rate for 2 stars because the pictures qualities and some options that need to be improve . But today I change the rate to 4 stars . Because I have tried another brands more expensive than this one . This one is not perfect but it 's the best baby monitor I have used.1 . The price is not too expensive2 . The sound volume and sound activate ( VOX ) works the best if compare with another brand I have used.If you 're looking for the best baby monitor quality Infant Optics DXR-8 is the best one only thing I did n't like they do n't have sound activate which I think the most important for baby monitor.Samsung SEW-3037W is better picture quality than Levana but ca n't compare the quality with Infant Optics DXR-8 . Samsung SEW-3037W has sound activate option but the sound volume is too low.Every products have pros and cons . If you do n't mind the picture quality almost black & white but they do the jobs that you need from the baby monitor and the price worth to pay this one good to go .	1
I have already owned two of these Levana modelsLevana BABYVIEW20 Interference-Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Cameraand was rather pleased . I found the second one I acquired ( after 2 years of use and abuse of the first one ) was less disruptive to my wi-fi.Anywho , I wanted to give this even FANCIER model a go.Like : ~The camera is on a stand that allows for MUCH easier positioning.~WALKY TALKY ... wish that had been around when my little guy was first born.~Temp reading of the room~Even less disruptive to WifiSame ( but like ) : ~Voice ( vox ) activated ... though this one you can adjust the sensitivity for the sounds it reacts to~Lullaby option~Night lightNot so much : ~While the picture quality is good , it 's a touch more grainy and jerky , in my opinion.~I do n't like having to go into a menu to turn the VOX option on/offOverall , the improvements are worth upgrading to this model . If nothing else , having the option to 'talk ' back into baby 's room and tell them you 're coming would have helped with my stress at times when I was delayed in getting to the room .	1
The YouTube video for pairing a second camera was more helpful than the manual . Very good monitor for the money once you get the pairing down .	1
When Amazon offered this too me , I was not sure . I already own a great baby video monitor at a reasonable price point . I love the Levana Jena monitor , though , it has some well thought out additional items that the one I owned did not . The light feature and lullaby features turned out to be so convenient . I have a baby and toddler in the same room and my toddler often misplaces something in his crib , so I can use the light feature . I love being able to use it to speak to my children . I find it easier to tell my toddler , I am on my way with his millionth request for more water or some other delay tactic than here him scream and wake up the baby.I totally recommend this monitor , it 's not that much more than the budget-friendly option I previously purchased but this one just has a few extra features that make 's it worth it .	1
I have one of Levana 's earlier iterations of the baby cam , and it was decent enough , but was lacking refinement . I 'm happy to see this new model had made some quantum improvements over their previous model I owned.Excellent Picture QualityThe screen on the base unit is stunning given the size . It almost looks like it 's in HD or something -- the images are super crisp and clear , and the quality is quite good . The viewing angles are excellent too.Excellent Signal and RangeThus far , I have experienced no dropouts or stuttering in my video playback whatsoever . The connection between the base unit and camera is rock solid , even when I went outside with the base unit.Superior Night VisionIt is n't just hype , this Levana baby cam has one of the best night vision capabilities I 've personally used . It comes close to the quality and clarity of my expensive HD video camera 's night vision , which is pretty stellar . It easily captures images in a dark room from over 10 feet away . Not sure why you 'd want a baby cam so far away from what you 're trying to keep an eye on , but you never know , so it 's nice to know the capability is there.Easy User InterfaceThe menus on the base unit are all very clear and easy to follow . Truthfully , I barely looked at the instruction book . My theory is , well designed products should be self explanatory -- the more you have to look at an instruction book , the more I consider the product to be a piece of junk . Products should do the job they 're designed to do with little to no required reading . If not , it 's a sure sign that the product 's design department has failed at their job , and ultimately , have failed their customers as well.No Ferrite CoresMy old Levana had ferrite cores on the cables of both wall chargers for the base and camera ; a seemingly little thing , that 's actually big thing -- and it was n't good . Ferrite cores are those little cylindrical blocks that are sometimes placed on either end of a cable . There 's a technical reason why they do it , all of which matters little to me . Ferrite cores simply get in the way of laying power cables in a neat and clean manner -- and for a baby monitor -- they 're just redundant beyond belief . Thankfully Levana did away with them this time around.LullabiesThis is a cool little function , that for me , sets Levana 's baby monitors apart from the rest . Glad to see they improved upon this nifty feature and even added a couple more lullabies . Just push a button on the base unit , and baby gets to hear a nice lullaby playing from the camera 's speaker.Two-Way Intercom - Great For The Front Door TooExcellent feature ! The base unit can 'listen in ' on the room with the baby cam , and hear everything as if you 're in the same room . But Levana takes it one step better -- the base unit also has a talk button , so you can speak into the base unit , and your voice will be heard in the room with the baby camera from its speaker -- brilliant ! I 'm actually considering using this as an intercom for my front door , so I can SEE who is at the door and actually TALK to them before unlocking and opening the door . And since the camera 's microphone is always on and listening , there 's no need for anyone standing at my door to even push an intercom button to talk to me -- which means I can mount the cam safely inside my screen door where no one can mess with it.Long Lasting BatteryThe camera can be powered with batteries , or the included wall adapter . I have mine plugged into the wall , so I ca n't speak to battery life for that one . But the base unit comes with a rechargeable battery and a charging cradle . I like the cradle because it eliminates the step of having to plug the base into something to charge it . With the charging cradle , you just set the base unit into it and it starts charging automatically . Battery life on the base unit seems to be getting me around 8 hours , which is what the manufacturer estimates , so spot on with that one.Bottom Line - This is a fantastic little baby cam with some great improvements over the old model . Battery life is great , night vision is stellar , excellent picture quality , good range , easy to use interface , and a 2-way intercom all adds up to a winner for me . If you need a baby cam or just want a 2-way intercom with video , this is a really good one . Good luck .	1
The basics : -good night vision-good battery life for the rechargeable monitor -- a little under the claimed 8 ( edit : actually about 6 after a few months ) -- but the camera should be used with the adapter as even the 3 hour life with rb 's can be a pain-good picture and camera quality-built-in lullabies are a nice touch-sound is clear-range is plenty for all but Trump Tower ( `` Still asleep at 7 am ? ! You 're fired ! `` ) -built solid enough to last.Short of the battery life issue and a price tag that would be more competitive at about 100-120 instead of 140 , this is a good unit .	1
This is our second Levana Monitor . Our first one , which we used for our son , was just ok . I really was n't expecting awesome quality with this model . I 've got to say , we 've been pleasantly surprised ! The picture quality is awesome , not the grainy fuzziness that we had to put up with on our last one . The battery life is great , and it has some really cool features that we love.I did n't think I would use the Lullaby feature , but I actually use it all the time . It seems to help calm my daughter once I lay her down . I also like the two-way talk feature . Whenever she starts to cry , I can calm her and shush her while I 'm getting up and heading into her room . She does n't always stop crying , but more often than not she stops and looks around : ) The only issue that I have with this , and I 'm not sure if it 's a problem with all of them , or just with my unit , is if she starts crying or screaming REALLY loud , the sound on my receiver will cut out and I ca n't hear her anymore . 90 % of the time she starts out with some gibbering or regular crying , which I always hear and respond to , but very rarely she 'll just start screaming and when she does , the sound will give out , while the lights still light up as normal.As I said , not sure if this is an isolated indecent or what . I have n't read about this happening to anyone else , so it may be just mine . This little glitch aside though , I absolutely recommend this monitor . It 's been so handy to have around the house , and made the transition of moving her into her own room so much easier .	1
The Levana 32111 is the fourth video baby monitor system I 've had , and , price considerations included , is the best one for the money . Like another reviewer , I 'd prefer a pan-and-tilt camera because my son always seems to move to a spot on the very edge of the screen , but those cameras tend to be almost three times as much as this one . If I were to buy two other cameras ( the monitor being able to select from four sources ) , then I could have my son covered from all directions , and , I imagine , have him feeling paranoid that he is being watched for the rest of his life.The daytime video quality is very good . I 've set the camera up on one end of the living room , which is about 22-feet wide , to watch my son eat his breakfast ( instead of chasing the cat ) as I shave in the bathroom , and from close up to about 15 feet away it 's perfect ; more distant than that is still clear but tends to result in a brief `` where 's Waldo '' moment because the monitor is still a relatively small 2.4 '' in size . This is not really a concern ; I do n't believe new parents will be placing the camera up in any suspended ceilings , 16-feet away from the crib.The night vision is pretty good . Yes , it is `` grainy . '' Even military quality night vision tends to be grainy , with glowing eyes and all that . Of course there is no color-contrast , but from crib-range , the night vision quality is just fine and you can easily identify a sleeping toddler . I was actually impressed by it , having seen it on three different models previously ; I thought this model holds it own nicely.The sound quality , while lauded by others , I thought was not quite up to the standards of the other monitors I 've used in the past . There is a time-lag , first of all , of up to a second in transmission time . I ca n't say the sound quality is bad , but I think it is sub-par compared to the other monitors I 've used ... although to be fair , those monitors were all about twice as expensive as this one . When I use the monitor to `` talk to '' the camera , the sound quality is , again , not as good as the other monitors I 've used.The lullibyes do seem to have better sound quality than incoming voice , but are difficult to control from the monitor . I 've pressed a button accidentally more than once and had the lullibyes begin , and it is n't easy to stop them when this accident occurs . They also always seem to be louder than what the voice is set for , which can be shocking.The on-screen temperature guage is a nice feature , but as with all monitors I 've ever had , the accuracy is open to debate . It 's very localized and will differ , almost assuredly , from the other side of the crib . It 's a good general measuring tool.All in all , I really like the 32111 Jena video monitor . Especially for the very economical price , it is very worth it .	1
I bought this monitor because my other audio/motion one was starting to act up and I think as my baby has become a toddler it & # 8217 ; d be nice to have the video and I don & # 8217 ; t need the motion anymore . Especially when he moves to a toddler bed and can get up on his own in the night.Things that are great : - The price ! I paid $ 99 . That is cheap for the amount of features you get.- I can talk back to him . I think this will come in handy as he gets older and I can tell him to get back to bed ( when he moves to that toddler bed ) or tell him I hear him and am on my way up.- Battery life . I & # 8217 ; ve not had it off the charger for 8 hours but I & # 8217 ; ve had it off for as long as I need and haven & # 8217 ; t had an issue . At night it sits on my night stand on the charger . My other monitor had two monitors and after 6 months the one monitor had to just stay on the charger at all times . The other one only lasts an hour off the charger now ( I & # 8217 ; ve had them for about a year and a half ) .- Can expand to more cameras . I haven & # 8217 ; t bought the other camera yet , but I do move this one around to other rooms in the house . If he is playing in one room and I need to fold laundry in the other room it is easy to move the camera but once I save up enough pennies I & # 8217 ; ll buy a second camera to just keep in that room.- Temperature . I like knowing the temperature in his room . We keep his door shut and it can get stuffy in there or on the winter nights ( we live in Florida so not that cold ) it can get chilly . At a glance of the screen I know how I need to adjust the a/c . I know I sleep better at the right temperature and of course so does he . And it & # 8217 ; s all about keeping him asleep . Peaceful nights for him mean peaceful nights for me.- Distance from camera to monitor . We live in a 2,400 sqft house . He is on the second floor in the front of the house , our room is on the first floor in the back of the house . You couldn & # 8217 ; t get him farther away . We & # 8217 ; ve never had an issue with the camera and monitor loosing signal.Things that are good : - Video clarity . In the light it & # 8217 ; s better of course . In the dark it is good enough . I have it about 8 feet from him ( mounted on the wall above the crib looking down ) . I & # 8217 ; m sure if I had it closer it & # 8217 ; d be better but then I could only see a smaller area . He is all over the crib so I needed a wide angle shot . Regardless it is plenty good enough to see what I need . You aren & # 8217 ; t going to be able to see your kid breathing with it , if that is what you & # 8217 ; re looking for this one isn & # 8217 ; t the one for you.Things that are ok : - Sound . There are five bars ( one lowest sound , five loudest sound ) . If I have it on 3 it & # 8217 ; s not very loud . If I have it on 4 it & # 8217 ; s the sound level I & # 8217 ; d prefer but you start to get background noise . 1 and 2 is no sound basically . 5 is too much background noise.- The nightlight . I & # 8217 ; d hardly call it that . It isn & # 8217 ; t very bright at all . If anything it & # 8217 ; d just show you enough light to find the camera . We have another nightlight so that isn & # 8217 ; t really anything we needed anyway.- Lullabies . I & # 8217 ; ve only used it once and it annoyed him . He fussed even more so we never use it.Things I don & # 8217 ; t like : - The button placement of the lullabies . They are on the side and when you pick it up it is right where your fingers would press those buttons . My husband has accidentally hit them a few times and then you scramble to quickly turn it off . Not sure why they put them there , it seems like the worst place for those buttons.All in all I & # 8217 ; d recommend this monitor . For the price it is a great video monitor . It has the ( what I consider ) important features and none of the other frills I want with that hefty price tag .	1
I love almost everything about this monitor ! The only thing I do n't really use is the music . I do n't think there is a way to adjust the volume for it either . I like the intercom and that the monitor will let you know the temperature of the room ! Having this video monitor has brought me peace of mind when putting my baby down for bed because I can see her ! I also like that you can add more cameras without having to get another monitor . The price was good and I would recommend this product for others to purchase !	1
This video monitor was a great price and has worked well for us for the past few weeks . Picture quality and battery life are n't excellent , but good enough . Set-up was incredibly simple . Reception is good , even around corners and across the house .	1
This product requires little if any & # 34 ; fine tuning & # 34 ; out of the box and displays a high fidelity picture with audio even across the house .	1
Our baby is n't here yet but we have tested it . It seems to be pretty good . I got it at a nice price point . Hopefully it works out well for us !	1
So far , I love this monitor . I would have given it 5 stars if batteries lasted longer in the camera or if the camera had a rechargeable battery.Pros : Clear video displayGreat night videoTons of featuresIntercomCamera can be plugged in or use AAA batteriesDecent sound qualityCons : AAA batteries do n't last long in the camera.The handset battery does n't last all night.It does n't change diapers or wash dishes . LOL	1
We had another baby monitor from this company and it failed miserably . We are cautiously optimistic about this one working much better . Our `` just out of the box '' impression was that this model might work better.The monitor and camera are a bit bulkier than the other model , but they just might be sturdier too . We have no issue with the size being bigger . We like how this model allows us to view in color during the daytime . If the monitor works as promised , we will enjoy it and find it very useful . We have been using it for over a week without problems ( the old monitor did n't even last that long ) . I will revise and edit this review as our opinion changes over time with use.The picture quality is great day or night . It is really amazing how cameras can be made to view things in a dark room with technology today . The set up is super simple and takes just a minute or two . Having a baby monitor with a camera is great to see if your little one is sleeping or not ( or standing there waiting for you ) . Taking a look to see if our little guy is covered or not is really important to us too.The only thing my wife does n't like about this baby monitor is that the monitor powers down after some time . I understand that this is some type of power saver mode , but for my wife it is just an annoyance .	1
This Levana 32111 Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor is a rebadged European market Switel BCF810 , and it works superbly . The reviews here prevented me from imagining what to expect . Both the daytime color image and nighttime black & white images are great . The sound is crisp . I like that room temperature reading on the monitor . I have zero complaints .	1
I registered for this since it was affordable and basically what I needed in a small , 1BR apt . It gives me the reassurance of sight even though I can hear her without it . One of those luxuries us new parents can enjoy.It 's very easy to install on a wall , thanks to the screw holes in the back of the camera . Recently , I 've noticed the camera freezing on the handheld which is odd . It comes back within a second or two , but still odd . Once I did have to turn it on and off again to get it to come back.At night , the night vision can be choppy and I wish this had pan and tilt , but for the price ... it 's a good product . I am satisfied with it .	1
I did a lot of research on the baby monitors.one of my friends told me about levana and then I thought I will give this a shotthis was in the price range I was looking , as I did not wanted to spend a lot of amount on a baby monitorthis has got it all , good picture quality , sound , good night vision , resonable priceI would recomend this to others	1
I purchased this after using a summer infant model for just over two years . In fact , that 's how long I could stand using it before I decided to replace it . My criteria was to find a capable and inexpensive monitor . The issue with the summer infant was there was tons of static and interference and it kept me up all night . And the video quality deteriorated . The good things were the large screen size , which the levana unit definitely lacks . But that 's really a minor thing . And a separate question as to why most new monitors have tiny screens . I love the portability of the unit , and the battery life is quite good when unplugged from the charger/ base . It 's gone a the night before needing a charge . The video quality is good enough , I can see perfectly whether he is asleep or awake . Sometimes the sound is a bit digitized , and I can also hear my son and the sound coming from the monitor a few seconds off so that sounds weird but overall the volume levels are nice . I have n't used the lullaby mode , seems unnecessary . So glad I purchased this unit , overall I 'm very happy with it ,	1
Image is super clear , love all the music features , the night vision feature . Its great when we 're downstairs and LO is upstairs sleeping and I can peek in on her via video and see/hear her clearly . : )	1
i had some issues before buy this monitor but now all have gone , its really good product , there is no problem on range of device , easy to use .	1
This pairs well with the Inglesina fast table chair for on the go . I love that it keeps toys and food on a surface I know is clean . It wipes and cleans easily and is perfect for restaurant use , but could be useful at home as well .	1
these work well , but i wish the suction cups were a little stronger . they fold up very nicely and are very compact , but the suction cups do not always stick , so my kids end up just pushing around the mat instead of eating . when it does stick , it works great and my kids eat right off the mat .	1
This works great unless the table is very textured . I like it a lot better than the disposable ones- it 's easier to set up and less wasteful . You have to really push on the suction cups for it to work- you will be able to see the indentations on the top of the mat .	1
I was never comfortable going out to eat or having my son eat at the table because of the messes . I would make him use his high chair most of the time . With this mat he can get messy and we just fold it and dump it !	1
What a great idea . This mat prevents toys and food from falling on the floor . It is soft and easy to clean-up .	1
This is my second summer tiny diner mat . The first i put in the dishwasher and ruined it so I bought this second one . Its functional for our situation -- we use a portable high chair that hooks on our countertop and this keeps things clean .	1
I do love this place mate . It 's easy to wash .	1
I bought this toy when my son was just 3 months old and he loved it ! He 's a few months older now and still plays with it all the time . It 's colorful and the parts that hang off rattle and make noise . He loves to look in the little mirror . It is a great toy !	1
My five month old son loves this cube ! The bright colors , bold prints , variety of textures , and toys tucked away in the cube make for lots of entertainment . It appears to be well made , and it 's just downright cute . He also loves the mirror on the section that opens . This would be a great gift for a new baby , but I think my five month old son will continue enjoy for a while .	1
Bought this toy when grandson was 5 months . Although he still plays with it once in a while at 9 months he has bigger fish to fry . He would have played with it more had I bought it when he was 2 months old . It has lots of interesting things attached to it that baby will find fun to play with .	1
My daughter has played with this from about 2 weeks old ( looking and watching it ) to currently at 7 months old . She keeps coming back to it to play . I also like it because it is battery free .	1
For anyone who has played the `` pick up '' game with their baby/toddler , this is the perfect solution . The first couple times you pick up a cup off the kitchen floor after your baby/toddler has thrown it from their high chair it is cute and endearing . By the 100th time it is no longer cute , it is back breaking ! The SippiGrip has been a blessing . It easily attached to our high chair at home and to our stroller while we are out . We have n't had a sippi cup hit the ground while taking a walk since we got this product . We bought two and I attach a cup to one and a toy to the other when we go out . No more lost chew toys ! I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family .	1
Really like this product , but I was able to find it cheaper at another retailer . I have two of these sippi grips ; one for home and one for the diaper bag !	1
I do n't know what I would do without this strap . I used them with my first child and now again with my second . Toddlers love to throw their cups on the floor ( especially frustrating on dirty restaurant floors ) and these prevent that !	1
this is not so great for smaller items . but wonderful for what i needed it for . i have been buying them in all the colors !	1
This thing is so handy . No more sippy cups thrown overboard on outings or in the car . It 's also handy for toys , and we 're using one to keep an entertainment center closed . We have 2 boys , age 1 & 2 , and get by with 3 of these .	1
I did get another brand that worked the same but was a bit longer , which I like , but this was is very good , too . No complaints .	1
I definitely am happy with this purchase . The velcro clip is easy to use and works as described.I do have some wishes for this product though:1 . I wish the strap could be elongated . It 's not quite long enough to strap to the highchair and still have the baby reach it to her mouth.2 . It would be nice if it came with a suction cup to stick to the bottom of the high chair or a table.Overall , I am happy with this purchase . We found a way to stop bottles from being tossed onto the ground !	1
I love this product . It keeps my daughter 's bottles of disgusting floors when we are out in public . Especially now that she enjoys dropping it on purpose . It even works on our skinny gumdrop bottles .	1
Works perfectly . Just long enough to keep the sippy from hitting the floor when attached to the stroller . Kid misses not throwing her cup but she will get over it .	1
These sippy cup & # 34 ; leashes & # 34 ; were great in that you can adjust them around different sized cups . In the couple of months that I have had them though , not only have my kids figured out how to undo the velcro ( and the cup goes flying to the ground ) , but the velcro is also tearing up part of the leash that does n't have a backing to it . I have since found sippy cup leashes that have a buckle instead of the velcro , although I 'm sure it 's only a matter of time before they figure out how to open that too !	1
These work great ! I love the grippy material that goes around the cup so it does not slide . 10 month old baby loves to throw her sippy cup over the side of her high chair , so this has been perfect for saving parents from playing fetch the whole meal time . She just pulls her cup up from the string when she 's ready for it again . Some of our sippys are too narrow for the loop , but it works fine to pull it tight and close the Velcro over the buckle to keep it shut .	1
My son tosses his cups all the time . These are great for the kitchen and also in the car so he can toss it and be able to reel it back in without help from me .	1
One less thing to juggle and try to keep off yucky floors when at a restaurant or out and about .	1
It holds a heavy sippy cup or bottle of water with no problem . Resist all the pulling by baby.The only issue , the color I bought is too light and attracts stains .	1
These things are fantastic ! ! They attach to any size and brand of sippy/straw cup ( even a bottle though I have never tried ) . We even attach them to smoothie cups we may get when we go to the mall . I do n't ever have to worry about my child dropping her cup and it no longer being drinkable because the straw touched the nasty floor . They also work great for making it through the & # 34 ; I like to throw my cup on the floor while eating in my highchair , making a big mess & # 34 ; phase . I 'm expecting baby # 2 and have already purchased some gender appropriate ones for the second child . I ca n't do without these !	1
These straps are easy to attach both to the highchair and to the cup ! They come apart easily when you want them to but stay put when the little ones try to remove them ! No more chasing the sippy cup around the kitchen ! !	1
Love these ! Fits all the different sized cups & no more constantly bending over to pick up the cup ! !	1
My daughter loves that these keep baby 's sippy cup off the ground while in the stroller , and off the floor while in a restaurant !	1
My child tends to through her sippy when she is done with it ( or just to watch it fall ) . This keeps it off the ground and she can even reach over the side and grab it to pull it back up . Have n't found any sippy it does n't work with , however , narrower ones can make it easier to open the velcro if you have a child with great fine motor skills like mine .	1
Its super small but super adorable ! My baby hasnt been born yet but Im sure when he/she is they will love to chew on this cute little toy : D	1
My lo ca n't get enough of giraffe 's in general and this one is no exception . It is just the right size for my 6mo old and is bright enough to grab her attention .	1
This is nothing special , but perfect for a baby . They can grasp and gnaw on it as much as they like and the colors are bright . It would be nice it the plastic/rubber it is made out of was a little softer for chewing . Please with the product .	1
Cute little rattle . Great quality . Bright colors . Great price . You ca n't go wrong here . Baby seems to love it . Thanks .	1
and goes with an outfit I hope my son and daughter-in-law will take a picture of my first grandson in while holding this .	1
I bought this solely to use at photo shoots for my now 3 month old . It worked great over his disposable diaper . He is currently about 13 pounds and it looks I 'll be able to use it for picutres for at least 4 or 5 more months .	1
Excellent diaper cover . They run a bit big . I thought I was ordering the Whisper soft cover by Bummis , but this is a different material . The Whisper Soft covers are made from a very light nylon waterproof fabric , and I thought that would be good for the summer months , but I guess they are no longer being made , so if you find any , they are spendy . These are the same type of fabric as the Thirstee covers . I just did n't like dealing with the snaps . Great product .	1
Almost exactly what I was looking for ! We used rubber diapers to cover our cloth diapers . Now that we are trying to potty train , we want rubber diapers to cover the potty training pants.Our son weighs 23 lbs ( right in the middle of the Medium size ) . His body profile is tall and skinny . The medium was too big for him . We tried the medium on over his pajamas and diaper . The pants were still too large . I returned the medium and ordered the small .	1
Our 7 month old had no problems transition to cloth diapers b/c we found great comfortable combinations for him . We use bulky fitted diapers and these bummis pull ons are roomy . They do n't pinch his chunky thighs but still cover the big fitted diapers in entirety . Easy on the pocketbook too .	1
It is a bit big but I especially like that because it can fit over a cloth diaper . The elastic around the legs and waist are nice and snug but not too tight .	1
I bought these to prevent blowouts with our cloth diapers . They are easy to wash and rarely leak . I really like these covers .	1
This is a good staple when cloth diapering and using pre folds . It 's a quick and easy cover that is easy to slip on . Holding up well , and fits well .	1
Cute baby pants with very soft material , easy on baby 's skin , not plastic . No leaks yet , so far so good .	1
I am a big fan of Bummis products in general , but I think these might be my favorite covers ever . Pull-on covers make tons of sense for babies once they decide they do n't want to lie down anymore . I reach for these time and again because I can put them on while my son is standing and that minimizes the crying . ( Plus , they pass as shorts if you do n't look too closely , so I feel comfortable taking the baby out of the house in them . ) The material is flexible , wipe-clean on the inside , and thin but not flimsy . This cover and the green one I bought the same day are in heavy , heavy rotation at my house ; I quite often use only these two all day long . So far , the only signs of wear are on the irksome Bummis tag ( which , of course , is on the outside like all Bummis tags ) . No stains ! Given the price , I happily recommend them to everyone who is looking to cloth diaper on the cheap . The colors are great -- vibrant but not neon . I only wish more colors were available ; I would buy one of each if there were.My son has fat little thighs , and I had some worry that the leg holes might be too tight , but that has not proven to be the case . They do not leave marks . The covers are capacious enough to work with nighttime diapers ( right now usually a Disana tie nappy stuffed with a small prefold , or else a prefold stuffed with a flat ) , but compress nicely with daytime diapers and fit under clothes with no problem.I had one poop blowout and nothing escaped the cover . There *was* a slight issue with stuff getting on his legs when I pulled the cover off , but it was not a lot of extra mess and I do n't deal with giant blowouts often enough that I hesitate to put these on him . Babies wash pretty easily after all , and like I said to begin with I 'd rather minimize the screaming from a baby forced to lie down !	1
Our baby was born at 6.5 lbs . She was too little for the ERGO without the insert . We took her out for a daily walk since she was three weeks old . She outgrow the insert at 10 weeks .	1
Arrived quickly and in perfect condition . We 've already used it with my 7 lb son for several walks : ) He loves being bundled up tightly in it .	1
I 'm pleased I bought this for my newborn son . It seems very comfy for him and has enabled me to use my new Ergo carrier from the very beginning . My only negative comments would be that at six weeks he is already growing out of it ( but he is a large baby ; I would have been able to use it much longer with my first child ) and that since the weather where I live has just turned very warm , I worry a little about my baby overheating in this .	1
There is so much to love about this booster seat , starting with how safe I believe this seat to be . It has total side impact protection and the headrest has head wings which sort of wrap around the sides of my son 's head which is made of EPS , an energy absorbing foam designed to withstand impact . The seat cushion is also made with EPS . There is a latch to secure the seat when your child is not in it to protect front seat driver/passengers should you be involved in an accident ( God forbid ) . Unlike our previous booster seat , this one has a recline feature which makes a huge difference as far as my son 's comfort goes , because he often would complain about not being able to fall asleep comfortably sitting straight up in his other booster . It also comes with a cup holder on each side that can be pulled out which is very handy . This seat seems safe , my son rides very comfortably in it and I highly recommend it .	1
I decided to install this in my 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan ( for a review with photos check out my blog listed in my profile ) . My son is 8 but he is really skinny and only weighs 66lbs . According to my state laws he 's still required to be in a booster seat . I originally had a Britax that we would transfer from vehicle to vehicle so we decided to do a permanent install in my minivan . This of course is only forward facing so if buying for a toddler be aware of that since most toddlers are required to be rear facing until at least the age of 2.Now the installation was a breeze . It took my husband approximately 5 minutes to set up . WIth the latch system there really is nothing to it . This Car Seat can fit any child from 40-120lbs and up to 57 '' so we know this will probably be the only one we 'll need until my toddler is ready for her own.My son without a booster does n't sit securely in the back seat with his seat belt . His seat belt does n't fit him right which is why the booster is needed . We love the head rest which is totally adjustable and has that side impact protection built in , and he said that the seat is very comfortable . A lot more comfortable than his Britax . I must say that it is a little bit more padded that his Britax was.The seat can be used with or without the backrest but for us it worked better with the back rest since the seat belt fits a lot better with the backrest on . ( I included pics on my blog ) .I do n't allow my kids to eat in my van but the added cup holders on the sides of the seat is an added touch that families who do will enjoy . I also like the arm rests . Great for those long trips.All in all this is a great booster/car seat and I would certainly recommend it .	1
This is the third car seat my wife and I have owned and I 'm quite impressed with the design of the Peg-Perego . It 's for older children , at least 40 pounds and up to 120 . As the child gets larger the back can be easily removed so it essentially becomes a booster seat . The seat is very easy to install and uses the cars own seatbelt rather than straps on the seat . There are cup holders on either side of the seat and the upholstery can be removed for easy cleaning . All in all it 's a very nice car seat that I would trust with my daughters safety .	1
Having switched from a better known booster to this one I have to say I am impressed . First , I like the color scheme as it matches the interior of my car very well . Also , my 4 year old claims that it is much more comfortable than her last one . It also has a better skid surface so the seat does not slide around without a seat protector on the leather seats . It seems very sturdy and the weight range is perfect to be the last booster seat we will need for her .	1
We tried two other toddler seats before settling for this one.The first GRACO , felt flimsy , the second DIONO , the sides felt like blinders , just too closed and narrowing , and finally , settled on Peg Perego Viaggio HBB , after many , many reviews being read.Three reasons we settled on this seat:1 ) While it has the side support , it flares out just enough for the our child to have a view from both sides . He still needs to bring his head forward to look out , but it 's not like blinders . Also , the sides flaring out feel less closed off and more roomy.2 ) seat latching to the car3 ) arms rest are short and lower , so do n't confine child and push his elbows up higher than they need to beReason for 4 stars1 ) seat does n't allow for adjusting the seat belt strap up or down from the shoulder , which really should be an option for all seats.We 're happy with it .	1
I am editing this review after having the seat for 3+ months . The seat is good for kids that are at least 6 years old . There is nothing securing a kid to the seat , except for the lap belt , so it is not good for kids who move around . Please note that this seat does not have a five-point harness , similar to some other booster seats . It is also not easy for young kids to secure themselves into and get out of since they need to be able to use a car 's regular seat belts . The colors of the seat are as shown and the seat is quite comfortable . It is also a perfect seat when space is needed since it is very narrow , especially as compared to some of the Britax booster seats .	1
Cute melon teether . My baby was 4 mo when I got it , cute and bright but not particularly favorite as does n't have appropriate ridgy texture . It is ok to good teether to have at home .	1
Our 5 month old is starting to teeth and chew everything . We put this in the fridge and our kid loves it , it really seems to calm and sooth his gums . I would highly recommend !	1
Our 5 month old son loves chewing on this , even after it has warmed up . It loses it 's chill after only a few minutes . On the positive side , and the reason for the four stars , it is easy to grasp , and he seems to be comforted when chewing on it . It is also ridiculously cute when he is chewing on it , since it looks like a tiny piece of watermelon . Do n't put it in a microwave sterilizer bag , it will become a little deformed , though still usable . We got ours at a local big box baby store for around $ 5 .	1
This is another great teether from Dr. Brown 's . This is probably my daughter 's second-favorite teether . It is nice and pliable and can go in the freezer if you want it to .	1
helps	1
This is my son 's favorite teether ... .I 've bought several and this is the one he seems to be drawn to . He actually laughs when I get it out for him . I ca n't really say why he likes it so much , but it 's a winner around here !	1
We loved this tub for the first few months of our baby 's life . It was super easy to use and clean . I 'm sad that our baby is too big for this now !	1
if you have a short list of & # 34 ; must haves & # 34 ; this should be on it for new baby . ( especially if first child ) Makes life much easier giving baths without breaking your back or fear of dropping kid etc . ( i had super large baby and could use it till she was 6 months old which was 29 & # 34 ; 22 lb )	1
We have a generic pedestal home depot sink and this worked perfectly . It is angled well so baby 's head was up out of the water and served as a good cushion barrier from the sink . Huge plus was that it folds up so nicely for storage in a very tiny bathroom .	1
It did n't take long for baby to grow out of this but I loved it for those first weeks . If I just want to give her a spongebath I would still use it , as it does n't hold much water .	1
I may like the Puj Flyte more than the original Puj ! The material is slightly harder and the shape of the flyte fits well in our sink . My husband prefers it over our original puj because he feels that the original falls apart from the magnets . This has no magnets so he has nothing to worry about : )	1
I have a small bathroom so I did n't have space for a big tub . This is perfect . When I 'm not using it , I hang it on a command hook on the tile wall of my bathroom . It fits perfectly in my bathroom sink ( I have a larger sink with an oval shape and a faucet that can move to the sides so it 's perfect ) and then stores neatly out of the way . It fills up quite nicely , so my son is somewhat submerged in water . He 's only 6 weeks and fits very well in this ; however , I do see that I will have to use something else in a few months , which I do n't mind . I did n't have the option of using my kitchen sink to bathe my son , so this was a perfect fit for me . My son loves it as well , though I have to admit he is very complacent and has not been picky about anything . At times when my husband is bathing him he holds him a bit unconventionally , and my son has even grabbed the sides of this when he feels unsafe . I still hold his head when he 's in it because I 'm not sure if it would cushion his head enough if he were to bob against it , but as he gets a little older I will probably give him more freedom in this . I just wish it came in more colors.UPDATE : My son finally outgrew it at five months . Well , he actually outgrew it at four months but my husband insisted on using it for another month until his splashing got to be too much for the sink . I kept it hanging in the bathroom because I loved it so much and just did n't want to accept he was too big to use it by giving it away . Then one day I finally had to bathe him in his new bathtub ( I bought the duck infant bathtub , super adorable and my son loves that one now ) inside the big bathtub ( because of his splashing ) , but I had n't gotten around to buying a kneeler yet . I was folding a towel to place on the tile for my knees , when I happened to look over at this hanging on the wall . When folded , it 's a little curvy but just about a good width and length to kneel on . Light bulb goes off and I take the flyte , place it on the floor in front of the tub ( curve towards the tub wall ) , place the towel over it , and kneel on a light and fluffy cloud ( I 'm sure you can just kneel on the towel , but this gives a little spring to the towel ) . No need to spend money on a kneeler , this is perfect for that use once the baby outgrows it ! I was able to kneel just on this without the towel also , but the towel gives a little height so I can reach in the bathtub better . Obviously it 's not worth buying it as just a kneeler since there are cheaper options , but if you 've used this tub for your baby and now he or she has outgrown it , keep using it this way unless you have someone you can give it away too . Just thought I 'd post this suggestion to show that it can last longer than just a couple of months .	1
We were using it at home and to travelEasy to clean , immediately dry , folds , light , warm with water , fits most of the sinks .	1
We love this . It 's perfect for our small sink . He grew out of it at about 25 & # 34 ; . But now he 's big and strong enough to go in the tub with a little help .	1
This was the perfect option for us -- we live in a small apartment , and I hate things that take up a lot of space . We 'll eventually migrate to a mesh seat in the big tub , but for now this is awesome . Be sure it fits in your sink though -- some are too big or too small . I just wish that the company made an option for converting this into a & # 34 ; big tub & # 34 ; reclining seat as the child grows !	1
We registered for the Puj because we lived in a small 1 bedroom apt and knew we would be traveling around a lot in the first few months of my son 's life . The puj was awesome for these first few months . It folds up and can be hung in the shower to dry between uses and when we traveled or flew places with him , it could easily fit in our suitcase and then we could bathe him in any sink -- kitchen or bathroom sinks.He is starting to outgrow the puj now at about 3 months but now he is big enough to bathe directly in the bathtub , so we can avoid having to buy one of those huge infant tubs that do not fold up for easy storage .	1
I used the puj flyte with my 1 month old . I actually put my 4 year old in the tub , washed him up , then bathed the baby while my older child continued to play in the water . It was great to get two things done at once . Plus my 4 year old was occupied while I took care of the baby 's needs . When I laid the tub in the sink I was happy to see it fit perfect . The sink spout easily filled the tub as the baby laid in it . The baby was not so sure about the bath . The height of being in the sink worked great . It was nice to have everything so close and in reach . I did n't have to bring a bunch of stuff out for his bath . The tub itself fills up and has a little hole further up the side . I would have liked an additional hole to release water lower down . Evan was not too happy about all the extra water and I think it is easy for it to fill too much . Plus when it came to dumping the water it was a little more difficult to maneuver , but I managed . Overall , I like this tub and will continue to use it as baby 's bath tub while my 4 year old is in the bigger tub to help save time.I think the puj flyte is perfect for people that travel or have limited space . It is really compact , easy to store and use . I also think its great for anyone that wants to use the bathroom sink instead of the kitchen sink to bath their baby .	1
I needed something that stored well because we lived in a tiny apartment . This thing is well padded and fits well in the kitchen sink . I never tried it in the bathroom sink , but I think it would work just as well . We now use it in our larger/deeper kitchen sink in our house . Love that I can still put it away .	1
It took me a long time to decide between the Puj Tub and the Flyte , but I eventually decided against the Tub because of reviews about how the bottom would randomly unfold . I did n't have this for my first child , but I wish I did ! It was so much easier to sponge bathe a newborn in this . It fits in our small sink perfectly , but I would recommend a high-arc faucet so baby does n't accidentally hit it . It 's very easy to clean , quick to dry , and easy to store . I just hung it on a 3m hook behind the bathroom door . I would absolutely recommend the Flyte !	1
After about 6-8 weeks , he was too big . We tried to push it to 10 weeks and he made quite the mess.My only complaint was that as soon as we out him into it , the water level got RELLY low . To remedy this , we left the water running a trickle while he is in it . This worked great until he accidentally hit the hot water off with his arm and cold water started running onto him . He started to wiggle a lot and I had to pick him up mid-bath to readjust the temp , haha .	1
Soft and flexible . Works great for newborn . We put it inside a flat bottom oval tub , which we then put on top of the changing table so it was easy to reach .	1
We have a small home lacking storage so I was searching high and low for a compact bath solution for my newborn . This is perfection ! It fits in the bathroom sink , no back breaking bending over a bathtub . It is soft enough to comfortably cradle the baby yet structured enough to keep the baby safe . I would highly recommend this as a wonderful space saving option .	1
I was a little hesitant to purchase this since it 's a bit pricy BUT ... I 'm glad I did . My daughter absolutely loves these . Like others mentioned , the banana is the only one she can really fit in her mouth but she still loves playing and looking at the other fruit . I 'm sure this is a toy we 'll keep for a long time !	1
A wonderfully simple basket of fruit perfect for little hands to grasp . My son pulled out all the fruit and put them right to his mouth . Of course , since the materials are organic , I was n't the least bit worried . The basket and fruit are made to last and are also great to start teaching names of fruit and colors . A cute toy to sit out in the nursery .	1
Cute , organic and safe ! Great to bring along as a stroller toy , super teething toy ! Takes forever to dry in the dryer !	1
~BACKGROUND~I purchased this but with an additional fruit ( pear ) for my 5 month old son who has really started teething.~PROS~- Organic cotton- Soft Egyptian cotton- Feels sturdy and well constructed- Bright colors- Different shapes and textures- Good sizes for infants to grab and hold- Fair Trade Product - socially and environmentally sustainable~CONS~- No so far ! ~TIPS~If you are going to purchase organic/natural products for your child , use non-toxic cleaning products to clean the toys such asCharlie 's Soap Laundry Powder , 2.64-PoundsorSeventh Generation Powder Laundry Concentrated , Free and Clear , 112-Ounce ( Packaging May Vary ) .Washing instructions : Machine wash only . Tumble dry until toy is completely dry . Do not immerse in water and leave out to dry . *Tip : Place a bath towel in the dryer with the toy to dry faster.~CONCLUSION~With so many products on the market that have unknown dyes , BPA , toxins , etc . in them it is great to find products such as these that I know are safe for my infant .	1
We bought this toy for our 8 month old and really enjoy it . He seems to like the simple toys : wooden things , stacking cups , etc . The pieces are very nicely constructed and durable , the colors are vivid . The basket is stretchy and everything fits so I might be buying a few separate pieces ! This is a wonderful companion toy withEarlyears Lil ' Shopper Play Set . I put both sets out for him so some make noises and some are brightly colored . He seems to enjoy both and we definitely play with these more than any plastic toy other people have purchased for us .	1
Very cute , and the organic cotton makes it safe for my child to chew on . It is much smaller than expected , however . Each fruit is only about 4 inches long ( give or take ) .	1
I had read all of the reviews for this product and the ones similar . There are many on Amazon that look identical - please watch the measurements . I think a lot of the negative reviews are from people who didnt watch that . I wanted a smaller sturdy organizer that I could use for a road trip with my little one . This is exactly what I got . Big enough for a couple toys , books , snacks ... .thats all I needed . This is perfect . I like that it has the little grippy type stuff on the bottom too so it wont be as prone to slide on leather seats .	1
I love this ! My backseat is n't messy anymore ! And my toddler can reach some of her books and toys from her carseat . We should 've gotten this ages ago . It is nice and sturdy , and it attaches to the middle seatbelt so it does n't slide around . I never thought I 'd be so excited about a car organizer , but I am .	1
Just the right size to store items within reach but without a huge bulky item that hogs up a seat . I have a small SUV and need the space ! Well made , lots of different sized pockets on the inside , and the whole things folds down with Velcro panels when not in use . The only additional feature I 'd like is a tie or other attachment to keep it in place . My lil one grabs everything ... Great buy ... definitely recommend !	1
I bought this based on all the reviews I read about it and sure glad I bought it ! This is great for my 4yr old and 2yr old they can both reach in a get things that they want and my car no longer looks like the toy store exploded in it ! Great purchase !	1
The right price for a highly functional caddy . We use it on the floor between the front seats in our ancient Previa van - keeps our ice scraper , road atlas , paper towels , etc . all nicely organized and a great place to shove extra stuff during road trips .	1
We bought this for our son and niece . It took them a while to figure out how to use it but it 's great for tummy time when they are on their backs and it hangs above them to pull on .	1
I was lucky enough to get both the monkey and elephant at my baby shower . This has been a cute little toy for my 3 month old . He smiles and laughs when I pull it and it makes noises . I have probably done it 100 times with each toy and the batteries are still good . I & # 8217 ; m always worried about buying these types of toys in the store because I don & # 8217 ; t know how many other people have come along and played with it in the store and used up the batteries . I always try to grab one from the back of the shelf , hopefully my friends did that when they bought them for me . I see someone posted a way to replace the batteries , but I don & # 8217 ; t think I & # 8217 ; m that motivated to do it when they die . I & # 8217 ; ll try to update my post when the batteries die so you know approximately how long they last.To activate the sound you have to pull on the bottom pretty hard . I & # 8217 ; m sure it will be quite awhile before my son has the strength to do that . Until then he gets a kick out of someone else pulling it . There & # 8217 ; s only a couple things I would change on it . I wish there were a little more to the toy . Like crinkly ears , a squeaker or a rattle inside . The noise it makes is the only thing it does . When the battery dies it & # 8217 ; s pretty useless . I also think it & # 8217 ; s overpriced for what you & # 8217 ; re getting . Aside from that , I think it & # 8217 ; s a cute little toy that is a good addition to our toy box . I carry it in the diaper bag so when we are waiting around someone ( like my older daughter & # 8217 ; s soccer practice or the doctor & # 8217 ; s office ) I can get a few minutes of entertainment out of it before my son gets bored and fussy .	1
My 5 month old loves this toy . It occupies her while we are driving and it is sensitive enough that she is able to pull on the toy to make the music come on by herself .	1
Someone gave this to me at a baby shower . We took it with us on a plane ride and I forgot to take it off the carseat . The tail unwound from the yellow loop and when we got his carseat back , the elephant was missing . Our son loves it so much we had to buy it again . I do n't mind the cute little sounds it makes , because it makes me proud of my little boy 's hand-eye coordination .	1
This was a baby shower gift for my son . This monkey was perfect for my little boy . It plays fun music that I do n't get annoyed by like many other baby toys . It attaches easy to many things . My little boy likes to chew on it . He ca n't really pull it for music on his own yet so either I do or my 4 year old does it for him .	1
This cover is awesome ! Cheap , adjustable , easy to use . Also , this is the only cover I can use all day without it getting soiled or wet .	1
For the price , I really like it . I think its on par with Thirsties . There are no tabs for the velcro , so it needs to attach to the front velcro strip . Its very trim , and I think my son could have worn the small as an 8 lb newborn easily . He outgrew it , except for maybe swim diaper . I think the fit is smaller than the other Bummis covers , especially more trim than the Bummis SWW .	1
I like how trim this cover fits my son , and no leaks ever with this cover . However even when I attach the velcro to the other side of the velcro it always I repeat always comes undone and sticks to the leg and butt portion of itself , fraying the fabric . If I do n't have this cover in its own hosiery bag then it sticks to all of my other covers and damages them as well . not good . However if you remember to keep it and its own bag in the wash or wash it by hand and do n't care a whole lot about the looks of it , then this is a good cover for you . If you 're one of those cloth diapering families that likes to have their baby out and about in a t-shirt , cover and baby legs then , this is not for you .	1
This was one of two covers I bought for my first cloth diapering attempt . The other cover I bought was a Thirsties . I prefer this one 10 fold . For starters I read the other review about the leg gusset and I completely disagree . The leg gusset in the Thirsties only serves to annoy me . They have done nothing to prevent leakage and they are a bad fit around my sons chubby legs . These fit my son perfectly and fit the cloth prefold perfectly in place . The Thirsties on the other hand seem that you have to shove the prefold in to fit on all sides . I can change out the prefold in these very quickly whereas I have to fumble to get him changed with the Thirsties . I 've found that the waist band of the Thirsties does not sit flush with the waist once the prefold is in.The Bummis however , does.I would recommend these to anyone using prefolds .	1
I originally had pink ones of these but found out we are having a boy . I really like these covers . They go on and come off very easily . I 've read in some reviews that it 's hard to see the measuring numbers b/c of the cover . It 's never bothered me since it turns easily and I can read the numbers just fine . Must have for glass bottles ! I drop mine all the time and I have n't had one break .	1
these fit the dr browns bottles perfectly like they should , the only minor frustration is getting the holes to line up just right with the oz markers . not a deal breaker .	1
These are nifty little sleeves that make the bottle easier to hold and provide some protection for the glass . The one problem is that no matter how you put it on the bottle it is very dificult to read the ounces to know how much is in the bottle	1
My 1 year old daughter has a habit of throwing EVERYTHING when she is done with it . This protective sleeve has truly saved us so much money . Love the glass bottles and this product is perfect for making sure they do n't break . Believe me my daughter has tested it on our wood floor many times .	1
I really wanted to switch to glass bottles - I think they are more sanitary and last much longer than the plastic ones . But of course I was nervous about them breaking . These sleeves are fab ... give you a good grip and you do n't worry if the bottle accidentally gets knocked on something like a counter edge .	1
No complaints ... this is of good quality and fits the bottle perfectly . The only thing is they did not specify clearly on the instructions if it can be left on the bottle and sterilised together with the bottle or it has to be taken off each time .	1
I like these bottles a lot . My baby seems to do the best with Dr. Brown 's bottles . We have several other bottles with venting features , but she does the best with Dr. Brown 's . The glass bottles are much heavier and wider than the plastic version . I also have the 4 oz Dr. Brown 's plastic bottle which are much easier on the hand . The extra pieces can be challenging to clean which are part of either the plastic or glass version . We noticed build up in the white piece near the cap . I have had these bottles for over 3 months .	1
I have read another review that they never used the sling option because it was too high above the water . But I use it specifically for this purpose . I took home a preemie who was sponge bathed in the NICU for a month . He was tiny when he was born but still tiny when he came home just over 4lbs.The sling works great because he is not sitting in the dirty water . I can use it right next to the sink and rinse him off well with this sling . I have used this sling for almost 5 months and it is just like new . I have tried out the tub without the sling for just warm soaks but will probably change to a less slippery tub when he can sit up on his own ( yes he is delayed a little ) . Over all I love this tub , its simple , easy to clean , sturdy , and no leaks . Ca n't say anything negative about it personally because it has lasted longer than I intended . And for the price I would buy a second one if it had n't lasted as long .	1
Got this tub for my parents house when we brought baby to visit . It works great ! And great price ! Love the mesh hammock for newborns . He now has graduated and is able to bathe without it . Good buy !	1
I really like this tub . My baby is just starting to outgrow it at 7 months old . If I could improve it at all I would make the seat underneath the netting a little differently since she struggled sitting up in it . I would also add a thermometer to the bottom . Otherwise , fantastic tub !	1
The netting or first layer works well . My Daughter is 3 months and enjoys it . She has used it since she was a couple weeks old . It allows for easy use because it cradles baby well and keeps her in water yet head is well elevated .	1
I like this bath tub because it can support my newborn baby when we take her to bath ( After her umbilical cord fell ) . It saved a lot of energy , even though we still need to hold her . She is very relax on the sling . Great price with great quality product , ship to home .	1
This tub is great because it will last us so long ! The fact that it is a 3 stage product was the selling point for me ! More bang for your buck !	1
I love that this tub adjust to the different sizes as the baby grows . Right now our baby is still newborn but with the little holder it makes giving her a bath much easier .	1
My baby loves taking bath in this . We had this on our registry and started using this tub when she was a four-day old newborn . We gave her sponge baths in it . She was very comfortable in the sling and now , at four months , she has progressed to the baby level . She sits with a little support in the tub while we bathe her.The tub is so comfortable that I gave my little girl a bath without anyone 's help when she was hardly a month old ! As a first time mom , this was a pretty scary thing in the beginning but she was very relaxed and at ease.It is very easy to clean the tub and very sturdy to move around . The only grouse I have is about the sling . It tends to get stinky once a week . Nothing a quick wash does n't cure but it took us a couple of days to figure why the tub suddenly started stinking.I know there are advanced versions of this tub , with soothing noise and all that jazz . But I really see no point in buying those because bath time is generally the most perfect time to bond with your baby . Why would you need any other distraction ? ?	1
These are really great to have they are soft on baby gum and new teeth , and it does not leak love that .	1
This spouts ( nipples ) are a must have to feed bottles with cereal . I originally bought 1 set but I have 3 now . Super convenient and less frustration for you and baby . I ' ve been using since our baby was 3 and half months .	1
My daughter is very picky and reacts badly to increases in nipple flow or any changes . So , it makes a nice transitional step for us to have this option to affix to her regular bottle . I do n't think the flow is very fast , possibly about the same as a level 3 Avent nipple , so this may not have proven to be helpful once we get to the next stage . At least it gets us over a technical requirement for her new big girl preschool.NONE OF THESE REVIEWS ADDRESS NATURAL style bottle and nipples VERSUS CLASSIC and which this fits . First of all , these are one-fourth this price at Buy Buy Baby . I drove far to go get them , taking my Avent Natural nipple ring to try with these , and indeed they DO NOT FIT THE NATURAL BOTTLES OR RINGS . And not many people use the Classic Avent anymore . So I had to buy the sippy cups with these nipples in order to use them . You need the Classic bottle rings to fit these to the bottles . Yes , that will work on the natural bottles . It is all very confusing and event Avent customer service had no idea ...	1
I like this spout , it does not leak , and no other pieces are required because I lose them often . This spout really helps when you are trying to wean the baby to a cup from a bottle .	1
Easily connected to my Avent bottles ! Perfect flow for my 8 month old baby . These work much better than other sippy cups .	1
These are great spouts , my little guys used avent bottles and I had a tough time transitioning them to sippy cups , I tried just about every brand out there , these were the only type of spout that they took to and were able to drink from without getting frustrated , plus they fit all my existing avent bottles . So , I love these spouts , but you can buy them considerably cheaper from the Philips avent website $ 3.99 for a set of two plus free shipping .	1
Love that Avent makes a one-size meets all early childhood drinking needs bottle and cup system . While this spout is not leak-proof the hard one is . And it fits to our already-purchased bottles . No need to purchase whole new systems that leak constantly ( when they are supposed to be spill-proof ) . This one allows liquid to flow when you bite , suck or pinch on the spout ... that 's the design . It 's not spill-proof , but does n't allow a huge amount to flow out . Great for the transition time after bottles to sippy cup .	1
This is semi-Life saver to US , our son is really really really picky with every thing and he is so stubborn when it comes to change ! So to switch from a bottle to a sippy cup we had a 1000 failure attempts until his teacher in the day-care suggested that he might tolerate a soft clear spout just like the bottle nipples ! So she bought him the Philips Avent Soft Spout and BINGO what a success : )	1
Great to be able to buy replacements instead of the whole bottle when they have some teeth ; the nipples get ripped up pretty fast and this is wonderful to be able to get only what I need !	1
Purchased these to use on the 4 oz Avent bottles that we already had . They are working great so far , son loves them . I think he likes biting down on them for teething as much as drinking out of them .	1
These blankets are soft and comfortable . I love that they are 2 sided with fun designs . They are very large and keep my son warm even though they are n't that thick .	1
I love these flannel blankets because they are generously sized , so soft and smooth and wash/dry really well . And they do n't look like the cookie-cutter flannel blankets you see at box stores all the time ; the satin trim makes them extra special and unique . I just bought some for my sister-in-law and her new baby boy and she raves about them !	1
These blankets are a great value . Nice size , very soft , and cute . I am sure higher priced blankets are a little better quality but for the price these are great . I would recommend to anyone and I would purchase for others . I have n't washed them yet or used them yet ( 10 wks until due date ) but with this being baby number 3 I have had a lot of blankets ! I would give them a 5 star review if I knew how they hold up in the wash ...	1
nice blankets , beautiful colors . we really wanted to go with more neutral tones for the baby . the reversible prints are great . the fabric is very soft and thin , which works for us due to the climate we live in .	1
These are great ! When my daughter was a newborn last winter , we 'd ordered several packs of the Luvable Friends flannel receiving blankets , which were very reasonably priced and worked great as swaddles . Now that she 's 8 months old and 15 lbs , they 're too small except to tuck around her as carseat blankets , so we needed some larger blankets for the crib , stroller , etc . These are SO reasonably priced , really good sized , nice and soft , and much warmer than the the single layer receiving blankets . My daughter loves them too ! I got the yellow set and it 's really pretty -- love the different prints on both sides !	1
These are great blankets for the price . They 're soft flannel with a satin trim . I have mostly been using them for the bottom of the bassinet , or laying down quickly for a diaper change . It 's nice to carry in the diaper bag and double as a changing pad instead of a more expensive blanket . They keep getting softer the more you wash them , too !	1
Hola quisiera compartir con ustedes que son muy lindas las cobijas , excelente material son muy suaves para el bebe las recomiendo	1
Cute design . It 's nice that it has a different design on each side so you can turn it over and get a totally different look . The satin trim is another nice detail . It is a thicker , heavier blanket . Therefore it is great for the winter , but I would n't recommend buying it for your baby to use during the summer .	1
Wow , such a generous size for a receiving blanket , and bonus . . . beautiful silk edges . Could be babies tag around blanket since it is light flannel weight ! You wo n't find this good deal in any big box or baby store . Glad to find this nice set of blankets .	1
They was much thicker and prettier than I expected . I love how soft they is and the colors are beautiful	1
Love these blankets . Nice and soft flannel . It 's two layers sewn together , so they 're a nice heavier weight . They make a good in-between blanket when you do n't need a super heavy blanket , but a light muslin cloth is n't enough . I love the pattern . They hold up well to washing . As for size , they 're great for laying on top or using as a cuddle blanket when you 're holding the baby , but not big enough for swaddling them in . So I use them to lay on top of her when she 's sititng in her bouncyn chair , or when I 'm holding her .	1
Nice thick blanket and of good size , but pills when washed . Not a big fan of flannel material in general compared with cotton with a bit of stretch like Carter 's . Satin trim keeps the blanket a bit interesting .	1
I wanted blankets for my son which will not be too warm but not too light as well . This is perfect size and keeps my son comfortable . Color stays true even after washing multiple times .	1
the material is the same as that of a regular receiving blanket but a little bit thicker . I love the satin trim and the fact that they 're reversible . Super cute !	1
Very cute designs and not a bad price for 2 and ca n't wait to gift to my sister for her baby shower ! ! !	1
These are very nice blankets and cute . My granddaughter loved them . I also ordered the Pink set ! I do n't understand why the yellow and blue sets came right away , and it takes MONTHS for the pink . Well , they took so long I had to cancel the order , as the baby came and still no blankets . I ordered them like 2 months before too ... . : (	1
I have a disabled child who tends to drool when laying down , I use these folded in half under her head and they do great , plus they are so gentle on her skin , looked everywhere to find more and here they were on amazon : ) , but they are double thickness , so you can use them as burp cloths etc .	1
These are great for the price , quantity in package and very cute . They were bought for use as receiving blankets and so far I have no complaints .	1
These blankets turned out to be nicer than the description . They are a very soft flannel w/ the satin trim . Good price for a quality product .	1
Very nice and soft blankets . They are super soft and thick and I ca n't wait to use it on my newborn .	1
Like the title says , I like it , it 's very comfortable ; however , I purchased it for use in a nursery ( like most people do ) but the cushion covers are not removable for washing . I have a 4-month old who spits up quite often and my options are to spot clean ( which is n't that effective ) , or wash the ENTIRE cushion -- something I have n't attempted because I 'm not sure my washing machine is large enough or if it 's even possible . Other than that issue , I really do like the product .	1
I LOVE this rocker ! ! ! I purchased this for my nursery and it is just perfect ! It arrived on time and was super easy to assemble . I only did n't need any additional tools - they sent everything you need to put it together and I had it done within 15 minutes . Make sure you use the washers provided so you do n't have squeaks in the wood when you rock.The snaps on the sides that hold the arm cushions were a little tough to get snapped but now that they are , they stay in place very well.I have had this item for over a month now and use it daily and it works great for me .	1
I bought one for my son 's room and we love it so much I bought one for my niece who is expecting .	1
I ordered a second glider because I still use one in my older child 's room and I have a new baby . It 's really fast and simple to put together and it glides really smoothly . It 's pretty comfortable to sit in for 30-45 minutes for nursing and rocking.The fabric has a chemical smell though . It 's fading but it 's not very pleasant . The fabric is a very cheap microfiber type fabric but it will serve it 's purpose . If you can sew , you can easily create your own covers for it too .	1
This chair was a splurge for our family- we did n't anticipate needing one of these , however , we love that we bought this for our baby . My husband is 6 feet tall and 250lbs and I am 5'2 '' and 140lbs , it works for both of us and was a great purchase that was a good price without the ottoman .	1
This is a very comfortable glider . I love it ! And it glides smoothly . Side pockets are nice to keep burp clothes in or to tuck away a bottle after a feeding .	1
Overall I like this rocking chair . It was really easy to put on the back and arms . The chair itself seems sturdy and solid . The seat and arm padding is a little chintzy . The back padding is comfortable . The seat is a little shallow so if you are really tall or have long upper legs you may be a little uncomfortable . I am 5'7 '' and the edge of the seat hits about at the middle of the back of my legs . There is about 3-4 '' from the edge of the seat to the bend of my knee . For me , that cuts off my circulation a little bit . If I use a foot stool or if the seat padding were more plush , it would probably feel better .	1
Our baby is a week old and every single time I sit in the chair to breastfeed I think , & # 34 ; This was worth every penny ! & # 34 ; Very comfortable , cute , soft , and calming . Super easy to assemble too !	1
While I am displeased that there was slight damage to the wood/paint on the front feet during transit ( the weight shifted and the feet came through the carton and the feet were not wrapped or otherwise protected ) overall I like this product . It looks nice and the back cushion is very comfortable . I like the high , wide back and the pockets on the arm rests . It took my 14 year old son about 30 minutes to put together and even he enjoyed rocking in it . Since I am tall- as is my 14 year old- I enjoy the fact that my head is not above the top of the cushion , which was an issue years ago with the glider I had when my son was born . This item looks nice in the nursery with my other white furniture .	1
I actually have two of these gliders , one in each of my kids rooms . I really love them , especially for the price . They have held up well ( one is three years old and one is one year old ) , and I use them both multiple times per day . They both squeak a little bit , it 's never been enough to really bother me or my babies , or make me want to pay $ 200 more for a similar chair , but it 's definitely there .	1
I love this glider . I am sitting in this glider right now , typing this review . I would never leave this glider if I had the choice.The only con is that the cushion underneath is a bit thin , which is n't a problem unless you are sitting in it 24-7 , which is what I would like to do . It is cute , and functional , and wonderful . The side pockets are a nice touch .	1
I ca n't believe I do n't see more of these around , this is such an amazing stroller . I have this stroller in black . I spent hours and hours researching . My requirements were a large parent basket , a generously adjustable handlebar ( I 'm 5'1 and my husband is 6'1 ) , a reclining feature , a good sun shade and a folded size that would fit reasonably well into my car ( aka wheels that are n't as large as those on the Bob or Uppababy strollers ) . My `` nice to have 's '' were a reversible seat , ease of folding , aesthetics , child weight limit and a magnetic peekaboo window . This stroller has everything.What I love about this stroller : -The size of the parent basket is unlike almost all other strollers . This is my favorite part.-The adjustable handlebar goes really low for me ( 5'1 ) and high for my husband ( 6'1 ) . I also looked at the Uppababy Cruz and the lowest handlebar height was still too high for me.-I love reclining the seat with a handle instead of having the pull cords that other strollers have.-The hood size is generous.-Reversible seat to watch/interact with my baby while we 're walking or face him forward and let him look around.-Two peekaboo windows ... and they 're magnetic ! -5 point harness-Folding this stroller is amazing . I do n't have to put it on the ground . It took ~ a week to get used to , but you become a pro quickly . And not to mention the fact that you can fold the stroller with the seat facing either way -- this really sold me ! -Mesh parent pocket in the back is very handy.-Shocks on wheels.Here are the things I do n't love about it : -Heavy-Straps are always getting twisted and therefore difficult to use.-My son 's head rests on the buckle-thing at the top of the straps . In a year from now his head may be above the buckle-thing and it wo n't be a problem , but right now it 's on the lowest setting for my 10 month old ( and he 's actually tall for his age ) .-The handle to recline the seat is really sticky ( but not a big deal , you just get used to how it operates ) .-I wish the mesh pocket on the back had a zipper or some sort of closure because things that I keep in there fall out if I fold the stroller with them in the mesh pocket ( for instance I always like to keep a tube of sunscreen in the mesh pocket ) .-While the shade is generous , it could use an extra pull out , if even just a fabric piece that is tucked under the last fold ( like there is on my Chicco Keyfit 30 infant car seat ) .Overall , this is the most amazing stroller .	1
At $ 259 + tax , this was a steal for a stroller with reversible seats . I also ordered the GT wheels so I can use them for walks . This is not my keep-in-car stroller . I have a compact stroller for that purpose . The regular wheels are actually good enough because of the all wheel suspension but the GT wheels are better . For only $ 60 it 's a cheap upgrade . I wish all strollers offered upgradeable wheels.I have a 2010 BJ City Elite so I will compare the versa to the elite . These are the things I do n't like about the Versa . The other strollers I considered were the bugaboo bee and mamas and papas urbo2 . I also returned the Contours Bliss . See my separate review of it . The Uppabay handle was too high for me.FABRICNot a fan of the fabric on the versa . It 's a thick woven fabric . I like the slick nylon-like fabric on my city elite.WHEELSTurns out the plastic wheels provide a pretty smooth ride . However I ordered the GT wheels before I received the stroller . I do like the option of being able to upgrade the wheels.RECLINEThe seat reclines only 3 different angles . The city elite has one of those rope reclines so I can recline the seat to any angle . My 5 month old fussed the first day in the Versa but got use to it the next day . He took two naps in it.HEIGHTI would like the seat to be higher up . Also the entire stroller feels low . The handles adjust but the pivot point is very low compared to the city elite . I 'm only 5'2.FOLDLove the one hand fold but once folded it does not stand on its own . At least the seat folds inward so the seat does n't get dirty I have to lean the stroller against a wall when folded . It 's not convenient so we often end up just leaving the stroller in the hall unfolded.CONCLUSIONIf it was n't for the great price and the GT wheels , I would have gone with the Urbo2 which is $ 600 . Thanks Amazon for the low price . I 'm happy with the stroller but I will keep drolling at the urbo2 in navy .	1
We purchased this stroller after seriously considering a number of stroller options , including the Baby Jogger City Mini , Uppa Baby models , and a few others . We ultimately chose this stroller because it was the only one that adjusted low enough for users that are 5 feet tall ( like my partner and I ) . Many of the other strollers we looked at seemed really high and were uncomfortable for us to push . We seriously considered the City Mini , but ultimately went with the Versa because of the larger basket on the bottom . The Versa is heavier than the Mini , but we really wanted that larger basket , and it comes in handy when one of our dogs wants to ride in the bottom and during shopping trips.The seat that the Versa comes with is NOT suitable for newborns . We are using the Britax B-Safe car seat and purchased the adapters that allow the Britax seat to be snapped into the Versa frame . This arrangement has worked really well for us.The Versa folds up very easily and I can fit it ( folded ) in the back of my very small Honda Fit without any issues . The ride is smooth and the stroller is very easy to maneuver . Overall , it has a pretty low profile , which makes it nice for taking out in public .	1
well , i do n't know how good the uppababby vista one is . ( city versa is almost same model as uppababy vista ) i 've been use this stroller for over 3 months . I 'm pretty sure this stroller is as good as the other one . ( i 've looked at the youtube video ) this stroller maneuver so nice and easy even though the roads around my house are n't that great.i can go in and out of the door without help.i have the red one . it looks luxurious way more than it cost . when we 're out in the public , almost all the time , people asks me about the stroller . ( i live in small city , so i only saw graco , chicco , baby trend ) folding is way easier than the handle turning thingy.i had a graco stroller that my friend gave me.that thing was so hard to close and open . finally , i gave up on that stroller cause it would n't turn anymore.Lucky me . i had a great deal with Amazon , too.only down part is ... it 's not compact stroller . if you have a small car , you will have only stroller in the car .	1
We have had the Uppababy Vista for about 4 years and love the fact that you can attach a glider board , rotate the seat and push with ease . Unfortunately it takes up a ton of space and is really awkward and hard to fold . So I went in search of a better option for our second child . I think the Versa has many of the good things of the Vista ( for about $ 400 less ! ) It pushes pretty easily but you can tell a notable difference when the basket is very full . The easy fold is amazing when running errands . While it is pretty heavy folding , its not unbearable . Good quality and amazing value at this sale price . I 've recommended it to a couple friends . It 's a great stroller if you want quality and some good features , but not a luxury stroller price . Do n't hesitate	1
I am a soon-to-be second time mom . When my son was born , we were limited with space and chose a Baby Jogger City Mini , which was perfect at the time because it folded up so easily and fit in a corner inconspicuously . However , I always wanted a full-size stroller with a reversible seat and a bassinet option , so this time around ( now that we 've moved and have more space ) , we started hunting for a full-feature stroller . I will qualify this review with the fact that we were NOT looking for a double stroller because my son barely rides in a stroller anymore , and we were not looking for a light-weight/travel/umbrella stroller . All of the strollers we looked at ranged in the $ 300- $ 900 price range and weighed in at 23-28 lbs.These were the features that were really important to us : reversible seat , easy fold , bassinet option , large easily-accessible basket , suspension and wheels that can handle grass and some smooth trails , well-made seat that can handle a tall child , good canopy coverage , ability to add a glider board.Seat : The seat on the City Versa is made with an attractive , high-quality , durable fabric , which also snaps on and off of the frame easily for cleaning ( I believe it 's machine washable ) . The seat is well-structured , with an adjustable footrest , three recline positions , and a huge canopy with two magnetic-closure windows . The seat is also incredibly easy to reverse and the seat back is 21.5 '' high , which will accommodate tall children . My only minor complaint is that the seat recline mechanism is somewhat `` sticky '' and takes some practice to master , but Baby Jogger 's customer service told me that the mechanism needs some time to `` break in '' and that it should get easier to use over time.Fold : This is what Baby Jogger is truly known for . The fold is FANTASTIC , as it is on all Baby Joggers . You just squeeze a trigger on the back of the seat , fold the seat in half ( facing either direction ! ! ! ) , tug the fold strap and lift up , and `` voila ! '' the stroller is folded and locked ! The only slight drawback is that the stroller does not stand up on its end when it 's folded . However , you can easily stand it on it 's side . The other awesome thing is that Baby Jogger 's glider board also folds up and allows the stroller to fold normally with it attached ! Bassinet : The bassinet is not included , but it 's really nice and clips onto the stroller very easily in either direction . We were able to purchase the bassinet with the stroller ( 2013 models on sale now ) for less than the cost of any other stroller/bassinet combo we looked at.Basket : The basket is HUGE ! It 's also very easy to access , which was really important to me , since I relied on my old Snap N Go 's big basket whenever I went grocery shopping when my son was an infant.Wheels & Suspension : While the wheels that come with the stroller are foam rubber wheels , I know from experience with my old City Mini that they will be fine on cracked sidewalks and moderate grassy surfaces and well-groomed trails . The stroller has a great 4-wheel suspension , and the push on the stroller is incredibly smooth and easy to maneuver . PLUS , Baby Jogger is releasing a `` GT '' forever-air wheel replacement kit this spring/summer for the stroller that will provide even more cushion to the ride ( supposedly the wheel kit will be around $ 50 ) .Glider Board : I 'm going to do a separate review for this , but I 'll just say that the Baby Jogger glider board is a REALLY nice glider board . It is so much more robust than I was expecting , and has a lot of ways to adjust it . Plus , it easily folds up and clips out of the way , while still allowing the stroller to fold normally . It 's a little awkward to fit my tall son on it when the seat is facing forwards , but it works , and everything works perfectly when the seat is facing backwards.For sake of comparison , I also thoroughly tested out all of the following competing models in person : Britax B-Ready , UppaBaby Vista , Mountain Buggy Cosmopolitan , Phil & Ted 's Promenade , UppaBaby Cruz , and the Bugaboo Chameleon . For the price point , there was simply no comparison - the Baby Jogger City Versa won hands-down for features and price . These were the drawbacks to the other models that I came across compared to the Baby Jogger City Versa : Britax B-Ready : Simply too big and bulky - it was hard to get this stroller through the aisles at the baby store , let alone aisles in stores that are not made to be stroller-friendly . This would 've been a big contender if we had wanted a double stroller , though.UppaBaby Vista : The fold was difficult ( and only works with the seat facing forward ) , it was just as wide as the B-Ready , and it 's expensive . Yes , it comes with a lot of extras , including the bassinet , but I 'd rather have the ability to opt out of the extras and buy them a la carte , rather than pay for all of it upfront . While the Vista also offers a huge basket , it has a big bar running right through the middle of it.Mountain Buggy Cosmopolitan : I REALLY wanted to love this stroller , but the handle bar was non-adjustable and too short for my tall husband , and the seat was WAY too short for our tall family ( 17 '' compared to 21.5 '' on the City Versa ) . I also did n't like the fabric in the seat , and I was worried about the long-term durability of this stroller - the floor model was very loose and wobbly and seemed like it had n't held up well.Phil & Ted 's Promenade : This stroller just was n't practical as a single-child stroller . It was REALLY long , difficult to maneuver , and felt awkward as a single.UppaBaby Cruz : This stroller is not nearly as high-quality as the Baby Jogger City Versa or it 's own sister , the UppaBaby Vista . The frame feels flimsy and the wheels would not handle grass or trails well at all . This stroller really competes with the Bugaboo Bee , not with the other strollers on this list.Bugaboo Chameleon : First off , it 's just way too expensive . Bugaboo needs to lower it 's prices because there are plenty of other strollers offering the same features for a lot less these days . The frame feels wobbly and flimsy , and the seat has to be removed before you can fold it.All that being said , we are extremely happy with our decision , and I 'm glad I put in the effort to thoroughly research my options . I still have yet to find a truly `` perfect '' stroller , but the Baby Jogger City Versa is very close ! The only minor complaints I have are truly minor and do n't outweigh the negatives I found in every other stroller . I 'm not surprised I ended up with yet another Baby Jogger stroller ( this is my third ! ) ; I also own a 2010 City Mini and a 2011 Summit XC jogger , both of which have been excellent and have held up wonderfully . They make great , high-quality products , and their customer service is absolutely top-notch !	1
These are just as awful as the bottles they go with . I ca n't count the number which have cracked , split , or yellowed to the point of uselessness in just a couple of months .	-1
My baby was not fond of these bottles and would end up refusing to continue eating . Also they quickly became very cloudy looking just after a few washes , and they were washed as directed ! Ended up switching to Dr Browns , which we love ! Wish we would have had them from the start .	-1
I really wanted to love this bottle . I like the feel of it in my hand and I like that you do n't have to shake the formula to get it to mix . But - and this is a huge one - it broke after less than a week 's worth of use . My husband struggled to close the cap and when he passed it to me , there it went . I like the bottle so much that I went on a scavenger hunt for another but could n't find one . I took that as a sign .	-1
I received this bottle from Similac with their sample cans of baby formula when I was expecting . After baby was born , we tried to use it . First of all , it 's hard to close the bottle and match blue marks - they never exactly on the middle . It 's leaks every other time . This little part for better formula mixture is a joke - does n't do anything ( we had to suppliment our baby with formula ) , and we did n't notice any difference between this and othe bottles.The bottom line , I do not recomment buing this bottle .	-1
I really liked this bottle at first , but after a few runs through the dishwasher and the sterilizing bag some serious problems have emerged . I think the low-quality materials warped a bit in the heat , because the parts have become very leaky . The fact that assembling the bottle requires pulling the nipple into the bottle rim *just* right does n't help with that , especially considering the fact that it sometimes takes a few tries.Pros : - the formula wand is a unique feature , though I do n't know how much it really helps- formula storage caps availableCons : - the large , clunky , oddly-shaped parts are a bit more of a hassle than the more straight-forward Avent brand.-leaky- poor quality plastic that warps easily ( I once accidently sterilized one in a bag with no water and it completely melted and smoldered . No other brand I 've used was harmed after making that mistake with them ) .-Ounce markings that twist diagonally around the bottle make measuring needlessly difficult- nipple sits atop a flat surface rather than a rounded dome like other bottles . Rounded shapes simulate how the baby latches on to a breast , so the bottle may be difficult for a breastfed baby to use-larger than other bottles so it 's harder to bring as many in a diaper bag	-1
I use Similac , so I was excited to see the bottle they are introducing to the market . I 'm a fan of wide nipples and the mixer seemed clever in theory . This bottle was a bit of a fail . The parts are complicated and just too much to deal with . I did n't quite get the little mixer inside -- it honestly did n't work and I had to shake the bottle up like any other ( so it just seemed to me like another part to wash ) . Further , though this does have a wide nipple and therefore seemed to be friendly to babies that also nurse ( to reduce nipple confusion ) , it just was n't a normal shape . The Phillips Avent Natural was a much better choice for this wide `` style '' bottle . This bottle just did n't work for us .	-1
These bottles are terrible . Many reviewers complained of leaking and then said if u use the bottle as directed , notch up , it would n't leak . I still had a problem , when bottle used exactly as directed , with leaking . The nipple is flimsy , which causes the leaking issue because it does not keep good contact with the screw lid that attaches it to the bottle . It also collapses in when my baby is drinking , both with self feeding and assisted feeds and I have to stop and pull it back out before she can continue . Definitely not my favorite bottle . My baby and I prefer the cheap gumdrop bottles to these . Gumdrop has basic parts and perfect size for little hands and they are inexpensive . These bottles are too big around .	-1
My daughter 's friend ( two years old ) dropped this bottle and it broke . I had liked the bottle ; it did seem to do ok but no more than others we had . We bought the two pack after receiving a $ 3 off coupon . I 'm not buying any more . If you ca n't drop the bottle less than 6 inches off the ground without it breaking , it 's not worth it .	-1
Babies have different tastes so when my sister returned to work ( and post grad school ) we had quite a few brands to choose from and we bought a few.This bottle was one of them . We loved that there was a formula mixer included . I 've not seen that feature in a while . That was the end of the pros with this bottle.When it 's shaken the formula leaks into the bottle cap and after a while it leaks out of the bottle 's cap and it got all over my hands and I 'd only made a 2 oz bottle to test it out . Not good . We are always on the go so the bottles we use have to work well when we 're out . A bottle that leaks this bad is n't going to make it into the diaper bag . Also the cap comes off way too easy.I would 've liked to try the formula cap but can not find them anywhere but the internet and I 'm not willing to pay shipping just to try it perhaps that cap will not leak.I do like playtex 's drop ins bottle as the cap does n't leak .	-1
My baby could n't get anything out of the bottle when suckling . The construction is very poor with all the different parts not locking together very well . You can not use the bottle without the stirring attachment which is easy to lose . The air vent hole did not appear to work , although hard to tell when baby can not get any milk out of the top . It is also a bit wide for babies who are trying to learn to hold the bottle themselves . Poor product I would not buy .	-1
The price on these were quite reasonable , so I figured I would give them a try . The first month or so that we used these bottles they worked great - so we ordered a ton of them . Shortly after we started to have a terrible time with them leaking , despite the & # 34 ; SmartClose & # 34 ; feature . They would leak in between the nipple and the nipple ring . After we stopped using them I noticed that my infant 's gas dramatically decreased after we stopped using these . We never used the & # 34 ; EasyMix & # 34 ; mixing paddles , either , since they were just more parts to clean.We ended up switching back to the Playtex Ventaire bottles from our first child and could n't be happier .	-1
This simply smart design was n't that simple or smart . I still had to shake the bottle to death to get the formula to mix and then there you go with all the air bubbles causing gas . I also felt the shape was not ergonomically well made , it is quite bulky . The cap was easy to line up but overall not worth it .	-1
I initially liked the feel of the bottle and the ease of flow through the nipple-much better flow than others I have reviewed thus far . I appreciated being able to `` see '' it closed by lining up the blue arrows on the bottle with the opening on the plastic ring . I get a little impatient since it is harder for me to open when I 'm busy and used to opening bottles up with one hand under my arm . When performing a similar task , I had to pass this bottle off to my older daughter to open.However , the nipple is another matter-you can easily grab it , pulling the whole thing out ! This bottle is designed with a `` U '' shaped indentation at the base of the nipple where it pokes out over the ring . This space yields a frustratingly LEAKY BOTTLE , aside from the fact that the WHOLE NIPPLE can be easily removed from the top.Also , the mixing paddle ( attached to an inner ring within the bottle ) did n't work well for us ... Powder remnants plastered against the inside bottom ... Thankfully , it 's removable , but we still ca n't get past the rest.Unfortunately , I can not recommend .	-1
I decided to try several different types of bottles for our newborn to see what worked best for her . I found this bottle to be full of bells and whistles that did n't seem to do much when compared to other bottles on the market . The stirrer seemed pretty useless , it helped , but you still have to shake the bottle to mix the formula . I could n't seem to line up the triangles that were supposed to indicate that the top was on correctly . The bottle also leaked significantly .	-1
My daughter prefers the Evenflo Airvent bottles/nipples and I thought this looked similar and would be a good time to switch since we 're now using formula . The bottles are supposed to be made specifically to help mix formula/water better-it has a little spatula shaped rubber thing that sits down in the bottle to help mix it , but it does n't really work and just adds another thing to clean ! The nipple is too big and my daughter does n't like it at all . The bottle itself is too wide and my 10 month old has a hard time holding it herself . Overall , I would n't bother with these-similac makes great formula , but should stick to that b/c these bottles are not good at all ! UPDATE : I dropped this bottle ( on our wood floor ) while it was full of milk and the bottom completely cracked and broke off . So it 's not durable AT ALL either !	-1
I ca n't find anything good to say about this bottle . I thought it had to be a joke . The bottles leak with a steady flow/drip ... it is not subtle in any way , it simply pours right out when the bottle is sealed ( I tried everything I could think of to reconfigure , even read the directions ) . Of every bottle I have tried ( and with my last baby I had to try many brands because she did n't want to drink from a bottle ) , this one leaks the worst . I was almost embarrassed for Similac ... being a formula & # 34 ; pro & # 34 ; you 'd think they 'd have produced something better . This bottle is completely NOT even functional .	-1
The bottle itself seems well made , and the in-bottle mixer keeps the clumps from staying together , but my daughter did n't latch on to the nipple . She did not like the bottle at all , and , while it may have been just her , it was a shame seeing the order for this bottle go to waste.So far we 've been using the Medela and Playtex bottles , which work fine .	-1
I do n't care for the mixer at all . I do n't think it does a through job of mixing the formula and I end up having to shake it up regardless . I prefer the Avent bottles and I 'm not a huge fan of those either . It 's a nice spare bottle to have just in case but not the go to every time bottle .	-1
I hate this bottle . I purchased this bottle at it 's slightly expensive price at Wal mart . Basically , this bottle sucks . it has this overly complex top to it that leaks . I have spent way too much of my time trying to screw this capon ... distracting me from my crying baby . I hate hate hate this bottle . leaks leaks leaks ! DO NOT BUY !	-1
My daughter is getting her molars now on top and bottom and they are really hurting her . Teethers really helped when she getting her front and middle teeth so I went on a quest to find teethers for her back teeth . So far there are not many to choose from . I found these and unfortunately these cause her to gag very badly . She hates it now and is afraid of it .	-1
I wish I could give this zero stars . I purchased this at the local Walmart . I gave it to my five month old to chew on . It 's not his favorite teether , but he uses it from time to time . I guess he got it far enough back that it lodged in his throat and induced gagging and choking . I immediately pulled it out , but he already started vomiting and this started gagging and choking on his own vomitus . The whole ordeal of trying to stabilize him lasted 10 minutes . He turned red at one point and could not breath . We called EMS and thankfully , he was better by the time they got here . It 's supposed to help the back teeth , but it goes far enough back that it can induce gagging and vomiting . It is a choking hazard ! I 've emailed the company and have called and I am waiting for a call back . This product is not safe for babies and I do not recommend it .	-1
I wound up returning this item to Amazon . It 's the only thing in my many years of frequent Amazon purchases that I 've returned . The bib I received was dirty - black stuff all along one edge . At first I thought perhaps it was from shipping somehow and figured I would just wash it - no big deal . When I went to remove the bib from the cardboard it was on , I noticed spots in the plastic that had a sticky , slimy feel to it like plastic sometimes gets when it goes bad . I filed for a return and got my money back without any issues . ( Which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to 1 ) .	-1
Did n't work as I expected . It it similar to the Moby wrap ( in style ) but only half as wide . I used it twice . The material is also like old gym uniform , that shiny stuff .	-1
I had high hopes for this but it 's very narrow and cheap feeling . The passes do n't stay spread under my baby 's bottom so after a few minutes he 's no longer in a seated squat position but in a crotch dangler position . When the tails are tied at the waist it digs into me because the fabric is so thin . It does n't feel like it has any stretch to me at all and was very diggy.Great idea but did n't work so well for us in practice .	-1
I am sure many people may like this item but I did n't like it . I did n't feel secure with my baby in it and it was a pain to put together . I did n't give it much time or effort though so it may work for some . I prefer a front baby carrier instead .	-1
Okay , here 's the scoop.I 've got 3 kids ( under 3 ... all diff ages 34 months , 15 months , 4 weeks ) . I bought this because we live in SoCal and like to be outside in the summer . The Moby is pretty warm , so I thought this would do the trick while we are in the pool and/or on vacation and/or out doors . Now , this is ALL based on an infant ... .maybe an older baby will work better ? Pros : Lightweight , good breathing material , wraps like the Moby.Cons : Stretches quick and baby slides around , Fusia is HIDEOUS ( do n't buy the pink ) , does n't get as tight as the Moby , so it feels unsafe .	-1
We have a Moby wrap which I absolutely love , so , for comparison : The Moby is extremely soft cotton . Like having a thick t-shirt on . The downside is that it is a LOT of cotton , so it 's heavy & hot . However , both baby & mom are comfy overall . This one , in comparison , is more of a net material ( maybe nylon ? ) It 's NOT stretchy at all , and itchy/rough . My baby hates it touching his skin , and I 'm not a big fan of it touching mine either . Because it 's not stretchy & soft , it digs in everywhere it crosses the body , and stays extremely tight . This kind of defeats the reason I got it instead of a standard baby carrier ( I hate them digging into my shoulders ) . So , for comfort , I 'd give it a low 1 on a score of 1-5 . I WILL give it this : it 's very lightweight , and breathable because it 's mesh , so in that regard , it gets maybe a 3 for that.I would n't buy this again . I used it once , and it was not a fun experience . I 'll suck it up & deal with the heavy hot Moby any day to keep my son and I in comfort .	-1
Though it arrived quickly and in plastic , the top compartment of this cooler is dirty . We think it has been used . I 'm very disappointed since it 's supposed to be brand new . it would be a good product if not used looking.it 's also larger than I thought it would be , but that would be ok ( again if it was new looking ! ) REVISION- I have been using this for a month to tote bottles to and from daycare . It 's been used a max of 20 min a day . I just noticed the lining is ripped at the seam in the bottom compartment . This has not been heavy use and should not have already ripped . I had it monogrammed to the top of the top compartment ( NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE RIP ) , so I can not send it back . But this was definitely a rip off as it 's pretty much useless after one month . There 's not even a way to contact the seller directly !	-1
Those tubes are made with both ends being a wide end like the one that fits in the pump . The original Medela ones have one wide end , and one slim end to fit in the shield . Because of this the tube comes off of the breastshield all the time while pumping . Not a good buy .	-1
We bought this seat 2 years ago as a second seat for my husbands car a 2004 Honda civic . She was 1 and still needed to be RF . I couldnt get this seat installed in the back on the honda with a correct fit for anything ! I returned it . Fast forward 2 years . Now she is 3 so we tried again since I knew I could get it properly installed FF . We have had it 2 months and she has ridden in it about 3 times . The little piece of metal that holds the harness strap is loose and wiggles all over . It seems it is missing a screw . I dont know if that would affect the safety since you can still tighten the straps , but I 've had it with this seat . This is probably an isolated incident , but I just like a better quality seat . Of course this seat is safe and meets federal standards , but it doesnt go above the minimum . We returned it and spend $ 100 more on a graco nautilus . It installed perfect and there are no cheap parts wiggling around loose . Also , I love amazon and buy A LOT from them , but this seat is 40 bucks at walmart .	-1
My mom got this car seat for her car so that I would n't have to deal with dragging mine through the airport with a one year old while traveling by myself . It took me 45 minutes to install it rear facing and it was never secure . I tried everything . I read the instructions over and over , yet it would move a significant amount side to side . I even had two airport workers help amd they couldnt get it to stop moving around . The fabric is cheap and seems uncomfortable . The straps are a huge pain to adjust and there is nothing to protect their little legs from being pinched when you are buckling them in . I never felt like my daughter was safe in this seat . I felt sick when we drove anywhere and avoided going to many places because I cringed at the thought of putting my daughter in this thing . Next time I will just drag a car seat , stroller , Boba baby carrier , 3 bags , and a diaper bag through the airport to avoid using this piece of crap . Please just spend a little more and get a better seat , a few dollars saved is not worth the peace of mind you will lose using this flimsy seat .	-1
The pen did n't work ( completely dried out ) when it arrived and one pot fell off the counter onto the kitchen floor and the lid snapped in two , made from very cheap materials .	-1
These containers have the WORST dry erase system possible . I was able to use that the first time , and then the band either rubbed off or the marker would n't erase so that I could update the contents and date . I tried to contact the company directly and they did n't even bother to reply , so clearly they are not interested in having customers that are happy or will recommend their product . Honestly , save your money . I ended up just buying some jarred organic food , using it periodically and then reused the glass jars with much greater success .	-1
The zipper separates after use . So far I 've been able to put to back together when I unzip and re-zip . Hopefully it continues to hold up .	-1
This was so bad , the zipper is really bad . It has a velcro ( the scratchy side ) on one side that seems useless . I have other pacifier pouches that are immensely better .	-1
This product was not at all what it represented it to be . It is cheap and flimsy and not worth the money . I ended up not using it and donating it to goodwill . The fabric is cheap , the zipper did not work well , and the inside is not waterproof ( therefore you can not wipe it out ) . I also bought the matching g wipe holder and it was similarly disappointing and also donated .	-1
I would n't bother purchasing this unless you feel very strongly about having a child tray ... It sits very far away from the child - as in , it 's awkward for even my 2.5 y/o to reach it ( perhaps made more apparent because the seats in the B-Agile do n't sit completely upright ? ) . Also , the cup holder is small ... None of her cups seem to fit in there at all ( I imagine some must , but none of our Gerber , Nuk , Munchkin cups do ) . We never even bothered opening the second one we purchased since we were pretty underwhelmed by the first ... If our 2.5 y/o struggles to use it , then no way her younger sister will find it at all useful .	-1
I had to purchase two of them . They are overpriced in my opinion . They are also so small . When I took it out of the box , I started to laugh . It looked like it belonged to a toy stroller . The cup holder seemed to be a normal size however the snack part of the tray is a joke .	-1
I 'm mystified by this product and all the positive reviews for it . Its just a canopy , your stroller already has a canopy . I bought this expecting that it would somehow cover more of the stroller than the normal canopy on my Britax but it is nothing other than what comes for free with the stroller itself.I 'm disappointed and also disappointed that the seller ( baby haven ) is insisting that I should pay to return it . This is not up to Amazon standards or my usual experience with Amazon sellers .	-1
This shade is big and floppy . No support at all ! Such a waste of money . Does n't stay on and honestly a trash bag would have worked better than this shade at blocking the sun ! Do n't waste your money .	-1
I bought this for the shade factor since I live in South Florida and its sunny nearly every day ! Well , the first day we used this the sun penetrated right through to my little one 's face.. I am 100 % disappointed ! Maybe I received a defective one ? But mine does not work as a sunshade , it does however work as a rain guard , so its 50 % worth having . I should not have discarded the packaging because I would of returned this ! Save your packaging if u get a defective one ! So , now I just use a big umbrella when I take my little one for walks to block out the sun . Good Luck	-1
Only works with umbrella strollers that already have a shade ! Please take note . This was not mentioned in the description .	-1
My husband and I both tried to use this shade and it just constantly blew back on windy days thereby defeating the purpose . It is not 'firm ' enough to withstand even a breeze really . We tried attaching it every which way to keep it stable and we just could n't get it to work well . Not to mention , our son really likes to look around and it blocks his view a lot . I 'm still looking for a good solution to the sun issue !	-1
My walls are very slightly textured . Visually , the walls are smooth and flat , but by touch , there is a faint texture . Other wall decals adhere to the walls very well without problems peeling or falling off . However , THESE DO NOT . The stickers are cute and look nice on the wall . But , there 's no point if they do n't actually remain on the wall . The stickers were constantly peeling and literally falling off . They were in my trashcan after a week . Such a disappointment .	-1
I ordered this product with confidence given the number of 4 and 5 star reviews.I found the product was not easily repositionable as it peeled the paint from my walls.In addition , the diagram on the package was not very helpful in determining where all the tree pieces belong . I ended up making my own design which came out okay in the end.I am giving it only 1 star because I know I will have to repaint the room now .	-1
Well , I had high hopes for this . The idea behind it is great , but it just did n't work for our son . It 's lovely and quite modern looking , but did not provide enough motion to really be able to soothe baby.Fastest setting is not fast at all .	-1
I bought this for my first baby . I was so excited to put him in it . As soon as we got home from the hospital it was the first thing I did and he HATED it . I tried every few days , all different settings , and we got the same screaming response . It just does n't move fast enough ... .at all . Even the fastest setting is SO slow . I do n't see how it soothes any baby.So we put it away and got it back out once we had our second baby ( only 12 months later ) . I thought for sure my more easy going baby would love it since everyone else seemed to rave about it , but nope , we had the same response . He hated it , too . It just simply did n't move fast enough . Not to mention the fabric is so stiff and not the least bit comforting . We put a fleece blanket in it to try to make it more appealing and it did nothing . Not to mention the mobile is completely useless . It does n't even move.We ended up getting a traditional cradle swing and both kids loved it SO much more .	-1
The design of these bottles is so flawed . My baby has no problems latching on to the breast or other bottles , but this one just does n't work . The milk comes out the corners of her mouth and just gets spilled everywhere . Her bib is soaked every time . What a waste of breastmilk . In addition , the awkward shape of the bottle means that too much milk gets stuck in the ridges inside the bottle , never getting to the baby . I got this bottle as a sample - good thing I did n't spend any money on it !	-1
Despite the smart design of these bottles ( nipple is sized and shaped similar to a breast , bottle is comfortable to hold , bottle is compatible with pumps ) , I would not purchase . Invariably , there is a fast leak at the lids and a frustrating mess . They are worthless for feeding and storage .	-1
Horrible bottle do n't just buy for how good it looks my baby hated it she hated the nipple with a passion	-1
These are suppose to create less gas in a baby , but my little girl just does n't like them . The nipple is a new structure and she finds it hard to eat out of . I 'm not sure if it is the size or the shape , but we could only try it once before she refused to go near them . I would n't buy these .	-1
this 4oz should be slow nipple because it for newborn ! ! ! but the nipple is way too fast . my son almost choke using this !	-1
I was so anxious to buy these because I wanted high quality bottles for my baby . However , after using it a couple of times I saw that most of what my baby was drinking was leaking out and for the life of me I could n't figure it out . The cap was on fine , the nipple fit also but the milk managed to leak somehow .	-1
I bought these bottles because I wanted to help my 3 mo daughter 's latch during breastfeeding . We were using the standard narrow nipple when bottle feeding her , and it affected her latch . To fix it , we wanted to try a more naturally shaped nipple and decided to try Avent 's new range due to its glowing reviews.On the first couple of times of using this bottle , so much milk leaked on my daughter that her bib was thoroughly soaked ! I do n't know how much she actually managed to take in since most of it ended on her clothes.I thought maybe she just needed practice to readjust herself to the new shape so I tried giving her the bottle a few times more . However , she seemed more frustrated each time . I got upset at the amount of leaked milk wasted too and needless to say , I do n't think we 'll be trying to use these bottles anymore.By the way , I used the slow flow nipples readily attached to the bottles when I received them.In short , I had high hopes for these , but now I 'm totally disappointed.Can I get my money back please ?	-1
These bottles get 2 stars from me for being decent quality - no leaking or other issues , volume markings are clear on the outside . Unfortunately , they were not at all natural in my ( primarily breastfed ) baby 's mouth and did not work for us . Just because it looks like a breast by eye does n't mean it will work for every breastfed baby . Make sure to check that your baby 's latch on the bottle nipple looks just like it does/should on the breast . For my 6 week old daughter , her latch on the avent natural nipples caused her lips to curl completely in/under instead of flanging out . The transition from tip to base is just too abrupt , it 's too sharp of an angle . Worst of all , she frequently choked while drinking from these , which was rather scary . I assume , based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews , that these must work for many babies . Just do n't make the mistake of assuming they will work best for every baby ; try multiple bottle nipples until you find the right one for your baby . For us , it was the Lansinoh mOmma bottles .	-1
Returned these as soon as they arrived . Too heavy and not ergonomic . Makes it hard for mommy/daddy and especially tiny baby hands . My baby has been holding her own bottle since 4 months old .	-1
The glass bottles are nice but the whole bottle is useless all thanks to the new nipples . Our baby had a very tough time maintaining a good seal around the nipple and as a result milk would spill all around his neck . We initially thought it was the flow rate on the nipple but after trying different Avent nipples ( that have slower flow rates ) and getting the same messy results we decided to return the entire bottle set and get the Dr. Brown 's glass bottle set instead .	-1
I had 3 bottles and 2 broke in the dishwater , more precisely , they lost pieces of glass on the rim . Totally unsafe . The last bottle I sterilized by boiling in a pot . It did n't break , but it lost the paint marking the ounces , so it 's useless now . They only reason I gave the bottle 2 stars is because I liked the nipple ( and so did my little one ) , the shape , and the fact that it is borosilicate glass ( so no worries about toxic chemicals from plastic ) . Although I have second doubts about the borosilicate reason ... if it was really borosilicate it should n't have broken in the dishwasher , top rack .	-1
Theses bottles leaked pretty bad . So badly that I sent them back . I read great reviews and the bottles were heavy and the tops leaked .	-1
First , you can only use Philips Avent bottles with this product . Most parents probably have a mix of bottles of various brands . The inability to mix and match with this sterilizer is its first flaw.Second , if you are using the larger ( 9 oz . ) bottles , then you can only fit a few bottles into this sterilizer at a time . It fits more 4 oz . bottles of course , but we only used 4 oz . bottles for the first month or so before our newborn 's appetite required switching to larger bottles.Third and most importantly , you have to be very precise with the amount of water that you add to this sterilizer . Too much or too little will make it malfunction , and there is no easy way to tell how much water to add without measuring with an actual measuring cup . You ca n't just eyeball it or guess . Even a little too much or too little water is enough to screw it up.I have found that it is a lot easier to just use my dishwasher 's top rack to sterilize my baby 's bottles . With this microwave steam sterilizer , you still have to clean your bottles first . So , you 're cleaning them and then sterilizing them , whereas your dishwasher will clean them and sterilize them AT THE SAME TIME .	-1
If you buy the Medela Quick Steam bags this really is n't needed - everything can go in the steam bag , dishwasher , or be washed by hand . It 's bulky and we literally have n't used it once .	-1
Was not a fan of this sterilizer at all . As a matter of fact , we used it one time ... to sterilize our bottles immediately after purchasing them . It probably would 've been easier to throw them into a pot of boiling water and time it , to be perfectly honest .	-1
Returned bc I thought this was for easy bottle cleaning but the directions tell you to wash bottles thoroughly before steaming w this item thus what 's the point ? I guess if you 're OCD and want them extra sterile you would like this . ? ? ? Double the trouble and not worth the time .	-1
I 'm sure this sterilizer works much better when using only Avent 's bottles . However , try using anything else and it comes up far short . Bottles do n't stay upright at all which is perhaps my biggest complaint . We ended up donating this sterilizer only after a couple of uses and bought instead the Playtex SmartSteam 3-in-1 Microwave Baby Bottle Sterilizer which is 1000x times better and is much more universal than the Avent Sterilizer .	-1
WAY too thin to be useful . These were see through , shrunk in the wash and do n't absorb anything . My intention was to use them for burp cloths , not a chance .	-1
I bought these to use as burp cloths . But the material is too thin . I do n't think it would work as a burp cloth or for anything else . I think it is too expensive for the quality of the product . I think the cloth will not stand after a few washings .	-1
These make AWFUL diapers . They are too thin and hold nothing whatsoever . Maybe layered with other diapers they would be okay , but they are not soft and I would n't want these against my baby 's sensitive skin . They are n't bad as burp cloths but they still do n't work as good as flannel ones . If washed correctly , they are good for cleaning and do n't leave lint behind .	-1
I had previously purchased another pack of cloth diapers/burp cloths that were unavailable . ( They were listed as 5-ply . ) I ordered these thinking they would be somewhat comparable , but they were literally see-through ! They went back immediately . What a waste !	-1
Super thin ! I returned immediately knowing they could n't be absorbent at all . I wanted them for burp cloths and found them to be not soft at all . I want something much more comfortable against his skin .	-1
After the first washing , these get very thin . Might as well use cheesecloth instead . They also feel very rough so I do n't like wiping my baby 's face with them .	-1
We 've got a number of prefold cloth diapers that we 've used as burp cloths and general wipe up - they 're way better than real burp cloths , and more absorbent . Picked up a pack of these Gerber brand tonight at Babies R Us - and they 'll be going right back soon . They 're horrible - thin as gauze , non absorbent , just terrible.Were I using these as diapers , I 'd be deathly afraid my child would leak everywhere . They ca n't hold anything , since they barely exist ! Ugh .	-1
I bought these to try as burp cloths with my son who has reflux . He tends to spit 40-50 times a day and it 's handfuls at a time so something very absorbent is important . I have to use at least 2 or 3 of these during feeding , and another 2 for in between feedings as they just do n't hold the liquid and they seemed to shrink an awful lot during washing . I was hopeful these would be a little better but they definitely are not for a baby with a spitting/vomiting issue . They are n't soft either ( scratchier to skin than clothing ) , I thought they would soften up a bit more after repeated washings but they have not .	-1
I meant to purchase the & # 34 ; gauze & # 34 ; style which are thicker and more absorbent than the & # 34 ; birdseye & # 34 ; style . These are also smaller , so I would definitely recommend getting the gauze . We use those all the time as burp cloths for our baby with reflux !	-1
These are not what I expected . I thought they would be like the thick , old-school cloth diapers . These are like rags that you wash your car with . They are rough and they get super wrinkly .	-1
These are very thin and was not what I expected while I was using them for burp cloths . I would have returned these if I did not already wash all of them before baby was born .	-1
BOUGHT AS PART OF GIFT , WASHED AND THEY LOOK & FEEL HORRIBLE ! ! WASTE OF MONEY ! ! SO SAD I ORDERED THESE ! !	-1
The older version of these are great . We have half a dozen that we use for burp cloths and other messes . They 're great for everything except actual diapering . So , when our daughter came along , it was only natural to add some more of these to the registry . The new ones are nothing like the old ones . They are made of flimsy , gauzy material that is actually transparent in the right light . They absorb nothing and tear at the slightest tug . I would rate these as slightly better than paper towels . We 've already gotten rid of them .	-1
We used Gerber cloth diapers with our first child in 2010 , and loved them as burp clothes and clean up rags . We just ordered more for our second child and received a package of cloth so thin that you can literally see through it . This is the same package as before , but not at all the same product , and it is not thick enough to absorb anything , so pretty useless . I will be returning these and looking for thicker cloth `` diapers '' that can absorb nursery messes .	-1
These were overpriced for the quantity and quality . They were my first buy of cloth diapers and was purchasing to make burp cloths . They work for what I am using them for but will never purchase these ones again .	-1
I used these as burp cloths for my last child three years ago and they out-performed every other `` burp cloth '' I tried . She was a total puker so we needed something very absorbent . Just ordered more for my next baby and they ARE NOT THE SAME - much thinner and not nearly as soft . Very disappointing given the cost .	-1
Like other posts- I use these to decorate and give as baby gifts . I thought I would save a few bucks and go with the 5-ply ... thinking what 's the difference between 5 and 6 ply anyway ? ( I usually buy the premium 6-ply Gerber but they were $ 4 more on amazon ) . I should have bought up- these are so flimsy they are see through on the side panels . I wo n't be able to give them away as gifts with this low quality.Take my advice- pay the extra for the 6-ply or purchase the babies r us brand . They are nice and thick as well .	-1
These make AWFUL diapers . They are too thin and hold nothing whatsoever . Maybe layered with other diapers they would be okay , but they are not soft and I would n't want these against my baby 's sensitive skin . I tried layering them inside some flannel prefolds for gDiapers ( the flannel facing baby 's bottom ) and they worked okay , but bamboo inserts worked infinitely better ! In a pinch they will do , but they just are n't much of an option for a heavy wetter . They are n't bad as burp cloths but they still do n't work as good as flannel ones . If washed correctly , they are good for cleaning and do n't leave lint behind .	-1
these were super thin . I use them for burp cloths and I was disappointed at how thin they were even though they were 3 ply . I will continue to get the baby r us brand as they are much thicker .	-1
Very disappointed ! ! ! We love these types of cloth diapers to use as a burp clothes but this is way too thin ! It feels like their 3 ply has been getting thinner and thinner every year . I have bought the same ones 4 years ago and they were very thick and sturdy but this seems like they took a 3 layers of medical gauge and sewed it together . When you wash and dry them in the drier , the drier vent is filled with cotton fuss that comes out of these diapers . It 's so thin that one table spoon full of water ( spit up ) will wet the half of the diaper . I got 3 packs of these thinking it was thick but now I have 30 of these thin diapers so I am thinking of sewing 3 of them together to make it little bit thicker .	-1
These are great as burp cloths but do not use these as diapers ! The `` absorbent '' batting in the middle is no comparison to real cotton prefolds , like those from green mountain diapers . Your baby will soak right through these Gerber `` diapers '' and you will probably not want to cloth diaper anymore . Regal prefolds are pretty inexpensive also , so if you want to try cloth diapering , do your research ! Try green mountain diapers or diaper rite .	-1
There is an awful smell - so bad that after 3 washings and one run through the dishwasher - it still smells . Not as strong as it did pulling it out of the plastic , but once I had it around my neck I could n't help keep wondering what that terrible smell could be and then I realized it was the necklace . The necklace is really pretty IMO and it does pull your hair - it will pull it out - so be careful . My daughter does like it - but I ca n't get past the smell and wonder what kind of toxic odor she is going to smell like from having that in her mouth .	-1
This monitor made a low clicking noise about every 20 seconds when we had it in use even at the lowest volume setting . Without any baby noise or background noise the sound lights were flickering constantly . I could n't keep the monitor on because it was misleading that something was going on in the baby 's room when in fact it was perfectly quiet . We tried switching locations and directions of the camera and the monitor and nothing helped . I could n't find any way to adjust the sound sensitivity . The video quality was good but the otherwise we were very disappointed in this model .	-1
I bought these for my boys to use until they were potty trained since the size states 15 to 30 plus pounds . After using these for a few months , they have shrunk from 18 inches long to 13 inches long and are too short to use on my 6 month old babies who weigh 17 lbs . They are only in the 50th percentile so they are not large babies either . Extremely dissapointed since I love how trim these diapers are and had very high hopes . Will be calling Amazon to return product if possible but will not be ordering another size .	-1
I have done a thorough internet search and can not find out where these diapers were manufactured . I see no backup for GOTS or organic certification . They smell of some chemical coming out of the package . I was excited to use these but I 'm not going to even prep these . They are going back .	-1
First of all , I 'm not sure why the product description says , & # 34 ; large ; & # 34 ; it is very misleading . When the mirror arrived , I was rather disappointed in the size . It is quite small ; the mirror itself is 5 & # 34 ; x 4 & # 34 ; . The frame is 12 & # 34 ; x 7 & # 34 ; ... if that is considered large ! ? ! Secondly , the melodies and sounds are not soothing ; they are upbeat and entertaining . I do n't mind the music , but it definately wo n't send baby off to dreamland , especially if he bumps it with a hand or foot while asleep . Baby goes in the crib to sleep , not play . Yes , the music can be turned off on the back of the mirror , but my 8 month old is able to turn it back on ! Lastly , the mirror does easily attatch to crib ; however , it is secured only on top , so baby can lift and bang mirror ... during all hours of the night ! There needs to be a bottom strap as well , so the mirror ca n't be lifted up ; it would also keep baby from being able to touch the power switch . As far as quality , the mirror is well constructed ; unfortunately , it just is n't practical .	-1
I could n't use this and had to return it due to the fact that the straps are n't adjustable . The part of my crib that it wraps around to attach is thicker and because of this the straps do n't even come close to closing . Not all cribs are the same so having straps that are n't able to be adjusted is bad design .	-1
I 've carried all of my babies in wraps over the last 7 years , so have tried just about every one on the market , and I had looked forward to getting this one , as I 'd heard that it was just so great . However , I 'm not impressed at all . The edges do n't fit snugly at all , no matter how tightly I wrap it . It does n't adjust easily once it 's wrapped , so unless you & # 34 ; get it right & # 34 ; the first time , as far as tightness , you have to take it off and wrap it tighter . The fabric is WAY longer and wider than most wraps , and is really just too big . It 's enough to have to wrap the standard length wraps , but to have one even longer and even wider than the standard size , means it 's that much more a hassle to wrap properly . I had to double it over , so it would n't be so wide , but then it was too hot to wear . I am not impressed for the price that they charge . I used to make and sell wraps myself , and had negative experiences with this company as I competed with them in the UK . Once I started selling a high volume of my wraps ( which were essentially the same thing , only corrected the issues that Moby has with theirs ) , they started sending me emails , basically bullying me , trying to make me stop selling mine because I was becoming competition for them and they did n't like it , since I was selling my wraps at half the price they were charging ... So between the company itself , and the unimpressiveness of the wrap , I 'd recommend going with a different brand . The Ultimate Baby Wrap is excellent , and so is the Sleepy Wrap . Any that are around 15 feet in length , made with 95 % cotton , 5 % lycra are perfect . I prefer 100 % cotton for the natural fiber , but the 5 % lycra means that it fits snugly on around baby and maintains the tightness without constantly having to retighten . Also , I 'd recommend going with one that you just tie off in a knot . The ones with rings are nice , but the rings will dig into your hips if pulled in too tight , and it 's more of a hassle to do and undo ...	-1
lets see , it takes way too long to put on , it takes way too long to put baby in and my baby hates it and when she is finally inside it she wiggles and hates it even more and it is way too bulky for me to feel like i can get anything done . dunno what the hype about this product is , it is pretty bad .	-1
Cheaply made and unattractive . Not quality I was expecting nor does it really resemble the picture . Save your money for other storage options .	-1
I really wanted some velvet baby hangers , and these were a great bargain ! Unfortunately , they seemed very cheap . I returned them because they were starting to shed the & # 34 ; velvet & # 34 ; material the first day I got them . Disappointing .	-1
Please do not purchase this highchair ! ! This was the only product that I did not obsessively research before our daughter was born 18 months ago and , boy , do I regret it . I bought because of the nice color combo which coordinated with our living spaces . Whoops ! Cons -- Dirty , dirty , dirty - this chair has so many cracks and crevices for food to fall , hide , stay forever ... yuck . I am the kind of person that likes to clean up every night , but this is the one thing that must remain dirty until its monthly shower ( literally , the only way to get this clean is the shower ) . Food gets stuck under the seat EVERY time she eats . Buy a chair that does not have seams and holes ... or as few as possible . The worst is the tray - Chicco screwed 2 pieces of plastic together to make this thing , which means all of the crumbs/food get stuck in the narrowest crack FOREVER . There is also a clever hole right at the crotch , perfect to catch food . And do n't even think about sweeping the food towards the foot rest , as the food will get stuck there too . Of course ! - Awkward bar at crotch - the leg bar is on the tray ( vs part of the chair itself like graco ) and too far forward on the tray . I can not get the tray close enough to her . Another contributor to dirtiness ... - Infant pads for shoulder straps too large - not very useful- Lap portion of belt always get stuck ( plastic adjuster always get stuck in the back ) - Too large for a small living space ( only purchase if you have ample space ) - Trays do not fit in dishwasherPros -- cushions - seem comfy for little one and easy wipe down- infant cushion option is nice- recline- large enough to accommodate baby/toddler for awhileI am firmly suggesting that you do not purchase .	-1
This chair has been a total disappointment since we first got it for our son . It is sturdy and durable , but it has some major drawbacks especially when it comes to cleaning.PROs : -Folds up easily and stores nicely-Has two removeable tray tops so that you do not have to clean the entire tray after each meal-Very adjustable ( with caveat ... see cons ) -Tray is easy to put on and removeCONs : -Tray is very large- much too large for a child 's normal portion of food and a cup- Because the tray is so large , it can not fit into our standard sized dishwasher ( despite being 'dishwasher safe ' ) -The chair and padding can not be washed easily- Chair should be made out of a 'wipe down ' material for easy cleaning or made from something machine washable.-The cushions on this chair are labeled 'hand wash only ' ... this is a major inconvenience.-The shoulder pads - which get dirty at almost every meal - are only removable by disassembling the straps.-These shoulder pads should be velco or snap on and off to allow for easy removal and cleaning.- Despite otherwise being very adjustable , the recline is fixed on this chair . As a result , you can not set your child to sitting fully upright . The chair is always reclined .	-1
I really can not say that I would recommend this toy/soother to , well , anyone . I 'm sure some babies might like it , and it does seem to get a few glowing reviews , I just ca n't rate it that well when I compare it to other toys & soothers my two little ones have used.This toy is a paradox to me , simple , yet also complicated to use . Simple , in that there are just a few buttons , and a spinning thing at the bottom which is very blah . Complicated , in that there is simply an orange circle button , and a blue triangle , and with those two buttons you have to scroll through so many options for the different settings . There is also a yellow button on the front . Of course I read the instructions , but I ca n't very well teach my baby how to use the triangle and circle button properly to select the different settings , now can I ? It just seems poorly designed in this aspect . Frankly , this soother really just does n't DO much.Also , do we have to put TVs everywhere ? Because that 's what this feels like , and cheap , watered down TV for the crib . The ability to upload personal photos to display is sort of neat , I 'll give it that . But other than that , I 'm unimpressed . The short `` soothing '' moving images and music do not last very long and do not interest my 18 month old at all . She was over this toy in a few minutes , unfortunately.Finally , while I can see some little babies under a year enjoying this soother in their crib , I also know that babies become very over-stimulated with in-your-face , strapped-to-the-crib toys like this . With both of my girls , I found other soothers to be much more entertaining & calming to them and very helpful when they were alone in their crib . Simply put , I just think this one misses the mark . Especially considering the price , to me it 's just not worth it . While it looks cool , it really turned out to be a very dull toy in our house . Baby ca n't interact with it much , the cycles do n't last long at all , and it just feels poorly designed.For what it 's worth , our favorite soothers to keep in the crib with our babies were the Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Seahorse , the Cloud b Sleep Sheep ( WE LOVE the Sleep Sheep ! ) , and the LeapFrog My Pal Scout/Violet dog . I 'd recommend those over this any day , and you 'll save a little money , too . Plus , call me old fashioned , but I really just do n't like the idea of my child being in front of a digital screen 24/7 . They 're everywhere already ( shopping carts , cars , restaurants , elevators , living rooms ) do they have to be in the cribs also ? Kids need a little down-time from over stimulation , too .	-1
I received this as a gift and I 'm returning it . This is basically just a tv ... . For a baby ... . Insanity ! This and products like it turn kids brains to mush . And personally I blame these kind of push a button and lights flash , loud toys are a huge factor to the incline of kids inability to focus , the need for instant gratification and the sense of entitlement . Chose your kids toys wisely .	-1
This seems like an interesting idea for the crib , but in reality , it 's pretty much useless . The design is cute , but that 's the extent of our satisfaction.It consumes batteries quickly , and since we limit screen time , our baby does n't realize what he 's seeing.We left it in the crib for visiting babies ( nephews and friends ) . Only one baby has ever shown any interest ... his mother has had him in front of the TV since birth , so he actually finds this soothing.I ca n't recommend this item . While we had no problems with the quality of it ( and I see that other reviewers have had problems ) it just does n't serve much purpose .	-1
I was excited to receive this product as I expected it to be a hit with my 2 1/2 year old and 12 month old ( the product description suggests that it 's most appropriate for 0-24 months ) , however , it 's been a disappointment for all of us.For a young baby , it 's likely a fine enough product to place in the crib for passive entertainment where the baby just watches the entertaining and soothing applications , though , as someone else has already said in a review , this makes it seems a lot like baby television . Since the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no television for children under the age of 2 , it seems that the bConnect Digital Soother is n't such a good idea either.There is an interactive component to the product where children can scroll to advance two of the applications , however , there 's also a large button on the front of the product which activates the nightlight feature when pushed . This feature is a major design flaw - any baby or toddler that 's interacting with this toy is going to push the large yellow button and unintentionally bring any entertainment to a halt to be greeted with a night light that can only be turned off by pushing the button again.I was particularly looking forward to the feature that enables you to use a memory card to display personal photos and thought this would be great for car trips . Unfortunately , I was never able to get one of my memory cards to successfully work with this product.Overall , it 's an overpriced plastic product . My recommendation is to purchase a rotating mobile - it will likely be a bigger hit ( and more educational ) with your baby .	-1
When my baby was 6 months , I put him into this booster seat . It was so small for him ! Furthermore , due to a lack of proper backing , my baby hit the back part of his head a couple of times when I fixed his seat on a dining chair . That was ridiculous , considering that my baby was 50th percentile for his weight and height at 6 months back then ! The toys were really boring with a blue elephant with a head that can be moved vertically , a chimp on a tree with the latter that pivots on its axis , a frog that is movable back and forth the same curved track and a giraffe with rattling rings around its neck . That 's all . Pretty boring , is n't it ? It certainly is , in my ( and my baby 's ) opinion .	-1
This seat is TINY ! I opened up the box , put it together and thought , oh , is this one of the play doll seats ? Oops , I thought it was for a baby ! My daughter isnt all that big , she barely fits in it . She looks ridiculous sitting in it . It looks like a giant baby sitting in a dollhouse seat : ) The backrest barely goes to the middle of her back . She is 16 months old , 30 '' , I dont think you could fit a toddler in it . Its best for 6 months and under IF your baby is small for their size and can sit by themselves . Yes , its inexpensive , like they always say , you get what you pay for ! I will keep it to take to restaurants , and get a regular sized one for the kitchen table . Also , the toy that attaches just easily pops right off , so , it gets tossed to the floor right away ! No suprise , though , there is a giant baby sitting in the seat ! ! !	-1
The toy tray is unnecessary as it can only serve interest for a shirt while before my toddler simply want to pull it off and drop it by the floor . And when this s it , you have a loose piece of toy 'furniture'/'junk ' if you will .	-1
I bought this bouncer for my 4 month old daughter because I wanted another seating option for her besides her swing or Boppy lounger . I thought this bouncer had a good concept with the interactive toy design . However , once I put together the bouncer and let my daughter sit in it , I saw that she could n't even really reach the monkey and butterfly toys at the top . She also could n't get the push and pull feature of the toy bars . I do n't know if she 's still too young and only knows how to bat at the toys but it just seemed like to me that she got bored very quickly sitting there staring at toys that she could n't play with . Perhaps an older baby may like this better but according to the bouncer description , you should n't use this on a baby that can sit up on their own and that 's the only way I can see any baby being able to reach up for the high toys . Also , the music and monkey sounds that comes on when you move one of the handles gets really annoying after awhile . It would be good if there was an off button for the music rather than having to just remove the battery . Lastly , I thought the toy bars could be moved to the sides so you can easily take your baby in and out of the chair but it does n't . That means you have to lift your child from the top and slide their legs out from below the toys . Not a big deal but another annoying part of the toy design . I ended up returning this bouncer as it was n't worth the money for the badly executed design of the toys .	-1
As far as my baby goes , he likes this bouncer okay . Only one of the arms plays music ( or a monkey noise ) when moved . I 'm not sure if he 'd get more entertainment from a different bouncer or not.But , both my husband and I have walked by the bouncer and tripped over it multiple times . The way the legs are positioned , just slightly larger than the actual bouncer , makes it very easy to trip over . I was inspired to write this review after my last trip incident today . I am sitting here with my pinky toe-nail ripped off due to this bouncer . I would honestly just recommend purchasing one with a different style base .	-1
We got this product off of our registry . Our son is a nightmare in the car and screams the whole time . We tried to install this so he could see himself and we could see him . There is no way for us to install it in a way in which he can see himself . We have a hatchback and there is no headrest in the center seat of the car . There is a velcro option but we it 's not the right length . On top of it all , the remote does not work . This is a waste of money . Plus the music is very annoying ( and my tolerance is high ) . Find another product if you can .	-1
This product says it can be installed without a rear head rest , but it can not . You need to be able to put it around a head rest . I tried installing it in the center where I have no head rest , but unless you have a hook , to clip the strap to , it will not stay over the back seats . I followed the instructions on how to do it , but it is impossible . It has straps that have metal in that mould over the back seats , but then when you go to put the mirror in position with the velcro on the back to hold it in position and tilt it so the baby can see , it becomes top heavy and falls forward . There is a strap and the instructions say to clip it to something , but there 's nothing in the car to clip it to . Yes there are bolts between the car seat base and back , but they are in front of the back rest , not in the car trunk ! Works ok when installed on a rear seat head rest , but do n't buy if you want to put it where there is no head rest.Also the remote I got did not work ! ! !	-1
I really wanted to like this item . It 's made by Fisher-Price which generally means it will stand the test of time . It is bright and colorful and has cute zoo animals on the front which caught my attention at the very least . However , I really wish I had gone with the Baby Einstein mirror or really any other mirror over this one for a few reasons I will outline below.PROS:1 ) It 's bright and pretty2 ) The songs are entertaining and the lights are cool . The music plays for approximately 10 minutes.3 ) It has a setting to control lights and music , music only , etc . very handy.4 ) The mirror part is large -- which should help you see your baby better.5 ) It comes with a remote control so you can turn the sounds on or off from the front seat ( see cons -- important ) CONS:1 ) The single most annoying thing about this mirror is its lack of stability . It has velcro straps to secure it into place onto your headrest . Sounds good , right ? Well the way it has the velcro , if you hit one little tiny bump ( say a speed bump or a pothole ) the entire mirror shifts and suddenly moves out of place . In a nutshell , it is not very secure . In order to make it truly secure you need better straps or more velcro , or ... something . It is a terrible design with how they put the straps in the first place.2 ) The remote is a GREAT idea ... only problem is , it works when it wants to . Sometimes the remote works , but 75 % of the time , it does n't no matter how many times you hit the giant button . You should see me , driving down the freeway , holding my hand out behind me trying all kinds of different angles to get the music to turn back on . Up , down , side , upside down -- nope nothing . Then I 'll wait a few minutes and try it again , and it will randomly work . Oh and they put the sensor to the remote control on the BOTTOM of the mirror , so if you have a high seat or the angle of the mirror is at an odd angle to where you are sitting ( so you can see the baby better ) , you wo n't hit the sensor . I should note that this is NOT the problem with the remote -- I will literally hold the remote next to the mirror when we are stopped and it still suffers from the same problem of working when it wants to.3 ) The music -- Okay on one hand , playing for 10 minutes is awesome -- until it stops . If the remote worked correctly , then you could start it up again and everyone is happy . Instead , my daughter has meltdowns on the freeway when the music stops and I ca n't get it to start back up again because I 'm in traffic and pulling over just to check on her and restart the toy takes away the whole point of having the mirror in the first place . Worse , 90 % of the time , I 've hit a bump in the road or changed lanes , and the mirror is out of place , so I have no way of knowing if the baby is crying because there is something genuinely wrong or because she 's upset the music stopped . Very frustrating.Ultimately , I really regret spending the money on this . I really wanted to like it , but now I 'm wishing I bought the Baby Einstein one instead ( which you can control how long the music plays for ) . Instead , I 'll probably break down and go pick up some velcro strips to try and make the mirror at least stay put . I would suggest you try it before you buy it and see if it works in your car for you . Maybe you 'll have better luck ...	-1
Sewing controllability status too maligned work spent doing this stuff too , and the remote control ... do not know the intentToo lazy , but just use Unsatisfied .	-1
Can not get this pouch to fit on car seat . Waste of money . I have the britax car seat and this product does not work well with it .	-1
I was hoping this would be better then a different generic holder we bought . Sadly , it is worse . It sits very low and child will never reach it ( on roundabout seat ) , was hard to attach and only has small pockets . I was hoping to put small board books in here , but the pockets are stiched on all sections , only leaving pockets about 3 inches wide . Its on now , but might not be for long .	-1
This pouch is not needed - you can barely see it on the side of the Britax Marathon Car Seat . I feel it was a waste of $ .	-1
This is a good idea and I like that I have a place to put his books and toys however its placed so low on the car seat my 15 month old ca n't reach it , he ca n't even see it . I wanted him to be able to get his books at his own leisure but does n't work . At least I can keep my car a little neater with it .	-1
sits too low for ds to reach ! ! Maybe in a year it will be usefull , but for now it just does n't work . I saw reviews saying the exact same thing , but really wanted to believe the other reviews that loved it ( 'cause it would make my life easier ! ) . No good for now ( ds is turning 2 and the tallest in his daycare class )	-1
The design of the pouch is not very functional for the child . The pouch is useful for the parent to put things that they do n't want on the floor of the car , but sits very low so that the child can not access the items easily . I would have rather purchased two cup holders instead ( although my cup holder partially broke after only two months . )	-1
I went to the Dollar store here in Kansas City , MO and found the exact item . Packaging is half Spanish . I would not recommend this . Who knows what 's in it and it surely dose n't qualify as being safe to me if it 's sold a dollar store .	-1
I wanted something small for my 6 mo old and these are definitely small . I wanted snaps but did n't want to spend the money . Should have just skipped these and gone for the JJ Cole bibs as that is what I 've ended up with and love them . These bibs are nice to throw in the diaper bag but I just do n't really care for them .	-1
While we will use this bag , we certainly would n't buy another one from Bumkins . The bag is a single layer where the Itzy Ritzy bags we have have two layers . Where the Itzy Ritzy bags feel soft , durable , thick , and easy to clean , the Bumkins bag feels plastic coated , super thin , and low quality . I would rather pay $ 10 for an Itzy Ritzy bag than $ 5 for one of these .	-1
This is a nice alternative to the plastic bags however , the price should be a little lower so that others can enjoy participating in helping to save the ozone layer . I have n't tried fruits for the absorbency , but it seems durable .	-1
I 'm sure that some people like reusable bags , depends on how `` green '' you want to go but I just do n't feel like I can get this clean enough to feel comfortable about using over and over again . The instructions say that you can put in the dishwasher or machine washable . I would n't want to put this in the clothes washer and it 's hard to place in the dishwasher and keep it open and in place without it getting blown around the dishwasher by the water spray.To me these are like reusing a straw or plastic sandwich bag . Just get a new one . There are other places to save money on and other things make more of an impact in the landfill than how many times that I might use a plastic sandwich bag .	-1
I have been waffling for over a year on trying out some of these re-usable bags for my kid 's snacks . Now that I have it , I realize how many things it 's really not good for . Crackers or pretzels can and will be smashed in my purse or my son 's lunch bag . Cheese or meat sandwiches are out of the question unless you have enough bags to use a fresh one every day . Berries are an obvious no-go . After agonizing half the summer last year about what nifty things to buy to pack my son 's lunches in this year I finally just used the hard plastic containers with flip up lids we have been using for years ( from that big Swedish store ) and that is what I will stick with . This bag will get some use packing the kids ' toothbrushes and toothpaste when we travel , but not for food .	-1
Great idea not to invent a product that replaces throw away sandwich bags , but after a few uses , this reusable bag starts to smell ... washing does n't really help because then the bag is wet , hard to completely dry and therefore your next day 's lunch is also wet .	-1
When my kids were small we had Bumkins bibs for them , in fact I kept one for the past decade to use with visiting small kids and it is still flexible . I often give Bumkins bibs as baby gifts because I like them so much . So I decided to try these bags.Positive : It does surprisingly well with stuff like crackers , I thought the crumbs would leak out the bottom or the zipper , but they do not.It does do well going through the washer or dishwasher ( but it is hard to put in the dishwasher , as it tends to float around.It is water resistant.Cute prints.Negative : You can not fit an adult size sandwich ( at least the kind my husband makes ! ) into the bag since it is not gusseted.You need at least two sets for each person bringing a lunch , since it takes a while for them to dry.They do not protect whatever is inside , it will get smooshed.My daughter ended up using this to keep her Ipod and phone corralled in her backpack , it is easy to spot and provides a little protection against spills . A bit pricey item for such a job.I packed my kids lunches for years in Tupperware type containers , they protect the food , can contain liquids and are easy to throw in the dishwasher . The new thing now is Bento boxes , and I think that either of the options above are a better choice for those looking to save the environment by having reusable containers ( that are simple to wash and easy to reuse ) . These bags are just too pricey and too much work for food packing purposes.I can highly recommend the bibs , but these bags are just not a good choice .	-1
Thought this was cute at first but the opening is way too smaill for toddler hands ! My son struggles to pull his hand out with his snacks .	-1
The monster is cute but it 's a pain to open him and the opening is n't as child-friendly as the less fun , regular designs that you find from the other brands such as Munchkin .	-1
I should have listened to the other reviews about how it 's hard to get the treats out of this monster . The teeth are a little bit hard . It 's even hard for me to get them out let alone my 18 month boy !	-1
Love that the snacks do not fall out and the little guy can get his hands in there and has no problems.. The reason I HATE it is that is NEARLY impossible to OPEN to clean . IT should be screw on top , but its not . You have to pry the lid off with a knife to open it , and with it being round , well then you can cut your fingers off ! FRUSTRATING when you have a screaming toddler who wants his snacks now.. and its hard to fill it as well .	-1
I find this hard to open to clean . My 15 month old son has used it more as a toy since he finds it hard to get cheerios out of it . I 'm saving it for when he 's older and hoping it will eventually be useful . The opening , being on the side , makes it hard for me to reach in too . He carried it by the arms but otherwise , the character did n't entertain him .	-1
Hard to open and black ink on eyes started to come off when my son put it in his mouth .	-1
Yes , it 's `` well made '' . It wo n't come apart if dropped . In fact , it sometimes wo n't come apart if a reasonably strong adult tugs and pulls on it with all their might . The feet will pop off before the bowl opens for cleaning or filling . The teeth are cute , but too gummy/sticky for a strong 9 to 17-month old to access even small snacks like Cheerios . I really wanted to love this snack keeper , but my daughter HATES it . She ca n't access the snacks and throws the monster on the floor when gets annoyed with its prison-tight grip on her snack . I hate it , too because I have to literally bang it on the counter to pop it open for cleaning or filling . I thought it would loosen up over a few months of use , but it did n't . Huge disappointment .	-1
My son gets so frustrated with this thing ! He ca n't get the snacks out because the rubber teeth are way too stiff . I even have trouble getting them out ! This thing as turned into a bath toy for us .	-1
It is really cute but you ca n't get your hand in and a snack back out . It did n't improve with time/use . My toddler could n't use it at all	-1
I found this little monster to be very difficult to use . Neither my 18 month old son or I can even get our hands into the monsters mouth to get cookies/crackers out ! Now I understand the point is to keep the food in , but I think the angle of the mouth as well as it being a narrow oval makes it very difficult to use . I 've gone back to just giving him a few at a time for him to hold in his hands .	-1
Maybe this would work for older kids , but my 12 month old can not get the snacks out of this snack keeper . It hurts his hand and so he just shakes it like crazy hoping something will fall out . If I hold the & # 34 ; teeth & # 34 ; open for him , he dives right in . There are definitely better snack keepers out there .	-1
While this is a cute product , my two year old ca n't even get her hand in and out of the opening , rendering it useless with the top on .	-1
I bought it because it looks very cute , but not so anymore after I have to clean up the crumbs everywhere . Crumbs fall off between 'teeth ' . This is only for home use . The shape is odd and too big for diaper bag . My 13 months old son has been playing it as a toy only .	-1
Playful container but it fall short in the way the lid attaches to the bottom piece . It just loosely snaps on . It is not a twist closure thus if your child drops this item , top and bottom pieces will separate ! I have to put two pieces of tape on so that the lid wo n't pop off when dropped .	-1
My LO does n't like using this snack cup as much as I thought he would . He is not afraid of this line of products , but we have had a bad experience with the entire line from nuby ( normally our favorite and go-to brand ) . His little 1 year old hand gets stuck in the mouth and he gets easily frustrated . I have the worst time trying to clean it out when we do use it . I did n't even realize that it came apart until I read other reviews . : ( Very disappointed in this entire line of products .	-1
This is seriously cute but the opening for my daughters hand was oval n instead of round so it is hard to use . It takes too much space in the drawer !	-1
I was hoping to reduce spills of snacks in the living room with this thing . It worked , but it also impedes my son from eating ! Little fingers can get inside , but then they lose what they 're holding on their way out . My son tried a few times and then just gave up on his snack . I also had a really hard time opening it to wash it , thought I would break it.It 's useless for now , maybe when my son ( who 's 2 ) is stronger , he can use it .	-1
Ugh ! Another dissapointment ! ! If my kid throws this all of his snacks will end up on the floor . LAME . MAJOR LAME . Sooooo cute but not practical !	-1
All the reviews were great so I gave this a try . The top is tough for little hands to get inside and keep the snack while pulling the hand out . My toddler learned to keep one & # 34 ; petal & # 34 ; down as she pours the snacks into her lap/floor , etc . Not what I expected .	-1
These diapers will only work if you 1. do n't plan on leaving it on the baby for more than 30-45 minutes or 2. if you stuff another insert into them . In my opinion , what is the point of having an AIO if you still have to stuff it ? There is barely any absorbency at ALL in these . The prints are very cute , though .	-1
This diaper is awful . While it is very cute , it leaks pretty bad through the PUL . I have found that this brand in itself is just awful . You get what you pay for with this product .	-1
At first I really liked this diaper even though it has a ton of snaps . It is slim and fits under clothes easily , but after a few times it proved to be too much of a hassle with all the stinkin ' snaps . ( If I take it off for Pumpkin to potty I dread putting it back on . ) Then it started leaking through the shell . That 's it ... it 's the only one in the drawer right now while all the others are in the wash.Pros:1 . The print is really cute.2 . It 's a slim diaper that fits under clothes without the bulk.3 . I like the way the insert is attached and washes easily.Cons:1 . Leaks *through* the shell . It is not waterproof at all.2 . Has way too many snaps . I think three snaps would be adequate , five is ridiculous.3 . Leaves imprints of snaps on Pumpkin 's skin.4 . The front flap for the insert is very loose moves out of place while being worn . Weird design and/or poor construction .	-1
Nice bag for the price , cute but not too girly for a baby boy . Not the biggest diaper bag I have seen but I do n't haul a lot of stuff around.I really liked this diaper bag when I got it , but only had it a month before the mesh that is part of the bottle holder on the side tore away from the top part where it is stitched to the edge , I was using the small 4oz skinny bottles , so I did n't do anything to make that happen .	-1
My son is 23 pounds so after reading the description indicating this is good for up to 30 I happily made the purchase . Once I opened it however , the box it came in said `` up to 24 pounds '' - I did n't even bother opening it and immediately returned it . SHAME Amazon has n't fixed their description yet ... .	-1
I have read all the reviews before making purchase . The product seems has very good reviews . I ordered one , the pacakae arrived very quickly . I was so excited to try it on my 11 months son . He slided off through the side loop and fell.fortunately , he did not get hurt . I have adjusted the stip and made it tight but the loop hole on both sides are so big that he can swing his head and arms off the strip and fall . I do n't feel safe to use it at all . Decide to return . In my opinion , there is design issue for safty here .	-1
My doors are too wide for these to fit correctly , but the kids like playing with them . They are a wee bit flimsy so they warp when I try to get them to go onto my interior bedroom doors . I also did n't get five different designs , but only four . Not a big deal , orange just is n't my favourite colour and I received two oranges designs .	-1
This item was on my baby registry and a friend bought the 0-3 month SOOTHIE pacifier for me . That 's what my baby likes , so I decided to order another set . I went back to the same page that was linked to from my registry and I again ordered the 0-3 month Soothie pacifier ( Amazon even said on the page that this was a repeat order from my registry ) . However , I was sent the 3+ months SUPER SOOTHIE . I just went back to look at the page and it is definitely for the 0-3 month Soothie . There must be something messed up with Amazon 's ordering system because when I click on the link to read and write reviews , it then says 3+ months , but then when I click on the link to go back to the item page , it goes back to saying 0-3 months . Make sure when you put this in your cart that you are ordering the correct product . I am going to return these and then go buy the pacifiers I want from a brick and mortar store so that I know I 'm getting what I want . This was very disappointing .	-1
My daughter loves these pacifiers in the 0 month size . The 3 month size are so thick she ca n't even keep them in her mouth when she 's sucking . They are n't pliable at all and they 're completely unusable for us .	-1
huge fan of all Philips products i thought i would give this a try , my son did not like it , he made such a silly face every time I would put it in his mouth , he would take it out almost immediately . not a good fit for us .	-1
I realize that these are made thicker in order to be safer for our little ones but my 7 month old will not take these pacifiers at all . He 's not even remotely interested and just tosses them to the floor . Such a shame because he really loved the 0-3 month soothe pacifiers .	-1
It 's true , this pail will stink , it wo n't matter what you use to absorb odor it wo n't work and every time you open the pail a horrible stench will permeate the nursery.The inside ring also always comes off and if you over stuff it will snag the garbage bag . We are having baby # 2 soon and the only thing I need to replace is this pail . I also advise all my friends to avoid this pail , as it was the worst purchase we made for our daughter .	-1
This diaper pail is horrible . We returned it . It 's just a garbage can . There is no sealing action , so you open the top and out comes nasty smells . Also , the can seemed to retain the smell , even though it said it should n't . Waste of money .	-1
I do not reccommend this product , I accidentally knocked this over one day and the white part cracked and fell entirely off after owning it one week . Two weeks later the clear piece that is on the inside of the rim fell off as well.On top of that this is TINY ! ! I ca n't believe how small it is .	-1
Cheap foam material and it 's tiny ! Did n't come even close to fitting my 1 year old - Might work for a newborn or a kid with a tiny head but that 's all !	-1
I have 2 kids , ages 10 months and almost 4 . All and all I do like the stroller , I have not used it a ton in the few months I have had it but when I do use it , it works fine . I had a single BOB and the BOB is STROLLER HEAVEN . Phil and teds quality does not even come close to the BOB quality . The BOB is a real rugged , tough , smooth as a dream ( with built in suspension ) , comfy seats , nice hood , nice storage , etc ... My friends and I had our BOBs for 4 years ( my friend is a exercise nut and a jogger and hiker and uses hers daily ) . Not once did we have to replace a single tire or anything at all , everything still works and functions like it did the day we bought it . I can already see that the Phil and Ted quality is not going to stand the test of time . Even though the Phil and ted costs more , it is more cheaply made . I wish BOB would make a tandem double ! ! ! ! The pros ... It fits 2 kids but is the size of a singleI like the rear seat recline , it gets a good enough angle for my baby to nap.I like the foot brake , it is easy to engage and is strong.I like the follow the sun hood ( though I prefer an oversized hood that comes all the way down to cover your kid like the BOB.Cons ... .My kids are large in size , around 95th percentile each , and they fit okay in the stroller ( they could have more room , but it is not awful ) . My oldest 's legs and cramped in the front seat , and he would have been too big for the back seat by 1 1/2 . My youngest is tall and lean ... and his legs in the back are already cramped . But , it is not AWFUL , they could just use more leg room . And I worry my youngest 's head will hang off the back seat in another 6 months . And he only has about another 5 lbs before he hits the weight limit ... so he will probably outgrow it before age 2.No shocks , so the ride is bumpy and not very smooth . It does not handle or turn as well as even the HUGE and heavy double BOB.NO STORAGE AT ALL . You are lucky in you can fit a water bottle in the storage basket ... and this is with a 10 month old in the back seat.The quality could be better ... something about it screams `` cheaply made in China '' and I know I will have problems with it sooner than later.Another HUGE annoyance ... the front seat pad slips down over 12 inches and bunches up behind your child EVERY time then get in ... the liner is not snapped or attached to the seat , it just sits in there over the hard plastic ... so you always have to pull it up after your kid gets in.Also for 700 dollars , they need to have a longer and better warranty ! ! ! If you pay that much money on a stroller , you should have the product guaranteed for at least 2-3 years ! ! ! Phil and Teds ... what is wrong with you ? ? ? Give your customers at LEAST a 2 year warranty and STAND BY your product ! ! ! I have paid $ 30 on toasters with better customer service and a better warranty.It does NOT fold with the doubles seat , I called phil and teds directly and only the vibe and verve do this.All in all , there are better strollers on the market.UPDATE : I purchased the stroller from Along Comes a Baby around 3 months ago and already had to go in for the warranty . So I decided to sell it after getting it fixed and decided to get something better . I was right in my opinion that it would not last and was not rugged and able to take regular use .	-1
The idea of these is great ... .but they do not stay attached well to furniture . I 'm going to buy another package of double stick tape and see if they work better , but they literally fall right off . The color is nice , though , and perhaps I can get them to stay on with more tape .	-1
Our 10 month old was able to pull these out without much effort ... . What good is a baby proofing thing that is n't baby proof ? The manufacturer should make the glue stickier	-1
Purchased multiple bibs , and this one was the least favorite . The plastic is pretty thick and awkward around the neck and our little guy found it uncomfortable .	-1
I returned this bib , as I was dissatisfied with it . The main selling point of the bib is that it will catch food that the baby drops while eating . However , as soon as my baby lifted his arms to put food into his mouth , the pressure of his arms against the bib caused the lower portion of the bib to collapse , so any food he dropped fell straight to the floor , or into his lap . I am very pleased with the Baby Bjorn bibs , which in theory seem comparable to this one , but in reality , they are made of much harder plastic , and therefore do not collapse .	-1
After reading many reviews , I ordered this bib to try to get to a point where we do n't have to change our 8-month-old baby 's clothes after every meal . It 's not a bad bib , but it does not achieve that goal . On the good side of things , the bib tightly closes around the neck to protect against drips down the neck , it is easy to clean , and the pocket does stay open to catch mess as advertised.Unfortunately , in using it over the last couple weeks , we have discovered a few downsides . Our baby is tall for his age , and there is a gap between the bottom of the bib and his tray , and it seems like food and stains always get in this gap and mess up his clothes . Worst of all , our son likes to chew on the silicone material of the bib , and often does so . This means that anything in the pocket dumps all over his clothes , resulting in a terrible mess ! So far we have still had to change his clothes after every meal using this product . I will keep looking for something else .	-1
i do not like this bib . i actually just bought new ones to replace it . it is too short so food gets all over the bottom half of my baby 's shirt . and the pocket flops closed so most everything ends up on baby 's lap and in the high chair . waste of money . the only upside is that it fits good around the neck so food and drink does n't get on the collar of baby 's shirt .	-1
The description says that this is for a pack of 2 , but it 's incorrect - you only receive 1 bib ( so I returned it ) .	-1
... want to sell it for 10 % of the price and see if anyone would take it . It is so hard to install and it heats up so quickly that my little one ca n't seem to stay seated unless I jack up the AC . and the seat belts are way too chunky and thick that it hurts their delicate skin when wearing tank tops . Not recommending it and want to sell mine ! If anyone wants this at 1/5 of the price please let me know ! I only bought it July of 2013 !	-1
I found that the stance of the seat was too high for rear facing installation with someone in the passenger seat . I also hated the instructions . They were very dense and not very clear . I also found many of the straps very difficult to adjust ( tethers and LATCH straps ) . It 's probably a great seat , but after 30 min of trying to get it in the car it 's going back . For reference , I have a Volvo V50	-1
I like the car seat for the most part except the straps were a little stiff . Also the button that releases slack on the straps is really hard to get to . I dont know how it works in every other car but maybe just the 4Runner is not good with this seat . I had many issues with this , which caused me to return it . The seat never did go back enough to be parallel as a safe fit . Also once installed in the car the seat butts up right agains the back of the 4runner bench seat leaving no room to fit a finger in the hole to push the button to release slack on the straps . I think my child is more than ready to sit upward but this seat , even though not in the full parallel position , was not far back enough , which caused my childs head to fall forward and be stuck that way when she was sleeping - my biggest issue . Also because the seat is SO close to the back of the bench seat in the car , there is even less leg room than there is for her in her chicco key fit seat . So we went back to that for now because I trust it to be a good seat . Still looking for the next car seat ... hope this helps .	-1
I ca n't believe how many good reviews this car seat gets because my husband and I absolutely hate it . After 8 months of owning it , we 're done fighting it and we 're getting a different one . It 's honestly horrible . The straps constantly slide down off my son 's shoulders . My husband and I make them so tight and somehow they still slip off down onto his arm . We 've had the fire department inspect it and they ca n't get it to work either . It 's really not safe . We 're so worried about our son 's safety in this car seat for this reason . I 'm afraid to have him in the car seat in the back seat without someone sitting next to him because I 'm afraid the strap will slide down and we wo n't know it.Also , our son is 2 years old , 37 inches tall and weighs 35 lbs and we basically need a crowbar to get him in and out of this seat . There is no room at all . He 's so uncomfortable in it that he cries when we strap him in . Maybe this car seat would work if your baby barely moves and is tiny . But if you have a normal sized toddler , this car seat is a waste of money and not at all safe . I wish we never bought it .	-1
This did not click my Chicco KeyFit 30 into place securely . Strapping a car seat into a stroller was not to my liking.The newer version MIGHT accept Chicco-I DO NOT KNOW.I got the Chicco car seat stroller/carrier and the car seat snaps into place and does n't move at all which makes me more comfortable .	-1
Rated 1 star until its used . Then I 'll re-rate it . Baby due Dec 1 2013 . I 'm sure it will be good	-1
As I mentioned in the review of the Infant Optics monitor - these cords are the most cheaply made part of the system . I have had to repair ( re-wire ) or replace ( buying this product ) multiples of this cord over a 2 year duration.I would recommend finding an alternative from a different manufacturer if you need a replacement to the original power adapters from the monitor kit .	-1
I get soooooo many complements on this car seat and that I like . I love the safety features as well . But as far as liking it for my childs comfort and my ease , I HATE IT ! Here is why:1- When I click it into my Quinny buzz , it sits so straight up that my baby falls forward and there is absolutely NO way to tilt it back a little . He even sits that high up in it when it is in the base in the car . There are two different levels you can set it at ( the Base ) but I find that the setting for smaller babies is still making them sit way too `` up '' . Looks so super fancy in the stroller but my little guy can never nap : ( 2 - The shoulder strap covers have a wire in them which make them stick out . So they never actually protect my babys cheeks from rubbing the straps . They are so errect that they end up popping out of the sides of his shoulders . Trust me , I 've tried making them higher and lower and have no luck at all . It is so uncomfortable for my son that when we put him in it he screams till he falls asleep . There is no way of removing them either . It 's horrible . I like how tight he clicks into the seat but ca n't stand the shoulder straps and neither does my little guy.3 : It is so darn heavy . My hands are rough and callused because it is 11 lbs plus my 13 lb child.4 : The sun shade and foot muff are so pointless I laugh about it . The material is very very thin so I dont even know why there is a footmuff ... Some parents I hear on here saying 'Its alright , we just use a blankie to throw over it '' At the price of this seat , you should n't have to have an excuse . Everything on it should just be great.5 - I have only been using it for a short 4 months now . My baby does not wear any type of shoes or booties . There is piling where his little feet kick . It makes me sad because the material is nice . I can always take a razor to it but again ... Excuses ... ( I can always this , I can always that ... ) I understand the good reviews because it is fancy and just looks amazing . But I do actually care if my child is comfortable . So I do not suggest this car seat . I would not put it on my registry and if I received it as a gift I would return it . I really wish my husband would have saved the box and wouldnt be so obsessed with it 's great looks because I would spend additional money and go out and buy a Chicco Keyfit . We thank Grandpa for the pricey present but I wish I woulda stuck my head in when they picked one out.I really dont like writing bad reviews but I had to share this important info . I gave 2 stars because it 's a pretty seat and it 's safe . I hope it helps !	-1
I was really , really looking forward to getting this baby monitoring camera . It has all the features , and then some , that I would want in a baby camera . However , despite all my attempts , I was unable to set it up to connect to my network . THE ONLY way it seems to be able to connect to a network is through an Android or an iOS app . However , those apps are an absolute garbage - very hard to work with and incapable of basic functions . The Android app could n't find my camera AT ALL , and the iOS app was unable to log in my home network . So right now I have this camera sitting pretty at the side of my desk , unable to function properly due to the utmost crappy software . I really hope they fix this soon . Until they do that , I would stay away from this over-expensive useless gadget .	-1
We really wanted to like this product . As background , our first monitor was aPhilips AVENT Baby Monitor , which we like , but it lacks video . Next we tried aGraco True Focus Digital Video Monitor , which has video and great nighttime brightness , but sound issues and daytime quality consistency problems . This item is pretty pricy , especially considering it comes with only a parent unit , not a monitoring unit , and therefore requires you to use your own smartphone , tablet , or computer , and we had high hopes , but it feels like it may have been rushed to market.First , we encountered a minor annoyance during setup ( which overall was easy , so that 's one plus ) . The manual , and a slightly corrected page that shipped with the unit ( telling you to follow that slipsheet instead of the originally printed page ) indicates the user should turn the unit off , hold the reset button , and then turn the power on while still holding the reset button , continuing to hold it until the unit beeps . This resets the unit before use , and is to be repeated anytime you switch wi-fi networks . This never happened for us - I held the button for about 30 seconds , then gave up , turned it off and tried it again , the second attempt holding it for well over a minute . No beep . So instead I turned the unit on first , THEN held the reset button , which was not the process that either the manual or the corrected page indicated , and that worked , eventually . So , first strike , minor bug , no problem.Second , the setup on our iPad was buggy . We had already set up the account on an iPhone without a problem , but the iPad app would not pop up a keyboard ( no external keyboard , so that was n't the issue , and we do n't have this problem with any other apps ) , so it was impossible for us to sign in on the iPad app , unless we went out and purchased an external keyboard just for that . I repeatedly restarted the app , and eventually it just worked on its own . No changes in iPad settings . Another minor software bug , probably something to be fixed in a later patch . No big deal.Third , nighttime quality on this unit is pretty poor , even with brightness cranked up to the max . We did a side-by-side comparison next to the Graco unit linked above , and there was just no contest - the quality on this unit is considerably grainier , and it 's much harder to see details . Motion is also a bit blurry , though some of that is to be expected when over wi-fi ( although note that we have a solid router , and the unit is well within the range ) . This is more of a problem.Fourth , when using the smartphone as the monitoring unit , which to us seems the most convenient given the size , we hear a bizarre purring/vibrating sound . There is nothing on in the baby 's room , and the other two monitors we 've used do not have this problem . The sound sort of pulsates or goes through a crescendo/decrescendo , fading in and out at regular intervals , but it 's always there , even if you turn the volume way down . This bothered us even more than the video quality issue.Fifth , because of the nonstop sound above , we tried not having the smartphone monitor constantly on , instead relying on push notifications . The unit seems to be designed to send you a notification when sound is detected , which would lead you to launch the app and see what 's going on with the baby . This worked right after setup - we went into the room to adjust the camera , and my phone immediately popped up with `` sound detected . '' Success . But then it did not work consistently going forward . It 's not clear whether there 's a huge delay between notifications , and we did n't see any way to adjust that delay if so , but about half an hour later , the baby went down a for a nap ( no notification when we walked in and laid him down ) , and about an hour after that , the baby woke up , and we could hear him talking from another room , but still , no notification from the app . I even turned a `` sound sensitivity '' setting up to max . Nothing . ( But note when I tested the app from work , after logging in , it immediately sent me a `` sound detected ! '' message , even though no one was in the room and it seemed completely silent to me . ) Unfortunately , with the range of problems above , we find this unit to be unusable . Even putting aside setup bugs ( the first of which may just be an error in the manual , the second of which seems a simple software bug that could be patched ) , we have to choose between a constant purring/buzzing from leaving the app open and not being notified when there 's a sound so you should launch the app ( which completely defeats the purpose of having a monitor ) .We are disappointed , and will look forward to further versions of the product in the hopes Motorola works through these issues .	-1
To set it up , it requires that you download a free Android or iPhone app . Now this was a bit odd that a product can not be set up using my computer . I 'm surprised that the set up requires using an app from the Android or Apple stores . Unfortunately , our Android devices ( two smart phones from Motorola and an older tablet ) are running an older version of Android for which this supposedly free app is not available.We have Windows Phones ( Nokia Lumia 920 ) but I 'm not going to blame Motorola for not releasing an app for the Windows Phone . However , this prerequisite of having one of the latest Android or iOS devices to set it up should be mentioned clearly in the description of the item . I guess if someone does n't have one of the latest smart phones , they should not buy this camera.But what really intrigued me is this : The app it requires us to use to set up and manage this baby monitor is not one developed by Motorola but some third party company called binatonetelecom based in Hong Kong . So if the software vendor stops updating the app or pulls it out of the store , this camera may become useless . As I mentioned , I could *not* find the app from the Google Play store on my device because my Android device was running a slightly older version ( 2.2 ) of Android OS . If you are thinking about buying this camera , it should concern you that even though this camera has a Motorola logo on it , the app that controls it does n't come from Motorola.Lastly , there is a website to manage the camera called monitoreverywhere dot com . This is where they require you to register by creating an account . On that site , there is no mention of `` Motorola '' anywhere . Their FAQ does n't even mention `` Motorola '' once . If you click on `` Contact Us '' , it takes to a page that shows their Hong Kong address with no company name and no phone number . Now again , this is the site that will be used to `` manage '' this camera 's live feed and control the camera . To me , this is a serious privacy concern.I would not even give this product as a gift to someone I care about - let alone use it . *** Update ****After only a few weeks , it stopped powering on . I do n't know if it 's powering on or not because when I plug this to the supplied AC adapter , I do n't see any LEDs coming on . They there used to be a blinking LED which when it was plugged in . I thought I 'd try one of the several universal IP camera apps to somehow get it be detected so I can properly review it but I have not been able to get it to work .	-1
This is the third internet-camera I 've bought online . One did n't work , one kinda works but not all that great , and this one simply wo n't work for me . I 've tried setting it up a dozen times . I 've reset , re-installed , re-run and I just ca n't get it to work.-I 'm sick of these things not working . I 've had it . ONE STAR.-STOP MAKING THINGS THAT DO N'T WORK . I 'm SO TIRED of going through the setup steps over and over and over only to have it NOT work or recognize the camera or come back with some dumb error . ZERO STARS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I 've been doing these Amazon Vine reviews for quite a while , I ca n't remember a product as frustrating as this one . I wish I could hurl it out the window , but the Vine rules say I have to keep it ( and I assume , not whack it with a hammer ) for six months before I can throw it away . Read on if you want to hear the gory details , or just skip to the end to see my recommendations for a better alternative.Okay , first , setting this camera up is just about impossible . And I say this as an experienced tech professional who has set up other Wifi PTZ cameras before . This , however , I gave up after 90 minutes of failure.Instead of having some way ( like a USB cable ) for me to configured this from my computer like my oldFoscam FI8918W ( there 's a newer version out there , but I do n't have theFoscam FI8910Wyet ) , there 's fairly involved procedure for resetting the device , having it turn on its own wifi , and configuring it wirelessly through their MonitorAnywhere app on an Android or IPad/IPhone device . You can view the image from a PC , but you ca n't configure it from one , so it would be good for households who only have tablets/smartphones ( if it worked ) . I had to try three or four times to connect to the wifi even with my 3rd generation iPad HD inches away from the camera . Then I went through the whole setup procedure ( the MonitorAnywhere app is horrible , and makes it hard to type where you 're supposed to ) , only to find that something went wrong , and I had to do it again . But wait ! It turns out that it was n't done . In order to set it up , you have to use a MonitorAnywhere app , and this app is too stupid to realize that you might already have a MonitorAnwhere account already set up ( from one of the prior failed attempts ) and let you log in . And hitting back is a BAD idea . So I 'm trying this whole stupid process YET AGAIN , and assuming I get that far , I expect I 'll have to set up another account.I have n't tried this from my Android devices yet , but I 'm not hopeful.Assuming that you get this set up ( I never did ) , you 'll discover why I truly dislike this camera : it appears that it will broadcast my picture and all the sounds it can pick up to some server on the internet . ( It might be using UPnP `` Universal Plug 'n ' Play '' to open up holes in my home firewall , but that 's just as bad if not worse . ) It 's actually a half decent idea , since it 's nice to be able to be at dinner and see that the babysitter has indeed put the kids to bed on time . But I ca n't disable it . So I just have to trust that the good folks at Motorola are using a secured protocol for the transmission and have locked their servers & cameras so hackers ca n't get in and access video of my children or overhear conversations in the house , like when my wife asks for my credit card number.To give Motorola a *little* credit , their solution is a bit better than the basic method that seems to be popular with Foscam users , which is just use port forwarding on their router . At least the Motorola method uses a password.Here 's a better option : get a router with a VPN , like theASUS RT-N66U . It has OpenVPN built in , so you can securely connect to your home network from anywhere . OpenVPN is supported by both Android and iOS . This way , when you connect to your Foscams from the restaurant , your kids pictures never leaves your ( extended ) private network . And you can probably do all of that for about the same price or less than a single Blink1 ( based on the Amazon price for this camera as of the time I write the review ) . If you want two or three cameras , you 'll be saving yourself hundreds of dollars . And hours of frustration.I hope you found this review helpful . If you did , please click `` Yes '' below . If not , please let me know in the comments how I can make the review better ! I 'll be happy to answer questions or add information to the review .	-1
The Motorola Blink1 Remote Wi-Fi Camera has good potential but there are some issues that will hopefully be addressed in future software updates . The initial setup is relatively easy and requires a free app / program . However , setup was longer than expected on my iPad as it took several minutes to recognize the camera and several more to link . Setup on my Android phone was much faster . Once linked , the camera is very easy to control and response is fast on both devises . When viewing on the iPad there is a rhythmic click , even with the camera sound turned off the click persists so the issue appears be with the app or video and not the camera 's audio.The Blink1 gives you the option of receiving alerts for temperature extremes and noise , a great idea if it worked in a timely manner . It took at least 20 minutes to receive sound alerts on my Android phone which is way to long . Alerts to not appear to be an option on the iPad . You also have the option of recording the video feed but this is `` not yet supported '' on the iPad . On Android you can not choose the file path where the video is saved so it is buried on your phone rather than showing in you videos . Still photos work on both devices as expected.Motorola is obviously still working on getting the software where it needs to be , hopefully it wont take it several releases tog to it there . If you are ok not having the temperature reading and the ability to remotely play lullabies you can find cheaper options but the Blink1 has good potential if they can correct the issues . With all these issues it makes me wonder how secure this camera really is .	-1
This product claims to be compatible with PC . Going through the instructions , it looks like this description might be technically true , because -- apparently -- once it is installed , you can view the monitored location from a PC on the internet by going to the right Motorola website.What they do n't tell you as clearly is that the device CAN NOT be installed unless you have an Android or compatible Apple device . Installation from PC is impossible.With my Android tablet ( hopefully ) lost or ( perhaps ) stolen , I can not even install this device to test it from the PC.Really , Motorola ? Was this necessary ? If a device can be installed using an app , there is no reason you ca n't make a mini-program to do the same on a PC . Failure to do so is a disservice to your customers . Moreover , in this case you should not claim it is compatible with PC , as you clearly do.If I locate my Android , or get another one , I 'll update the review to discuss functionality . Right now I 'm severely disappointed in the unreasonable limitation on installation .	-1
**Important - A smart device ( i.e . iPhone ) is required in order to set up this monitor.First off , the direction booklet is rather confusing . It could be done much better and made clearer . And it made it seem it could be set up on the Mac Book Air laptop , without setting it up on the iPhone , which is not correct . The set up process is not intuitive , nor simple.We had another brand of camera monitor that was so easy to set up and use . But this one is very difficult and disappointing .	-1
With another baby on the way , we were looking for a second baby monitor but after trying to use this one for a couple days , I am ready to throw it in the trash.Setting up the camera was easy enough . I followed the instructions for resetting the camera , which only took a couple minutes . First , I tried to access the camera from my Macbook Pro . It is running Mac OS 10.7.5 , which meets the system requirements . I went to the website and created an account . I first tried Firefox and after logging in , I got the message `` We currently do not support your browser on MAC platform ... '' . So I tried updating Firefox to the latest version . Still got the message . So I followed the link to download the latest version of Safari . I did n't get much further . I could see my camera `` Loading ... '' in the background but the message in the foreground said `` Please Wait.. We are downloading the JAVA Applet . This may take a few minutes depending on your Network Speed . '' I left it overnight and it still had the same message . I checked my download speed and it is 32 Mbps . I 'm fairly certain the download issue is not due to my internet speed.On my iPhone 5 and iPad 2 , I had no problem downloading the app and connecting to the camera but I was disappointed again . We have a regular video monitor and in comparison , the picture quality was terrible . It constantly looked out of focus , there was a delay in the feed and usually very choppy . I could take pictures but when I tried to record a video , I got the message `` Not supported . Video recording is not supported , coming soon . `` I am giving the product 2 stars because the two way speaker feature did work well . My husband and I could hear each other clearly . The camera did take pictures and I appreciate the temperature feature although I 'm not sure how accurate it is since our thermostat showed that the room was at 72 degrees and the camera showed 68 degrees . But in terms of what we were looking for , it just did not deliver .	-1
Originally , we purchased the Motorola Digital 3.5 '' Video Baby Monitor - MBP36 . But , we returned it and got the Blink 1 monitor because we were excited about the ability to view the baby from remote locations . However , this monitor was a huge disappointment.First , while the monitor packaging claims that it can connect with other cameras , when I called Motorola , they did n't have additional cameras that could connect to the system at this time . I guess you 'd have to buy an entirely different system at full price , instead of spending an extra $ 50- $ 100 for an additional camera like the other Motorola monitor systems.As for the function of the Blink 1 Monitor system itself : The sound is delayed by at least 30 seconds and sometimes up to a minute . The video is real time , just the sound is delayed.There is a constant static sound in the background . You have to turn your phone volume all the way up to hear the baby , but the static covers up most of the sound the baby makes anyway . No quiet evenings when this monitor is on ! The sound would cut in and out 10-20 times each minute , also making it difficult to hear what was going on in the baby 's room.If you get a phone call or open certain apps on your phone , the monitor app will turn off and not alert you . This is particularly worrisome at night , because we woke up the next morning realizing that our monitor had turned off sometime in the middle of the night . When I spoke with Motorola about this , they said that is just how the app works and there is nothing they can do about it.The picture is low quality , and there is no noticeable difference between the high and regular quality settings.We were unable to view the baby unless we were on the same network as the monitor , so it did not work remotely . I also had a difficult time trying to set up the remote viewing online , and was unable to ever get it working.I called Motorola to share my concerns and spent 30 minutes or more trouble shooting my problems before they offered to mail us a replacement . After waiting a week with no monitor , the new one came in the mail ( an ugly red color , instead of the black one we originally purchased ) . The new monitor was slightly better in the trouble areas mentioned above , but in no way made me feel like it was a safe , reliable monitor ( there was still static in the sound , and the sound still cut out multiple times a minute ) . Now we have to deal with the hassle of returning both monitors . Do n't waste your time or money on this one .	-1
We have a comparably priced Summer Infant video monitor , but we have had to purchase a second remote device ( the hand-held device with the screen ) because the remote has been dropped so much . When the opportunity to try this one came up , I jumped on the idea ! We have our iPhones and iPads handy almost all the time , so it sounded ideal ... Not so much.Summary : Setup was easy . Video is lack-luster , sound is meh and crackly . The internet aspect slows things down from the moment you try to log on . Quality and user experience are severely limited by the Internet involvement.Setup : Software : App install was quick and easy.Camera : Set up was annoying but not terrible . You have to make an account on their server , even if you only want to stream within your own house . And then you have to configure the camera for your network ( which involves the camera starting its own default network , you joining that network with your phone , configuring the camera to join your network then switching back to your network with your phone ) . That went well and the instructions were very clear.Login : I find it takes forever for the app to log me in . It 's annoying and unnecessary . It also means that you can not run it exclusively locally even if you want to . If you lose internet , you probably lose the baby monitor . ( I did not test this , personally . ) Video : The video quality on this camera is poorer than the Summer Infant one . The night vision works , but it makes the room and crib look hazy , like a dark , smokey bar . ( Summer Infant 's makes it look like surveillance tape , but it 's clearer and easier to discern what 's what . ) Both cameras use infrared LEDs for night vision.During the day , it 's ok , but still not as clear as the Summer Infant camera.The picture looked much better on the phones than the tablets - the resolution is n't there for larger images . The zoom is digital , so it 's not actually useful ( same pixels , just larger ! ) . Switching between high and low quality made no visible difference.Sound : I could not get rid of the crackly static noise from the camera . I tried different rooms , different angles ... Also , I could not get the push-to-talk to work.There is a slight delay - maybe 2 beats - in sound and video.Controls : There 's definitely a delay between pressing the button to move the camera and the camera moving.Loss of connection : If the camera loses connection , the device you 're monitoring on will beep . Loudly . It 's a nice beep - like an industrial elevator beep - but still quite loud . Just what you do n't want to hear in the middle of the night , right ? We did try connecting from offsite and that was easy if also slow . Video was very clunky at that point.Plus it 's expensive.The room temperature display is kind of neat , but not nearly enough to make up for the short-comings.Conclusion : There are more tests we could have done but this small amount of testing turned up enough clunkiness that we decided this was n't for us .	-1
I was really excited to try out this product . Set up seemed easy enough . So then we installed the `` Baby Cam '' app on my iPhone 4 and waited . And waited . And waited . Finally it connects and we see baby on the screen . Well sort of . There was a blob in the middle that was baby , but had I not known what I was looking at it would be very hard to guess . Loved the idea of this product , but video quality is very poor . The wireless has repeated connectivity issues . Nice idea , but unfortunately the flaws make this an unreliable product and considering it is intended to keep an eye on precious little ones , I just ca n't recommend it .	-1
Updated Review : Well , this thing has turned into a brick after doing a firmware update . It will reset itself , but it will only hold a connection via my ipad/iphone app for a minute or so then lock up , and then say its busy . While doing this , it will basically take down your wireless network . So yes , I threw it back in the box . At this point , I do not recommend.OLD REVIEW : First and foremost , Amazon shipped fast , arrived in good shape , good job again Amazon . The Motorola Blink1 Wi-Fi video camera is a great option for those who are expecting a newborn in the near future . I have older kids now , so my reason of snagging one of these was to monitor my wife and her misadventures while I am away on business ( I kid I kid ) . I set this up in my kitchen to keep an eye on my pets when we are out of the house , as well as maybe catch a burglar and alert the police . Setup is pretty easy , just hold reset till beep , download app , install software , sign up , and your good to go . The camera has some cool options like pan and tilt and listen and talk ( you can scare some folks.. heheh ) . A temperature reading is also good just in case you are conscious about your home heat/cooling bill . Daylight visibility is pretty good . Nightime camera visibility is ok ( then again , its a cheap night time camera , this is no $ 5k surveillance camera ) .I am pretty impressed with this setup . A few bugs and hiccups here and there , and some better software improvements might knock this review to a 5 star . Overall , I recommend .	-1
UPDATE : This cam is actually a Wanscam JW0004 Wifi Baby Monitor . I 'm looking for the original firmware and am planning to wipe the Motorola version clean and get it back to a stock Wanscam . It may actually turn out useful if I can get rid of the crappy software on it now , and get it running as it was originally intended . Interesting how it only costs 55 bucks as opposed to two-fifty for this iteration . 50 bucks is about right for this cam.And now back to the original review ... ..I really wanted to like this cam . But the price is just far too high to justify the seriously hampered functionality . If you 're a tech challenged customer , then you might be drawn to the innocuous setup , compared to a Foscam FI8910W , which requires minimal IP knowledge . I get it - parents are busy enough , and do n't necessarily want to learn basic IP config . However , my setup of this Motorola was n't exactly problem free , and if you can handle following a couple paragraphs of instructions , then Foscam will deliver far more than this Motorola ever could. > Incompatible With Latest Java on PCMotorola has all kinds of warnings on their website saying this cam is NOT compatible with the latest version of Java . Motorola 's solution ? Downgrade to an older version of Java , just so this crappy little cam can work . Personally , I do n't think it 's worth the trade-off . Java usually only updates their platform when there 's a security vulnerability . So downgrading to a less secure version of Java just so I can use this cam , is NOT an acceptable solution . Get your act together Motorola . It 's your job to get this stuff working with the software that you selected to use it with . You did n't have to pick a Java interface , but you did , so make it play nice with Java , or scrap it , and come up with an alternative . *Note* - If I open a web browser and type in this cam 's IP address , I can access it directly and control the Pan & Tilt . It just does n't seem to work with Motorola 's online software for some reason. > Wonky Setup on AndroidI downloaded Motorola 's Android app , and setup was hardly quick and easy . The setup kept failing and I had to run it about 6 times before it finally worked . The process was very slow , buggy , and took 45 minutes of tinkering . Hardly user friendly for someone looking for a quick and easy setup . And I know what I 'm doing ( I can get a Foscam working within 5min out of the box . ) The process is sorely lacking in a manual setup option , and the automated one barely works . Advanced users are shackled to a buggy automated setup , and the tech challenged would certainly be lost in the quagmire , so who is benefiting from the `` convenience '' here ? > Limited FunctionalityI do n't really get the concept of a `` baby '' cam . Since when do parents ONLY want to keep an eye on their children when they 're toddlers ? What parents really need is an affordable security system . With multiple cameras and the ability to record and playback footage , just like a DVR . Yes , you want to watch your baby . But when they 're old enough to crawl into another room , do n't you want to keep an eye on that too ? Maybe check in on them , and the babysitter , when you go enjoy dinner on a rare night out ? Or make sure your teenage kids are n't at home cutting school while you 're at work . Or if one of life 's little accidents happen , would n't it be nice to check the security footage and see exactly what happened ? All this IS possible with Foscam , and NOT even remotely possible with this Motorola in its current form. > Small AntennaYou 're not getting very far from your router with this thing . And the antenna ca n't be upgraded , so that 's that. > No Network PortJust because something can be wireless , does n't mean it always should be . I have a lot of WiFi cams on our security setup , however , I always run a network cable to the cams whenever possible . Fact is , wired is just more reliable than wireless . So when possible , run a wire , and save the wireless for situations where it 's the only option . It 'll reduce the radio frequencies swarming around your environment , and the devices that are hooked up wirelessly , will work better as a result. > Poor Image QualityThe resolution just is n't there , no matter if I use standard or HQ settings . This Motorola looks more like a cheap webcam than an expensive WiFi baby monitor. > Pan & Tilt Is ResponsiveGood news here - the pan and tilt functions are snappy and responsive . And the digital zoom is ok. > LullabiesNice feature that works well . But the volume is quite low . Do n't recall seeing an adjustment for it. > Local and Remote ViewingLocal viewing means you 're NOT accessing the cam through the internet . Which is a good thing , because that means you can watch the cam all day long at home , and not rack up any extra data charges . When you 're away from home , you can remotely check in on the cam for up to 5 minutes at a time . Then you have to reload the video stream . They do this so people are cognizant of how much data they may be using on their cell phones or work computers . It 's a good thing. > Night Vision - it 's ok. > Audio - it 's ok too . > Compact - Foscam is larger , but does more. > Limited Mounting Options - either place this Motorola on a desk or shelf , or hang it from the one screw hole on the back . Problem is , cameras like this need to be hung upside-down , not sideways on a wall . Why ? Because all your images will be skewed and off kilter if you hang this on a wall . I call it `` Batman Supervillan Angles '' cuz on the old TV show , the bad guys were always shown with tilted angles , cuz they 're 'crooked ' crooks . Not a good thing for a baby cam.Bottom Line - this cam costs far too much and does far too little . And what little it can do , it does n't do very well . Just not worth the cost or trouble to setup . Not to beat the drum here , but again go with Foscam if you at all want anything decent . No I do n't work for them , they just make really good stuff and i know that cuz I 've tried a lot of security cams . As it is , this Motorola needs some serious upgrades , and the price should be cut by half , at least . Avoid , IMO . Good luck !	-1
I had high hopes for this wi fi monitor since I really like their regular monitor but unfortunately , the setup was kind of awkward and I was never able to get it to connect to my wi fi so back it goes : (	-1
Already having a set of the Motorola baby monitors , I was excited to get this one to add to the set so that I could watch via the internet as well . I saw it advertised iPhone and Android so I went over both the Amazon page AND the box and sure enough , it very clearly said it was PC compatible as well . So imagine my frustration after downloading and installing multiple software items , reading the entire manual , and basically spending a couple hours of my life trying to troubleshoot WHY I could n't get it to work . Only to find on some obscure help page online that you HAVE to activate it with iPhone or Android AND YOU CAN NOT ACTIVATE IT WITH YOUR COMPUTER ! I obviously thought I had n't read the box properly so I looked again , only to see that they did indeed say that it was viewable via Android , iPhone or PC . Not quite true , now , is it ? Having neither of these , only a Blackberry , I basically wasted hours of my life trying to mess around with the thing . I have no problem with it just being Android or iPhone , but when it 's not advertised as such there is a serious problem , especially such a high-priced item . I mean really , how hard is it to create an application for the PC ? So this is a heads up for those of you who are like me and want the computer side of the camera alone . Obviously I ca n't review the rest of it because I ca n't use it ! But the original baby monitor set was awesome so this was a huge disappointment to me .	-1
I own this product and have extensive working knowledge of the Foscam 8910w . That is the comparison I intend to make.The Foscam and the Motorola Blink have almost exactly the same feature set . Except for the following : - Blink allows for digital zoom . If you do n't know , `` digital '' zoom universally sucks . Its not the zoom you think it is . You want `` analog '' zoom , which none of the products in this category provide . I see digitial zoom as a non-feature . No one will want it . Your resolution reduces inversely to the amount you zoom . In other words , you do n't increase the amount of information you are viewing . You simply pixilate and otherwise destroy the image in cropping out the edges and making the interior pixels larger.- Blink allows for room temperature display . This is cool , and is one of two features that are both DISTINCT and USEFUL over the Foscam product.- The second DISTINCT and USEFUL feature of the Blink is the lullaby feature . I have an old ipod and speakers for my baby 's room , so I do n't need the lullabye feature . But for some folks out there , I 'm sure that feature alone is worth the price of admission.That 's it , the rest of the feature set is mirrored in the Foscam.Ok , so you 're still reading ? Here 's the payoff . This product costs $ 250 . Wow . Just WOW . The Foscam product is routinely found for $ 65- $ 85 . That 's a savings of $ 165- $ 185 . I own 3 of them , and can attest that the Foscam 8910 is NOT superior to the BLINK ... but simply matches it 99 % feature for feature ( no temperature readings , no lullabyes ) and then absolutely blows it away on price.I 'll update my review if my Blink grows wings and learns to make me coffee ... or if one of my Foscam 's bursts into flames and burns down my house .	-1

Now let 's look at how the camera works . From what I can gather , it goes like this : Rather than configuring your router to allow you to stream data directly from the device , your camera sends all of its a information to their central server . You then connect to their server using the account you set up ( above ) and stream the data from them . OK , I can see how this makes set up much easier for the average person , but I 'm not very comfortable about the fact that there is a live stream of data going to a central server somewhere that has all kinds of automatically gathered data associated with it . Remember when they said they automatically store `` certain information like IP address [ and ] cookies '' ? Well , other easily obtained information can include a your physical location . OK , not your exact address , but your city is usually pretty easily obtainable . So now if they get hacked , you are sharing a live video stream of something in your house and a general idea of where you live . But wait -- it gets better . From what I can tell , you set the camera 's WiFi access from their site . That means you give the SSID and password and they send it to the camera . I can only assume that the camera has built in cell access for the initial set up and then uses WiFi only after that ( and it would make sense since it is a Motorola product ) .So let 's recap ... 1 ) In order to use the product , you have to provide > > a ) your name and email address . You must use an accurate email and you must keep it up to date > > b ) your SSID and wireless password2 ) Any information you provide to them becomes theirs forever and they can do whatever they want with it3 ) They can share whatever they want with whomever they feel they `` need '' to share it with ( though you could `` need '' to share anything for one reason or another ... like I `` need '' to share your information with this advertising group so that I can make more money ) 4 ) You are streaming live video of things in your home to their central servers5 ) While they claim they will secure your data , they ca n't make any guarantees.BUT WAIT -- THERE 'S MORE ! Also at the time of this review , the most recent version of the Java VM wo n't work with their program ( version 7 , update 21 ) . You have to uninstall that version and install an older version to get it to work . Now I 'm not sure what the specific changes between update 17 ( the one they recommend ) and update 21 , but usually these updates have to do with added security . So using this product on your computer means you have to lower your security . Nice.I have n't used this product at all because I 'm not comfortable with the terms I have to agree to in order to use it . I do not intend to use it.To fix these problems , this is what I want to see:1 ) Allow an option to stream data directly from my device . Yes , I realize I 'll need to set up some port forwarding and create a dynamic DNS entry , but that 's what I did with my security system and it really was n't that bad.2 ) Do n't require me to register with your site if I stream directly from the device . There would be no need and so I do n't want to share this information with you.3 ) Get rid of the cell communication ( if that 's what you have ) and provide an interface for me to interact directly with the camera so that I can set up the WiFi . This could be by means of a USB or other hard-wired interface , OR even better ... BONUS4 ) Provide a dedicated monitor so that I do n't have to download any apps to my phone or turn on the computer to view the baby . If the monitor had a keyboard , I could use it to set up the WiFi , as well.The product looks like it would work great , but I 'm not comfortable using it the way things stand.NOT RECOMMENDED	-1
This tub toy is just ok . There 's nothing especially fun about this turtle . Look around for something more fun before you buy this tub toy .	-1
I bought these hoping my son would want to use them often because of the fun monster theme . That plan backfired as he does n't seem to care lol . As far as functionality these are terrible really . The fork does n't pick up food at all , I ca n't even get food if I stab it so he definitely ca n't ! The spoon works because obviously how can it not ? But it 's kind of a smaller area than other toddler spoons so it limits the amount of food that can be picked up . Both utensils are a slick sort of plastic , that makes it even harder for already struggling toddlers to keep food on them .	-1
It 's not that great and does not hold a lot of food . Perfect for a newborn but not for 13 month old and up . The scoop for the spoon is not deep enough .	-1
ok we love avent products.However , if you are pumping breast milk this bottle is not for you . We have learned it hard way . My milk is very fat , so it has to be warmed up ( we use Avent bottle warmer ) and after being warmed up it leakes from the rim . I cried after loosing 2 oz of breast milk do to the leak . it does not seem much but when you pump and do n't have milk pooring like water it is very hard to loose 2 oz of breast milk . We have tried to screw it little lighter or harder nothing works . We have tried it with water to see where it leakes and it looks like if you just tilt it , bottle will not leak but after applying pressure to the nipple bottle will start to leak from the rim . We really like the design and really like to use glass bottles but lt looks like Philips needs to work on Avent glass bottles a little more .	-1
I bought these because they are glass - easy to stick in the dishwasher , no chemicals leaching out when warming them . The problem is that they almost always leak . I take the whole thing apart to clean and am careful that the nipple is perfectly where it us supposed to be when I put them back together . I am careful to screw the lid on just riight . No matter what I do they seem to leak . I have one plastic avent bottle in the diaper bag and do not seem to have as many problems despite havingidentical lid / nipple . Nevertheless since I need to buy more plastic bottles to take on hikes ( because they are so.much lighter in weight ) I am going tonget Nuk . I have oneplastic and one glass Nuk and neither leaks . All my 15 glass Avent bottles leak.Update : do n't buy these ! Now my baby is teething . She hates these ! She was refusing to eat and then crying . Poor thing I was crying too ! But she would eat from the NUK bottles . So we bought a bunch of plastic NUK at target and I just ordered glass ones on amazon with expedited shipping . Costing me a fortune but wothr it !	-1
Did n't work for us . Bought 5 of these before the baby was born . Tried all of them for a few months and gave up . The bottle leak from under the white plastic . Nothing you can do to stop that . Have n't found a bottle brand yet that did n't leak . Will keep searching : (	-1
My newborn was choking on milk with these and the milk would become frothy due to the venting system and sit right in the nipple which made her drink aerated milk causing major gas . Switched to Dr. Browns and have had no more problems ... . the Dr. Brown 's stage one nipple is also slower .	-1
The fact that the bottle is glass was definitely nice , however the nipple is shaped super weird . I did n't realize it til I tried to put it in my baby 's mouth and her lips had nothing to really latch onto . Decent bottles , but I would n't recommend them .	-1
I was so excited when i ordered this avent glass bottle . i love avent but im trying to veer away from plastic bottles . But this glass bottle is very heavy . And when my daughter accidentally dropped it . It shattered to many pieces ... . So dangerous . I will not recommend this to anyone .	-1
After seeing a short video in the hospital on the newborn channel after delivery which highlighted this product , we bought two . After receiving them , my wife swaddled up our little baby and then watched to see what he would do . In less than a minute , he had the arm flaps pulled up over his face and he was gagging . We immediately returned both and replaced them with simple muslin sheets that are much more effective for swaddling ( not to mention less expensive ) and if he gets one over his face they are breathable so there is no issue.May this be a warning to other parents , this product seems like a good idea but it is potentially dangerous for active babies that like to move their arms a lot and is not nearly as good as simple breathable swaddling blankets . Parents be warned !	-1
Maybe mine was defective but my child unraveled it due to the loose velcro . Seems like a dangerous suffocation hazard . I returned it after one use .	-1
Not for a young infant ( 13-15lbs ) . The swaddle option did n't work , maybe when he gets bigger ?	-1
Maybe its just me , or maybe I got a faulty crib but I hard the hardest time putting this thing together . The rails just did n't want to lock . I like the storage compartments but to me its not useful if it takes 20 minutes to setup so this is being returned and I 'm going to keep the travel lite graco crib that I got instead . Its easy and lite and will last longer than this one since you can remove the bassinet and put at the bottom just like a crib .	-1
After the first few weeks of washing , the bag is completely deformed . The waterproof fabric and the stretchy outer fabric have shrunken unevenly and the bag has lost its shape . Plus the plastic at the seams has been breaking off and turning up in the laundry . I would expect so much more from this expensive brand .	-1
It is n't worth buying at the moment . The company has redesigned these bags and are releasing them soon but the version I have is TERRIBLE ! After one wash something ( not sure which part of the fabric ) started sticking together ... after a few washes it could only hold a few diapers . Plus , I do n't like the way it holds onto the ring inside the Ubbi pail , it does n't stay put .	-1
Same issue as the first reviewer that after a handful of washes , the liner sticks to itself . I will also contact Ubbi customer service to see if they have other issues with this pail liner .	-1
This towel is very cute , and my 2 year old loves to wear it , and it fits her well . However , after washing it just once before she used it , the towel developed lots of little pulls and snags and looks worn out and shabby already .	-1
Once you put an nice pack in it , there is barely room for a bottle . Many other reviews said two bottles could fit , only if they are narrow , not wide bottles . This is not a very practical size for bottle storage .	-1
I ordered this because we had a diaper cover in the same print and I thought it was really cute , but clearly I was n't thinking , because this thin strip of fabric is n't large enough to even show enough of the design , so it 's really blah , and then after wearing it two or three times , it broke , because that tiny little ribbon ca n't be securely sewn to the fabric . Sigh . Our two ulubulu pacifier clips have held up for months , and my son wears them every day . Skip this , because even though you think it 's cute , it 's just going to be that much sadder when it breaks .	-1
My daughter pulled on it once ( when she was less than 3 moths old ) and it ripped , not worth the buy .	-1
I bought 4 of these just a couple of months ago and only one of them is still functioning . The loop that holds the pacifier on broke in about 5 seconds on one of them ... literally . That is not an exaggeration . I clipped it to my daughter and she pulled on it and it broke right off immediately . One has a clip that completely rusted over . One clip does n't stay clipped anymore . Finally , the last one I have left is slightly rusted and the clip does n't hold as firmly as it did . It wo n't last much longer.Do yourself a favor and buy a more expensive clip . I was tempted by the low price and hoping to save money , but in the end I spent more . There is a reason why these are only $ 3 . They are a complete waste of money.The Booginhead brand works really well . I suggest them . They are more like $ 10- $ 15 but the ones we have now are still in excellent condition . We have one that is over a year old and still looks new and performs the same way it did when it was first purchased .	-1
the metal holder sticks out too far and could poke a baby in the eye and the string to hold the bink is very flimsy	-1
The fabric print is cute but the loop to attach the pacifier is flimsy ribbon , not cording like other clips I have . The metal clip is fine and works but is not finished as nicely as other pacifier clips I have purchased.Not a good value compared to other clips I have purchased on Amazon .	-1
This pacifier clip is the worst I have ever purchased . It is cheaply made and broke after just a couple of days . The underside of the metal part of the clip also has sharp corners that i worried my son might get scraped on . I would not buy this again ! ! !	-1
These were great when they first arrived - they had a nice , tight grip and help tight to my son 's clothing . After a couple of months the closure mechanism got loose and they are now easily removed . I have other brands that have lasted much longer than these . Wo n't buy these again .	-1
I 'm returning this because it 's a cheap-o . The shelfs , besides the very bottom one , do n't have a hard base , so they just sag and distort the whole thing . Do n't get it .	-1
The tubes work ok , but they come out really easily at both ends , so I have to be really careful not to bump them . I tried reversing them ( switching the bottle connector into the pump port and vice versa ) , but that does n't really stay in well either .	-1
It 's really unfortunate that one of the tubes broke after a couple of uses . The adapter that you insert into the pump for suction fractured and will not all for optimal suction , therefore the pump is n't able to do its job . I 'm having to purchase another set of tubing .	-1
I bought this with the hopes that it would be great but sadly it did not live up to my expectations . You can only set it for up to 8 hours which means it will wake your baby up if they are still sleeping after 8 hours . Something most parents do n't want ! Never wake a sleeping baby right ? ! ? ! Also , I thought the music selection was horrible and did not sound very soothing . The little mobile pieces kept falling off too . The only think I did like about this product was the light feature . Its a great idea in theory but the actual product was not so great .	-1
Out of the box , I was irritated that this did n't fit my crib properly . My crib bar is too wide at the top . You need a narrow crib bar at the top for it to fit properly . So mine is jammed on . It stays in place and is difficult to pull off ... but still . Not so great in my eyes.I got this for my twins when they were about one month old . I was drawn to the idea of the projector helping them sleep because the one I got for my one-year old turned out to be a life saver . My twins cry when I put them in the crib . If they 're asleep and I get them down , they last for 5 minutes . I have also had no success getting them to sleep in swings , bouncers.. etc . They do sleep in the boppy pillows on the sofa ... Or on my chest.. but I really need an overnight solution.Anyway.. this machine wakes my kids up . And if they were sleeping and wake up , it goes off and they start screaming . My one-year old shares the room and it wakes him up too . All of the crying is a bit overwhelming . I was really upset by the outcome given the price.Never say never though . It did n't work for us , but it might work for you . Ever child sleeps differently . My one-year old was a champ in the crib at this age .	-1
Died almost immediately after I put it into the Snuza Go . I 'm having the hardest time finding a battery that will last in the Snuza -- and if a Snuza battery wo n't do the job , I do n't know what will !	-1
Original Snuza battery lasted 2 months and this replacement lasted 2 weeks . However , it would appear our Snuza Halo began drawing down batteries much more rapidly as it approached 6 months old based on the fact that we replaced this replacement Snuza batter with an FDK which only lasted 2 days . History is the original Snuza lasted 2 months , the first FDK bought at Batteries Plus lasted just shy of 2 months , the next FDK bought on Amazon and advertised as a Sanyo lasted a few weeks , this Snuza replacement lasted 2 weeks , and a replacement FDK sent free when I complained by the Amazon seller that advertised a Sanyo but sent me the aforementioned FDK lasted one weekend . After this we stopped using the Snuza Halo . Having said that , the Snuza Halo gave us great piece of mind for the first 6 months after the release of our premature baby who spend the first 3 months of his life in NICU at Children 's Hospital . So both my wife and I agree we would recommend the Snuza Halo even at the $ 100 plus price despite it apparently having a battery draw issue after 6 months . It would be nice if the maker of Snuza Halo chose a standard battery size . There is a Rayovcac CR lithium 3 volt battery 2 pack sold for under $ 10 at Walmart in the camera section which if we were still using the Snuza Halo monitor I would have bought to see if it worked . The length of the battery was almost identical and the ends were similar but not exact matches . I came really close to buying them but our baby had pretty much outgrown his prematurity issues ( he used to reflux and stop breathing ) so we decided to call it quits on the Snuza slightly earlier than we would have otherwise .	-1
It was dead on arrival . So maybe not the batteries fault ... but just beware . Sucks to have to return it and wait .	-1
We 've owned several of the previous model that nearly the same except for the objects on the mobile and the inclusion , on this model , of the lights . Do n't get too excited about the lights . If you 're trying to get your baby to sleep , they 're much too bright . About the sounds ... you could n't have chosen a more annoying selection of musical tunes . 99 % of the music is so irritating and upbeat there 's no way they 'll get your baby to relax . Hassling . The only usable sounds are the two ( yes , only 2 ) nature sounds ... birds ... crickets/owl . The rest are guaranteed to keep your baby awake . They 're OK if it 's not sleep time , but typically we put our boy in the swing to chill out , not to get ramped up . Also , the swing makes a constant knocking noise which is very annoying . The mobile 's motor is also noisy . Cheap motors all around . Think about it . If you can replace this motor with the tiny little motor of a $ 10 air freshener , how great a piece of equipment can this be ? We had 3 of the previous model ... the motors all burned out . FP is very good with returns and warranty replacements , but it 's still a hassle . I 'd rather have one that works for more than a few months that has no warranty , than one that constantly drops dead with a great warranty . Why ca n't somebody put together a HIGH-QUALITY baby swing with decent a weight limit with a strong , quality motor ? Oh , before I forget . There is a padded insert for smaller babies . With this insert , it 's comfortable . Take it out when your baby is larger , and you have a pretty uncomfortable , hard seat with minimal padding . You can actually feel the hard plastic edges of the seat through the cheap cover that contains so little padding it 's ridiculous . If you were going to design a swing for INFANTS , would n't you do whatever possible to make the thing comfortable ? 20 cents worth of foam would do it . They cheaped out by stuffing the cover with so little that except for the very exterior ( that looks nice and fluffy in the photo ) , the inside is not much thicker than a pillow case . So we kept the insert in for our 7 month old . If he 's swaddled , we ca n't snap both latches because the straps are too short . All in all ... a good LOOKING swing that 's simply not worth the money from a company with good customer service , but a `` let 's cheap out '' manufacturing mindset . We 'll likely return before the motor burns out ... which , by the sound of it , will likely be soon . P.S . Everyone here whose reviews say they `` Love , love , love it '' ... will -- I assure you -- be editing their happy reviews when theirs drops dead in a few months .	-1
I originally owned the my little lamb swing with batteries , which worked well . With my second child I wanted to upgrade to the model that plugs into an outlet because I was sick of changing the batteries . The platinum edition cradle n ' swing is very noisy and turns into almost a game with my husband and I of who can position it just right so that it makes the least amount of noise . It becomes quite frustrating when the thing you are using to get your baby to sleep makes so much noise that it wakes the baby up . It seems like this thing is cheaply made and the swinging motion causes it to creak . Adjusting the legs around , pushing down on the motor part and other random tricks seem to make it quiet temporarily . For the price , I would expect it to work better .	-1
I did n't like these . I ca n't be certain but I 'm pretty sure my output dropped as soon as I switched to these .	-1
I guess if you are n't sleep deprived , and stressed because no one local sells valves or replacement tubing for your breast pump , you could read the description carefully enough to see these are not genuine replacement parts.I am an IBCLC , and I done want to risk my supply if these do n't perform . As a part time pumper , I need my pump to function correctly , or risk not only my stash of milk , but my supply in general.Now , I have to return these , and still not have a replacement . Ugh . I would have paid the extra three dollars to not have to worry ! ! ! !	-1
These valves work just fine on the Medela pump . However , the shape is slightly different from the original valves . Normally , a slight shape change would not bother me but it is soooo much harder to remove the valve from the other piece ! It sounds silly but I have a hard time gripping this valve to pull it off and spend more time than necessary removing it . I am not a fan of this product but , like I said , it does works with the Medela .	-1
They leak.. a lot ! I tried so bad for this to work out for me since I have been pumping x 6 months and thought maybe these would be better than the medela shields . When removing from breast the milk tend to pool on bottom and leak out ( not good ! ) .I am returning them ( at least they accept returns ! )	-1
These did n't work at all for me . I tried multiple sizes . It was just a huge waste of money . It was n't any easier than without the darn flanges , and I certainly did n't get any more milk . I pump 2-3 times a day and it was just not helpful . It would have been more of a pain to clean the parts off . Maybe these work for some people , but not for me .	-1
I have the hygeia q and these do n't work with it . Had to sadly return . The quality of them seemed great though , the plastic was very thick and solid .	-1
I wanted these to work , but alas , they did not . I was able to fit them into my Dr Brown Simplisse pump 's softcups , but having already been used to the silicone softcups , these hard plastic cups were not for me . I also felt the holes were too large ( even on the smallest cup ) , and it sucked too much of my aureola into the pump . These cups were a last ditch effort to save my Dr Brown from going out the window ( love the pump , but hate how small the nipple holes are on the softcups ) , but it looks like I have to get another pump ( since the Dr Brown 's softcups only come in one size ) . Sadness .	-1
These seem like a great idea -- but they did n't work for me . I was still unable to find a size that would fit properly and no milk came out when I tried the different sizes .	-1
I 'll start by saying that I am a seasoned pumper ( on my second child ) with my Medela double electric pump . I 've also been trained on postpartum breastfeeding support as a doula . I ordered these because I liked the idea of increasing output and thought that if they were more comfortable so I could avoid the occasional pinch , then great . The positive reviews of a mommy blog I love pushed me to make the purchase.I woke this morning after baby slept through the night ( yay ) and after baby nursed only a little and I had some still very lumpy ducts , I was excited to try the flanges out . I expected a huge output ( I did n't even nurse at all on one side ) , and got next to nothing - exactly half of what I typically get in the same scenario with regular flanges . I was n't close to empty and had to stop because I hate pumping for too long - and these were not any more comfortable than the Medela flanges.Other problems : I use a PumpEase hands-free bra pumping bra ; the medium flanges were difficult to fit through the openings ... ca n't imagine trying the large.When I went to take the flanges out of the bra , milk came pouring down the flange in the wrong direction ! I feel like the ridges actually helped some milk escape . With my other flanges I would just lean forward before removing to prevent this , but that did n't seem to help in this case.Later , while nursing my son , I looked at how he was latched . I 'm not an engineer , but I breastfeed full-time . There may be the slightest angle , but for the most part , he latches straight-on . In the diagram on Pumpin Pals website , the & # 34 ; proper baby latch & # 34 ; reflects what I imagine a baby nursing with mother well-reclined or on her back looks like ( positions suggested to help discourage a strong let-down from inundating baby with TOO MUCH milk at once ) . I Googled unbiased diagrams , and lo-and-behold , the nipple goes straight back into the mouth - NOT at an extreme downward angle , and even bends upward in the back of the mouth in some diagrams ! I wanted to love this product and I am all for parent-invented products , but these did not help me , and upon closer inspection , it makes sense that they did not . I was going to give them a more neutral review until I discovered the biased diagrams . Good luck to the creators in their future endeavors , and I 'm happy for those that this apparently helped , but I would never recommend this product to anyone .	-1
Unfortunately these do n't work for me ... Ca n't get any milk with any of them . Have to keep using the medela medium phlanges again ... lots of people love these though . Also found these leading to the pump membrane deals falling off during pumping because the angle is different with these than the standard phlanges .	-1
I bought this set along with the hands free system and the little mesh bag thing . I exclusively pump for my child and was attracted to the reviewers who said this increased their breast milk supply.Sad to say I have not seen an increase . They will then tell you to finish pumping sessions with your original flanges until you get used to these . Again , no dice , but at least I did n't decrease in supply.I thought the plastic was more flexible , but it 's the same rigid plastic as my Medela flanges , which I did n't find all that uncomfortable really . I do not find this any more or less comfortable than my Medela flanges.One thing I really , really dislike is that milk easily drips out from the bottom of these flanges while pumping . I use hands free pumping bras- from homemade cutting holes in a bra to purchased and $ $ $ ) and they will always have wet spots on them at the bottom of the flanges . I do n't have this problem with my Medela flanges.Nipple comfort is a bit better , but nothing spectacular.The sizing is weird . The 3 sizes are Medium , Large , and XL . I am a 38 DDD and use 27 mm Medela flanges , but find the Medium ( aka smallest ) Pumpin Pal flanges work best for me . The middle size ( aka large ) is ok , but I tend to see a small decrease in output with that size . However , with the Medium , the exact same amount of nipple and areola are being pulled in as the Medela flange , so again , not seeing a huge difference.The shape , while advertised as allowing you to lean back and be more comfortable , really is n't much different from the Medelas . Stick them in some bottles side by side and you 'll see . The downward angle is visible a bit , but if I do n't lean forward slightly the milk does n't go down . This is not a suction issue , I use a Medela Symphony to pump . The one advantage to the shape that I have noticed is that I use my hands free bra to pump while driving and the slight difference is just enough to be more comfortable when you have a steering wheel in front of you.Overall it 's not a huge difference in comfort , output , or even shape from my Medela flanges , so I just use them as extra sets when the Medelas are dirty .	-1
Let 's start by saying I have a lot of trouble at the pump . I pump three times a day while at work and I only produce 3 ounces each time . That 's okay , but not enough to go without supplementation at day care . I 've tried everything , 4 different pumps , different flange sizes , all.the.things . I was really hoping this would be the cure all . It was n't . Not even close . I had to use the smallest size which is still too big ( fits like a standard Medela ) . I had zero output with these . I took them off and went back to my regular flange and had an immediate let down . I think that if you have small nipples , its best to pass on these . I 'm so glad they work beautifullly for some women and I 've heard they have excellent customer service but these just are n't for me .	-1
I bought these after hearing some pretty awesome reviews from other people . I tried them out , and ended up finding that the smallest one in the pack worked for me . It was really comfortable and took a lot of the soreness I had away ! However , after a week of using it , I realized that my milk supply was dwindling . It also took longer for me to pump with these . I have since gone back to using the flanges that came with my pump . My supply came back up . I 've completely stopped using them now . So much for comfort !	-1
I was excited about these after reading the reviews , but they did n't help me at all , neither with comfort nor increased output . first , note that if you use an ameda pump it only works with the smallest flanges . so if you do n't have those , it wo n't work . I have both a medela and a hospital grade ameda . I can see this working better with the medela as I think those flanges leave more to be desired than the ameda . I tried both the medium and larges . They both seemed to fit fine , but I was left with a horrible bruise . I was really looking forward to these , but sadly they did n't work .	-1
I tried these but never really got the hang of it . I went back to the flanges that come with the pump . I used those flanges and a pumping bra . I do n't think these were worth it . They ended up leaking and I lost precious breastmilk . Boo .	-1
maybe these do work for some women , but these were more painful than my regular flanges ... i 'm sending these back !	-1
Maybe it 's user error , but I could never get these to work well neither on their own or with the medela shields . I could n't get them to fit as inserts into the medela shields . On their own , it just was messy and awkward .	-1
I bought these Pumpin Pals after reading so many people boast about them , but after receiving them I figured out they were a huge waster of money for me . First , they did not connect properly to my breast pump and were always loose on the ends . Second , they actually hurt my nipple more than my regular flanges and it was the only time my nipples were left hurting was after using these . They come in three sizes , which I tried all three , but I did n't care for any of them .	-1
The theory behind this is brilliant but in practice it just does n't do the job . It 's not like with the angle , you can sit as you normally do . You still need to angle yourself a bit . The price is also way too high for something like this .	-1
I do n't think these are any more comfortable or efficient than the Medela flanges . In fact , I think they 're more awkward . I still ca n't sit comfortably while pumping and because of the angled shape of the flange , it does n't hold to my breast like the Medela flanges . Also , I 'm annoyed that it only comes with in packs of 3 sizes because I only use one size ( making the other two sets useless and a waste of money ) . Stick to the Medela flanges .	-1
These were less comfortable for me than regular Medela flanges . I could n't keep them from rubbing . They do move more tissue and thus get more milk than regular flanges alone , but if I use regular flanges and hand-express while pumping , I get just as much . The adjusted angle did n't make much difference for me .	-1
I was really excited to get these and start using them.. but I did n't find them anymore comfortable than the Medela flanges that came with my pump . I actually think it makes the whole flange/bottle combination annoyingly bulky . I did not see an increase in milk production as other reviewers had said they did . I was hopeful to fall in love with this product and get an increase in production but was not impressed .	-1
I returned these , they caused me a lot more pain then regular shields that came with my pump , these caused me a lot of clogged ducts . I guess they might work for some but not for me .	-1
