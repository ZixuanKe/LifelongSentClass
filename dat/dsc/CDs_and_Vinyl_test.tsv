I really love country music and Trace Adkins is a favorite . This CD is fantastic with many of my favorite songs on it . Highly recommend all Trace Adkins Cds .	1
Trace Adkins has one of those voices I like better each time I hear it . My favorite songs on this cd are `` You 're Gon na Miss This , '' `` I Left Something Turned on at Home , '' and `` Every Light in the House is on . ''	1
If you like Trace Adkins this double CD is for you ! All the songs are awesome ! I 'm new to Trace but I love his work !	1
I am a longtime fan of Andy Wood and of all the seattle music scene in general . Andy is in my top 3 Seattle musicians after Kurt Cobain and Chris Cornell .I loved all Andy 's music in Malfunkshun and Mother Love Bone , Mother Love Bone should of been a huge band and it is sad that he is only known because of his young death in music history and Pearljam forming after and the tribute album recorded by Chris Cornell and Pearl Jam Temple Of The Dog cause Andy was a gifted musician who did not live long enough to be one of the greatest singers and songwriters ever which he should of , he would of been up there with Nirvana Alice In Chains Soundgarden Screaming Trees and the other seattle greats.I recently learned about this movie being made and released and was so thrilled since it was a longtime coming and there was so much footage live and interviews with family and friends and Andy never aired before , there are some touching scenes with Andy 's mom and girlfriend which were moving , the music on the cd 's are great I love all the demos and unreleased songs and alternate takes of music , I have never heard any of these tracks before not even on bootlegs that i listened to years ago.I wish there was more solo Andy music acoustic and piano cause I read that he left lot 's of solo music songs behind . I would tell any fan of Seattle music from the 1980's-90 's or any Andy Wood fan to get this cd/dvd collection you will enjoy it as much as i did this is a priceless documentary on one of the most underated singers and muscians from the glory days of the Seattle music scene !	1
It 's unfortunate that , in order to make the CD and show itself more sellable , the powers-that-be felt the need to include the known celebrities of Tom Womat and Vanessa Williams and highlight them as performers in the cast when they sound to be the weakest links . The other cast members exhibit a high degree of technical ability as well as the flexibility of voice to express the inherent emotions effectively . I 'd like us to enter an era in which the most talented and appropriate talents are cast without regard to past fame and recognition of name .	1
Just to add to the comprehensive reviews here , perhaps from a different perspective : I 'm generally not the greatest fan of reviews and rehashes of earlier shows , often finding that the productions are outshone by their originals ( most of which , in the Sondheim field , I already have and enjoy ) . And so I really did not have high hopes for this recording/production , and really was n't looking greatly forward to it , to be frank . But , in a dearth of new recordings in the field , I got it.I must say , I was pleasantly surprised here . As others note , the production value is high , and the commentary , as brief as it is , interesting ( even for those well-versed in matters Sondheim ) . In fact , I have found my listening to the recording repeatedly , and even the Sondheim commentary is interesting and welcome after multiple listens.My recommendation : give it a go -- you may be in for a nice surprise .	1
The songs are obviosuly great to start out with , but so is the cast and so are the Michael Starobin orchestrations . Adding to all of this are the recorded Sondheim commentaries ( which dovetail nicely with some of the ones inFinishing the Hat : Collected Lyrics ( 1954-1981 ) with Attendant Comments , Principles , Heresies , Grudges , Whines and Anecdotes , by the way ) and the alternate versions of existing songs . Of particular interest among these are `` Forget War '' ( which , unlike George Abbott , I think is very hummable ) and `` The Wedding Is Off '' . Lastly , the medley/mash-up of `` Losing My Mind '' and `` Not A Day Goes By '' sung by Vanessa Williams and Barbara Cook is for the ages .	1
I 've been a Ben Folds fan since the beginning of his career , and I 've got to say that this release is by far his most `` different . '' I mean that in the best way possible . As most of you know , Nick Hornby wrote the lyrics this time around . I personally think Ben 's lyrics are just as good as Hornby 's , but if there 's anything a guest lyricist 's contribution did , it had Ben approach songwriting from a totally different perspective . I think Ben is a great songwriter in every single way , but he 's been doing it for 16 + years with the same formula . Having to write music around someone else 's words seems to have given Ben a reason to really perfect the music . He said it himself in recent reviews ; he felt like he had to live up to the quality of the lyrics being sent to him . You can tell extra attention was given to these songs , so that they could reflect exactly what Hornby was trying to get across . I 've got to say , it made Ben 's music sound fresher than it has in years ( and I do n't think he 's put out a bad one yet . ) This is , however , an album you need to pay a lot of attention to if you want to get the most out of it . Rockin the Suburbs has some great lyrics , but you do n't need to listen to the words to have fun with it . The songs are bouncy and catchy , which is something that ca n't be said as much about Lonely Avenue . The songs are n't quite as instantly catchy , but I would not put that against the `` quality '' of the songs at all . It 's just a bit more of a grower , mainly because you have to pay close attention to how the music plays off the words to really FEEL the album like you 're supposed to . Once it clicks , you 're going to find yourself lost in this record . It 's the most stylistic thing he 's done since Reinhold Messener , way back in 99'.I reviewed the normal version simply because I knew that this was going to be where most people would be reading a review , but I must tell you that the deluxe version is the definitive version . It comes with lots of pictures , short Hornby stories , full lyrics , all wrapped up in a little hard cover book , sized like a thick cd . It 's really a fun package , and its worth the extra money.This is just a well balanced , stylish , catchy , deep , and intelligent record that should please anyone who can respect this genre of music . This is probably a one-and-done collaboration , so I 've got to give it to Ben and Nick . This is a well earned five star review .	1
A lot of people only want to listen to Ben Folds if he 's playing piano in a trio -- bare bones . To each their own . Personally , I 'm ecstatic that , among Mr. Folds ' solo albums , we get 4 unique albums in Rockin ' The Suburbs , Songs For Silverman , Way To Normal , and now Lonely Avenue , which all share a common bond -- Folds impeccable talent to write a melody that slips its way into your head and does n't go away . In this regard Lonely Avenue takes a couple listens to get into -- as do all his albums ( chalking that up to `` album diversity '' as I like to call it ) . Not to be overlooked is Paul Buckmaster 's suberb work with the string arrangements . Fold crafts the catchy melody , and Buckmaster ties everything together with a bow on top.Horby 's lyrics are a natural fit for Folds ' style , as has been previously mentioned by other reviews of the album across the web . Fans of either artist should not hesitate to give Lonely Avenue a couple listens at the very least .	1
I think this cd stands above most of the rest issued by other country music artists recently . The music and production are first-rate and I particularly like the rock/rockabilly and blues influences on some of the songs . Country Boy Rock & Roll and Hummingbyrd are AMAZING - Kenny Vaughan is a guitar-playing monster talent ! ! My other recommendations include Branded , Bridge Washed Out and Ghost Train Four-oh-Ten.The slow songs are great and very beautiful , but I do n't like slow songs ( ballads ) very much , hence the 4 star rating instead of 5 stars . I apologize , that 's what happens when a converted rocker writes a country music cd review - - we like our songs fast and kinda wild ! Much like Dwight Yoakam , Marty Stuart has always been able to incorporate influences from other genres while remaining a traditionalist of the first order . Overall , Marty and his band members have created a standard-setting cd with many songs I will play over and over ! Ca n't wait to see the guys perform them live !	1
Holly Crap . What do we have here ? A real , genuine , almost extinct , country music album . I did n't think anyone made albums like this anymore . You need to buy this because ai n't no one making stuff like this in Nashville anymore . Your chance to make a contribution to someone making real , genuine music -- and prvide him with encouragement , and funds , to do so again in the future . Absolutely amazing ! This guy is fast becoming a national treasure . When him and Springsteen and B.B . King come to the end of the trail , the last keepers of real genuine meaningful music are going to leave a void in this country . Just a step away right now from music becoming a product with no more value or usefullness than a bag of Fritos .	1
I just got this CD today and have listened to it ALL DAY LONG ! Marty has always been a big favorite of mine and the band I used to play lead guitar in opened two shows for him back in 2008 in Hiawassee , GA. A few months before that , I saw him in concert and then had a dream about opening a show for him and God allowed that dream to come true ! ! Anyway ... onto the CD ... .There 's not really much I can say but ... .GET IT CUZ IT 'S GOOD ! ! !	1
There are great songs here : Teutonic Terror and especially the Abyss are worth the price of this cd alone . But overall I have had mixed feelings about this release . I gave it four stars ( instead of the 3 and 1/2 the content deserves ) out of the `` benefit of a doubt '' factor . I have been a huge Accept fan for most of my life , so there 's some sentimentality in there as well.I have wavered back and forth in my opinion so often because much of this album we 've heard before ( and better ) in the 80s . There are so many of the same song structures and suspiciously familiar riffs on this album that my first four listens made me feel anxious for it to end . The situation has n't improved since . So much of this is safe and obvious , to a numbing extent . I mean , I can understand that bands that are staging a comeback tend to want to give their fans what they want , which is inevitably the familiar . Besides the two aforementioned tracks , the songwriting itself on this album is at best just above average ; the overall quality of each track does n't warrant the length of the cd at all.The upside ? Mark Tornillo has legitimately replaced Udo Dirkschneider , as incredible as it seems . He shares some stylistic similarities to Udo while bringing his own personal , fascinating quirks . He 's perfect for this . Wolf Hoffman plays fantastically well , even better than usual considering he 's known as a great guitarist to begin with . The production is pretty typical in that over-digitized way that people other than myself ca n't seem to get enough of , and the drums are right up there with the killer 80s Accept drum soundSo , well worth buying both for the two awesome tracks , and to help fund another ( hopefully more adventurous ) album .	1
What do you get when you mix New Wave British Metal with German march choruses , sprinkle in a little Thrash and even a little early 80 's Glam Metal ? You get the best metal album in the last 10 years to hit the Metal scene . There 's no let up on this album . From the double bass drums thumping of the opening cut , `` Beat the Bastards '' to the last cut , `` Bucket Full of Hate '' , with its thundering medieval sounding choruses , you 'll be `` white knuckling '' it all the way . This album is blistering from beginning to end in the old style of classic metal . Also , do n't let the cliche sounding titles deceive you . These are very well written songs that appear to be directed at an older more mature crowd who have experienced a little in the modern world . `` Blood of Nations '' itself is a patriotic song .	1
When they made this a pick of the week , I sat up and took notice , especially then of the hugely positive reviews.So I put it on my Christmas list , and Santa was listening ( well , now he 's deaf , I guess ! ) .The new fellow is kinda like Arnel Pineda : he echoes the original singer well enough to make things work comfortably , but has enough of his own sound to avoid a copycat designation.I 'll give it 5 stars-it 's not like the greatest metal album of all time , but ya got ta give it to these guys for coming back after a long time , with a different singer from the iconic Udo Dirkschneider , and cranking out some face-melting tunes . Up to the standard of `` Restless and Wild '' / '' Balls to the Wall '' ? ( Or for that matter `` I 'm a Rebel '' / '' Breaker '' ? ) . Mmmm , maybe not quite , though I 'm just on the first listen . But certainly worthy of mention in the same breath.Finally , how can you resist a record released on the `` Nuclear Blast '' label ? ! ?	1
Blood of the Nations- THIS is an album for the fans ! And despite the naysayers , Mark Tornillo IS a fantastic fit for this band . He sounds amazing here ( Udo who ? ) . So very nice to have Herman Frank on board here again also , the addition is noticeable with his tasty playing bouncing off of Wolf ` s aweseome fretwork . The guitar work is stellar , the songs very lyrically well written on variable topics & by god this album just is good-ole fashioned METAL ! ! The best cuts on the album vary to my mood , but usually are The Abyss , Blood of the Nations , Rolling Thunder & the blistering closer , Bucket Full of Hate . I never saw this coming nor did most people but after months of playing this album I 'm just stunned at the overall quality . In due time will be recognized as one of Accept 's finest in their history .	1
FINALLY ! ! ! Accept is back ... and back with a vengeance.This is the album I have been waiting for since 1986 's Russian Roulette was released . To me ... the last REAL Accept album . U.D.O . 's Animal House came close ( as it was written by Accept to begin with ) , but this is what Accept should be and this is the sound that is near and dear to all our `` metal hearts '' .I 'll start with the obvious comments about new singer Mark Tornillo . He is the man for the job , without a doubt . One would think Udo is too iconic to replace ... maybe so in 1986 ... but not in 2010 . Mark not only replaces Udo ... but SURPASSES him and compliments the band perfectly here . His voice is gruff enough to handle the traditional Udo songs ... but has a wider range to enhance these new songs . He has a banshee like scream that is a blend between Brian Johnson of AC/DC and Rob Halford of..well ... ROB HALFORD fame.For me , as it has always been , it 's about the maestro WOLF HOFFMANN . He and Peter Baltes have done the impossible . They have taken music that so easily could be considered `` dated '' and have made it so contemporary you would not think that this is a band that has been around over 30 years . Andy Sneap ( producer extraordinaire of bands like Arch Enemy , Nevermore , etc ... ) really brought this classic metal act into the new millenium.I could go on and review track by track ... but that is pointless . There is n't a `` filler '' track to be heard . This is , quite simply , the best metal album of 2010 and probably worthy of being in the top 10 metal albums of the last decade . It is a classic .	1
Al que le guste el metal con caracter y poder , este es el disco . De lejos el mejor trabajo del ano 2010 , no lo piense , simplemente comprelo y disfrutelo ! !	1
The new singer is so compatible to the classic Accept sound that you do not even have to really think about it ... just sit back and enjoy . I found I liked the album immediately and each successive spin I am liking it more and noticing more . I really think its a good 4.5 star release but since we cant give .5 ratings , I will take it higher rather than lower . There is a classic Accept tone , vibe , sound , etc all the way through . The only negatives I could say are that there is no massive stand out song ( like a Balls to the Wall ) and after a while some of the riffing and songs start to sound quite similar to others on the album ... but ... honestly , they are all good , so it is hard to treat that as a negative . The guitars sound great and are what we have come to expect from Accept . It is great to have them back as a viable band ... UDO was dumb for not coming back , however , I am not sure they would have released as good a product with UDO ( the last Accept album with UDO was just so so , in my opinion ) . The new singer and producer both seemed to reignite and reinspire Wolf Hoffmann and the remaining Accept musicians into creating a great album to sit proudly along side their prior classics . Based on this album , going to see this lineup live their next US tour is now on my list of priorities .	1
Not a single weak song on this ! The best thing that they 've done , and one of the best albums released in the 21st Century .	1
this CD rocks from the first song to the last ! i think its as good as epic records like `` Back in Black '' .	1
AWESOME ! ! ! This is the best Accept release in years , no joking , it totally kicks ass ! Every song is well written and just fun to listen to . This release gets your blood boiling as it just drives like thiers no tomorrow . The sound quality is very good and the band is delivering the goods here . Sorry Udo , the new guys is kicking your butt lol.Great release , do yourself a favor and pick it up . We need to support good metal and this my friends is just about as good as it gets !	1
I was a bit sceptical when I first heard that Accept were recording a new album without vocalist Udo Dirkschnieder , as I did n't think Accept could be viable without Udo in the band ( remember 1987 's Eat the Heat ? ) . Fortunately , my fears are completely unfounded . This is solid old-school metal with a great production from Andy Sneap . While the album is n't quite on par with the old classic Accept albums from the 80 's , every song is strong and the result is an album that marks a great return to form by the band .	1
I was a little hesitant about getting this CD after hearing Accept with Dirkshneider but WOW , this is the most powerful metal CD that I had gotten in a long time . Mark Tornillo does an awesome job on vocals and is a great replacement . Every song rocks on the CD rocks ! Not much else to say but anyone looking for a great metal CD , please check this out !	1
I think I like them better ... ( sorry Udo ) The mix is great . The new singer is great . The guitar work is great . The song writing is great , as well as the lyrics . The album cover is really cool , graphics , everything ! ! ! I cant find any reason you should not take the plunge and , buy this record . I have seen 100 rock/metal shows , was a hard rock singer for many years and , I am also a collector ... grab this one and they 'll give YOU the axe ! OLGA '' S drinking vodka ! Who told her what the upcoming release was going to be titled ? You can come and deal with it !	1
In today 's world it is extremely difficult to come across a decent classic heavy metal album , let alone a good one . I remember drooling over Ronnie James Dio 's Heaven and Hell album `` The Devil You Know '' in 2009 because it was the best classic metal album I have heard in a decade at that point , and such a diamond in the rough . After that , I did n't expect to run into anything of similar quality for a long time , but ... Wow . Accept 's `` Blood of the Nations '' will probably go down as one of the biggest `` What the hell is that ? '' albums , because it hits you right in the face with amazing heavy metal music from track one to the last track , without letting go for a second . A classic band coming back these days with this kind of incredible material is truly a jewel that many of us will treasure for a very long time.The melodies , the amazing guitar work ( both heavy riffs and insane solos ) , the aggressive vocals , the clean drumming , no distortion in the production ... the talent here is so thick , you can cut it with a knife . I never expected to hear anything of this high quality from any classic band , but boy , was I wrong ! This record is addictive and will have you coming back to it again and again . I honestly ca n't spot any weak points on it and have been listening to it since getting it almost nonstop.I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone who enjoys such artists as Dio , Iron Maiden , Hammerfall , Firewind , Primal Fear , Black Sabbath , and other similar great bands .	1
First off , I have never listened to an Accept album . I loved their song `` Balls to the Wall '' , but I never actually owned anything or heard anything else from them . I consider myself a metal head , but I just never got into them for some reason.I listened to some samples on Amazon for Blood of the Nations , and I thought this album would be worth having . And boy , I am not disappointed . This is a great , hard hitting metal album ! Every song on here is great ! There is n't a weak track to be found.This album definitely has me thinking `` metal album of the year . ''	1
I 've always liked Accept . Their lyrics on this cd are very mature and the riffs are aggressive and the singing is great for this band . While overshadowed by a band such as Priest over the years in some ways botn is actually better than Priest 's last two efforts . The future looks bright for Accept . Hopefully they will release more albums like this .	1
Straight in your face metal like it was in the early to mid eighties . This CD will grab you from the first track and have you screaming along !	1
OK , the 3 star average for this album does n't look too good , so you 're not going to buy this album . There are 3 star albums that are not worth buying . This album is not one of them . Here are 10 reasons why:1 ) Most rockers after X amount of albums do n't have anything interesting left to write about . There is a ( personal ) story behind this album that makes it gratifying , and adds another dimension to the album.2 ) JP 's voice is not as bad as some here let on . To me , the contrast between Chrissie 's and JP 's voices , and the interplay in the singing is what helps to make the album interesting.3 ) Musically , the band sounds like they have been playing together for more than a single album.4 ) There is one song on the album that stands out from the rest to me ( Your Fairground ) . That song alone makes the album worth buying , although there are other good songs on the album as well.5 ) The album is cohesive from start to finish , for the most part . The only song that seems a bit out of place to me , ironically enough , is the title track ( Fidelity ! ) , which comes at the end of the album.6 ) Based on some reviews , I was expecting there to be some great incongruity between this album , and Chrissie with the Pretenders . To me , this album sits right alongside any other album with Chrissie , just fine . It 's the same Chrissie , vocally , lyrically , and otherwise.7 ) It 's not a downer album . People are happy . What 's not to like about that ? 8 ) If one thing sums up this album , `` but if you try sometimes , you get what you need ... '' 9 ) If anyone has the chance to go see the band in concert , go do it . They are playing at smaller venues , and it will be a once in a lifetime chance . I wish I could go see them in concert , but probably wo n't get the chance.10 ) Go Akron . 'Nuff said .	1
Suburba is an album like nothing else you will hear today . Since last album The End Is Not The End , I 've been convinced that House of Heroes is the top punk band in all of Christian music . With this album , they are now my favorite punk band in all of rock music . I am a long-time fan of Weezer , Jimmy Eat World , Plain White T 's , Death Cab for Cutie and Relient K. If you like those bands , get this album immediately . House of Heroes won me over 2 years ago with `` If , '' `` Lose Control , '' `` In The Valley of the Dying Sun '' and `` Field Of Daggers . '' I have had the privilege to see the band in concert twice and heard them perform a few songs from this new album last month . If you like what you hear on this album , do n't miss out on seeing them perform live . I have n't seen many bands who are even better in concert at performing incredibly tight guitar riffs and singing amazing harmonies than on the studio recording . House of Heroes are the real deal.Suburba is hooky , ambitious , and dripping with honest , candid emotion . This is what a rock record is supposed to sound like . This is what a rock record is supposed to feel like . `` I like this album because we chose to write about things that we knew , '' states frontman Tim Skipper . `` We wanted it to sound very American and full of youthful energy . We kept a lot of what we loved about the last record , but we just applied it differently and I think it came out exactly the way we wanted it to . This record is about growing up in middle class suburbia , '' states Skipper . `` It 's about fighting for your own identity in the face of society 's ideas about love , money , religion and power . It 's about having big dreams and going after them with reckless abandon , yet having to reconcile the fact that things are n't always going to go your way . And it 's about realizing , throughout all of it , that God is real and is the one constant among all the variables of life . `` The opening moments of the first track `` Relentless '' will appeal to any fan of 1980 's electronic rock . The mix of diverse musical styles with Tim Skipper 's amazing vocals are an incredible combination that gets better and better with each album . The standout songs on Suburba include the anthemic album opener , `` Relentless , '' `` Elevator , '' `` So Far Away , '' `` Salt In The Sea '' and the epic `` Independence Day For A Petty Thief . '' House of Heroes went the extra mile this time around to create lyrics that are cool , calculated , and crafty , while remaining vertical all the while . On `` God Save the Foolish Kings '' they comment on the search for significance : `` And we fight ` cause we 'd rather break our bones than brave this loneliness , And we draw blood ` cause we 're just trying to draw out some significance , But I met God on the street tonight , He said , `` Choose your battles wisely or you 'll never find me . '' On `` Love Is For the Middle Class , '' they comment on materialism and unconditional love : `` If all I gave was love , Would you give up on me ? But if you measure love in false securities , I owe you nothin ' at all.. '' Perhaps the most poignant moment of all on the record comes in its most worshipful , on the track `` Constant , '' where House of Heroes simply states the following : `` All thru the night I was fallin ' , Straining to hear your voice callin ' . You never gave out . You never gave in . You never quite gave up on me . You are my constant . `` CLOSING THOUGHTSSuburba is without a doubt the top punk rock album of the year . I ca n't get enough of this album and expect multiple GMA and GRAMMY award nominations for this album . If you have n't jumped on the House of Heroes bandwagon , do n't wait any longer . This album will stay in heavy rotation for me and although I did n't think it was remotely possible to match the intensity and brilliance of The End Is Not The End , after constant listening of Suburba , I 'm now convinced that this is their best overall album and one of my top 5 albums of 2010 .	1
We loved this album . We love any thing this man does . I now have most of his albums and DVD videos . I will eventually collect all I ca find .	1
Nik B & auml ; rtsch 's ensemble Ronin had previously issued their album Holon , which held me in its grip . This captivating music continues in the new album , Llyria . The stark European free jazz [ this is from ECM after all ] is composed to a large extent but , when performed , the musicians interact as cells in an organism to stretch and contract the phrases , to pull the listener in as each modal exploration unfolds . Saxophone or clarinet , drums and percussion , piano , and bass guitar weave a web of pulsing rhythm , timbre , and repeating lyrical phrases . Avant-garde , yes , but the music is fully accessible to the uninitiated ear . These are musical statements , meditatively spiritual in effect . Ronin are sorcerers . There is a quality of Turkish Dervish music in its elegant flow . Llyria is a significant album .	1
Nik B & auml ; rtsch 's Ronin seemed more exploratory and explosive on the two earlier CDs than this third album , `` Llyria . '' In other words , the old adage about the journey not the destination applies , for me to those earlier works , whereas the band seems to have reached stasis here , continuing with the ideas and themes from the earlier modules.Although the musical exploration seems to have slowed , the musical interaction here smoothly pulsates and spirals throughout these modules , clearly showcasing an ensemble that has heightened it telepathy and precision but perhaps lost some of its passion . `` Llyria '' is wonderfully easy to fall into , the music enveloping one like the rush of sound from a waterfall . I appreciate the elegant accessibility here but hope Ronin will explore some of the areas on its next recording that are already charted during its epic string of Monday-night live performances .	1
Ciara Princess Harris is somewhat underrated as an artist , as she is capable of combining many elements into her music and videos . Her voice can be both sassy and sweet , she is a great dancer , and she has an element of sex appeal.On `` Basic Instinct , '' she is able to combine those elements effectively enough to produce a very entertaining , hook-filled hip hop/pop crossover album . On her first two albums ( 2004 's `` Goodies '' and 2006 's `` The Evolution '' ) the strongest moments were without question the singles , as `` My Goodies , '' `` 1 2 Step , '' and `` Like A Boy '' were killer hits and burned up the charts . On her 2009 album `` Fantasy Ride '' she mixed in a few tender ballads , a duet with Justin Timberlake , and a few dancefloor anthems ( `` Work '' is one of her best ever songs ) , but only one single managed the top 10.Just over a year later , `` Basic Instinct '' has appeared , after several delays . The first two singles ( `` Ride '' and `` Gim me Dat '' ) have not been huge chart hits , which is disappointing , because they are quite good ( but not great ) tracks . The best moments come during the middle of the album , when she teams up with Tricky Stewart for a couple of mainstream hip-pop gems ( `` Heavy Rotation '' and `` Yeah I Know ' ) . Later in the album , there is a nice song featuring Usher , called `` Turn It Up . '' As typically is the case with Usher , the song hits the mark.In conclusion , Ciara has enough excellent songs here to make `` Basic Instinct '' a fine record , although not a great one . But in an era in which there are plenty of female singers all over the top of the charts who are turning out auto-tuned cheese , it is a shame that Ciara is not getting more airplay , because the quality of the best songs on this album are right up there with what Beyonce and Rihanna have done the past several years . In an era when great rock bands are almost impossible to find , there are an abundance of female pop singers ( Katy Perry , Rihanna , Gaga , Kesha , Beyonce , Xtina , Shontelle , and the list goes on , and Ciara hopefully will not become lost in a very crowded playing field . She needs a huge top 5 single , and there are a few songs here that could ( and quite frankly SHOULD ) be able to give her that success .	1
I think Ciara is extremely talented . Her vocals are not all that , but I love her music , style , and dancing skills . Alot of people are saying they want the old Ciara back ... . well , she is no longer the young teenager everyone fell in love with years ago . She is a mature lady now coming into her own . Ciara has evolved , but what do you all expect ! If she kept singing the same type of songs she did when she first came out , then everyone would be crying about how she never changes . Ca n't win over everyone , that 's for sure.Ciara : Do you mama ! Keep grinding and the best of luck . I see you !	1
This is a great CD release by the talented & sexy singer Ciara , tittled , 'Basic Instinct ' . This great CD ( with 10 tracks ) opens with `` Basic Instinct ( U Got Me ) '' , an okay electro/techno rapping title track . Other okay tracks include `` Girls Get Your Money '' ( lyrics could/should have been better ) , `` Speechless '' ( okay electro-synthesizer sound , laid-back track with okay vocals ) , `` Wants For Dinner '' ( another electro-synthesizer track , 'reggae ' bass with great vocals ) & `` I Run With It '' ( laid-back track with an 'eerie ' background sound ) . Great tracks include `` Gim me Dat '' ( great electro-synthesizer , great drums & better rapping than the title track ) , `` Yeah I Know '' ( great melodic electro-synthesizer sound , great drums & her vocals/rapping is great . Lyrics could/should have been better ) & `` You Can Get It '' ( laid-back track with great melody & vocals ) . Solid tracks/gems include `` Ride '' ( has a great deep voice of Ludacris , fantastic laid-back vocals by Ciara , the song also has a great melody . Ciara declares , `` They like the way I ride '' , quite a beautiful & sexy beat of a song ) , `` Heavy Rotation '' ( a beautiful electro-synthesizer sound , great drums & great vocals . The song has a beautiful melody as well as wonderful harmonies . Ciara proclaims `` Heavy rotation all night long '' , quite so invitingly tempting . This is my favourite track from this great CD & hence the title of my review ) & `` Turn It Up '' ( a fantastic dance track with a beautiful chorus & harmonies , featuring the great Raymond Usher on vocals ) . Although tracks like `` Girls Get Your Money '' & `` Yeah I Know '' needed better lyrics , there is no 'weak track ' to really talk of on this CD . On overall , this is a great CD release with the usual sexual overtones that Ciara is well known for ( which unfortunately may mask her brilliance somewhat ) , a recommended CD listening .	1
Have everything these guys have released and this is my favorite . Not a bad one in the bunch mind you . Black Sabbath influenced heavily . If you are a Sabbath fan , you will enjoy this band in my opinon .	1
stoner metalI really did n't like Gods of Earth . I 'm afraid to listen to Age of Winters . However , I decided to give The Sword another chance , and I was surprised by Warp Riders . Everything I found horrible about the band is gone.This is the band 's first album produced by an outsider , and production quality is vastly improved . Initially , I did n't like the murky quality , but it 's part of the genre , and I got used to it . Cymbals are used more sparingly . The singer actually learned to sing , and his voice fits the stoner thing . Vocals are mixed higher , so they 're not hiding in the background.On top of that , the songwriting/playing is a considerable step up . Very solid musicianship and very solid songs . It 's also a sci-fi narrative concept album , but I have n't studied the lyrics yet . Overall , The Sword is somewhat of a softer , early Mastodon.In retrospect , this album helped bring The Sword into metal prominence . With their 2012 release , Apocryphon , the band became a much bigger deal than I ever thought they would . And deservingly so .	1
I 've been listening to these guys since the first album , and I 've been liking them more and more with each album . I got ta say , I was not a huge fan of Age of Winters - the sound was muddy , the songs were unoriginal and the vocals sucked . Nonetheless , there were some good grooves and riffs and I happily got their next one - Gods of the Earth . I thought it was an improvement , mostly better songs , but still with weak vocals . But Warp Riders ... Wow this is much better ! I was excited to hear Matt Bayles was producing , as he did a great job with Mastodon ( Blood Mountain , Leviathan ) . As expected , the sound is much better , better separation of the guitars without losing any heaviness , but most importantly , the vocals are awesome ! These songs are all really good - the whole album flows very seamlessly , and there are no weak tracks . That being said , some of the songs are a bit more `` commercial '' than their older stuff ( Tres Brujas , Night City ) , but they are still pretty good with catchy riffs and great drums . This is very listenable - it 's been in my car for about 6 weeks and I 'm still playing it . Some people have mentioned a 'southern rock ' feel - I 'm not sure it 's ZZ Top , but definitely more `` rock '' sounding than the other albums . I actually can see Phil Lynott ( RIP ) singing some of these songs , which I do n't think I ever would have thought about an album from The Sword . Definitely worth getting .	1
What the Foo Fighters are doing for rock , the Sword are doing for metal . This album is a little more polished production wise than Gods Of The Earth . I really enjoy listening to these guys . Straight ahead classic metal and far out lyrics . You can hear the influences here too- Zeppelin , Sabbath , and Thin Lizzy just to name a few . Their new album comes out in October . More likely I will pre order it . Spend some time listening to these guys . This album is absolutely an instant classic	1
RBF is still one of the most under appreciated bands in the world today . This CD is a re-recorded version of their biggest hits , with a bonus CD that 's an acoustic set of some of their songs . The acoustic CD is spectacular and well worth the price of the CD . It 's almost like getting a badass acoustic set of RBF songs with a greatest hits CD thrown in the mix ! You ca n't go wrong with this one .	1
I almost did n't buy this album because of a couple bad reviews , but this cd kicks ! I mean what do you want in a best of ? If you already own the song , congratulations you get this pleasure of hearing a slightly different recording . If it 's a song you do n't know , then you just think it sounds great ! You ca n't lose ! Every band should do this ! Plus all the songs sound consistent as an album ( i.e . if I manually mix a 1998 track with a 2010 track you can tell the difference if recording quality / sound volume ) .And I ca n't believe if you buy the hard copy you get the Skacoustic cd too ( with acoustic versions of most of the songs ) ! That 's insane value ! But note this is only in the NON-MP3 order . I downloaded the MP3 version , which did NOT include Skacoustic ( oops - guess I should read the reviews ! ) You can still download Skacoustic separately though . So keep in mind I 'm only talking `` best of '' in my review here.So will you like the `` new '' best of versions ? First off , they 're all top notch quality . One reviewer implied they were n't trying or something - I do n't get that at all ! Second , they 're pretty similar to the originals . A casual fan would not know the difference . But you get some different voice inflections and things , just like most bands end up doing in concert - you change how you sing a line or two here and there . In fact , its pretty much like getting a high quality live recording on a night where the band played it really close to the album.What if you know all the songs already , should you get this ? That was n't my situation , but I think if you love the way it was originally done , there 's not enough difference to justify a whole purchase of the best of . But if you 're like me and only knew maybe half these songs , I guarantee you 'll love some of the others , great stuff !	1
I 've been a fan of RBF and Ska for years and when I saw this in a store I decided to pick it up and hear how these songs sounded redone . At first I was a little dissapointed in how the songs were the same yet different ( hope that makes sense ) . However after listening to it a few times and really paying attention it grew on me and now I personally prefer these to the originals . Not only that but the acoustic set just came off really well and is worth buying this set for alone . Overall I 'd say they did a fantastic job on this compalition cd	1
Great CD and awesome band . The only thing im not a fan of is the same bass drop in every song . makes it sound too generic and over played . But its in all their music not just this CD . So far this is definitely my favorite by them	1
These guys are very good . This CD is very good the only dissappointment is that it is a really short CD and to fill the space , they put some live songs of their older albums up .	1
This was supposed to be a DVD/CD set . Problem : only arrived with the DVD inside ; no CD . Bummed out entirely .	1
I used to think all of U2 was 'bland and monotonous , then I listened to them . To call this album soafter not even having a week with it silly . The album does 'seem ' to have a tone that is somberand restrained . And it also seems to be difficult because these feelings are n't always united withlovely lyrics about falling in or out of love . My response after having a mere 12 hours with thisalbum is an eager curiosity . This was n't the case with his previous album . Here I found four songsat the beginning and the rest unravelled around them as an album . This album is strange becauseit seems to lack those tent pole songs that maintained all his other efforts , that opened the door ( mixing metaphors ) to the less commercial tracks . This definitely seems to be an album you approachas an album . I am only speaking about the first disc . The second disc ( and bonus tracks from other vendor ) have great songs - A Moment Changes Everything is a great song . It could easily become a verypopular live song . So maybe this album is five stars . It might be one star . But let 's not sabotage hisefforts .	1
What can I say . Some more super-retro electro stylings from Chromeo . I expected nothing less . I 'm dancing around my office .	1
Ive been a big fan of chromeo since their humble beginnings and love them greatly . I feel on this album they kind of matured a bit and while that is good for any band , it kind of takes away what i love about them . This album kinda has me wondering `` where 's the funk ? '' . One things for sure , these cats are becoming really good at producing . The production is wonderful . Plus they still write great catchy songs . But if i had to choose an album of theirs id pick fancy footwork . That album was fun and every song was good . My gf and i would sing every single song on that album haha .	1
I discovered Chromeo on Daryl Hall 's web series `` Live From Daryl 's House . '' When I saw them perform songs like `` Waiting For You '' I knew these guys were something special . Their music has clearly been influenced by Hall & Oates , among other 80s pop musicians . Their last album - Fancy Footwork - was flat out awesome ! So , I was eagerly anticipating the arrival of `` Business Casual . '' I 've been listening to it all day , and here is what I think of it . `` Business Casual '' is a very solid album . It has many incredibly catchy songs like `` Night By Night '' - the BEST song on the album ! `` I 'm Not Contagious , '' `` When The Night Falls '' and `` Do n't Walk Away '' are all amazing songs as well . Almost every song on here is excellent . I do n't think it topped `` Fancy Footwork , '' but `` Business Casual '' is more of the Chromeo I 've grown to love . It did not disappoint.One thing I really like about Chromeo is that they truly care about the music they create . If you listen to their songs multiple times , you 'll pick up on different instruments you did n't notice before . That 's because they spend a great amount of time adding multiple layers of incredibly effective music . If you your hips or lips do n't start moving by the time this album is over , you might want to check your pulse because you 're probably dead ; )	1
If one tries to explain and define Chromeo 's sound in one word that word would be followed by the word retro ( for a better overview of the band I suggest watching their video for `` Do n't Turn The Lights On '' , it will give you a good idea ) . Chromeo is just that , awesomely retro , it may not be the best way of putting it but it certainly gives a good idea of the type of band that Chromeo is , the band has been compared to artists such as Hall & Oates among others . Chromeo is very much a 1980 's fueled electronic band , they have a current electronic sound mixed with 80 's pop and at times the disco of the 70s ' , the result is musical genius ( at least in this reviewer 's opinion and perhaps fans of 80 's music ) . It is genius to use the sound of the 80 's artists that influenced them but at the same time making it sound current , this is why I find the band so interesting . I 'll tell you right away I 'm not a fan of pop or modern mainstream music at all but I do enjoy 80 's music more than some would admit to . Chromeo is one of the modern bands that I really enjoy and hope will continue bringing us their genre of music.This Montreal based French Canadian electro band 's ( I think that French electro is some of the best , for instance I loved some of the stuff that Daft Punk and later Justice put out ) breakthrough came in 2007 with the release of their album Fancy Footworks , before FF they released their debut in 2004 She 's In Control which had the small club hit `` Needy Girl '' . With Fancy Footwork the band went further into the retro element of their style and the band evolved in better direction I feel , the songs on that album are excellent.The band 's new album Business Casual continues in that direction but is a different album altogether . It is filled with delightful retro pop sounds like the catchy and energetic `` Hot Mess '' . The album 's first single `` Do n't Turn The Lights On '' is one of the best songs here and it 's easy to see why it was chosen as the single , excellent song with terrific lyrics . I was surprised that Chromeo included `` Night By Night '' from Facny Footworks , it sounds like a retro 70 's disco sound and is incredibly catchy , this was one of the best songs from FF and it 's also one of the best ones on Business Casual . One could ask : why did they include it again on this album ? For one reason it 's an amazing song and if it did n't get attention the first time around , maybe on this album it will get the recognition it deserves . `` I 'm Not Contagious '' is exactly the opposite of its title , it 's overly contagious with energy and you feel this song is contagious ! `` Do n't Walk Away '' is a slower-paced song with a funky disco vibe to it . There is also a song in French `` J'ai Claqu & eacute ; la Porte '' which is interesting to say the least . And those are just a few of the songs on Business Casual.I do n't think Business Casual is the band 's best album yet , I would say Fancy Footworks remains their best , but Chromeo continues to make superb modern-retro music that I just love . If you 're new to the band I would recommend you start with Business Casual however . BC is a strong album and I hope that Chromeo will get the attention they deserve , they 're getting more exposure ( MTV certainly did since FF ) but for now it 's almost as if the band is a well-kept secret in a way . If you 're a fan of 80 's ( and it would help if you liked some disco ) pop music then I believe you should give Chromeo a try . Not quite a 5 but a close 4 .	1
I probably should have bought some of Paul 's music years ago , but incredible as it may seem , this is the first collection of his music I 've actually owned . Apart from his big hit Diana ( which is featured here as well as regularly turning up on multi-artist compilations ) , I do n't think I 'd actually heard any of his other music prior to buying this set . I had n't really thought about what to expect the rest of the music here to sound like , but I would have expected to find some rock'n'roll ( he wrote It does n't matter anymore for Buddy Holly ) but there 's none here . Instead , we get treated to a lot of music that really dates from an earlier era - the swing music of the thirties and forties , along with a French-themed album . I love that music too , so I 'm happy with that , albeit a little surprised.Here , you 'll find Paul 's first three albums , plus the singles that were n't also released as album tracks . Thus , all of Paul 's British and American hits from the fifties are here , but the major part of this set is devoted to Paul 's early albums . The first and third albums each occupy the first twelve tracks of a CD . The only one of Paul 's singles among them is Diana , while the remaining tracks include plenty of familiar songs including Secret love , I 've got my love to keep me warm , Love letters in the sand , You belong to me , Red sails in the sunset , Side by side , Your cheating heart and Jambalaya among others . It seems that the record label wanted to market the albums to an older albums to an older audience , leaving the singles for teenagers.The French-themed album occupies the remaining tracks on CD 1 . Many of the songs here are of French origin , though there are also some American songs with French themes . One of Paul 's singles , My heart sings , was itself a song of French origin and provided the album 's inspiration . This album clearly shows Paul 's love of French music , which came to the fore in the late sixties when he took Claude Francois ' hit Comme d'habitude and wrote English lyrics for it , calling his version My way.The second half of CD 2 is occupied by singles that were n't included in the three albums featured on this set . Stylistically different from the album tracks , there is still a lot of great music here , though the unlikely trio of Paul Anka , Johnny Nash ( still some years away from his own big hits ) and George Hamilton IV ( who had a brief career as a pop singer before settling for a country music career to which he was better suited ) have all delivered better music separately than they do together on Teen commandments of love . Perhaps the pick of these singles would be Put your head on my shoulder , Lonely boy and You are my destiny , though all are overshadowed by Diana.These days , Paul is remembered for Diana ( which he wrote ) and for My Way ( which many people give him full credit for writing , when he is only entitled to part of the credit ) but this compilation shows him to be a much more versatile performer .	1
I can not believe I waited so long to order this ! ! This collection of songs is amazing ! Al Jardine is a master of sounding fantastic . The various duets on the album are wonderful ! 'A Postcard . . . ' lets us realize , and really appreciate the control and quality of Mr. Jardine 's voice . As well , the price was very fair , the quality of the disc perfection , and the delivery to my door prompt . I 'm very impressed with the whole deal . . . and now , I get to enjoy the music ! !	1
Great cd.Al 's writing ability is as good as anyone out there.He was a great opart of the Beach Boys	1
A nostalgic album to be sure . I was surprised . It is really good . California Dreamin ' really garbed me . It is a bit nostalgic and that is a good thing .	1
I have been listening to the entire album for 2 days now ; the guest appearances of America , Glen Campbell , Stills , Crosby , and Young , etc . are tasteful , seasoned and display a fine respect for American music history and the Beach Boys ' particular relation to these artists as analogues and inspiration . `` Do n't Fight the Sea '' is nothingless than a `` Beach Boy song '' and is stirring ; I have been living that song this weekend here in LA , and its power has been animating my every more , either rocking round the LA freeways or heading to the beach . The song may have a political , ecological focus , but that element , however important and worthy from the BB , falls away in respect to the philosophical and emotional power of the music and singing . `` Do n't Fight the Sea '' can mean so many things : do no resist the power of Nature , broadly defined ; do not resist truth and beauty , etc . It 's `` Do n't back down '' reimagined and `` aged '' 48 years later . There is a Taoist element to the thinking here , and the song is liberating . Concerning the album as a whole , how can this great gift of Al , the hopeful , emotional core of the surviving BB , mean anything less than a full reunion to come ? Every BB , save the late Dennis , is represented here -- David playing a rockin ' lead on Drivin ' . I hope all the BB take this to heart . I remain in awe that at the click of a mouse I am listening to the BB again . The spirit of joy and peace radiates from very track . Once you listen to this album , you feel part of the land , history , and , as Carl would have said , the spirit.thank you Al , Professor M.CalabreseCalifornia State University , Los Angelesmcalabr @ calstatela.edu	1
For those of us who still need our Beach Boy fixes , this one was a pleasure to listen to . Al 's vocals fit like a glove . Makes you want to get outside and go stare at the ocean . Hearing Neil Young sing on California Saga is a treat . Thanks Al !	1
Following up an album as good as The Rhumb Line is a difficult task . Ra Ra Riot had a major element working against them : the untimely passing of John Pike , their original drummer and a great lyricist ( who penned various songs for The Rhumb Line ) . They also faced the possibility of a dreaded sophomore slump . Now , I 've read some early critiques of the album that say this is just more of the same from Ra Ra Riot ... but really , is that a bad thing ? Taking a closer look ... The Orchard - A haunting beginning to an eclectic chamber pop album , The Orchard works as a great intro and a fitting title track . ( 7/10 ) Boy - This rambunctious new single falls into the same camp as their catchy single , `` Can You Tell . '' It 's hard not to sing along with the relatable , yelped chorus where Wes shows off his boundless vocal range . It 's hard to disagree with this song . ( 10/10 ) Too Dramatic - A live staple turned recording , this song is instantly memorable for its catchy 80 's vocal melody ( and VERY 80 's keyboards ) . The staccato strings also chop in and out in very precise , deliberate strokes that demand attention . ( 9/10 ) Foolish - This song sounds classic to me . I almost feel like I heard it on the radio at some point a long time ago . That 's a very good sign . Everything just fits into place very well on this track . ( 10/10 ) Massachusetts - This overlong white-guy reggae song about Massachusetts falls short both lyrically and musically . It 's almost as if this song wanted to be something like `` Diplomat 's Son '' but relied too heavily on repetition . It 's not bad if you only listen to it for a couple minutes though . ( 5/10 ) You And I Know - Alexandra Lawn steps up to the mic to make her debut and she croons over the Renaissance Fair-synth with a low , jazzy voice . The ethereal backups that come in and out help round out the song . It 's a fine debut indeed . ( 8/10 ) Shadowcasting - This one chugs along at a reasonable pace and seems like it would be perfect for blasting out of your radio while driving around during the summer . ( 8/10 ) Do You Remember - The strings really seem to take center stage in this song . The breakdown with strings only draws attention to their intricacies . This song could very well signal the return of the `` soft rock '' genre , but in a good way . ( 8/10 ) Kansai - Great drumming throughout , and a bouncy bass line keeps this song fun . I think it needs to grow on me though . ( 6/10 ) Keep It Quiet - This is the album 's masterpiece . It begins very minimalistic and then a little more than halfway through , a Vampire Weekend-like guitar riff comes in with the violin and cello , making the song truly heart wrenching . [ I recommend everyone also check out the Boy Single version . ] ( 10/10 ) Overall , I think this album is a great representation of a band that is great at what they do and feel no need to give into gimmicks just to draw in trendy fair-weather fans.Thanks for reading !	1
What the hell 's the MATTER with you other reviewers ? Only a handful of 5 star reviews ? I 'd give this 6 if I could.I 'm 52 years old , and been with Carlos since Abraxas . I 'm a professional keyboard player , and life long Santana fan . This absolutely smokes . It 's wonderful , and it 's near perfect . `` It 's not Santana '' one reviewer said . Say WHAT ? Exactly ! He did n't write these songs , and he adapted himself . This is Carlos paying tribute , and it smokes . I can not wait to see this tour , because I can tell right now it has the potential to go down as perhaps the single best live concert experience of my life . Viva La Santana . If you 're reading this Carols , hey , it worked for me !	1
a special selection of the music that Santana likes , excellent work , excellent songs and interpretations , i recommend so far	1
All these other reviews comparing this CD to others is bull . Let 's review this on it 's own merits . Do you like Santana 's style ? Do you like his tone ? Do you like his production ? If yes then own this because it is a clean well produced album with GREAT guitar tone and the singers selected add to the product . Can or should classics be re-made is not in question but this is a satisfying CD.Also , `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' with India Arie and Yo-Yo Ma is worth the price .	1
Even though there 's about 140-odd-reviews on this already , I 'm gon na add a few thoughts in defense of this CD.1 - The first time I heard it , I was EXTREMELY disappointed . It was NOT the Carlos Santana that I wanted to hear . However , the CD IS the Carlos Santana that HE wanted to play , and you know what ? -- It is excellent.2 - Poor marketing decisions are the real problem here . The title at the top makes it look like a cheap , 99-cent TV special limited time offer . If you call within the next five minutes , you , too , can have Carlos Santana playing the hits of the decades . WHO designed this thing ? Worse , who decided to add that `` greatest guitar classics '' line as part of the title ? Talk about trashing the effort.3 - `` Guitar Heaven '' would possibly have served by itself as the title , except `` Guitar Heaven , '' to me , means long , uninterrupted lead breaks with minimal or no singing in the song whatsoever . This should have been called `` Rock Heaven '' or something . Bad , bad marketing.4 - According to a recent interview , there 's potential hope at the studio end for volumes II and even III of this thing . I would hope not . It 's a pleasant musical curiosity and an interesting artist divergency , but Carlos Santana needs to sound like himself . THAT 'S what we 're all waiting for out here . The REAL next CD.5 - A good thing about the CD -- The pretty orange CD face with the big Santana on it is reminiscent of the Carlos Santana/Buddy Miles Live cover . You almost do n't notice the silly title.6 - RE : The songs -- Every single one on here is very , very nicely done . They all do what I think they were intended to do , which is balance commercial covers with musical interpretation , some more so than others . How much wiggle room is there , really , in doing `` Whole Lotta Love ? '' You either do it or you don't.7 - Random comments -- Lead break on `` Knocking '' is nice ; `` Sunshine '' books right along ; Anybody who knocks this version of `` Weeps '' is n't listening ; `` Photograph '' rocks nicely ; NAS on `` Back in Black '' is superb ; `` Riders '' is more than nice , especially with Manzarek on board ; the Jon Lord tone and style organ on `` Smoke '' is very well done ; `` Dance '' is nice ; Bolan 's `` Gong '' is the ABSOLUTE TREAT of the album and worth the price of admission by itself ; `` Little Wing '' with Joe Cocker is untouchable -- an entire album between the two , now THAT would be interesting ; and `` Superstitious '' has all the flavor it 's supposed to.8 - Anyway , if you 're looking to hear the Carlos Santana `` OF '' LEGEND , this is NOT the CD you 're looking for.9 - However , if you 're looking to hear what `` THE '' LEGEND Carlos Santana is doing these days , this IS the CD for you . I like it.There 's only three minutes left to order . Make that call now . Operators are standing by .	1
I 've read several reviews of this disc , and can not understand why some of you chose to slam this album . It 's grand ! I do n't know what the naysayers were listening to when writing as they did , but it was n't this CD ! The first three tracks , Santana 's versions of Led Zeppelin 's `` Whole Lotta Love '' , the Rolling Stones ' monster , `` Ca n't You Hear Me Knocking ? `` , and the Eric Clapton/Cream classic , `` Sunshine of Your Love '' are worth buying `` Guitar Heaven '' for alone ! All three pack the wallop of an uppercut from a young Muhammad Ali . I thought that I was too tired of `` Smoke on the Water '' , that is , 'til Carlos ' magic breathed new life into it . The George Harrison/Beatles ' `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' remake is tender and soulful.Now , is this Carlos Santana 's best album ? That 's hardly a fair question , given his immense body of superb work , ( Santana I-III , Moonflower , Supernatuaral , amongst many more ) . Thus , the short answer is no , but `` Guitar Heaven '' is unquestionably one of my favorites.Yes , there are weak moments , but only a couple . I 'm not a fan of `` Back in Black '' , ( featuring Nas ) , because I truly believe that rap and hip-hop are the musical equivalent of urinating in the Holy Grail itself . I did n't care for `` Dance the Night Away '' , or `` Photograph '' , only because I 'm not a fan of those original tracks.Yet the rest of `` Guitar Heaven '' delivers pure gold : `` Riders on the Storm '' , `` Bang a Gong '' , `` Little Wing '' , ( of which Jimi would approve ) , and `` I Ai n't Superstitious '' , with the dynamic Jonny Lang , finish this bit of Heaven . `` Guitar Heaven '' *is* a great album ! Those who think otherwise deserve to be flogged with a handful of Carlos Santana 's guitar strings , though they be unworthy of that privilege . Listen to the samples , then buy -- and truly enjoy -- this disc !	1
I was afraid to hear this cd , cause i though it was goin to be similar to their lastest offerings . A Santanta just playing along some of today s ' singers and just that ... ..But here , i can not denied that there is some of the old fire in most of the songs . I do like his aproach on the sacred `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' , a song also covered by a great guitar player as Peter Frampton is and many others.Most of the songs follow the originals , Frankly , i consider some songs , not really adecuate for Santana to play , specially the Van Halen cover , since they have better songs . He should , instead for example , cover a Ten Years After song like `` Standing at the Station '' or Jefferson Starship `` Save Your Love '' or the Rolling Stones `` Time Waits for No One '' , or he Beatles `` I Want You '' ... .or Journey s ' Kohoutec , songs that he can strech out long solos ... ... ... Hope next time , it his mentor Clive Davies , wants him to record a follow up to this album , he chooses better songs for Carlos Santana to play .	1
Great CD . I love listening to Kenny . He has the kind of songs on this CD you will listen to over and over .	1
I `` Love '' this CD . I can listen to it over and over and not get tired of it . I 'm always pleased when you buy a CD and the whole thing is good , not just the song from the radio..I was also glad my boyfriend , who knows alot of trivia , could give me the scoop on what 's behind the song `` Hemingway 's Whiskey '' ..Apparently Hemingway always drank a glass of Whiskey while he was writing . Anyway , you will not be disappointed in this CD . Of course , Amazon , as usual was very prompt with delivery and the product was in excellent condition . Thanks Amazon !	1
This entire CD is fantastic . There is not one bad song and if you 're a country and Chesney fan , you will be very happy with this CD . I ca n't stop listening to it ! !	1
Kenny just does not make bad music and I love his sound.I love the song 'Boys of Fall ' it is awesome.Just a great album front to back .	1
Another well handle buying situation	1

Seal 's new CD , his seventh ( despite the title being `` Seal 6 : Commitment '' - I guess they are n't counting `` Soul '' ) is obviously a labour of love . Produced by David Foster who produced his covers album `` Soul '' from 2008 , it comprises 11 lavish paeans to love , the lyrics obviously inspired by the missus ( super model Heidi Klum ) and their four children . The album has a similar quiet mien as his under rated `` Human being '' album.Lead-off single is the delicate acoustic ballad `` Secret '' , and similar is the waltz-like `` Letting go '' ( `` Baby , baby , why must you travel ? four little faces , they need you home '' ) .There are no dance anthems as found on his `` System '' album , or `` Killer '' from his eponymous debut , but stepping up the tempo a bit are the bouncy `` Weight of my mistakes '' , the groovy `` Best of me '' ( think Lenny Kravitz 's `` It ai n't over till it 's over '' ) , `` The way I lie '' , and the absolutely lovely tempo-shifting `` Big time '' alternating between pounding beats and a Jazzy swing.Everything else comprises ballads which he excels at ; `` Silence '' , `` All for love '' and the chilling theatrical `` I know what you did '' the standouts.His raspy voice still soars and stretches like it did on `` Kiss from a rose '' . As much as I enjoyed `` Soul '' , it 's great getting new songs penned by Seal . This might not initially grab you ( and one ca n't help but feel Trevor Horn would have done a better job at adding subtle but vital nuances and flourishes ) but it slowly grows on you .	1
There 's no comparason . This album kills . The production is phenominal . The song writing and playing is phenominal . And even more , the drum work on this album is on fire by Mr. Will Hunt . This band has never , ever sounded better . Not a filler song on here . Each song was carefully crafted and well thought out . Seems that a little change behind the scenes can do a band good !	1
After BLS 's `` The Blessed Hellride , '' I got pretty tired of the same old formula and sort of lost interest in them . I have to admit , Order ... '' has really impressed this old metal head . The reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because this album contains THREE ( ugh ) ballads . Zakk , enough of the ballads ! ! ! They all sound the same and are very redundant . By far the best track on this album is `` Overlord . '' I just ca n't stop listening to it . The rest of the album however , is just as strong . It 's still the same BLS , but a little more groove and edge this time around . I 'm glad I picked it up .	1
This is the best BLS disc I believe . I have most of them but this has it all . Here is a breakdown of the basics : Guitar - A+ ... Incredible ! Some extremely well done solos . The guitars explode out of the speakers . Excellent , driving rhythms about . 'Chupacabra ' is like Zakk Wylde 's ERUPTION ! He shreds like crazy on this.Production - A ... In your face , guitars shredding above all and a good bass line bottom . The solo 's are incredibly clear.Songs - B+ ( for BLS ) ... These tracks rock out 80 % of the time . 'Darkest Days ' is one ballad though . Pretty draggy at that . 'Time Waits for No One ' is another that is a bit better . 'Shallow Grave'.. eehh . I know they put these tracks in for an attempt to give the disc more dimension , but they kind of do n't fit.Otherwise , the riffs and song structures work well and the solo 's kill it ! ! Great soloing throughout . Most important , the songs do n't drag or bore you . Standard in approach granted , but you do n't get tired . They flow well.Lyrics - B ... Good for his style , avg . to borderline impressive for this type of thing . Strength , power and the South ! Pretty good , or should I say good enough ! Originality - C ... Heard all the riffs before . Its BLS . Not trying to reinvent anything , just execute it well . Song structures do n't go too far out of their pattern . Though 'Southern Dissolution ' has some tempo changes that work real well.What makes the disc lose its 5 rating is the damn VOCALS ! I like Zakk , most of the times it works , but sometimes they just grate on ya . He has his style and you can feel the emotion , but sometimes you just wish he had another vocalist to rely on for a track or 2 . They do annoy me after a while . The over emphasis , the dragged out words and screeching falsetto highs are a little strong for the attempted ballads on here . 'Shallow Grave ' would be great with a different vocalist . Its a beautiful song , just that nasally vocal kills it at the bridge and chorus.And they are very loud in the mix to boot.I really think BLS would go further with a second vocalist to take another approach to a select song here and there . I have always thought this and still do . But 80 % of the time its fine . Zakk 's voice is good with this stuff , but it would n't hurt . I doubt any BLS disc will ever get a 5 from me because of that.Overall , a much better release than the last . Highly recommended .	1
Masterpiece ! BLS has been my favorite band for years and this album does not disappoint . Great to hear Zakk and the boys turn it up a notch after the good but no so great Shot To Hell . Definitely on par with my previous favorites , 1919 Eternal and Blessed Hellride . This man can do it all , from piano/acoustic based ballads to balls-out rock/metal , and without a doubt is EASILY one of the best musicians in the industry today .	1
Ohhhh ! Hell yeah ! He 's back ! The Guitar God is speaking again ! Heavy , crushing , pounding ... .wicked riffs ! Worth the wait ... ... .BUY IT NOW ! ! !	1
You either like him or hate him but Zakk delivers some kick butt rock-n-metal on this latest disc.It has some great piano ballads on this disc along with some head bangin rockers.In my opinion one of BLS best .	1
For me this is the best Black Label Society album yet . Time away from Ozzy and taking a little more time between albums has paid off .	1
Rumor has it the surviving members of Pantera have discussed , or have had discussed for them , a reunion with Zakk Wylde in the place of the irreplaceable Dimebag Darrell . While Pantera fans rightfully think Dimebag could never be topped , the choice of Wylde is a logical one , as he is one of the more identifiable players out there , a fine songwriter himself , and well versed in the same classic rock and metal Pantera were.In the meantime , Black Label Society is his flagship band , having left Ozzy for drinking too much . Considering it 's Ozzy , it must have been in liberal amounts , but Wylde has supposedly sobered up , and let 's hope so. & # 34 ; Order of the Black & # 34 ; is a stomper , replete with heavy riffage , thrash that would put most thrashers to shame , dynamic singing , not grunting , and even a few ballads . While four of those cuts may be a bit much , at least he 's not afraid to throw some curves . After all , the great bands of yesteryear mixed metal with melody and did just fine . BLS straddle the line between the heaviest traditional metal and extreme metal . It serves as a defining point between the aforementioned classic metal like Priest and stepping into the territory occupied by Slayer , Kreator and Exodus . Here 's hoping he does n't go all southern rock on us . I smell a whiff of good ol ' boy , and I 've heard enough & # 34 ; Freebird & # 34 ; for a lifetime .	1
Zakk and BLS are back , and it was well worth the wait . This could definitely be up for metal album of the year . Zakk 's guitar work and piano work are simply amazing . This thing is good from beginning to end . I like the whole thing , but Godspeed Hellbound is quickly becoming my favorite . Everything you wanted from Zakk and more .	1
He continues to surprise me . I like over half the CD.You wan na hear MC skills AND learn something I suggest you get this album.Forget Lil wayne and Niki Minaj garbage cop this right here , your soul needs it hahaha	1
I love a review of a tenor when the worst complaint the `` critic '' can come up with is about his low notes . LOL ! ! This is a very young man ( 33 ) at the edge of what I think just might be an international explosion of a career . How long that career lasts is very much up to him.The fact that he includes Manrico 's high-C dripping music from `` Il Trovatore '' is already cause for concern . That is music he can look at five years from now . Maybe . I 'm not even sure I would want him singing Rodolfo just yet . His voice , which is actually quite beautiful , needs time to mature and grow naturally into whatever it is going to finally be . Judging from this recital and a couple of other things I have heard him in ( none , alas , in person ) he seems to be in the possession of a rather beautiful instrument , and seems to have a fair amount of musicality in his nature . So much the better.Signor Grigolo should continue to develop for the next few years in those smaller houses which dot the European continent . He should resist , at all costs , being enticed to come to America and parade his stuff , like a trained seal , in one of American 's Great Big 3000 Seat Singing Barns , like - dare I say it - the Met.Do n't go west , young man . Not yet . We 'll still be here when you 're ready .	1
VITTORIO GRIGOLO . Watch for the name to soon be on the lips of every lover of opera - especially the good old chestnuts from the Italian repertoire . Grigolio is only 33 - a fine age for a tenor to begin to sing the major roles - but he seems to have it all , from strikingly handsome good looks , soul , rather phenomenal stage presence , and a voice that can fill a huge hall or reduce an audience to utter silence as he almost whispers sotto voce phrases . This is an important recording because it allows us to have a starting point ( excluding the very popular recording 'Vittorio ' that offered love songs about four years ago - perfect for that young age ) . His technique in vocal production , the range of his voice that seems to find no strain , his immersion in the roles represented on this very generous sampling , and the above all the extraordinary beauty of the sound he produces are all in evidence on this recital . He is amazing : he seems ready to assume the mantle of the next great Italian tenor.This well engineered recording does n't have a weak track . The orchestra is the Teatro , Regio di Parma resident orchestra conducted by Pier Giorgio Morandi and while the orchestral sound is not the most opulent it is at all times in keeping with the colors of emotional range of Grigolo . The arias are all from the works of Donizetti , Verdi and Puccini and for now that narrow range seems fine . But instead of paying attention to the minutia , the major point here is to listen to the glories that come from this young gold mine of a tenor . No matter how many times we have heard 'Che gelida Manina ' or 'Una furtiva lacrima ' or 'E lucevan le stelle ' , hearing Grigolo makes them sound fresh and alive and transporting . The same can be said for all the arias he has elected to present to us as his first operating outing . Sit back , listen to the not only the perfection of phrasing and technique , but listen to the beauty of this extraordinary new gift to the opera world . He is astonishing ! Grady Harp , October 10	1
The ratings distribution so far is a bit on the generous side I think - I would on balance say it 's not a 5 but also not less than a 3 . Firstly the material is a good cross section that should stretch and grow an early comer to opera as it goes a bit beyond the normal fare - but not too far . The voice for me is pleasant enough but has that breathy/gaspy aspect that can distract and I think Calleja is better for this class of voice . Its interesting to compare Vittorio 's version of Puccini 's 'Firenze & egrave ; come un albero fiorito ( from Gianni Schicchi ) ' with that of Juan Diego FlorezTenorto hear the marked difference and realise that he 's not really in Florez ' class . I was attracted to sample Vittorio 's music further after seeing him in the Rigoletto live in Mantua version of the opera , where he plays the Duke . It has to be the best Duke I 've seen in a Rigoletto , strong , capable , testosterone charged and with the looks and moves that are very convincing - he sings his heart out , so see it if you can track it down somewhere .	1
`` Red Velvet Car '' marks Heart 's first album of new material in six years . The last album , `` Jupiter 's Darling '' kind of snuck in under the radar . `` Red Velvet Car '' however is roaring down the road . Ann and Nancy Wilson are back with their best album in a long time . If you 're looking for a return to the 80 's sound that brought them huge succes , you wo n't find it here . If however you are a fan of `` Little Queen '' or `` Dog & Butterfly '' you 're in for a great ride . The single `` WTF '' ( for those wondering , those words do not appear anywhere in the lyrics ) is about those moments when you have been bashing your head against the wall looking for the answer when you have to decide `` which bridge to cross and which bridge to burn '' . The song is the hardest rocker on the album and shows that the Wilson sisters still have it . Other stand out tracks are `` Wheels '' ( another rocker ) , `` Hey You '' ( with Nancy on lead vocal ) , `` Saffronia 's Mark ' ( which sort of recalls `` Dream Of The Archer '' ) and the Lovemonger 's track , `` Sand '' . The album is a return to what made Heart so great . Fans of the 70 's era Heart will find much to enjoy in `` Red Velvet Car '' .	1
I was FORTUNATE to see Heart on tour this summer . SIZZLING ! Ann still has the voice and Nancy can play ! They played a lot of `` Red Velvet Car '' including the title track.Normally , I DREAD the `` new stuff '' when I see the older bands perform ... .UGH ! It just is missing SOMETHING . Not so for Heart . While this release is certainly notas GOOD as their debut ... .its a FINE LISTEN . It 's clear that Ann can still sing VERY WELL , and is the `` intriguing '' creative songwriter , we LOVE . There is n't a tracklike `` Barracuda '' here , but the CD has some GOOD cuts like `` Queen City '' and `` WTF '' . ( I have to disagree with some other reviewer 's trashing of the lyrics ... .nothing WORSE , in my opinion , then the every other worded profanities that pass for lyricsin `` today 's music '' . Ann Wilson is an accomplished lyricist and a `` poet '' . ) With Heart ... .you 'll never get the `` headscratching '' lyrics of the classic rockers , but you `` DO GET '' a FINE LISTEN from a band that even with some new memberscan still ROCK OUT . REFRESHING ... .considering what is out there these days ... Heart is a FINE inspiration to all of us 70 's rock fans who played Heart 's albumstill the grooves wore , and partied until dawn.Yes , Heart `` Rolls On '' , maybe now with all the original members , but Ann and Nancy STILL ROCK ! If you are FORTUNATE to see them LIVE do it ! Then kick back and listen to this very `` smooth sounding '' audio journey ... .LOVE 'EM ! FOREVER !	1
I had such high hopes for this album ... the Wilson sisters seemed to be on a real roll . 2004 's JUPITER 'S DARLING was one of Heart 's strongest , most diversified albums to date , while the group 's live shows were better than ever . Even critics , who 've been less than fair and/or kind when it comes to acknowledging the band 's impact and importance in and on rock history , have started cutting the group some slack , begrudgingly granting them ( some of ) their just dues.All of this , coupled with the addition of Ben Mink as producer ( who did such a good job on Ann Wilson 's 2007 solo project HOPE & GLORY ) seemed to point to good things . The icing on the cake was the announcement that Nancy Wilson would be sharing more of the lead vocals , as well as the fact that there would be alot more harmonizing between the sisters.Sadly , most of this did not come to pass ... .Nancy only handles lead vocals on two tracks , the harmonies are pretty much nowhere to be found , and the production , while nice , is pretty run of the mill on many tracks . Toss in a handful of songs that are just O.K. , and RED VELVET CAR is an album that , while enjoyable , could have been so much more.The disc kicks things off with `` There You Go '' , arguably the best track on the album . Anchored by a slinky , sly arrangement , the instrumentation is minimal , but oh , so , powerful . However , it 's the vocals that really shine here ... Ann 's lead is sultry and strong , while Nancy 's harmonies are pitch perfect . Snaking in and around each other , this cut , more than any other , showcases what COULD have been . Brilliant ! I 'm not as big a fan of `` WTF . '' I certainly enjoyed the cut live , but it just does n't translate in it 's recorded version ... on the one hand , it seems like an unfinished demo . On the other , it seems like a blatant attempt to prove that , at 60 and 56 , the sisters can still ROCK . Weak lyrics and a so-so lead vocal just buttress the question `` This is the first single ? ! ? `` Next up is the disc 's atmospheric title track . Awash with a killer lead vocal , an alternately sweeping and intimate arrangement and pristine instrumentation , `` Red Velvet Car '' is one of those tracks where it all just comes together . Complete with thoughtful lyrics ( `` So pull your weary bones inside/You can sleep when I drive '' ) , `` Red Velvet Car '' is a definite high point.Both `` Red Velvet Car '' and the following track , `` Queen City '' , could have easily fit on any one of the first four or five Heart albums . Full of rock & roll attitude ~ `` swagger '' is the best way to describe Ann 's lead vocal ~ the track actually has an acoustic core , which just adds to it 's overall cool vibe . Yes , points are deducted for some weak lyrics , but it still ultimately lands in the `` Win '' column ! Ditto `` Hey You '' , the first of Nancy 's lead vocals . A folk-tinged acoustic strummer , the lilt in Wilson 's voice is just downright captivating . By the time things get to the `` Na , na , na , na , na '' bridge , well , it 's just magic ! This cut is sweet , seductive , simple and sassy , all rolled together . And I just LOVE the line `` Until the darkness and the light/Decide to rhyme ! '' Definitely gives `` There You Go '' a run for it 's money as my favorite cut on RVC ! '' Wheels ? '' Not so much . The second half of RED VELVET CAR is really rather hit-and-miss , and this track is a prime example of that . It 's not that the song is bad , it 's just ... eh . The arrangement is somewhat generic , while Ann 's lead vocal is decent at best . The lyrics are nothing special either , so , in the end , you have a cut that 's basically just filler . And with only ten tracks on the whole album , well , that 's absolutely unacceptable . `` Safronia 's Mark '' fares much better ... there 's a quirky edginess to the song that 's exhilerating . Part `` Dog & Butterfly '' , part `` Kick It Out '' , the arrangement is downright hypnotic , while Ann 's vocal dances over the picturesque lyrics ( `` Suddenly she 's standing there before you/Reaching out her arms just like a child/Her face is like a door you want to walk through/Cause something deep inside just might belong to you '' ) . Another one of RVC 's true gems ! `` Death Valley '' falls into the `` Miss '' column ... .once again , it seems like the sisters are trying to PROVE they can ROCK ( Ladies , you do n't have to `` prove '' anything ... that was all made clear years ago ! ) . Bloated , cliched , dull ... this is one of the disc 's biggest missteps . What works on stage does n't always translate to recordings.The exact opposite can be said about `` Sunflower '' , Nancy 's second lead vocal ... .the song is fresh , dynamic and fun . Blessed with an airy arrangement , a sweet , yet smoldering lead and gorgeous harmony vocals , it all comes together perfectly , resulting in a track that just pulls you in . Add smart lyrics to the mix ( `` Sunflower/Never steal your eyes away/Even when the seasons change/A little sun - a little rain '' ) and you have exactly what RVC needed more of.Things wrap up with `` Sand '' , an almost note-for-note rerecording of a track from the Wilson 's 1997 Lovemongers side project , WHIRLYGIG . If you 're going to rerecord a song , especially one of your own , you have to add something new to it , freshen it up , change things around . On an album that 's already pretty short , with some what of a hit-and-miss vibe , to not do so just seems kind of ... .chintzy . Or lazy.And that 's one of the saddest things about RED VELVET CAR ... .Ann and Nancy Wilson have NEVER been lazy . They proved long ago that they are true rockers , with a lot to say and contribute to the world of rock . Here 's hoping the next Heart album allows them to stretch a bit more , providing us with a Cadillac-esque vehicle , versus a sedan . ( As with all my reviews , I 'm giving the disc an extra half a star for including the lyrics ) .	1
I thought it be like Jupiter 's Darling ( which i find it to be in my top 5 of their best albums ) but this album was quite good.Some very catchy tunes and rock on songs like WTF & Death Valley.They seem to never let down and this album certainly does not at all .	1
I love this CD . One of my favs was the title track , but all the songs were excellent ! This is one for the Heart collection .	1
First , let 's do the easy part- get the bonus 12 track CD instead of the 10 track one . The 2 bonus songs are both good so that makes it a real simple choice.Now on to the album : This is a strong release from a veteran band . It is a lot of acoustic numbers with some rockers mixed in . There really is not a weak track on the disc- they all are good . It strikes me as a release from an older band comfortable in what they do and they 're not trying to reinvent their sound here . They 're happy to do what they do well and leave it at that . Fans of the band will no doubt be pleased with this CD- 4.5 stars .	1
I am NEVER disapointed in any release that either Ann or Nancy Wison are involved in . I have been a fan since I got `` Crazy On You '' on a 7 '' single ! We were ALL younger but the girls have never faultered in the following years . `` Red Velvet Car '' was well worth the wait ! I heard songs from the album live prior to it 's release and was anxious for the release ! The title track 's lyrics touched my soul and is very uplifting for someone like me who has felt in a funk . Ann again reached out to my inner soul with lyric 's , `` Do n't sit crying in your room stealing candy from the jar '' . `` Safronia 's Mark '' sounds like classic Heart with a mandolin intro , into a rip , roaring rocker with mystical lyrics . Nancy takes over vocals on `` Hey You '' and sounds just as good as always . Closing with the beautiful `` Sand '' that has been a live staple now a great studio version to own ! If you love Ann & Nancy , you will LOVE `` Red Velvet Car '' ! Simply put ! ~Kevin	1
`` Red Velvet Car '' is Heart 's first studio album since 2004 's underrated `` Jupiter 's Darling . '' If you listen to the discs back to back you 'll hear a lot of similarities , and some key differences . Unlike the mostly fast-paced `` Jupiter 's Darling , '' which marked Heart 's true return to their classic sound , `` Red velvet Car '' smolders a slow burn.Despite their return to the sound that Heart stars in the 70s , Ann and Nancy Wilson ( with producer Ben Mink ) manage to craft an album that honors that old sound and twists it in a new , interesting direction .	1
I love Red Velvet Car . It reminds me of the great first five albums Heart put out . But I have to ask-Why did they stick a live version of `` Never '' in the middle of the disc ? For me , it just seems so out of place . I have n't really kept my dislike of their 80 's stuff a secret , so to me , this song just takes away from the whole continuity of the album . Now , `` Magic Man '' live at the end is another story . You just ca n't beat that song live . It rocks , and every time I hear it live , I say `` that was a song meant to be played live '' . It sounds better than the studio version in my opinion . Anyway , on my playlist I just take out `` Never '' , and the album is just the way it should be.I love Heart ! They never needed anyone else to write their stuff . They are great with their own stuff . I guess they had to do it during the arena rock , big hair days , but for me , I just did n't get it . Welcome back to the good ol days ladies , and congrats to you for getting into the RRHOF ! woohoo !	1
I love this new album by Heart . It has a good mix of straight up rock songs with slower songs . My favorite track is `` WTF '' . This song is about trying to move in life after making mistakes and experiencing set backs . This is an excellent rock song that pulses with energy established by the beat of drummer Ben Smith.A totally opposite song is `` Sand '' . It is a very moving song about remembering a special friend who has passed away . Ann and Nancy sound so good by simply playing the acoustic guitar here . This song is very touching . The title song is an gem of a tune about coming to the aid to a friend in need . Ann 's vocals touch my heart on this song . `` There You Go '' is a song about living life on the edge . Ann 's voice sounds very sultry here . Nancy shines on lead vocals on the track `` Hey You '' . This is a pretty love song . Nancy plays the auto harp on this song . I like the lovely sound this instrument makes . `` Saffronica 's Mark '' is a song about being under the spell of a mysterious woman . Nancy plays the mandolin on this track . Ann sings the lead vocals on this song . I love the soft tone of the tune `` Sunflower '' . `` Queen City '' is a song about survival in life . I love the metaphor of a person living in a leaky boat trying to hang on with all of their strength . `` Death Valley '' is a song about all the things that can go wrong on a road trip . This is another excellent rock song . `` Red Velvet Car '' is Heart 's best album of the 21st century .	1
I have always loved these ladies , right from day one . They have always been able to create simply amazing tunes and well , I 'm happy to say that trend continues here . Every song feels fresh and alive and not at all dated or whatever . Some things or people get better with age and these girls are one of those things/people.Rock on girls , rock on ! Check it out ! !	1
Excellent CD - He just keeps improving . I'veonly been into him for a couple of years but already have 4 CDs . He is a typical country with a little extra . The more you listen to one of his CDs , the better it gets .	1
I would recommend this CD for anyone that enjoys the old style country , his voice is soothing and the songs are great !	1
The title of this LP/CD is apt . Not unlike spending a hazy day along a backwater river , somewhere unknown . It 's lovely , really , and the harmonies dip beneath the water , resurfacing shortly for a little air . Highly recommended .	1
Lovely , dreamy , hallucinatory , warm , brilliant . This is a very good album , and I 'm happy that I stumbled upon it . Highly recommended .	1
I happened to catch a small write-up in Rolling Stone some time ago , and on a whim picked up this amazing little CD ( I say little because the album clocks in at about 36 mins ) . I was a little slow to warm up to it at first , but the more I listened to it the more I liked it . The way to describe this album ? A unique mixture ! This album successfully tows the line between polished and passion . First thing I noticed where the vocals - top notch blue-eyed soul that would make Daryl Hall proud . Rarely do we get to hear someone who can sing with this type of rawness while also sounding accessible . Second - the production - again it 's polished but not so much so that you ca n't make out the individual instruments . I love albums with this sound : crisp , punchy , raw , but not so raw that it sounds like it was recorded on a tape recorder . Third - the band ! There 's not many R & B ; bands out there so it 's refreshing to hear they 're still out there ... and sound like this.I guess you could describe this album as having a retro sound . The songs are very much in the mold of late 60 's Motown , with a modern production values . If you 're looking for an album with that 's equally packed with grooves and hook , then this is your CD . Oh , and it you 're a vinyl collector like I am , you can find a vinyl copy of this album on their web site .	1
Where has Fitz been my whole life . I ca n't say enough as to how good this disc is . Just want more	1
Is it too late to buy stock in these guys ? I saw them in concert in Chicago in mid-February having heard only one song ( the infectious `` Moneygrabber '' ) previously , and I loved the show ! They 're very tight , very personable , and their music is a wonderful blend of Hall & Oates and Motown 's finest . `` Moneygrabber '' is one of my favorite songs of the past 5 years . I really like 6 of the other 9 songs , and the other 3 ( the slower songs ) are n't bad . All in all , one of the most auspicious debuts in years.To really get a feel for this band 's sound and flair , check out their `` Moneygrabber '' video on YouTube.I hope the band gets a break like being on `` Late Night with David Letterman '' . I know Dave and Paul would love 'em , and I think most of America would , too .	1
A great record you can listen to from beginning to end . When was the last time you did that ? Jumps out of your speakers because it sounds so different . Love the cuts : Moneygrabber , Pickin ' up the Pieces , and Mr. President . Noell 's vocals are wonderful -- she brings a lot to the party . What I like most is it 's different , fresh , - a treasured gem mined from the wasteland of American Pop music today . Finally ! A great `` time capsule '' album for 2011 . Had never heard of them . My husband serving in Iraq heard them in the middle of the desert listening to the AF radio network ... and thankfully sent me the record because I 'm from Philly . Those reviewing claiming it sounds like Hall & Oats - Daryl Hall all but handed this band his torch while he sang MoneyGrabber on Live @ Daryls house - it 's an awesome jam with the `` blue eyed soul '' master himself . Check it out !	1
To say that this album is a amazing is an understatement ! For the first time this CD was placed into my library it is my go to CD for gatherings , reading , or jamming out . I love this use of the instruments it has such a classic feel with modern twists .	1
I first heard Fitz and the Tantrums on Live From Daryl 's House . I 've learned of some great acts there , including Matt Nathanson and Diane Birch . However , I 've NEVER been moved to buy an artist 's CD BEFORE I finished listening to their first song as I was with Fitz . They are energetic , original , and retro without sounding like copies of any other artists . Certainly a perfect fit with Daryl , but awesome by themselves . Seldom do I go more than a couple of days without listening to them , as limited as their current material is . Ca n't wait for more , going to see them in St Louis in Feb , sure they will be even better in person . If I could give them 8 stars I would !	1
This band has a great and funky sound to it . They always use strange and new sounds in their songs . The lyrics are catchy , the songs are n't very repetitive , and the album has an energetic thesis . The only thing that I did n't like is that practically every song had to do with lust , love , romance , and break-ups . I , personally , hate that kind of thing so I wanted to make mention of that.Otherwise , I 'd compare this band to The Sounds .	1
Missed this band at Lollapalooza this year but had some friends tell me it was one of the best shows of the festival . Checked out this album and ca n't believe I missed them . Every song on here is catchy and single-worthy . MoneyGrabber is the first single ( great video on youtube if you want an idea of what they sound like ) and it 's easy to hear why - infectious hook and extremely danceable music . But the rest of the album is just as good - the music manages to sound like a throwback and something brand new at the same time . Great vocals from both singers . Even the ballads are catchy . I have n't been this into a complete album ( vs one or two songs ) in a long time ! They 're playing the Telluride Blues and Brews this year so I 'll definitely be catching them there .	1
This ablum is purely epic . It 's beast- it attacks you and pins you down so hard , you ca n't do anything but listen in awe . The beginning of each song is intense and so original . When I listened to this , I had to put everything I was doing away and focus only on the songs . It 's all about a zombie apocalypse- does it really get any better than this ? No . It 's absolutely impossible .	1
This is an awesome EP . It really shows off how great DVP is . If your looking for a quick hardcore fix this is a great EP to get it	1
I like my music with some serious soul in it . Not the artificial soul of what passes for modern R & B ; I mean real stuff that comes from the gut . JJ Grey 's new CD `` Georgia Warhorse '' is one of the most soulful albums I 've heard in a long time.Let me start with my favorites . `` Got ta Know '' is a slow and sensitive ballad that crescendos into a powerful guspel-filled jam . `` Hide and Seek '' is some serious swamp rock with a killer guitar riff and hook . `` Georgia Warhorse '' provides some great swamp blues about - what else ? - the indestructible insect that the song is named after . `` Sweetest Thing '' reminds me of the type of mid-tempo soul that Otis Redding might do ( and Grey 's voice is very comparable ) .Really , all the songs on this CD are quite different but there is n't one that is a `` filler . '' They are all quite good and Gray 's raspy vocals combined with the songs ' semi-raw production make this a real treat to listen to.If you are a fan of old ( new ) soul a la Marc Broussard , JJ Grey and Mofro 's `` Georgia Warhorse '' will be right up your alley .	1
Definitely a `` swampy '' soul band . This is the best of their last three CD 's . Great musicianship and vocals . This CD is not quite as `` polished '' as the previous two , which is a good thing . I love the fact that they stick to their roots ... not about to compromise for the almighty dollar . Look forward to seeing them live.If you like blues and soul music , you should pick this one . You will not find a more original sounding band.Highly recommended .	1
Brittney Wright is a breath of fresh air to the gospel music industry . I love her songwriting ability and her ability to interpret the heart of God . Wonderful project .	1
Headbanging from start to finish . The pace never lets up . It 's a great , fast-paced CD . With a little more variety it could be better , but perhaps it 's the simplicity that makes it such a great listen .	1
I saw these guys live , and decided to check them out . I for one decided to get the special edition and let my tell you , it was worth it . The cd itself is awesome . Then the dvd interviews all the guys of the band plus the mangager . If your into that , like I am , then it was pretty cool . Also has three songs recorded live on it , which was fun to watch them play again . If you like As I Lay Dying this cd is a pretty close sound . Do they sound the exact same ? No . I still enjoy As I Lay Dying more , but I am also a huge AILD fan as well . These guys a true metal sound , and you will love it .	1
Most people say this is MMIs best CD to date . Not sure if i agree but its definitely a great one . Some really great lyrics here .	1
I 'll start off saying that I do really like the album . It 's heavy , quick , and shows the bands talents . MMI reminds me of old BMTH and how they should have stayed . Apologies was excellent IMO and Monuments did n't quite live up to the debut . The clean vocals were more apparent , though still much better then what alot of other bands have done , the album is a little monotone but not too noticable . If you liked the debut , give Monument a chance . After a few listens you 'll fall back in love .	1
I do understand the negativity that is directed towards this album . If you have heard `` Apologies Are For the Weak '' , the sound on `` Monument '' is n't much different . However , I can not relate ; `` Monument '' is beautifully brutal . This album , in no way , is mainstream . With the exception of one song , the entire album is relentless . The songs do not sound the same as the first album , but ... you could play the two CDs back to back and feel as though they are on the same album . What this album could have used is more explosive breakdowns with guitar solos overlaying them and longer , epic songs . I would love to hear an eight minute song from this band . Whatever the case , this album is thoroughly enjoyable and deserves more than one listen .	1
Anything by Blake Shelton is awesome . This guy can sing ! ! I always look for anything by him and have all of his CDS .	1
Blake Shelton , enough said , his music is nice to listen to ... Like him and his music ... Have other CD 's by him and had to get the song ... Who are you when I 'm not looking.. a few others are good too..	1
This is a very good song . as a late comer to listening to blake shelton or rather listening and not knowing who the artist was . i have come to become a fan.. great job	1
For the most part this is a very good , albeit , short , cd . Shelton has a good voice and mixes it up pretty well with duet partners on a couple of cuts .	1
I honestly had no idea what to expect . For some reason I was thinking hip hop , but decided to take a chance . I love the entire album/CD.Awesome purchase .	1
Calvin , Ready to hear so more southern soul music Calvin , I 'm lovin your music and I loved the tribute to Bobby Womack songs as well . Waiting on your next project a true fan of your music . Would love to see you in concert , please try to stop in Memphis .	1
In his fifteen year career , Calvin Richardson has done what a lot of artists wish to do- release quality material in a consistent manner . His lingering problem , however , has been promotion . Since his debut album `` Country Boy '' in 1999 , he has released great product , but left the labels constantly clueless on how to market him . He is very much a `` middle of the road '' kind of artist . He has one foot in neo-soul and the other in contemporary R & B ; , and meets the two somewhere in between . He is revered in the `` chitlin circuit '' , but is n't exactly a Southern Soul performer . Strangely enough , his lack of promotion at major labels has worked to his advantage . On an independent , he has more creative control as a singer , songwriter and producer . Before you look at it as a bad thing , consider this : Calvin 's biggest hit was `` Keep On Pushin ' '' - a song that he solely wrote and produced.On his fifth album- and third for the Shanachie label- `` America 's Most Wanted '' , Calvin is in the producer 's seat for the second time , following 2008 's criminally underrated `` When Love Comes '' . The album is n't a political record , if you judge it on the title . Actually , the title track `` America 's Most Wanted '' is about him dating a supermodel . The only song that actually deals with social commentary is the track `` Monday Morning '' . On this effort , he goes for completely live instrumentation , which is a complement to Calvin 's voice as well as his choice of material . On the song `` Never Do You Wrong '' , he reassures his significant other about his fidelity , despite the negative perception of musicians on the road . `` Feels Like We 're Sexin ' '' finds him being sexually aroused by a female dancing partner . He decides to turn his life around for his partner on the song `` Thug Livin ' '' . Though most of this album is ballad heavy , the only uptempo songs are `` You Possess My Body '' and the closing track `` Paradise '' . The verdict on this album ? `` America 's Most Wanted '' is Calvin Richardson 's best album , hands down .	1
I 'm a Brian Simpson fan , and this South Beach release is very nice all the way through the CD.Look forward to hearing what he releases next !	1
El DeBarge 's first album in 16 years delivers ! I did n't even know this was out until I read a review on AllMusic.com - they gave it 4 stars so I had to check it out . I do n't know if I can say I was `` pleasantly surprised '' since I thought El 's last couple of albums were solid , but I was surprised to hear that this late into his career he was able to pull out his best album.The first thing that struck was his voice - it sounds exactly the same as it did in 1986 ! Still youthful ... still has that range . The next that hit me was how every song is so good . This is a definite must have for any R & B ; ran . The album does n't follow any trends , but it does n't does n't ignore them either . It sounds modern , while also sounding timeless . There 's a few rap cameos ( most notably 50 Cent ) which add a little variety , but make no mistake - this is El DeBarge 's album and he shines through out.Every song seems to be carefully arranged with gorgeous arrangements and melodic vocals . Who would 've thought that in late 2010 El Debarge could pull of such a smooth album ? !	1
I placed this cd in the cd player of my SUV and every song was like a personal love letter to me from his heart . I truly love and adore El DeBarge . I am thankful that he was given a Second Chance . I love you El DeBarge , and this music is truly some of your personal best . I look forward to hearing from you for years to come ! E	1
El DeBarge seemed like a forgotten about legend of music until he made a surprise comeback on the BET Awards show earlier this year . Given the full time to go through all his classics like Rhythm of The Night and Stay With Me , it was clear that El DeBarge had not lost his gift of performing nor his silky smooth voice . Now only a few months later comes Second Chance and this comeback album is how a comeback album should be done ! El DeBarge 's music is as smooth and soulful as it ever was and the music is brand new with a touch of the vintage style we have all come to know and love . Beautiful instrumentation , arrangements , lyrics and voice . The album is grown folks music ; sexy , mature , and appropriate for any situation . There 's really not much more to say . Some legends try to stay `` relevant '' by trying to make trendy music instead of updating their sound ... .not El DeBarge . Instead he crafts another timeless piece of music that can comfortably next to any of his releases . Although Fabolous & 50 Cent are featured they do n't really offend nor enhance the tracks . They blend in rather perfectly and do n't sound completely out of place or off topic.The bottom line is that this cd is a must have for fans of El DeBarge , R & B ; and Soul music . This one 's a no brainer . 5 stars .	1
this cd is very good , however because radio does not play the songs on it no one really knows how good it is , if you have n't heard it . radio needs to feature at least once a week or more a complete cd of an artist . ca n't you guys work this out with your program directors.they play one song off of this cd lay with you but there is plenty others that are good i 'm not gon na name them purchase the cd or call your radio station and complain.i do n't listen to a whole lot of music radio because of the same songs played over all day & night . this is 2011 ca n't we slip in a new format . help the artist do n't hurt them .	1
I CHALLENGE ANYONE NOT TO RATE THIS CD 5 STARS , COME ON FOLKS THIS IS QUALITY STUFF IN THE AGE OF FAKE MUSIC AND OVERATED ARTIST THIS IS PERFECTION ... .GRAB IT OR FOREVER HOLD THY MOUSE.I purchase this cd as a gift to me and oh boy what a perfect gift for the best person in my life me . When a person love themself as much as i love me only the best can do , an amazingly beautifully produce album ... this one is going to get played to death ... i am very happy with this purchase..I HAVE BEEN PLAYING THIS CD NON STOP SINCE I GOT IT LOVE IT LOVE IT BEST IN YEARS EVERY TRACK ... ..JUST LIKE HEAVEN TO ME BABY ... .	1
In an era where people get recording contracts and rely solely on scantily-clad outfits , abrasive lyrics ( void of character ) , and Auto-Tune , it 's a REFRESHING relief to see the return of El DeBarge . I 've always loved his voice and his abilities as a true artist and musician . He is truly touched with a blessing of song and is a phoenix to have been able to rise above the demons that plagued him and his family during their lives.I hope that this album is only the tip of the iceberg and he will continue to represent and be the epitome of what an R & B ; crooner should be . He 's the definition of cool and effortless song . This album is awesome ... El DeBarge could sing the dictionary and I 'd buy it !	1
I think this is the first cd in years where I love every song from beginning to end . I am happy that El Debarge is back .	1
A nice and smooth record , with the exception of the Christmas tracks , not a dull song ! strong production reigns on this one , El De barge vocals are just wonderful , brilliant return to a format that has been getting redundant and stale in the last few years . a must in your collection and a good gift during the holidays !	1
I 've had Eugen Jochum 's highly respected set of Haydn 's `` London '' symphonies in my collection for quite some time ( Haydn : The 12 'London ' Symphonies ) , but have always had reservations about them . There are two issues : first , the London Philharmonic produces a sound that 's almost too big for this music . Jochum and the Londoners also make the music sound a little too modern . Jochums ' slightly rounded off approach to Haydn is immediately apparent when comparing his reading of the 93rd symphony to George Szell 's pithier , more classically inclined reading . Across the board , Jochum sounds slightly homogenized whereas Szell sounds edgier and more authentic.How do you articulate the feeling of `` this is it '' when you listen to performances such as these ? I do n't know , but for $ 12 and change from an amazon reseller , you can find out for yourself .	1
This a collection of Szell Haydn symphonies . The earliest here were released in the mid 1950 's , including # s 88,104 , the first of two 97s , and 99 . # s 92 and 93-98 , including the second # 97 , date from the mid 1960 's . There was also an early 50s # 92 not re-released here . I wish that he had recorded # s 100-103 to complete the London Symphonies . All here are terrific , with Szell 's signature precision and grace , but these are also relaxed when necessary and , especially in # s 95-98 ( including the second # 97 ) , a bit moreprobing-there is much depth here-try the second movements of # s 97 and 98 which are searching and deeply felt . # s 93 and 94 are very good but slightly topped by Eugen Jochum 's LPO # 94-what winds- andColin Davis 's quicker RC0 # 93 . # s 88 and 104 shared an lp . The sound is not quite as good as his later Londons and 104 lacks some repeats . I am happy to have them , however , and play Szell 's perfect performance of the perfect # 96 when gloom threatens.Peers : # 88 Jochum/BPO , Davis/RCO , Reiner/CS # 92 Davis/RCO , Leitner/Capella Coloniensis , Rosbaud/BPO ( best Haydn disc ever w/ its equally great # 104 ) # 93 Davis , Jochum/Dresden # 94 Jochum/LPO , Davis # 95 Jochum/Dresden # 96 owned by Szell # 97 ditto # 98 Leitner , Klemperer/EMI # 99 Kubelik/BRSO , Davis/RC0 , Tate/EC0 # 104 Davis/RCO , Jochum/LPO , Klemperer/EMI , Tate/EC0 , Rosbaud/BPO	1
Asylum is the Disturbed music you instantly recognize and devour . Disturbed knows their sound and does n't tread too far from anything other than the razor-sharp chords and David Draiman 's punch-you-in-your-face lyrics . But the album does n't start out like you 'd expect . Remnants is an instrumental , not at all Disturbed-like , but a great intro to the title song , Asylum . As Draiman barks `` Release me ! '' we know Disturbed is back.One of the best songs is Never Again , where Draiman embraces his Jewish roots . It 's about the Holocaust , but has lyrics that might as well be spitting into the face of Iran and other enemies of Israel : You dare to tell me that there never was a HolocaustYou think that history will leave the memory lostAnother Hitler using fear to controlYou 're gon na fail this time for the world to seeNow only if we can get the Israeli army to listen to this music instead of Kei $ ha.Another treat is Innocence , a typical Disturbed hit which will have you banging your head in seconds . The 'hidden ' track comes as a pleasant surprise . It 's a cover of U2 's `` I Still Have n't Found What I 'm Looking For . '' This is n't for everyone , but considering the show they just put on , Disturbed deserves to cover another classic , as they create new ones themselves.Disturbed is five-for-five in their decade of storming the stages , and let 's hope for many more .	1
I love Disturbed , their music is always so intense . The lyrics in most of their songs really speak to me and the music is like a force unto itself .	1
Album is superb but it has a hidden track ( a remake of I still have n't found what I 'm lookin for ) that I can not get to play.. It downloads on the computer OK but is totally blank when I play it.. I had the same problem when I downloaded it from the site as well..Any suggestions ? Somebody finally told me that due to it being a HIDDEN TRACK that one has to wait over a minute & a half & then the song starts..	1
Well well ... .here we are at Disturbed 's fifth album . And it pretty much sounds like the other four , with varying shades of guitar and Draiman 's voice . You 've heard this all before , and if you like Disturbed you 'll like this . There are reviewers who blast these guys for not trying new things , and my thoughts are `` Why change a formula that works ? '' . Donegan has become more expressive on the guitar which is certainly nice , I fear he 's always been buried beneath Draiman 's voice . While I have enjoyed their previous remakes of classics , I can do without the U2 and Judas Priest songs this round.All in all , it 's what we expect to hear from Disturbed , and it 's as good as any other album they 've put out .	1
If you are a big Disturbed fan , this song is more of the same from the last two albums . If you want something different and exciting , this song Asylum provides a tiny bit of that but not enough . It 's still a good song , but I 'm 'disturbed ' that this is the album title song , hopefully this is n't an indication that they think this is the best song on the forthcoming release . If so , I 'm already bummed .	1
I thought Indestructible was outstanding and pretty much their best since the untouchable The Sickness . Asylum , is just about as good as Indestructible , and perhaps , with more spins , even better . The one thing that can make digesting Disturbed challenging at times is how they borrow from themselves so often ... so many riffs , songs , and especially vocal passages are reminiscent of things they have done in the past . BUT ... great is great so I personally do not see reason to use the similarity to prior works as a significant negative . The twists on Asylum for me are found in the guitarwork ... . Dan Donegan just keeps growing and getting better and better as a writer and more intricate with his lead guitar work . All other instruments ( drums , vocals , bass are the classic style and expectations of quality that Disturbed deliver routinely ) ... but the guitar really has taken progressive steps more and more over time . The first album was mostly all rhythm and no lead ... this album , like Indestructible keeps the inspired and unique rhythm parts but infuses more lead over the top . To me Indestructible brought Donegan really riffing things up with the lead showing that he can hang with the Avenged Sevenfolds out there . This one , sort of brings out the old classic Judas Priest melodic inspired and memorable solo lines . It is very throwback classic in that sense . Great patterns ... I listen and think this album was possibly constructed to be a jammer for Rock Band usage ... it full of riffs that stand out because they are melodic more than just being blisteringly fast . This work is even evident on the great intro track to the album which slowly builds up into the first song . So , it is really the guitar work here that really makes this a stand out album for me . But , I must point out , that is no knock on the rest , Disturbed continue to have very distinguished and unique vocals and , to me , the best drum work out there . They are the perfect blend of unique , modern and classic all rolled in to one ... as they were from the start . Disturbed command attention and are one of the key saviors in modern metal bands that prove metal is alive and well and growing.As I often feel with the 5 star rating system ... I am not comfortable giving this only a 4 star rating though I am not sure I would give it a full 5 if I could give a 4.5 . So , out of fairness , I believe I should round up in these situations . My favorite songs here include the intro through the title track , The Animal and Another Way to Die , but I do like all the other original songs too . The song I like the least , by far , is the bonus track cover song ... not nearly as good as their other cover songs of the past ... I just do n't think that song really shines with the Disturbed treatment and I am not much of a U2 fan overall either . Keeping it a `` hidden '' bonus track was wise ... as I do n't think it is worthy of being considered a part of the real album .	1
Solid album , almost as good as Ten Thousand Fists . Just narrowly misses the bar for excellence , but I 'm talking about compared to Ten Thousand Fists and the Sickness . I recommend the album .	1
I just now received my pre-order of Asylum and am currently listening to it . When I finish , I will proceed to jot down my thoughts on each track.Okay as of now I 'm ripping the album , so I have enough time to post on what I just listened to.Remnants- Pretty damn good intro I must say . It 's nothing special but it does fit the mood and I do n't have any complaints about it . That 's for sure ; good guitar work from Dan.Asylum- Having listened to this song since it was released on the internet , I definitely was n't disappointed . I mean , I listened to Another Way to Die first which was n't bad ; it was just pretty generic . However , Asylum kicks in with that evil laugh from previous single `` Inside the Fire '' and a kick ass riff . Dave shouts `` Release me ! '' as he then begins to break out in an aggressive spew of agony-inspired lyrics . This definitely reminds you of the Sickness days and is currently fighting `` Haunted '' for favorite song of all time.Infection- From viewing other reviews , some people seemed not to like this one . It 's only major fault is its repetitiveness , in my opinion . As much as David sings `` *insert something* must die ! `` , you 'd think he wrote this song in his sleep . However , it has an incredibly heavy riff and is full of adrenaline . It has more of `` crude '' sound to it like Disturbed always had . Definitely no clean-cut riffs here . However , I 'm loving his harmonizing vocals here ; as repetitive as they are , I 'm having a hard time keeping them out of my head ... . not that I 'm trying to ; ) Anyways enough said here ; ripping should be done and moving on to the rest of the album ! Please proceed to play some pretty elevator music while you 're waiting for me to finish what looks like another Disturbed-masterpiece.Warrior- Oh , man ! I 'm loving this opening riff . You start off introduced with some great adrenaline-filled guitar work from Danny . Afterwards , Dave follows up with some of his most aggressive vocals yet ! Extremely rough , but in that good way . When it kicks into the chorus , I 'm not paying too much attention to the lyrics as it all just fits great together ... . but what I can hear from the lyrics , they do n't seem to bad . I 'm definitely loving this song . If the rest of the album is like this and is the reason why `` Infection '' is rated so poorly , I do n't see myself being disappointed.Another Way to Die- More Disturbed goodness . If you 're a fan , you 've definitely should 've heard this track by now . You should 've heard it by this VERY early summer . Anyways , it seemed very generic when I heard it back then . However , whoever mixed it on the album did an incredible job . I would n't say it holds a candle to some of the other tracks I 've heard so far , but it definitely does n't sound generic anymore . Anyways , for the most part this song starts out with a melodic intro of Dave 's vocals and some doom-hopeful guitar-work from Dan . From here on out , it 's the same-old Disturbed but the drums have more of a Thrash-Metal influence . The bass is good here . Honestly , nothing wrong with this track . Just not the strongest on the album . Good work guys ! Never Again- Once again , a REALLY good riff compared to past Disturbed albums . There 's no doubt this was a really good effort by the band , but they may have tried too hard . I 'm loving the song , but Dave 's bursting out with really fat-paced vocals while Danny for the most part offers a slower-paced riff . All the members provide some really solid work here . The only problem is they do n't sync as well as they COULD have . That is a small complaint however , as the song is still very good . Awesome solo from our man , Dan here . You can tell he 's definitely improving his guitar-work.The Animal- Interesting intro here . Has more of an electronic sound ... . well until now ; the song kicked in . This sounds promising here ! The beginning definitely reminds you of `` Down with the Sickness '' and the majority of the song has somewhat of a Thrash/Industrial/Disturbed sound to it . I just got to the solo and it was pretty short , but it was still good nonetheless . If I had to pick just ONE reason we always loved Danny , it would be his ability to write solos without feeling the need to show off . It 's still good guitar-work , but it 's major stand-out here is how unique it sounds ! Very haunting and has a more of a `` creepy '' sound to it . My biggest complaint here is VERY similar to the last one . Dave 's the only member trying a little too hard here as he incorporates almost every single one of his past-singing styles into the song here . For the most part , it goes together pretty well here . However , when he goes into the chorus he goes from his extremely aggressive and rough voice ( i.e . Fear or Intoxication ) to his more melodic higher-pitched and extended vocals ( Such as Prayer or Stricken ) . It 's not bad and believe me , it sounds GOOD . The transition just sounds a little awkward . The only fix for that would give it the more `` generic '' sound from past Disturbed albums . Personally , when comparing the two possible 'problems ' , I 'd say this is the lesser of two evils . Still an awesome song and I REALLY enjoyed it.Crucified- The opening riff is once again , very heavy . Almost sounds like something from Alice in Chains . Dave has good vocals here as usual . The guitar work is definitely a stand-out here ; if a bit subtle . That `` Alice in Chains '' -like riff may seem a little weird with Dave 's singing style here but both are very enjoyable . I think the best way to enjoy this song would be to focus on the guitar or the vocals separately . Both are outstanding , but may seem a little `` off '' when put together . I just got to the breakdown and it 's pretty good ; will remind you alot of `` Enough '' . It looks Danny 's breaking out a more high-pitched guitar sound than he 's used to after the breakdown . It 's really good from here on out and definitely syncs with the vocals well . Good song ; for the first beginning half it 's enjoyable with a few SLIGHT `` wtf '' moments here and there . After the breakdown , it all picks up and band brings it together and the song gets better than it already is.Serpentine- Beautiful riff here ; full of emotion . Dave offers some of his most beautiful heart-felt vocals than ever ! I 'm only in the beginning of the song and it 's already great . I now got to the chorus and I think this may be one of the strongest tracks on the album . Johnny just now delivered a kickass bass riff and after I heard it , I now find it easier to hear now that I 'm paying attention to it as well as the rest of the song . REALLY great effort here guys ! ! ! Am loving the breakdown ; definitely well-thought out . The only problem here is how much I 'm enjoying the song . I can find this being a `` One more time ... . '' rinse and repeat . Beautiful song , guys ! Some of their best work.My Child- Was a little disappointed when I first heard this . When I heard the sample during the Uproar tour advertisements , this was my most anticipated track . However , now that I 've listened to it enough , I definitely enjoy it . The only problem here is that with a subject so sensitive to Dave , I figured it 'd FEEL a little more sensitive . Oh , well ; good track nonetheless . Has more of a Thrash feel with the instrumentals and has Dave 's `` rap '' style vocals from the `` The Sickness '' ... . except for the chorus where Dan plays extended riffs and Dave begins to hold his notes as well ... . probably the most heart-felt part of the song . The breakdown 's really good here as well.Sacrifice- The riff here sounds kind of like something from Pantera 's `` Walk '' . Dave delivers his more melodic vocals once again . It all fits together well . The melody and rhythm in this track is great here . It kind of makes me think of `` Stricken '' and `` Facade '' but with this particular album 's feel to it . Daves vocals gradually get more and more aggressive and pissed off as the song progresses . Great pace . The solo once again is good ... . actually , it 's great ! Dan 's most impressive work yet , I 'd have to say . It starts out kinda slow and sounds alot like the one in `` The Animal '' . However , when it kicks in , Dan gives it his all . Great song ! Innocence- As the last track on the album , it really has a `` Thrash '' sound to it , much like the rest . Thrash + Melody = Profit ! Dave starts out with some of his roughest vocals here ; all for the better . The song has an amazing intro to the breakdown ; just listened to it and am currently on the breakdown now ... . Well Dave , Dan and John are n't too hot here . They 're good , but not the stand-out . So who does that leave ? ? ? That 's right ; Mikey on the drums ! ! ! The rest of the song once again picks up as it started.Well , there 's an `` untitled '' track and two live tracks left . Since we already know what `` Stricken '' and Down with the Sickness are , I wo n't need to comment on those . Now for the untitled track : For some reason the song does n't start until about 1.5 minutes in . It really starts off with some non-Disturbed sounding riff . Now I 'm curious as to if this song is a cover . Once Dave 's vocals kicked in , it sounds like NOTHING Disturbed would ever write . Good song , though . The only problem is it sounds a little too happy than what Dave 's vocals have sang in the past . Dan offers a good solo here . Honestly , if someone finds out what this song is , I 'd say it 's the weakest song on the album . Great instrumentals . The only part I 'm not too sure about are the vocals . Considering David Draiman 's singing , when something about them does n't work you just KNOW it was n't been written by Disturbed . During the chorus when he sings `` I 'm still have n't found what I 'm looking for '' , however , he really does prove his vocal potential . It 's just other parts in the song where his vocals sound awkward.Anyways , it 's overall a really great album . I just finished it and like the past four albums , it has its own distinctive sound . I 've mentioned that particular sound a lot . That 's right ; thrash with melody and Disturbed 's own little twists . I 'm not sure where I 'd rank among the past albums as I 'll have to give it about a week of listening . Nevertheless , it is DEFINITELY Disturbed 's best instrumental work yet and you can tell they gave it their all on `` Asylum '' .	1
Asylumis every bit as much a Disturbed album as 2008'sIndestructible . Disturbed pound through every bit of ASYLUM providing an enjoyable , though not revolutionary effort . The album is clich & eacute ; metal with strong , anthemic choruses that often namecheck the title of the song for the fan 's cohesion sake . The beginning of the album lays better than the end , but that is typical of so many efforts today . I believe part of that is that Disturbed 's best , most cutting edge material appears at the forefront . Do n't get me wrong , there is nothing here that is bad by any means , but after a while , the album grows a bit `` same-y '' if you catch my drift.The album opens up strongly with `` Remnants , '' an instrumental cut that builds in intensity and instrumentation . The grand guitar work here foreshadows what is to be a sick display of guitar solos and unabashedly strong guitar riffs . Title cut `` Asylum '' follows , proving to be the ` cream of the crop ' cut of the album opening with a fine bass-driven groove . Often times title cuts disappoint , but `` Asylum , '' much like `` Indestructible '' from Indestructible proves to be a key listen . The refrain for `` Asylum '' is well crafted as far as songwriting appeal and the guitar work is jagged and desirable , archetypical of metal . While `` Asylum '' is by no means the second coming , it is a solid cut and one of the best from this album of the same name . `` The Infection '' is equally as alluring as `` Asylum '' if no moreso . Here frontman David Draiman 's vocals are slightly more present and balanced within the production , adding additional clarity to his vocals . A nice production touch here is a second layer of vocals towards the end of the track which further solidifies `` The Infection 's '' star power on Asylum . Cuts `` Warrior '' and `` Another Way To Die '' are both equally clever , though not revolutionary , though they fall a shade lower in my opinion in comparison to stronger cuts `` Asylum '' and `` The Infection . '' `` Warrior '' like preceding cuts contains strong guitar riffs and a catchy refrain while `` Another Way To Die '' benefits from a slow introduction followed by the typical driving tempi that characterize Disturbed as a band . `` Never Again '' does n't quite live up to the best of ASYLUM , but it was another standout cut in my mind . Here , slight musical changes ( changing meters occasionally ) and a solid refrain differentiate this track slightly from others . `` The Animal '' is not as solid in my mind , but with some key changes in production ( an introduction created with synthesizers , a couple of ` blue ' notes within the guitar , etc . ) , it is enjoyable despite being flawed . `` Crucified '' was n't a favorite either , with a slightly weaker chorus in my mind than other cuts , but the cut ends strong and is by no means bad . `` Serpentine '' and `` My Child '' are good , if ` Grade B ' cuts in my opinion while penultimate cut `` Sacrifice , '' like `` Crucified '' is merely average . Closing cut `` Innocence '' restores some of the former greatness of ASYLUM , but does n't make this ` good ' album a ` great ' one.Overall , Disturbed fans will be pleased with this effort I 'm sure . The pounding drums and jagged guitar riffs are much appreciated by all listeners and some of the nuances of this album show some great musicianship on the part of Disturbed . With that said , while the front end of this effort is very strong , the end falls flatter in my eyes and I do n't believe that portion of the album would woo new fans by any means . I have no doubt ASYLUM will perform solidly on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart , despite any of its critical flaws . 3 1/2 stars ; Solid , though not revolutionary .	1
ASYLUM is trademark Disturbed with a couple of twists and turns.If you know Disturbed you will pick them up in certain songs.If you have been with them from the beginning and like all their stuff , there is no reason to stop here.Get it now.From beginning to end , Draiman hits you with his trademark vox and their addicting sound.Asylum , Warrior , Another Way To Die , The Animal , Serpentine , My Child and Innocence highlight this effort.There is even a hidden track around a minute and 39 sec . into the 13 slot.U-2 's `` I Still Have n't Found What I 'm Looking For '' .If you know Disturbed , they have done covers before , very good ones at that and this one hits the spot with me too.Being a big U-2 fan as well , Disturbed handles the song in their own way and give much respect to the original.So what you waiting for ? ? ? Buy Asylum ! ! ! ! or you will be put into one ... : )	1
I had a hard time finding a certain album where I live . Ever since I vowed I was going to buy it after Ten Thousand Fists , I checked my local WalMart for it while hunting to buy other CDs , and every time I went they did n't have it . During a trip to another WalMart nearby , I found this CD in what was a very small CD section . This album in question is , if you have n't looked at the title or cover art of this album , is the fifth album from Disturbed , titled Asylum.Asylum is a lot better than Indestructible , which was a mediocre record at best . Although some songs are not that interesting ( Crucified and Innocence come to mind ) , some songs are outstanding accomplishments . Songs like The Infection , Asylum , Never Again , The Animal , My Child ( which kicks off with a crying baby ) , Warrior and first single Another Way to Die are pure `` Disturbed '' , if that makes any sense . However , this record does not beat Ten Thousand Fists or The Sickness in quality.EXPLANATION ON THE HIGHLIGHTSMy Child : Great song from Disturbed . The highlight of this song is the instrumental part in between the second and third chorus.The Infection : Love this song , similar to other Disturbed songs . The verses are amazing for this song.Never Again : Although I think this is not the best song on here , I think the whole song is musically fantastic.The Animal : Similar to Down With The Sickness , but without the all of the profanity , this song is the best song on here . I like the story behind it , and the verses are fantastic as well as the chorus and the opening part.Asylum : What needs to be said about this song ? This is a fantastic opener to a great album ! Warrior : Nice fighting song here from Disturbed . Good enough to be played at the stadium.Disturbed 's fifth outing is a great addition to their discography , and a perfect listen/buy for your collection.Rating : 4 stars/5 stars	1
what can i say about my favorite band , i have every cd they made & love every one & every song	1
This album is one of Disturbed 's newer sounding albums and while some people do n't like it , I think it is one of their best . I like almost every song on it , although some of the songs are & # 34 ; Disturbed & # 34 ; .	1
The first few times I listened to this cd , I did not like the first 6 songs . After listening to the cd multiple times and seeing the GVB perform many of the songs live , I began to really enjoy all but one of the songs . I love the talent in this group , but I am tired of seeing Michael English trotted out as the repentant bad boy . He messed up , asked for forgiveness and was forgiven . Move on . We do n't need an overly dramatic `` mea culpa '' song every time he performs . I would have also liked to have heard a more triumphant version of `` He 's Alive . '' Great to have Mark Lowry back and this cd shows what a great talent he is . Buy this cd to lift you up on a trying day .	1
This album is a must have for big NOFX fans . This album has a lot of singles that were never included in any other album to include the entire contents of the EP Cokie The Clown and The Longest Line as well as most songs from the Regaining Unconsciousness , Bottles to the Ground , and the Never Trust a Hippy EPs . Excellent compilation album and you will not regret getting it !	1
I 'm a huge fan of this band , I have several albums . When this CD came out I was right in line for it , this is a very good album if you want to hear NoFx 's beginning and fairly new material , as well as some remastered in acoustic . pick this up if you a fan of punk or if you want to start listing to it .	1
because the sound is perfect , these are n't loudness war masters . the remixes from 2000 were loudness war mastered . the same care has been put into not overcompressing and loudness waring these remasters as had been with the beatles boxsets last year .	1
I was never a huge John Lennon fan , but hey - how can any self-respecting music lover not be a John Lennon fan ? And , since I did n't have any of his solo CDs , the release of this gorgeous discography to commemorate what would have been his 70th birthday was the perfect excuse to catch up.John Lennon was with us for 40 years , and we 've lived without him for 30 . And then this box comes along and reminds us of it all . The box itself is somewhat outsized , and much bigger than you need to hold 10 CDs . It is all white , with the word & # 34 ; LENNON & # 34 ; emblazoned in blue sky/cloud motif on top of all that white . When you slip slide the top of the box off ( tight , the way an iPhone box would breathe open mid-pace ) , you see a greeting : FROMYOKOJULIANSEANPersonal messages from the three surviving Lennons . Below that is a hardcover book , white with the word & # 34 ; Yes & # 34 ; emblazoned on it in blue . The booklet has an essay and photos.Below it are John Lennon 's eight CDs , and one singles and rarities collection : Each of them contains a thick and glorious booklet that include photos , essays and lyrics.Once your fantasy has taken in all this glorious media , you can note the side of the inner box , which has a nice portrait of John and Yoko ( full body ) on one side , and an abstract concept of their faces on the other.Finally , at the bottom , there 's a drawer that contains a gorgeous print of a drawing of John and Yoko sitting under a tree . Nice.The square white book that comes with the set is a gorgeous little thing , with the word & # 34 ; yes & # 34 ; inlaid in blue in what seems to be John 's handwriting . It contains 60 pages of photos and writings on John Lennon , with some lyrics , doodles and artwork . Many of the photos are of John and Yoko together , and there are some of John before he met Yoko ; there are no pictures of John 's two sons . John is in every picture in the book except a picture of a Ringo Starr album cover , inexplicably included here . There 's a great picture of the bed-in that is followed by a pen drawing of the scene . My favourite picture is of John and Yoko at Giza , with the pyramids in the background . The essay is not bad , as it gives saucy quotes from John angry about people 's expectations of him , or their poor opinions of Yoko ( and , by extension then , of him too ) , but it also re-tells some of the stories that are in the individual album booklets . Some of the typography is not great , as a few lines drift out of the left column . On pages 7 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 20 , 44 , 45 , 48 and 56 this problem exists . Is this some sort of code ? Sadly , there are no labels or credits for the pics and paintings . Neil Young Archives Volume 1 this ai n't , but it 's a work of art nonetheless .	1
How refreshing to find an album of music not readily available to the public either in concert form or in recorded form ! Magdalena Kozen & aacute ; , now the glowing star of the Metropolitan Opera production of Pelleas and Melisande has a voice of rich , dark hued beauty that makes her the perfect choice for bringing these early Italian Baroque songs to light . She knows the technique of the singers of that era and yet still softens the effect of her performances by allowing her lovely vibrato quality color the tone . The result is a collection of very similar songs that she is able to bring to life.The accompaniment here is provided by the Private Musicke - six stringed instruments and percussion - that allows the rather hollow sound of this music to radiate around Kozen & aacute ; 's voice . The songs are all 'letters of love ' and are not exceptionally dramatic but are intensely interesting . Apparently Kozen & aacute ; is touring with this repertoire currently . It would be a joy to hear it live in a small recital hall . This is an unusual recital that grows more interesting with multiple hearings . Grady Harp , December 10	1
Highly recommend Hannibal Buress ' comedy . He has a unique style and delivery to his story telling that will leave you in stitches .	1
Hannibal Burress is one of the better young comics around . If you want to say he sounds like Mitch Hedberg , that 's apt because like Hedberg , his style is largely one liners with a low key delivery like every one liner comic going back to Steven wright and earlier has done . He 's got a nice take , and importantly : he 's funny.If you 're looking for new comics like this , do what we all do now : cruise podcasts like Maron , Carolla , nerdist , comedy bang bang , Doug loves movies , etc which regularly feature great young comics .	1
As Elton John has said , Leon Russell was one of the most remarkable of talents to have had an effect on him . And , of course , as we all know , Elton is also one of the most generous and giving of superstar entertainers , with a very tender and loving heart . Factor in the `` loss of Leon '' ( his having become nearly completely forgotten by producers , etc . and all but a few of his `` old fans '' ) and we clearly see where this `` gift '' to Leon , and `` labor of love '' both TO Leon , and BETWEEN them here , arose from Elton and his desire to make this album.In truth , the `` gift '' of this album is also to US , and those who have acquired this album like myself , are truly thankful for it , through them , on behalf of Elton 's `` good wishes '' and `` love '' for an old friend . The clearest and easiest thoughts on it , upon first hearing , was `` wow '' , and upon further listenings , `` Oh , Wow '' , again ! There are already nearly 150 reviews here before me for this release , so I suppose whatever I may say will seem like a re-run , or tired , but what others have said IS true . This is perhaps ( or most certainly ) the `` album of the year '' both for popular music , and also for `` nostalgic music '' if you will ! How truly wonderful to hear Elton , as it always is , and ADDITIONALLY , certainly , to hear Leon again , and together is remarkable `` beyond belief '' to their old fans , AND HOPEFULLY , new ones upon hearing this album ! There 's not a bummer to be found here on this set , folks , and is n't that truly fortuitous for a collection of songs like this ! Rocking , Rolling , Soft and Tender , Full-Tilt-Boogie , etc. , as it always used to be , is again presented here by these two great masters of Rock ( and Roll ) as we knew it in the 70 's through the 80 's ! I can not imagine anyone who EVER liked either of these two great musicians who will not be `` caught up '' and `` blown away '' by them again , this time `` together '' ! Give a listen to the sound bites above ( how sad they must be so tragically short for you to sample ) and you hopefully will see just how wonderful this album is . After hearing the whole thing , complete , I will just bet you will be here with all `` 150 '' or so of us who have come here and praised this album , praising it yourself ! Happy Listening , Surely , to you ! Enjoy ! ~operabruinPS : Hey , guys , can we please have some more , perhaps performed live , and with a dvd of the concert ? ? ? ? ? Please ?	1
Nearly everything positive has already been covered here , but did you know ? Sir Elton John , long before he was knighted by the Queen , used to be an opening act for `` The Master Of Space and Time '' ... aka Leon Russell ... aka Claude Russell Bridges . I have had the privilege of seeing Leon six ( maybe more [ LSD ] ; ) times from huge arenas to intimate lounges . He has been my hero for FIVE DECADES ! He first caught my ear playing on Dave Mason 's ( after Traffic ) `` Alone Together . '' The majority of that group backing Mason , were the same people that were on Leon 's first two records AND on the infamous Mad Dogs & Englishmen.As a teenager he was working with LA 's Wrecking Crew studio sessions and a big part of Phil Spector 's `` Wall Of Sound . '' Here 's a TINY sampling of people and groups that Leon has been associated with : Beach Boys , Delaney Bramlett , Glen Campbell , Tom Petty , Eric Clapton , Joe Cocker , Bob Dylan , Frank Sinatra , Barbra Streisand , The Byrds , Gary Lewis and the Playboys , Bobby `` Boris '' Pickett , and Herb Alpert , George Harrison , B.B . King , Jerry Lee Lewis , Dave Mason , Willie Nelson , Rolling Stones , Marc Benno , Shindogs ( house band for Shindig ) , Elton John ( before this offering ) .Oh , before I close , I REALLY LOVE THIS GREAT PIECE OF HISTORY TOO ! When are the meat heads at The Rock & Roll HOF going to include Claude ?	1
Leon and Sir Elton - it does n't get any better than this - an amazing collaboration , ( & # 34 ; Making Of & # 34 ; DVD video is also excellent )	1
This work deserves to be heard on something more substantial than a set of i-pod headphones ; you really need the bass to hear the nuance of the piano work as well as the outstanding percussion and backing vocals . I really only think two of the 16 tracks should be considered filler although I suspect that my version of `` filler '' differs from many others .	1
absolutely fantastic c.d . especially for anyone who really enjoys classy music well done by 2 true masters.I would have no trouble at reccomending this c.d . to anyone .	1
So , I 've been an E.J . fan for many years now and have purchased all of his recordings -- first on lp , then on tape , cd , and now digital format . I 'm a bit ignorant of Leon russell 's music however , with the exception of `` A Song For You , '' which I believe is one of the best songs ever written . This CD was a real treat.Having bought it the morning of it 's release and just before an 1000 mile road trip , I had the oportunity to listen to it several times . It certainly has some remarkable achievements . `` Gone to Shiloh '' is an amazingly touching song which features Neil Young 's haunting voice and is about a Union soldier who has gone off to fight in the battle of Shiloh . In my opinion , it 's the strongest song on this CD . Other homeruns are the opening track , `` If It Was n't For Bad '' and `` I Should Have Sent Roses , '' both offer incredible lyrics and for the life of me , I ca n't stop singing them over and over again in my head . They 're catchy ( obviously ) and soulful . One of the tunes that miss the mark a bit in my opinion is `` Jimmy Rodger 's Song '' which is a bit of a rocker and has received many good comments on the various reviews I 've read but I personally thought it was kind of bland.It was Elton John 's objective to expose people to the voice of Leon Russell as he believed he 's always been a bit underappreciated in the music scene . Well , he achieved his goal with me . With his gravely , stripped down voice , I will now do a search for some of Leon Russell 's music after listening to this CD . This one is a keeper and will rank among my favorite E.J . efforts . I just hope many other people will give this one a chance as their ears will be in for a real treat !	1
This is a great CD collaboration of the great Elton John with the legendary Leon Russell aptly titled , `` The Union '' . The CD has 14 tracks , the opening track is '' If It Was n't For Bad '' , an okay track . Other okay tracks include `` Hey Ahab '' ( a country-blues track with a great grand piano ) , `` There 's No Tomorrow '' ( weak music but better harmonies ) , `` Monkey Suit '' ( fast folk rock song ) , `` A Dream Come True '' ( a racy folk rock song with vocals sounding like Eric Clapton ) & `` I Should Have Sent Roses '' ( good music , vocals , harmony & chorus ) . Great tracks include `` Eight Hundred Dollars Shoes '' ( laid-back track with great music & great vocals by Elton John ) , `` Jimmie Rodgers ' Dream '' ( great coutry music sound , guitar & vocals ) , `` Hearts Have Turned To Stone '' ( great folk rock track ) , `` Never Too Old ( To Hold Somebody ) & `` In The Hands Of Angels '' ( great grand piano , vocals , chorus & harmonies ) . Solid tracks include `` The Best Part Of The Day '' ( great grand piano intro , beautiful melody , harmonies & chorus . This is my favourite track from this great CD & hence the title of my review ) & `` When Love Is Dying '' ( wonderful grand piano , great vocals by Leon Russell & Elton John providing beautiful chorus . The track is also very melodical ) . On overall , this is a great collaboration , combination of folk rock songs , country blues songs & rock songs , a worthwhile listening CD release .	1
Having never really listened to Leon Russell but being a huge fan of Elton John , I bought this album on a whim for a road trip just after listening to the samples . After the 3 hour road trip , I 'd listened to the album three times and still ca n't get enough of it ! I love soul or folk story tellers who have a unique sound quality about them , and whose songs are just haunting or inspiring . Leon definitely fits into that category . I love his sound . The blend of instruments with piano , and Leon 's voice , is just perfect.Some of the music indeed sounds like Elton that we 've heard before . I even checked to see if the songs were remakes that I 'd never heard before , but they were n't . I guess over time you just know Elton 's trademark sound when you hear it . At first I thought Leon had probably written all of the songs and even mistakenly thought this was `` his '' album . A closer look at the inside booklet proved I was wrong . Elton and Bernie wrote most of the songs . Leon wrote just a few on his own , and also wrote some with Elton and some with Bernie . But this album was mainly Elton 's idea and his tribute to Leon . Either way , the album is amazing.I love `` Gone To Shiloh '' and have found myself humming or singing it on my own when not listening to it . Fans of Neil Young will be happy to hear him sing a verse here . Songs like `` Monkey Suit '' and `` Hey Ahab '' will have you tapping your feet . They definitely have an old honkey tonk piano fill to them . And then you might just shed a tear at `` I Should Have Sent Roses '' or `` Never Too Old . '' There is definitely something here for everyone.Excellent vocals . Great rememberable lyrics . Elton . Leon . And that good old piano ! Like I said before , I just ca n't get enough of it all .	1
Im not going to try and explain the back story behind the album that has been told over 100 times now . What I will tell you is about how amazing this CD is . Eltons soft voice next to Leons rough growling works so well together . When I first heard 30 second clips of this album I was unimpressed , and thought Leon sounded terrible , but man am I glad I got it . Only through listening on a CD can you truly hear the songs with Eltons piano on your left speaker , Leon 's on your right . The whole album is mastered wonderfully and anyone looking up the full songs on youtube are doing them a great disjusctice . This is not a pop CD nor is it a collection of boring slow songs . What we get is one of the best Country Rock and Roll albums ever made . I am not a fan of country at all but this is just fantastic music anyone can enjoy . The use of pianos , horns , and back up singers make this sound like one of the most epic records ever recorded . Unlike his last few records all the songs were recorded live ( and on analog devices , not digital ) and the energy is really drawn out . We have some upbeat western songs ( Hey Ahab , Jimy Rodger 's Dream , Monkey Suit ) , some deeply dark songs ( Gone to Shiloh , THere 's no Tommorow ) Ballads ( Eight HUndred Dollar Shoes , I should have sent Roses ) and anything else a great record could ask for and more . Usually reviewer 's like to pick some `` Highlight Tracks '' but this whole album is so great that I am perplexed , at a loss of words.Elton and Leon 's voice really do complement each other , what note one ca n't reach the other can . I felt like a complete fool for ever thinking Leon couldnt sing , you just must hear this album and how wonderful and upbeat it is . This is the best Elton CD in the last 20 years ( since Sleeping with the Past ) and it is ar eal fun rocker to listen to although initially I thought it was going to be a more slow kind of CD I was definitely wrong . Having Leon around really gets Elton hyped and full of creative energy which makes this album a unique original record . If you love Elton John , or if you just love music this is something definitely not to pass up . If you are an Elton fan like me who first thought `` This doesnt sound good how is it getting these great reviews '' go out and buy the album and you will be BLOWN AWAY at how great it is . Elton may not sound like he did when he made albums such as `` The One '' or `` Honky Chateu '' but this is his most solid album ( as in all the tracks are great and any of them could be seen as the best ) since 1989 's Sleeping With the Past.I got the Deluxe version for the 2 bonus tracks ( 1 slow song ) ( 1 uptempo song ) which are both great . The documentary DVD I was definitely looking forward to but WHAT , it 's the same 6 and a half minute video that was posted to fans a month ago . This is false advertising to say it includes I making of documentary by Cameron Crowe as this is WAY too short . It is also a huge waste of a DVD disc . If this was any other CD I would feel really angry and ripped off but luckily the CD was excellent enough to make me forget about that DVD . So save your self some cash and buy the regular version . I am in the process of emailing Decca Records as I think this may have been a manufacturing error as there is a full movie Cameron Crowe has made that is screening in film festivals that is what is supposed to be on this disc .	1
Alright , so I 'm a little biased because I 'm a huge Elton John fan ( I wish I would have been around in the 70 's but missed it by two years ) but I really think that this album is simply phenomenal . It really reminds me of a Tumbleweed Connection with the country/soul aspect to it . Leon sounds amazing and Elton goes without saying . First listen through it I was already in love and picking out my favorites . The heart that was put into this album seems to come out in every song and just is such a fun record all together . I have to say that I was a little skeptical when I heard that this album was going to be a collaboration and I wanted just a new Elton John album . Now I kinda want him to do more like this because it just turned out so beautifully . So stop reading and go pick it up , you wo n't regret it ! !	1
It 's been 2 years since I first saw Celtic Thunder and now they 're part of my everyday life , their music is my ringtone , I even bought an MP3 reader so they can come along with me to the Mexican Riviera ! They 're top notch showmen and their mix of music appeals to everyone . As individual soloists they are second to none and as a group , I can find no flaws . Please continue the good work ! I 'm so happy they 've done a Christmas album - Christmas 1915 is a favorite of mine .	1
A different take on Christmas music but it is enjoyable . Most Christmas music is good and this one is too .	1
The songs are poignant and wonderful for the season of love . They have great arrangements and super harmonies . It would make a great gift .	1
this group is a very easy one to listen to . the make all the songs enjoyable and wonderful to listen to .	1
i first ordered this cd when they were here in jacksonville on qvc . i have been listening to it daily , and it is really amazing the songs they have chosen . and the information they put in with the songs . i wish everyone could get this even if they do n't like different types of music . i think celtic thunder is awesome and that they will go far in their chosen field of music.tigerlady59	1
THIS IS AMAZING . That 's what I got ta say , what an album . I rekindled an old romance with this album , my romance with with Paula . I , like everyone had heard the gorgeous I Do n't Wan na Wait over and over through the Dawson 's Creek days , but she was and is far more than that song.Ithaca is deep , it 's etheral , organic and just a pleasure to listen to.The standout for me is of course 'Somethin ' I 've Got ta Say ' ... it has been on repeat , I absolutely fell in love with this song after hearing only a small part on the amazon preview ... also in the albums EPK , which I recommend watching , it draws you into what Paula wanted with this album . Another standout is The Hard Way , it 's reaching chorus and the almost regretful feeling throughout the song is brilliant , when I listen to it it almost feels like a snapshot of what she has gone through over the last few years.I am so glad this was reccomended to me by amazon as I had n't thought of Paula in a while , but now I am once again an avid fan praying she will tour Australia , here 's hoping .	1
Must have cd , Vickisue should have been a icon long ago . her voice & ability to sing with such a strong voice should have been awared for her talents a long . long time aga , comeon america wake up . such a tragic loss . vickisue is a long but not not forgotten artist , { she is truely missed } , may you rest in peace , from a long , long time fan . tony	1
I could n't be happier with this album . To combine two great talents and for them to sing great songs , I 'm happy .	1
Wake Up ! is not just my favorite album of 2010 - it 's one of my favorite albums of all time . Take John Legend , one of the best R & B/Soul artists out there , and add the Roots , one of the best Rap groups out there , and you have a super-group capable of greatness . And greatness is achieved in this powerful musical presentation . The re-imagining of these classic soul songs , the musical delivery , and the created sound will take your breath away . The final work is a timeless classic . I look forward to the possibility of future collaborations between Legend and the Roots . I would recommend this album to anybody , but if you are a fan of Soul , R & B , Jazz , Funk , or high-quality Hip-Hop , then this album is an absolute must-have .	1
... and it keeps getting better ! I was a little late to the party on this one . A friend of mine had it on recently and I was surprised its ' release in 2010 escaped my notice . The first track I heard was the magnificent cover of Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes ' `` Wake Up , Everybody '' and it struck me immediately . One interesting quip that other reviewers have here is the song selection . I actually think this is where John and The Roots absolutely struck gold . Sure , they could have gone the more familiar route with `` Mercy , Mercy Me '' , `` What 's Going On '' and `` Ball Of Confusion '' . Their masterstroke was going the other way with less recognizable selections in my opinion.You can tell these guys love and respect this music . Some of the arrangements stick pretty close to the originals ( `` I Ca n't Write Left Handed '' , `` Humanity '' ) and some are rearranged ( `` Compared To What '' ) . It 's all done with taste though and this is a joy to listen to start to finish.Highly Recommended !	1
John Legend with the RootsWake Up ( 2010 ) SonyFive StarsThe current John Legend release is a serious throwback project . It harks back to the days when music with a social message really meant something . Legend has struck pay dirt for sure by collaborating withfunk soul band , The Roots . Revived are tracks previously recorded by the likes of `` Baby Huey '' , Robert Flack , Donny Hathaway , Ernie Hines , Marvin Gaye and reggae artist , Prince Lincoln . According to press releases , the project was inspired by the election of Barack Obama as President.The major standout on this Grammy caliber project is the musicianship . The Roots ' drummer , `` ? uestlove '' is the time keeper through and through . Canadian recording artist , Melanie Fiona and Common take a guest spots on the title track . Vocally , that track is nowhere near what Harold Melvin & The Blue Notes ( with Teddy Pendergrass ) did with it . But , it is impressive . Rather than rely on pre-canned tracks or annoying auto tune misuse , this is a live collection of recorded sessions . True voice and true music is presented without meaningless fluff , silly catch phrases or bling , bling references .	1
I should have just bought the one or two songs I liked . This was NOT a good gamble on my part : - (	1
Starter : I ca n't believe how close I came to never buying this album.Reason : I just figured I should stick to John 's 'Original Material'.Conclusion : Truly , this album is special and a Masterpiece . Every song is full of power and ORIGINALITY.Full Disclosure : I only heard 'Wholy Holy ' , in terms of listening to the original songs , meaning their original versions , so I am not using any sort of comparisons , all I know is that John and The Roots delivered ! Again , I can not believe how close I came to never buying this , what a loss it would have been ! ! ! And all mine.Additional Note June 29th 2014 : I have since looked up and listened to the originals of 'Hard Times ' by Curtis Mayfield and 'Little Ghetto Boy ' by Donny Hathaway , and I emphatically prefer John & The Roots versions . Curtis and Donny are the origin and blesssed for starting it , but I would have to say John & The Roots version of 'Little Ghetto Boy ' is one of the most memorable music performances I have ever had the pleasure and joy of hearing . It inspires me continually . Thank You . And 'Hold On In There ' OMG ! ! ! THANK YOU ! ! ! You 're helping me to live and keep going ! Ownful WayTo John LegendIn a dim hall his voice echoes , the light reflectsthrough infinite prisms of harmony , the marble ripples calmly.His voicecries out again , this time richly , as glasswindows strain to stay frozen , this place is a haze.Upon a dim stage a figure flowsmysteriously , thenprosperous to the touch , sways like a sage melody , thriving through constant play.Ina glowing region overdone with lampposts in the rain , Legend survives the second deathand sings in his ownful way.10:47am-11:12am -- Saturday , March 29th , 2014	1
These guys have been playing Europe for years now ... and , sometimes , unfortunately , everyone finds out how talented your previously 'unknown ' band truly is . This album does not disappoint . Three , sometimes four , cello 's these guys play reach directions in music no one has dared go . They added a drummer a couple albums ago , and the technical drumline stays right inline with the mastery performed on each cello.I 've seen them live several times -- from scaled-down festival shows in Germany , to small-dive rock clubs in Seattle , WA , and Hartford , CT , to even a 50,000-plus stadium in Berlin -- the show 's they put on are phenomenal . If you can make the show , do n't miss an opportunity to see them live ... and , well , if you 've got the lyrics to some Metallica songs be prepared to participate in the band-induced sing-alongs ! ! They are truly professional musicians who know how to perform to any size audience ... The latest CD showcases what should become chart-topping hits on the better stateside rock-radio . With this CD , Apocalyptica has made it in the U.S .	1
Junip is the band that includes guitarist/vocalist Jose Gonzalez , who produced wonderful albumsVeneerandIn Our Nature . As much as I love those two albums , I find that the addition of drums and keys on `` Fields '' expands the types of songs Gonzalez can do and improves their overall listenability.At the risk of damning with faint-sounding praise , these songs are pleasant . But that 's no small feat , creating an entire collection of songs none of which breaks the spell that the low-key instrumentals and understated singing produces . Nothing Junip does is ever likely to grace a karoake collection -- the songs are not tuneful in that way . But there is a sense in which the sophisticated poetry is carried along by the bouyant melodies and unobtrusive percussion that is very compelling and works on two levels : Fields can be wonderful background music for a gathering , but the lyrics are such that they will reward more mindful reflection .	1
I just listened to Fields for the first time last night and must say , Wonderful ! I am a big fan of Jose Gonzalez solo work , so began listening to this album with a bit of scepticism . After the entire collection was done , I became a fan of Junip also . Well worth the purchase .	1
Sound that is slowly enveloping you and taking you to that atmosphere where we hope to be , JUNIP ( Jos & eacute ; Gonz & aacute ; lez , Tobias Winterkorn and Elias Araya ) makes music that glows . Their springy guitar riffs flicker around the mix like light on water , while an oozing old Moog synthesizer adds undulations of its own . Meanwhile , soft drums keep the rhythm fleet.Junip it 's as tidy and clean as anything , just as elegant , as melancholic and very pleasant , is a perfect album , I recommend the limited edition comes with 3 discs ( two previously released ep 's ) . The music focuses on Gonzalez 's trademark acoustic strings . You can feel his fingers on them , drawing us close . Winterkorn 's snaking Moog lines add lust and depth , while Araya 's drums contribute speed.It 's an album that would be difficult for some love , others will be eternal love , in which I include myself , is a quality production that at times makes the game of diffuse , other times you see the dust kicked up by the wind , but simple or complicated it is a lovely album.The mix of talent and creativity of these three musicians results is remarkably strong , the genres that blend here , from folk to Krautrock , make for an interesting album , of course is not for everyone , perhaps by the minimalist sense or repetitive sense in any case , in my personal opinion is excellent in every way .	1

I 'm not going to bother reviewing the album itself , but here are my thoughts about this release : Due to the nature of the music any remastering is going to be fairly subtle , but the sound is definitely a bit cleaner , with greater dynamic range . The highs are possibly boosted a bit too much ; maybe Broadrick is suffering from tinnitus after nearly 30 years of extreme music ? The lows , however , are where the remaster really shines . The thunder that this album has always deserved is now there on the disk instead of being left on the master tapes.The second CD is fairly underwhelming . The `` unreleased mixes '' are all nearly identical , with the main difference being some alternate drum samples ( the snare sounds a lot higher ) . The live/rehearsal tracks are very , very rough recordings , especially Dream Long Dead which sounds it was recorded on a Sony Walkman . The most interesting tracks are by far the two Tiny Tears demos . Stripped down to the basics , these tracks show off a lot of melodies that are later obscured by the ( intentional ) waves of distortion in the final mixes.Overall , if you are buying this album for the first time it is absolutely worth it to pick up this release . For anybody interested in updating their old copy , I would say you should give it some thought - if you do n't listen to the album very often , this release is n't likely to change that .	1
Of Montreal , well-known as the venting mechanism for one Kevin Barnes , is back with an LP of brand new material . Following in the vein of Hissing Fauna , Are You The Destroyer ? and Skeletal Lamping , False Priest is an eclectic mix of funky indie pop and spazzy R & B ; jams . Of Montreal has changed significantly since its Beatles-esque first incarnation , the obvious turning point being Satanic Panic in the Attack , which was perhaps the first point at which Barnes successfully synthesized his varied tastes into an engaging and exciting piece of work . On Hissing Fauna , he chronicled his personal transformation through a difficult point in his life , coming out on the other side of The Past is a Grotesque Animal as the sexually empowered Georgie Fruit . He then gave full control to his fickle muse on Skeletal Lamping , a product with a handful of truly brilliant moments surrounded by schizophrenic fluff , which tends to play out a little too long and a little too obtuse to have staying power . Following Skeletal Lamping , False Priest sees Barnes scaling back his insanity , instead carefully dialing it in to hit on a compelling blend of creativity and precision , the latter of which was very much lacking from Skeletal Lamping.Opener I Feel Ya ' Stutter has some of the aforementioned schizo elements from Skeletal Lamping , but I think that as on Hissing Fauna , False Priest chronicles a transformation from Georgie Fruit back into a new hybrid character , someone with both the creativity and the pop sensibilities . Coquet Coquette has a bit of a Led Zeppelin stomp to it , which deep , billowing guitars and a driving rhythm section . The contributions of Janelle Monae and Solane Knowles on Enemy Gene and Sex Karma respectively are not to be overlooked . Two of the album 's strongest tracks , the former has a powerful note of self doubt and introspection while the latter absolutely oozes sexuality.Hissing Fauna , through my ears , was unquestionably Kevin Barnes ' opus , and I do n't suspect that he 's going to ever top it without his life being thrown into serious turmoil again , but that 's ok , because after the growing pains of Skeletal Lamping , Barnes has found his stride , effectively creating a record that sounds entirely like Of Montreal while still refusing to play it safe .	1
The title of this review says it all and `` All We Need '' is Oli to keep making music like this . Listen to the samples then do yourself a huge favor and add this to your collection ! !	1
I ordered this for myself Nd was very happy with this purchase . I would recommend it to others . Thank you	1
This album is the definition of getting slept on . It 's a good one too , if you do n't listen to expecting it to be another In Search Of ... like most people do . Do n't buy this thinking you 're going to hear 10-15 [ depending on what version you buy ] new smash hits produced by The Neptunes , because this is not an album by The Neptunes ... this is N*E*R*D. A lot of these songs are influenced by classic rock and funk music and are n't about pleasing the masses who listen to Top 40 radio . If you have an eclectic taste in music then I would without a doubt recommend this album to you . Pay the few extra few bucks and get the Deluxe Version , because the added songs are just as good as the first 10 songs on the album . As long as you go into this knowing this is n't an album by The Neptunes and not comparing it to another N*E*R*D album then listening should be an enjoyable experience .	1
N.E.R.D has done it again . I have loved all their ablums . This one in particular is one of my favorite with just three listens I know I will listen to it 10000 more times . I love the fact that Pharrell said that they titled the album `` Nothing '' because it is about nothing , there is iorny in this , but the title is funny and smart all the same . This is a feel good album . It will set the mood for your next get together and it is elcletic enough that everyone will like it . Pharrel and Chad are genius when it comes to great sounds .	1
This is a great fourth CD release by the talentd trio , NERD , titled `` Nothing '' . The CD has `` Party People ( featuring T . I . ) , `` Perfect Defect '' & `` Hot-N'-Fun '' ( featuring Nelly Furtado ) which are okay tracks : rapping , vocals are just okay . `` Hypnotize U '' is a great track : Pharrell Williams 's voice/vocals are great with persuasive lyrics to boot . `` Help Me '' is a great track : deep vocals , varied sound & great melody . `` Victory '' is solid track/gem : great bass & melody . This is my favourite track from this album & hence the title of my review . `` I 've Seen The Light ( Interlude ) Inside Of Clouds '' is a rather great interesting track : great ( music , vocals & harmony ) . There is a bridge in-between ( interlude ) then the song fading away quite nicely . `` God Bless Us All '' is a great 'soulful ' track with great ( melody , harmony & chorus ) . `` Life As Fish '' is an inquisitive interesting track : the band is informing us where we come from ( creation , big bang & evolution ) . `` Nothing On You '' is a great title track : great ( rapping , chorus & guitar ) . On overall , this is a great CD release effort by NERD ( Pharrell , Shae & Chad ) , a highly recommended listening .	1
N.E.R.D 's fourth album `` Nothing '' finds the eccentric trio of Pharrell Williams , Chad Hugo , and Shae Haley ( aka the production group The Neptunes ) having come full circle , battle tested from their 10-year journey as a band . `` Nothing '' is a return to the classic N.E.R.D sound from `` In Search Of , '' combined with the live rock feel of `` Fly or Die , '' and highlighted by the electronica of `` Seeing Sounds . `` The 10-track , 36 minute LP ( the deluxe edition includes four additional tracks ) is N.E.R.D 's most complete album to date . Its cohesiveness , along with its more mature , calmer tone imbues the album with a simple yet rich quality . The two songs that bookend the album shine as the obvious singles , but the remaining eight tracks confidently chain these bookends together , expressing one comprehensive thought.The funky , house inspired `` Hot and Fun , '' featuring Nelly Furtado , is one of two radio-friendly songs and is in fact the lead single . The second single finds southern rapper TI reuniting with The Neptunes ( check for TI 's first album `` I 'm Serious '' ) on the upbeat club anthem `` Party People . `` The rest of the album seamlessly varies in tempo and tone from track to track . While many of the tracks employ a more serious , classic style , the music never comes off pretentious or self-conscious . Williams croons about his love for the opposite sex like only he can , but he also sings a motivational anthem for Chris Brown on the charismatic `` God Bless Us All . '' Other stand outs include the insatiable anthem `` Victory '' and the environmentally conscious , yet entertaining `` Life as a Fish . `` Every track is produced by The Neptunes , with the exception of `` Hypnotize U , '' which features a mid-tempo , spacey contribution from the French duo Daft Punk . With Williams ' Prince-like vocals , the song fits superbly into the album . Throughout the album , there is also a strong presence of brass provided by trumpeter Jason Carder , and the saxophone , is played by none other than Hugo himself.All but two of the tracks are co-written by Williams and Hugo . N.E.R.D 's label head , Interscope 's Jimmy Iovine , even lends his penmanship to the jazz influenced `` Help Me , '' where Williams sings , `` See those war machines out there ? A pact with your karma , do you care ? `` Looking for fresh music like this , follow me here. [ .. ]	1
One of modern metal 's main front-runners are The Contortionist . Combining elements of progressive metal , death metal , and ambient styles in a unique and innovative mix , they have proven they are truly a force to be reckoned with and are destined to be masters of the genre.The Contortionist 's debut EP , Shapeshifter , was extremely based in deathcore and breakdowns . The following EP , Apparition , eased up on the deathcore elements for a much more progressive sound . Vocalist/keyboardist Dave Hoffman left after these releases , and was replaced by Jonathan Carpenter , with the lineup being rounded out by guitarists Robby Baca and Cameron Maynard , bassist Chris Tilley , and drummer Joey Baca . This lineup released their full length debut , Exoplanet , which continued down the proggy styling of their EP , with several of the songs being reworked for the release.Exoplanet is an extremely strong debut release . It features everything you 'd want from a progressive death metal album . It has intense vocals balanced with melodic singing ( complete with a vocoder effect akin to the legendary Cynic ) , intense riffs interloped with clean melodies , prominent bass-lines , and impressive , polyrhythmic drumming.Highlights : '' Primal Directive '' is the opening track . It features a taste of what you can expect with the remainder of the album . A particular noteworthy point is the `` You have been defined '' vocoder cleans being layered over the screams during the chorus . `` Flourish '' is one of The Contortionist 's most known songs , for good reason . It begins with frenetic technical riffage before flowing into further intensity . Approximately two minutes in , however , the song changes drastically into a melodic segment that would n't sound out of place on an Explosions in the Sky album . This climaxes into a beautiful solo followed by a breathtaking guitar harmony . Easily one of the best songs on the album . `` Vessel '' opens with a soothing ambient intro but then segues into more intensity . More great guitar melodies abound within this song . `` Oscillator '' is also in the running for best song . First half is intense , full of breakdowns and growls . However , a third into the song , is a melodic guitar solo and a refrain from the heaviness . The second half is purely instrumental , and more breathtaking melodies that sound at home on a post-rock release.The `` Exoplanet '' suite , however , is by far the biggest highlight of the album . The first segment , `` Egress , '' opens with more post-rock-esque riffs over a smooth bassline . It picks up the pace with vocoded singing over a melodic guitar lead before transitioning into screamed vocals . `` Void '' is a heavier part , that has more of what makes this album great , interloping intensity and melody , and containing mesmerizing guitar leads . `` Light '' is the final piece , beginning with even more atmospheric post-rock riffage . It transitions into final bits of intensity , before an outro of ambient sound effects.The verdict : Exoplanet is a phenomenal release from this young band . They would manage to top it with their sophomore release Intrinsic ( which I have previously reviewed ) . However this is still an incredible album . I recommend it wholeheartedly for fans of modern prog metal , death metal , atmospheric metal , etc.Rating:9.5/10	1
I saw this band while I was waiting for Periphery to get on stage . They did n't quite steal the show , but it was veeeery close . Solid djent , with creative melodies that leave you guessing . I find myself listening to this non-stop for several hours at work ; it just does n't get old.As far as I 'm concerned , the Best Album Of The Year award is between The Contortionist ( Exoplanet ) , TesseracT ( One ) and BTBAM ( The Parallax : Hypersleep Dialogues ) , and I really wan na pick them all .	1
This is a great CD . I ca n't stop listening to it . This is a MUST have CD .	1
ANOTHER GREAT PROJECT BY BILAL ... .. I love the cd ( i think the 1st cd was better ) . Bilal is so under rated .	1
When I listen to this album , a lot of the lyrics has to deal with relationships sometimes when things are not working , sometimes when are done and sometimes when they are fine . It 's a great sophomore for The Script . I like the whole album and has good tracks .	1
The intriguingly poignant combination of melodies , beats , .. the bass , guitar , .. drums , produces a melancholic sound . It literally pulls the listener in . When the singer 's .. '' nothing.. '' first occurs and breaks and falls is my favorite part , and that 's just `` Nothing . '' It 's on my playlist loving it . Another great song on this particular album is `` For the first time . ''	1
This is a rocky album . Not in the 'it rocks ' meaning of the word , but more in the sense that The Script deals with upheaval in love and politics . The trio of Dubliners waste no time in going for the gut with the opening `` You Wo n't Feel a Thing , '' which deals more with the austerity measures that Ireland is going through than a breakup . These former boy-banders have more on their mind than getting the girl ; U2 echoes throughout `` Science and Faith . `` Too bad that `` You Wo n't Feel A Thing '' is the best song here . The Script know their way around solid melodies and good hooks , but they are smoothies from the school that also includes OneRepublic ( they used to work with Ryan Tedder as producers ) , Snow Patrol and even Coldplay . The single `` Walk Away '' does make for good radio fodder , and the fine `` This = Love '' being the only song that really breaks the formula . Heck , `` Walk Away '' even features a rap cameo from B.o.B . in the 'everyone else is doing it ' category . If you get the extended version , you 'll likely enjoy the piano based and rapless version more , if only for the reason that the rap version sounds more of the moment than of the band.That said , `` Science and Faith '' is pretty decent overall . There are moments that suggest The Script could break the rut and maybe find their way into Coldplay 's creativity or ( if they were willing to get away from the over-production ) Maroon 5 's pop-soul . Just too many times on `` Science and Faith , '' you keep wishing for the big payoff when all you get are little fireworks of inspiration .	1
As I am new to classical music , I 've been looking for ways to pick up good samplers . I purchased this for that reason . Wow , the sound quality is excellent . The performances are absolutely first-rate , by some of the very best performers in the world at that time ... Fritz Reiner 's Chicago Symphony Orchestra , Charles Munch 's Boston Symphony Orchestra , Jascha Haifetz on violin , Arthur Rubinstein and Van Cliburn on piano , and even Julian Bream on guitar . Plus , there are many others ... really a who 's who of 1950 's and 1960 's classical music . Really , I do n't know how anybody could regret buying this set .	1
This is a portrait of orchestral music making in America circa 1960 , reflecting what audiences paid to hear . It 's about 40 % twentieth century too . It is full of fabulous recordings . To mention just a few Reiner Scheherazade , Momnteux Franck , lots of Heifetz concerti , Piatigorski , Leinsdorf Boheme . Not everything is top notch but RCA did n't stint and there are a lot of the gems of their catalog here.The sound is generally very good , occasionally stunning , never bad .	1
This box set is an embarrassment of riches . I have gone through 15 CDs so far ( 25 % of the entire set ) and I 've already received my money 's worth.There is really too much to comment on for a quick review . I will point out the fact that one can look into individual CDs available on Amazon that by themselves are considered among the handful of best performances available - and they are here.Munch conducting the BSO , Reiner with the Chicago Symphony , Fiedler , Rubenstein ... and the red book quality of 60 year old recordings is , so far , wonderful.Whether you are a long-time classical completest or a relative newcomer who is looking for a great place to start , the & # 34 ; Living Stereo Box Set & # 34 ; is highly recommended .	1
23is the album that started my love for Blonde Redhead . I 've gone through their older albums and have not been able to get into them . At first listen , I feared that Penny Sparkle was going to be the same . So many bands have done that to me . They draw me in with an incredible album , and are never able to repeat the magic . And I 'm stubborn about it . I usually buy 2-4 more albums before learning my lesson and giving up on the band.But with subsequent listens , I quickly warmed up to Penny Sparkle . It has a lot of the same `` feel '' as 23 , without being too derivative of that work . I can hear the evolution of the band , and thankfully , they are not deviating from what drew me to them.I highly recommend this album if you enjoyed 23 . If you are new to Blonde Redhead , I recommend you buy23first.To be fair , I should really give their older work a few more listens before writing those albums off .	1
I agree with `` Chazz '' ! A friend of mine turned me on to the `` 23 '' album last year , and after several listens , it quickly became one of my favorite albums of the year . I find this new one to be a logical extension of the direction of `` 23 '' - still experimental , but more cohesive as a whole . While I do n't really know what this band sounded like previously , the short clips I 've heard have convinced me that they have matured and improved as songwriters , and the vocals of Kazu Makino are less obtuse now , generally fitting the mood ( and moodiness ) of the songs better than on `` 23 '' . If I had to describe this unique band to someone , I guess I would say it 's a little bit of Sneaker Pimps and UNKLE , mixed with some Hooverphonic and a good deal of quirkiness ! Less guitars than previously ? Maybe , but does n't every `` indie '' band today favor crashing , dissonant guitar sounds , ad infinitum ? ? I 'm glad Blonde Redhead took a different turn on this one . Great music for the upcoming autumn .	1
I am not a long-time Interpol fan , do n't own any previous stuff , but have always liked the songs I have heard by them . I purchased this CD on a whim and I really love this disc . At first listen , Success and Barricade immediately popped out and I loved the angular raawwwkkk . But after several listenings , all the other slower songs have grown on me . The riffs , the arrangement - I do n't know what it is and I 'm not a musician so do n't know the terminology - but each song has an element or elements that draw me in . Tight , moody , haunting , rocking - a very satisfying listening experience . I grew up on all the bands that influenced these guys , but I think it is unfair to say they are a Joy Division or ( insert band name here ) clone - they put their own stamp on all the influences and have made a fine record .	1
AFTER thunderously jamming out to `` Barricade '' immidiately after opening the packaging , I really enjoyed the listening experience this album had to offer from front to back . Cool artwork , too . Also wanted to mention how great the overall sound production is on their self-titled , the bass lines are rather insanely good . Along with all the many great transitions , when I first put this in , I personally enjoyed the feel of how the second song comes in shortly after the first track ends . Pretty cool disc.Thing is , once track 6 is over , that 's when the cd really about ends for me . The rest is quite a chaotic journey via sound that , from what I know , has been done muuuch better on alot of their older stuff . `` All of the Ways '' Is pretty cool , though . I 've always had a thing for the broken chord sound , though . Not too bad when possibly turned down , albeit listener 's preferences.Once again , a REAL good sounding cd.Had the time came and I knew of what I 'd be hearing , of course I 'd of got it again , too . It 's a good addition to the collection .	1
Like a young actress who won her Oscar a bit early or , more appropiate , an old indie favourite that has now a substantial fanbase , Interpol have not been given the credit their work deserves ever since 2004 's Antics won them a wider audience .I , though , still find present in their records the qualities that made me love that band so much in the first place : an extremely dark romantism , Paul Banks striking baritone and their strong , punctual songwritting , `` born out of a forced discipline `` as drummer Greg Drudy has said in an recent interview .Lyrics rarely say something specific in rock music and here its no different . What 's so capturing instead is this whole sense of unintentional menace of enigmatic lines like `` I 've got two secrets but i only told you one ... '' from `` Success `` or those nightmarishly oh-la-la 's towards the end of `` Memory Serves `` . Stand out tracks include `` Barricade `` , `` Success `` , `` Lights `` and ( personal favourite ) `` Try It Out `` with it 's devastating climax . Critics may follow trends but music fans know better and should stick with this talented group for the long run .	1
This is a very different record for Interpol . First and foremost : it 's a production-oriented album . The crackling gothic guitar harmonies and snappy bass-lines we 've become familiar with on previous albums have taken a back seat to methodic , ominously-layered arrangements . Instead , we see the band relying more than ever on a detached synth-ambiance and the icy , multitracked vocal work of Paul Julian Banks to flesh out the hollow skeleton of dark rockers that make up this album.Due to their overwhelming subtlety , it 's very easy to miss how much time and energy must have gone into arranging the vocals on this album ( the number of vocal tracks on Always Malaise alone would be enough to exhaust Freddie Mercury himself ) , but the minor keys , half-steps , and deadpan delivery remain true to any of PJB 's best moments.What is n't subtle -- in any way -- is the melange of album art rendering a 3D image of the band 's name being blown to smithereens by an unseen force . Some might be inclined to interpret this as the band foreshadowing its own break-up . This is , apparently , the last Interpol record that will feature the band 's original bassist and keyboard player . Others might see it , however , as the band anticipating the backlash it would get from fans in response the new direction it takes . After all , there are still a hefty amount of Interpol `` fans '' out there who remain steadfast in waiting for them to selflessly mimic what they were doing eight years ago on Turn On The Bright Lights.I say let them evolve . This album took a bold step forward . It captures all of the haunting , cold and calculated mystique of their previous work and sends it careening through space on a quiet sonic journey to the outer limits . This is Interpol , post-Interpol . This is Interpol 2.0 .	1
Interpol 's new album `` Interpol '' is a 4 1/2 star release . It is nice to have the mood back , this album brings back the sound of `` Turn On '' and `` Antics '' . This is a nice comeback after their hiccup with `` Our Love To Admire '' .You have to give it 3 or 4 listens too sink in ! You ca n't listen to it just once and give it a critical review because this album is moody and it depends on how your day is going . 8 out of the 10 songs have made it on my radar : `` Success '' , `` Lights '' , the single `` Barricade '' , the synth piano driven `` Try It On '' , `` Summer Well '' , `` Memory Serves '' , `` All Of The Ways '' and a great closing song in `` The Undoing '' . Great comeback !	1
Halford IV is amazing , hard hitting Metal God brand Heavy Metal we all love . Great tracks , brutal riffs and amazing vox from the metal god as always . With Judas Priest doing their final world tour right now it 's nice to know Halford will scream into the future .	1
After hearing the single `` The Mower '' I lost a lot of enthusiasm for this album . It was a pretty brutal extreme Metal song with screaming vocals and heavy guitar riffs -- Not my cup of tea.Many fans love the heavier side of the Halford albums . Personally , I ca n't listen to Crucible without getting a headache . So imagine my delight when IV was firmly rooted in the classic Metal sound while leaning towards epic European Power Metal such as `` Fire and Ice '' and `` Speed of Sound '' . `` Hell Razor '' is my personal favorite on the album , because it sounds like Stained Class-era Priest . He 's 59 years old and can still sing like that ? Amazing . Great twin guitar solo in the middle . [ Do I hear a cool bass solo too ? ] '' Heartless '' and `` Matador '' are some other great Metal songs and `` Twenty-Five Years '' is a very personal song about being a gay Metal frontman from 1973-1998 before he finally came out of the closet.This album is so obviously a masterpiece I am surprised to see such mixed reviews . The boxing lyrics of `` Undisputed '' are a bit awkward and `` Thunder and Lightning '' seems pretty average . Some people foolishly complain this is a hard rock album and not Metal . Umm I will trust Rob Halford 's judgment on what is Metal . These people need to put down their Lamb of God and Trivium albums and get back to true Judas Priest style heavy metal . Made of Metal is a stunning and diverse collection of songs from the greatest singer in Metal.Rob Halford releases an especially great album at the beginning of each decade : 1980 British Steel , 1990 Painkiller , 2000 Resurrection , and now in 2010 Made of Metal.If you are a Priest fan or enjoy powerful heartfelt Metal like Doro or Hammerfall then you should definitely pick up this fantastic new HALFORD album .	1
THERE ARE 14 SONGS WITH DIFFENT FEELS WE HAVE INDISPUTED GOOD OPENER ABOUT BOXINGAND THE FIRE AND ICE GOOD POWER METAL SONG AND THEN MADE OF METAL GOOD HEAVY ROCKER ALONG WITH SPEED OF SOUND , MY FAV SONG AND ONE OF HOS BEST ID HEARTLESS GOOD SONG THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT AT HOME ON CRUIBLE CD OR RESURRECTION AND MAYBE HIS FIRST RADIO FRIENDLY SONG WE WON THE NIGHT THAT I REALLY LIKE , SO WHOS CARE IF HE IS SINGING ABOUT BOXING OR CAR RACING AS THE MUSIC IS GOOD	1
Typical Halford release thrashes like mad . Lead singer of Judas Priest , Fight and Two 's fourth solo album . A rumor spread that the backing band had been shot and killed along with Pantera . Just as good as Resurrection and Crucible . Key tracks are : Undisputed , Fire and Ice , Heartless and Hell Razor . This is on his own label- Metal God Records . I would recommend it .	1
The leading characteristic of this album is its diversity . As a fan of his first album `` Resurrection '' I expected solid rockers and straight likable tunes . They are there but sometimes they are buried . Yes there are a few moments that are sometimes difficult to follow . But all in all Halford delivers . The guitars commanded by Mike Chlasciak and Roy Z are sharp and dangerous and musicianship is tight enough . Go and get this one .	1
I believe I must put my 2 cents in . The vocals of Rob Halford is always a treat . Need I say more ?	1
when painkiller came out i was just 14 and i liked everything in that album even that some of it pure fun , 20 yrs later and i 'm into this album from the 1st spin i was caught into this cdi cant understand why some other fans dis the cover or the songs - these are songs done by the pro for the fans and they are 100/100 for fun and having great timeyou can play this cd in your car at home with the kids and you will never get tired of it yrs from now it will still rocklong live true metal long live rob	1
I 'll agree that they are n't your typical Metal cheeseball lyrics , but heaven forbid someone write about a few offbeat topics ... You know though , if anything , this album proves that Rob Halford is definitely one of those singers that could sing about ANYTHING and make it sound good . For the life of me I ca n't understand all of the negative reviews , as I 'm enjoying this record just as much as any of the FIGHT material as well as CRUCIBLE and RESURRECTION ! ! So far this has been my favorite album of the year , heck , becoming my favorite of the last two years . If you 're a true Rob Halford fan , you 'll buy this album and love it , if you 're a negative person who 's stuck in the past and loves to chop things down and criticize things , you 'll make fun of this album and miss out on a great record ... Meanwhile , I 'll be rocking out.. Rob Halford , what a guy ... . Very happy metalhead here ! ! It 's been a while since I 've bought an album this good ... Halford is the Metal god ! ! !	1
Made of Metal has a variety of different styles and tempos of Heavy Metal songs all on one CD . Rob Halford is called the Metal God because he has decades singing all styles of Heavy Metal and Made of Metal is filled 14 awesome Heavy Metal songs . Made of Metal has Judas Priest type songs with Fire and Ice & Hell Razor , 25 years is a ballad . A couple of songs have hints of Iron Maiden with Undisputed & Like their 's no tomorrow . The Mower is an extreme metal song . Matador is a latin influenced heavy song . Made of Metal has Rob 's best vocals of all his solo projects . Rob sings on MOM like he sings for Judas Priest . Rob sounds different and very unquie on every MOM song . Buy Made of Metal and give it few listens and you will be writing your own 5 star Amazon review .	1
Saw them in denver and they ABSOLUTELY rocked dead boy boogie live . Believe it or not I still rock the original 14 song `` album '' , as it were . Because with this release I am equally as delighted as I am dissapointed as to what they choose to include and not . It is exciting with some songs , like aww man they included `` mine '' and `` suck magic '' , sweet ! But not including , `` twitch , clarksville or send you to heaven ? '' That 's sad . No , `` Tornado '' , though . Good choice . But at least in some way or another it 's out . But should have been out from the start - F'ing record label .	1
This was my introduction to Black Mountain . They have a new fan . Not one skippable song on the album . Get the vinyl version , its super tasty !	1
Had never heard of Amanda Shaw until Sioux City , Ia's. , `` Day In The Park '' music festival , this past July ! What a pleasent surprise , this gal and her band can play ! Very Impressed ! ! ! ! ! Her 3rd album is a more mature production then her first CD 's , show she 's improving with age , like a good wine ! ! ! My only concern would be that she may slide into redundancy with her style of music ! Hope she broadens her horizon 's in creativity..If you ever get the chance to see her perform , take it in . NOT A DISAPPOINTMENT ! High Energy Entertainment ... ...	1
Woe , Is Me . wow . they took the cake on this one . very great sound from the guitar and the singing is great . great live too . screaming is great as well . only complaint is that the drummer does the same fill 80 % of the time . but its great nontheless . very catchy songs , great intro that effortlessly leads all songs into one another . very memorable in my opinion . pick it up today ! ! give these guys a shot . theyll be huge within the next year or two in the `` scene '' .	1
Ricky Skaggs , and his producer have weaved I believe is one of the best gospel albums I 've heard in a long time . You can tell from the lyrics , and from the way he sings , that this album was speaking to Ricky Skaggs 's heart . For those of you that have followed Skaggs career , you know that he started in Bluegrass music , went to Country music and back to Bluegrass again . He 's had success in both genres and has excelled and established himself as a 'star ' in both genres . Do n't expect the Bluegrass or Country Ricky Skaggs here . He has reinvented himself into a folksy balladeer . Some have called Mosaic , Pop music , but I think it fits more along with Folk music , or rootsy Americana music . Ricky Skaggs has reinvented himself , and made probably his best album ever . Give it a listen , you wo n't be disappointed .	1
If you are looking for a `` typical '' Kentucky Thunder or sole Skaggs cd look eleswhere . Ricky has made a Christian Music pop CD . For a Christian these songs are powerful and entertaining . For a some Non-Christians they may which there were more secular songs.By calling this a `` pop cd '' I do n't mean to imply there is n't a variety in the music , there is . Or that he has left his more `` country/bluegrass '' roots as they are in the mix.Simply , this is a fine Christian CD . Amen .	1
I loved every song on here and it 's been on my mp3 player ever since . He is a master musician and his voice is one-of-a-kind . Mr. Skaggs , I hope you play and sing for many years to come .	1
'Mosaic ' finds Ricky Skaggs at his best . God is always near to his heartand his affection is very nice . Ricky 's voice is a perfect match for thesesongs and his band .	1
10 Years fans rejoice - after the last album `` Division '' which left many of us wondering what the direction of the band would be , we can rest at ease . While `` Division '' has its place and time , `` Feeding The Wolves '' hearkens back to the sound of `` Autumn Effect '' that we all came to love and enjoy . Jesse Hasek has an amazing voice , and it clearly shines on this album . I always listen to an album and listen for vocal and tonal similarities to other bands , then I piece together the music I want to listen to on a given day or trip.On this album , I find that Jesse has some similarities to Brandon Boyd ( Incubus ) most notably on the `` The Wicked Ones '' , `` Chasing the Rapture '' and `` Waking up the Ghost '' . This album is very well engineered with amazing sound and clarity . I would love to see them live one day after listening to this album . I still listen to `` Autumn Effect '' and `` Division '' , but I feel that this album far exceeds the previous ones . A must have for any hard rock fan .	1
My first 10 Years CD though it should n't have been . I should have started from the beginning because this was an amazing CD as I 'm sure the others are .	1
I GOT THIS FOR MY GRAND DAUGHTER FOR X-MAS BECAUSE SHE ASKED FOR IT . SHE IS HARD TO BUY FOR . SHE LOVED IT .	1
Their previous album was great and so was this one . Great to see this band have the energy and enthusiasm as well as the creativity to put out another terrific album .	1
This is pretty much all you could have asked for : The Three Degrees first of two albums produced by Donna Summer 's producer Giorgio Moroder on CD , WITH all the 7 '' edits , Moroder produced b-side `` Out of Love Again '' , the bonus track `` The Golden Lady '' , and the full 12 '' version of the very hot Moroder produced `` The Runner . '' The sound quality is excellent on this collection , and I hope they do a similar release with the second Moroder produced album , 3D.One thing I noticed -- on my original vinyl LP , The track sequence is different for the first three tracks , with track 2 being Looking for Love and track 3 being Falling In Love Again . However , since the songs are in a continuous sequence , the sequence actually sounds more natural on this CD -- Giving Up Giving In/Falling in love Again/Looking for Love .	1
There are several copies of `` New Dimensions '' CD circulatingin different markets . However , BBR had released the most completeone including the single versions and remixes.Liner notes are excellent . Mostly , Sheila Ferguson personal storybehind her composition `` The runner '' . Which is kind of sad.The orchestration of `` Woman in Love '' is kind of sensual . `` Givin ' up , Givin in ' '' could be played today at any Disco and the newgenerations will not know this is a song from the late 70's.Without any doubt this is Giorgio Moroder at his best . Highly recommnen-ded ! ! !	1
This new release from Stone Sour is solid . It blends a little bit of everything from the previous two . Sure , it 's not as heavy as the first two albums , and NO , there is not a song on this one that says 'I could have been a Slipknot song ' . The intentions of Stone Sour are to be Stone Sour ... not Slipknot . They are two different bands . I have to laugh when people complain that they bought the new Stone Sour trying to find a Slipknot song . You want Slipknot , listen to or buy Self-Titled , Iowa , Vol . 3 , or All Hope is Gone . I like both bands because they are both different . Like I stated earlier , this is a nice blend of crunch and clean guitar and some atmosphere . Give it a shot if you like Stone Sour 's first two . I 'm not going into detail about each song nor will I give you my favorites . It 's just purely my opinions , and I 'd rather you give this album a try and have your own opinions . It 'll eventually grow on you if it does n't suit you at first . My reasoning for the 4-star review : the Self-Titled was and still is the absolute best by these guys and ca n't and probably should n't be topped . Thanks for your time .	1
Well , lets get it out in the open . I have read complaints that this CD is all soft and is all ballads . Well ... Maybe it is and maybe it is n't . Buyers should listen to the samples before buying this ablum and decide for themselves . Nuff said there.I personally felt it WAS a softer sound for them but it was n't a bad CD . It was simply more melodic . I liked it enough to give it 4 stars.The CD/DVD combo is well worth the buy . You never seem to get shorted on a Stone Sour DVD.I 'd like to say more but if you listen to the samples , you will know all you need to know .	1
No matter what it would have been hard to follow up on the terrific 'Come What ( ever ) May ' . 'Audio Secrecy ' does a fine job of doing so.It provides the usual blend of hard rock/near metal sound and soul-filled ballads to allow for fans to enjoy the full spectrum of Stone Sour 's talents.The only semi-complaint is that there seems to be more cohesion , effort and purpose in this album compared to Slipknot 's 'All Hope is Gone ' . But so long as one of the bands is providing solid rock it 's good enough .	1
This album is definitely slower than their first two , but it 's really good ! There is n't a single song that I do n't like , and the lyrics are very good . I love all of their CDs !	1
Being Stone Sour 's third release , I was n't sure what to expect . Verdict : the album is quite enjoyable . All the songs are great and very easy to listen to . There are of course better songs than others , but it 's an overall good third effort by the guys . Long time fans will appreciate the evolution the band has taken.But do n't listen to me , buy the album and judge for yourself ...	1
It is a testament to Junior Wells ' strength as a performer that the numerous albums released in his name posthumously only range in quality from superb to pretty good , with no `` better left unreleased '' material to taint his legacy . Even with this excellent track record , LIVE IN BOSTON 1966 still stands out from the crowd . Recorded just one year after the seminal HOODOO MAN BLUES album , it finds Junior at the top of his game as a performer of the blues . Backed by the Aces , Junior tears through a twelve-song set with the passion , intensity and humor that made him one of the finest of all bluesmen . His singing is full of energy and conviction , his harp playing is punchy and tight , and the Aces provide great grooves to support Junior 's craft . Listening to Junior romp through classics like `` Got My Mojo Working '' or his own `` Junior 's Whoop '' is a treat , while his between-songs banter adds to the feeling of being at a live Junior Wells show.Though the music certainly stands tall on its own merits , one should not underestimate the importance of the choices made by the label , Delmark , in making this a truly great disc . Many live albums which feature great performances are marred or ruined by misguided attempts to clean up the sound , haphazard attempts to cut and paste tracks to get the best songs together , and overdubs to hide mistakes . Not this one , though ; LIVE IN BOSTON 1966 listens beautifully from beginning to end , feeling like a single , uninterrupted recording . The sound quality , while not polished , is exactly what it should be : gritty and greasy . After all , this is n't pop , it 's blues , and the bumps and bruises , mud and blood are what give it vitality and character.This rave review could go on , but it would be a waste of time which could be better spent listening to the album . I recommend that you scroll back to the top of the page and click `` add to cart '' right now .	1
It 's hard to accept that Junior Wells departed this world in 1998 . Although we 'll never be privileged to again experience his concerts and club dates , the recorded music remains and continues to reward . Junior left behind a 45 year legacy of both studio and live recordings . Although this catalogue should be sufficient , the typical blues aficionado still craves for more.Thanks to Delmark records , `` Live in Boston 1966 '' has finally seen the light of day . This CD is a rich and rewarding Blues listening experience . It represents one of Junior Wells finest live club dates.1966 , found Junior at the peak of his powers . He already had 13 years as a performing and recording artist under his belt . His chops were well established both as a prominent member of Muddy Waters band ( replacing Little Walter , no less ) as well as both a solo and collaborating artist . This `` Live in Boston 1966 `` set is unique , in that it found him reunited with the Aces . A band of working musicians which had commercial and critical acclaim during the fifties.By the mid sixties , Junior was experiencing wide global recognition and appreciation . Thank to a best selling album '' Hoodoo Man Blues `` and the public acknowledgment of his influence on the British Invasion . U.K. bands , e.g. , Stones , Animals , etc , were shining the light on authentic blues artists and enthusiastically crediting these musicians with fostering their success . These bands hired artists such as Junior Wells , to open for national tours.The `` Live in Boston 1966 : CD consists of 11 numbers plus closing theme . The seven stage raps sprinkled in between the numbers totals approximately 12 minutes . Anyone fortunate enough to attend one of Junior 's gigs knows how entertaining these moments were when J.W . established a genuine rapport with the audience . During the later part of his career , these stage raps could prove excessive and awkward depending how free the spirits were flowing . I 'm happy to report this is n't the case with this release.The song selection is impeccable . It ranges from soulful ballads ( That 's All right ) , jump tunes ( Hideaway ) , all the way to blues jams ( Junior 's Whoop ) . The old chestnuts like `` Messin with the Kid `` and `` Got my Mojo Workin `` are included . However , since this is 1966 , the sounds resonate as fresh , vibrant and kick ass . Junior 's vocals are in top form and his harp work is slammin throughout the set . He leaves plenty of room for the Aces to demo their contributions , This is particularly evident with numbers as `` Hideaway , ' Got My Mojo Workin '' and Junior 's Whoop `` .Louis Myers ( guitar ) , Dave Myers ( bass ) and Fred Below ( Drums ) deliver an exceptional set . Junior and the Aces are truly a first tier Blues band entity not just a solo artist with a pickup band . The sound mix , for a mid sixties club date , is spot on . It provides a very intimate club listening experience . You can almost smell the whiskey , smoke and sweat that were always in play in those small urban blues bars during the sixties.Hats off to Robert G. Koester and Steve Wagner for album and CD production , respectively . Also a big note of appreciation to Scott Dirk 's crisp and comprehensive liner notes .	1
65 minutes in length approximately , including approximately 8 minutes of between song talk . Wells ' vocals are slightly distant , and slightly distorted through his mic , but the lyrics and Wells ' inflections are clearly discernible . The sound of the band is generally much better . All-in-all this is a good bootleg quality recording-but do n't let that deter you from hearing some fine blues-and do n't let the term `` bootleg '' scare you off . The disc is snapped in , bare , inside a tri-fold cardboard holder . There are several photos of the band and a short overview of Wells ' music.For lovers of 60 's style Chicago electric blues ( like me ) , this is something to get excited about . Closer in feel to Wells ' `` Hoodoo Man Blues '' than to the later , smoother live album , `` It 's My Life Baby '' , -this is ( the late ) Junior Wells playing his brand of slightly funky hard blues to an appreciative crowd in Boston , in 1966 . The band , besides Wells on vocals/harmonica , is THE ACES-Louis Meyers-guitar , Dave Meyers-bass , and the great Fred Below-drums . This is the band Wells began playing with in the 50 's , recording some fine sides for the States label.A number of songs will be familiar to blues listeners- '' Worried Life Blues '' ( Sleepy John Estes ) , `` That 's All Right '' ( Jimmy Rogers ) , `` Look On Yonder 's Wall '' ( Arthur Crudup ) , `` Messin ' With The kid '' ( A Wells ' favorite ) , `` Hideaway '' ( Freddie King ) , and so on . But do n't let the fact that familiar tunes means a lazy , sloppy performance-far from it . Wells is at his best here , and the band ( especially Louis Meyers ' guitar work ) is never less than solid , and sometimes they smolder under Wells ' leadership . And speaking of Wells-his harp work is typically gritty and in your face , while at other times he uses his instrument to punctuate his insistent vocals . All in all-a fine performance . Between tunes , Wells chats with the audience , which some listeners will find annoying . I find it enhances the live feel , and brings a little bit of the `` you are there '' feel to the recording . After hearing his comments-they can be programmed out-to each his own.For anyone who likes Junior Wells ' work from the 50 's through the 60 's , purchasing this set is a no-brainer . If you 're new to Wells ' brand of blues-purchase his early 50 's sides ( `` Blues Hit Big Town '' ) , his 60 's releases `` Hoodoo Man Blues '' and `` Southside Blues Jam '' first , and then purchase this set-which is icing on the cake . Junior Wells was one of the important blues artists who brought authentic electric Chicago blues to a generation ( including myself ) of listeners who were just discovering this wonderful music . And this release is even more proof that Junior Wells and his band could deliver the real thing when it came to the blues . This set belongs in everyone 's library of modern electric/Chicago/Junior Wells blues .	1
A very good cd from Hey Monday . Might seem to have only a few tracks . But are n't they just good ? I 'm glad they made these songs . They are awesome .	1
Hey Monday is one fantastic girl-fronted powerpop band ... they are everything Paramore wish they were and should have been . Now , Paramore is OK , but I wish they focused more on the pop and less on the angst . Cassadee Pope and her boys are more my kind of band . Kind of like a current incarnation of Letters To Cleo ... which makes sense as HM parted ways with their drummer , and all drum duties are by one Stacy Jones ... the current leader of Boston powerpoppers American Hi-Fi ... he was the drummer for Letters To Cleo then Veruca Salt ... he 's like a cooler Dave Grohl ... drummer of Nirvana-turned-bandleader of the Foo Fighters.Anyhoo , this new RELEASE ( I can not call it an album , sorry , as it 's only 6 new songs ) is a fantastic and fast followup to their full-length Columbia debut `` Hold On Tight '' , which came out the tail-end of 2008 with the cool powerpop classic singles `` Homecoming '' and `` How You Love Me Now '' ( co-written with powerpop genius Butch Walker ) ... all 6 songs on `` Beneath It All '' are superb and I wonder if there will be maybe another EP in 6 months ? ? That would be cool , and in this day & age , more acts are releasing a string of EPs in a calendar year rather than 1 full album once every 2-3 years ... not only Hey Monday , but also cool punky Swedish dancepop queen Robyn 's `` Body Talk '' EPs and country rocker Blake Shelton with his `` Six-Pack '' series . Hey , I 'll take 3 Hey Monday EPs with tunes this good ! ! ! Cassadee has the perfect girlpop voice , the band rocks with cool riffs , they have tunes up the wazzoo with heavenly hooks , harmonies to die for , the works ... and Cassee is really a good songwriter ... I think she 's just getting started.Tracks # 1 + 2 , `` Wish You Were Here '' & `` Wondergirl '' are my favorite tunes here ... but the Butch-produced , played-on and co-written `` Hangover '' is almost as worthy . I would keep an eye on Cassadee 's progress as a songwriter ... she 's got the goods ... a kickass mix of great melody , hooks , soul and deep lyrical honesty ... she wears her heart on her sleeve even if it bleeds . On `` Hold On Tight '' , 2 songs that really showed this mix well were `` Candles '' and `` Hurricane Streets '' , which came from experience , as they are from West Palm Beach , Florida , and get hit with hurricanes on a regular basis.Hey Monday , one of the best bands out today and this new EP is great and inexpensive ... BUY it .	1
Shouting out my highest praises for Kerrie Roberts debut album ! She is amazingly talented , and it is such a joy to listen to this CD ! The sound of her voice captures you , and without a doubt , the lyrics will bless you.I 've listened to the album about 10 times now , and I love it more with each listen . You ca n't go wrong with this album , and I say do n't hesitate in making a purchase . It 's AWESOME , and has definitely earned a place at the top of my favorites ! Not a bad song in the bunch .	1
I wish I loved this ... it 's good , and the idea behind it is even better . Tina 's speaking voice just bothers me a little ... it feels like she is forcing her spirituality .	1
Long story short . I initially purchased it for one song . Once I listened to the disc I was pleasantly surprised by all of them . It truly helps me get grounded and it 's very easy to listen to . You ca n't help but be in a better place after listening to it .	1
What a GREAT collection of Emmylou songs . The nice thing about listening to Emmylou is it really do n't matter what the song is , EVERYTHING she sings is BEAUTIFUL . If there EVER was a singer with the voice of an angel it 's Emmylou . With this Series of CD 's you 'll have practically everything she sang that you 've heard in the past and then some . NO disappointments , not one !	1
What a cop out of an album . `` after 17 years '' we get a Steve Miller Band album in which he only sings a few songs himself , does n't WRITE any of the songs , and makes it as unappealing as possible to the fans of his familiar songs . People who know him from `` Jet Airliner '' , `` Fly Like An Eagle '' , or `` Abracadabra '' will be sorely disappointed . It 's getting to the point that if I hear one more artist do a cover of blues `` classics '' I do believe I will pull my hair out .	-1
I been a fan of Korn since Issues came out in 1999 its the first CD of Korn I purchased . Korn III : Remember Who You Are is really a disappointed in an album from Korn , it reminds me alot of their 2003 album `` Take A Look In The Mirror '' which featured the original lineup before Brian `` Head '' Welch and David Salvia left the band . I will give Munky , Fieldy , Jonathan Davis , and Ray Luzier create for trying make the sound of the earlier albums along with Ross Robinson returning to produce the album after being gone since the bands Life is Peachy album which is the last album he produced with the band . It is no way a return to the earlier sound of Korn though in a few tracks you can hear a few nods to Korn 's earlier albums . I think alot of songs could use more work in them as I came away kinds not impressed with the album . I am not a huge fan of Korn by the way kinda of a follower of Korn but not a die hard fan . Issues got me into them and I avoided their recent albums Untitled and See You On The Other Side after Brian left the band . I really think the band should continue if that what makes them happy though most will say that the band is done with . They really could build on the sound of Korn for the next album if they chose to . Not a bad album by any means just not what die hard fans would want in a Korn album . If you want the older sound then listen to Issues , Life is Peachy , Korn , etc . Or listen to Heads album Save Me From Myself if you want the missing sound of Korn . Also Jonathan 's whinny sound needs to stop , i know its what fans love but its way overdone and Korn should probably go in a different direction . It was great 15 years and I understand is but fans love about Korn but I really do n't need it now when the guys are in their 40 's with families and really successful in life .	-1
I know I 'm going to get lambasted for this so before I begin , please note that I really wanted to like this album , and I 'm only writing this review for those who are up in the air in terms of whether or not they think they want to buy Korn III . For those who are die-hard Korn fans and are insistent upon giving it a 5-star review after a single listen regardless of the quality or content , this review is not for you.I 'm not going to review each track , because once you 've heard the first few you 'll get the idea . Ever since 'Untouchables ' , there has been a noticeable yet steady decline in the quality of Korn albums , and for those of you who think I 'm dumb enough to blame this squarely on the departure of Head , both 'Untouchables ' and 'Take a Look in the Mirror ' featured Head as the lead guitar . 'Untouchables ' was a good album , not great . 'Mirror ' was still decent , and I 'll admit that there are a few redeeming tracks on both 'See You on the Other Side ' and the 2008 edition of the self-titled album . However , a few redeeming tracks does not make up a whole album.I think its safe to say the the `` Korn sound '' was lost after 'Issues ' , and the band started putting together as many tracks as they could with little regard to the way they would flow on an album . When you listen to their early work , the band wrote songs that were emotionally driven from `` Daddy '' on their debut album to `` Somebody Someone '' off of 'Issues . ' With the release of 'Untouchables ' , the Korn tracks took on a surprisingly familiar pattern that was introduced back in the 1950s . With each track , it took little imagination to know when the song would change tempo or launch into a 'catchy ' chorus . This is not to say the albums released since 2000 have been bad , they just are n't worthy of a 5-star rating.This new release sounds closer to `` Mirror '' than the last two , but it lacks the creativity that really separated Korn from the rest of the nu-metal one-hit-wonders polluting the radio waves . Does Jon Davis sound angrier on this album than the last two ? Yes . Does he growl more ? Sure . Are the lyrics memorable . No . Does the music stand out ? Not really . I sometimes also get caught up in giving a new album a remarkable review after one listen because I 've been starved for new material , but lately I 've been taking the time to really listen before I judge , and I ask myself if I 'll feel the same about the record 6-months or a year down the road . In 6 months , listeners will have stopped reviewing this new release and they 'll forget how they initially heard it the first time they popped in the CD or turned it on via an MP3 player . They 'll be listening to the older albums and telling everyone how the new album just is n't that great.I do n't want to rip the band because they 're still one of my favorites , but a band should realize that once the angst and the creativity is gone they need to find new channels of expression . Either that or spend more than a few weeks in the recording studio and really dig deep for something from the soul . The album is not terrible , but it 's unremarkable and candidly , it 's also forgettable . My $ .02	-1
So there we have it ... .another amazin ' korn album ... .jam packed with the same riffs , no solos , no leads , minimal drumming , generic bass lines , and whiney Jon Davis vocals ... ..what more could a devoted korn fan ask for ! ? ? Although Korn created heavy metal in 1994 , I still think they are n't up to par with Limp Bizkit or Linkin Park in terms of making the best album ever ... .Remember to avoid poser music and stick with KoRn peoplez ! ! ! Who needs Venom , Slayer , Exodus , At the Gates , Cannibal Corpses , Shadows Fall , Pantera , Iron Maiden , Black Sabbath , Ministry , Fear Factory , Burzum , or Immortal ! ? ! ? ! ? Stick with Korn .	-1
How many times is Jimmy Webb going to re-record these songs ? I do n't care if he brought Elvis back to sing on them ... enough is enough . From a man who has written a gazillion songs , here we get yet another version of most of the hits and even the non-hits that are incredibly boring . I guess those exciting days of THE YARD WENT ON FOREVER and SUNSHOWER are over . No more heartfelt productions with the likes of Mike Deasy , Hal Blaine & Larry Knechtel and gorgeous engineering by Armin Steiner . So sad .	-1
What is this garbage ? This is not like any Quincy Jones I have ever heard - and I have heard most of his stuff from jazz big bands through Patti Austin . Juxtapose the original Secret Garden with the Secret Garden here to see what I mean .	-1
Yes two stars for Q . Why ? Because an originator should never remake his own material . Quincy Jones must be uninspired to create new compositions . Perhaps , he is an old , rich , fat man bored with nothing to do . This ai n't `` Back On The Block '' .No way does this project come close in comparison to that hit CD.The fabulously fantastic wizardy of wizard 's surprising musical remaking trickery of tricks ( yes , tricks ) moment for me was hearing Amy Winehouse after four years since her last studio recording . Only the legendary man of music could get her raggedy drunk and druggy a $ $ to croon again . Thanks Mr. Jones for that . Please stay retired . No need to prove anything because you are done !	-1
Quincy Jones is a Name that is responsible for alot of Classic Material and also for being associated with a whose who of the Biggest Name in American Popular Music . Producer and Arranger and the good thing is i remember when a Q logo represented the goods . however this Project feels like a Bad inside of a Tv Show that he was associated with called `` Madd Tv '' . Madd Tv was a Broke version of In Living Color and the reality the case with most of these tracks is that they are a Broke Version of the better Originals . Quincy owns the Publishing on the songs here so he can re arrange and flip them like hot cakes if he elects to and sadly that is what he is doing.tired Auto tone , the kind of colabs that at best have a hit and miss feel and at worse feel like boring Snoozefest Karoke . as the saying goes it is best to leave good enough alone sometimes for you can never recapture that magic , that time and that place.nothing really memorable here , some alright stuff , but nothing here that stands out on a whole and the rest is bland , boring and bad and not in a good way at all.it 's a shame because these songs in there orginal light were good to great. got ta leave well enough alone .	-1
the only positive is that i was able to get the mp3 album on special for 3.99 otherwise i would be quite a bit more upset abot my purchase . this sounds like the music from a bad jackie chan movie ( as oppossed to a good one ? ? ? ) . i liked the last couple of releases from the band but this one just inst for me . the asian influence sound just doesnt mesh with the nice vocals . i would look else where before buying this latest release	-1
This is a GREAT collection with GREAT songs and GREAT value ... This being said there is alot lacking from this set which is mostly from Winwood 's solo works . There is probably almost 30 minutes of CD space that could have been used on this set that was not . Roll With It and Finer Things could have and should have been included . Also the 4th Cd really lacks any memorable tracks . Included are 2 or 3 tracks from the Traffic album `` Far From Home '' This is not an issue but when there are better tracks from the same album I have a problem with that . Also only one track from Nine Lives ? ? ? Nothing from Refugees of the Heart and I am pretty sure there is nothing included from the About Time CD either ... I really think if anything they should have made the Set cost another $ 10.00 and made it a 5 CD set . Also ... Their are not hardly any liner notes ...	-1
NOT VERY AHPPY WITH THIS ONE . GUESS I WAS EXPECTION MORE . WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ALBUM . IT IS GOOD AS YOU WANT IT TO BE .	-1
It has happened with Barry Manilow and Rod Stewart.It has happened with James Taylor.Michael McDonald also was 'caught ' by the same 'disease ' ( and he even did it two times , UGH ! ) . ( It seems that ) Sadly , Carlos Santana is also walking in the same path.No new tunes , no new composition work at all , old glories are just trying to 'recycle ' themselves.And the only way they have found to do it , it just by making new 'covers ' of great 1950s , 1960s , 1970s and Motown greatest hits ... As 'brand new ' Hits ... Hit songs that by themselves ( in their original versions ) , are truly music JEWELS.But ... Trying to make them 'new ' hits when covered by performers that have musically nothing to do with the original performers , this becomes nothing than a real Bad Joke.I admired Phil Collins when he became the leader of Genesis after the departure of Peter Gabriel . Even most of his solo works , in my opinion are truly good music efforts.However ... Now , a truly Brit trying to sound as a Motown singer ... PATHETIC . That 's it ...

This Album is the definition of the word ( Washed Out ) . The originals are much better . No innovation . Do n't waste your money .	-1
collins admitted he wanted to `` bring nothing new '' to these classics . then why record them ? unless perhaps you have a record contract to fulfill.it 's a jump the shark moment.at least when clapton covered the robert johnson songs , he played songs that had rarely been heard -- at least not by a wide audience.there are garage bands covering this material as well as collins does here.i suppose artists such as collins will continue to pump out this drivel as long as us rubes continue to buy it.i 'd give it zero stars if i could .	-1
Not liking the majority of the cd . Was n't very impressed with this cd . Have enjoyed many of his cds , but this one left me cold .	-1
This cd is like no other Ozzy album.It sucks.The New Guitarist Gus G Sounds like he is able to play but is NOT very creative.VERY repetitive sounding.This album also has Absolutely NO melody , no good hooks and the lyrics are so bad at times you just got ta laugh.This is pure industrial rock that went outta style about 15 years ago.Here is what I think happened ... ... read is Sharon Osbournes voice `` Ozzy you have got to keep current and play for a younger audience and this is what the kids are all rocking too these days ... ... etc ... ... .. '' and here is the reply.Please read in Ozzy 's voice `` If you say so , Sharon.You 've never steered me wrong before.I will miss the days when I put out good solid rock with creative lyrics and catchy riffs and hooks , but you know best , my darling Sharon ... ... .etc ... ... .. '' I am the BIGGEST Ozzy fan on the planet and I am telling you to steer clear of this one.Shame on you Ozzy ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
This is coming form a Black Sabbath and an Ozzy lover : I was actually looking forward to this cd , and when it came in the mail I immediately opened it and put it onto my Zune . After it was loaded , I gave it a listen , and was immediatlety disappointed.It 's important to realize here that Ozzy 's band has drastically changed . Gone are Zack Wylde and the ex-Faith No More drummer extraordinare Mike Borden ( who is actually touring with FNM currently ) . With those changes in mind , NONE of the songs on here have any real soul to them ; they sound well-produced and performed , but they are just `` empty '' sounding , as if Ozzy and the musicians are just going through the motions . As I listened to each track , I became more and more upset - after all this is an OZZY album , right ? ! Usually there 's one or two CLASSIC tracks on each of his efforts , but not on this one . Again , the entire work just sounds empty and heartless ; there 's no real memorable songs here , nothing to even tap your foot to , and THAT is the real disappoint ment here . ( Note : I will NOT compare this cd to Black Rain , because I do not remember that album that much ; I will hoever say that I remembered enjoying it MUCH more than this , and that I listened to that album several times ) .In short , pass on this . Even if you are an Ozzy fan .	-1
This album is not that good . The songs are medicore , average at best . I listened to it maybe 5 times before I shelved it . I ran it by my brother , a fellow Ozzy fan and he felt the same way . It just lacked energy.It is n't because of the departure of Zakk , Gus is awesome and more than capable . It is the same mistake as what Ozzy did with Down to Earth.Down to Earth was written by various different artists , most which were not metal players , without Zakk . Then Zakk came in and had to metalize the tracks and essentially try to whip them into descent shape . The product was predictably mediocre.In this case Ozzy again wrote the songs without Zakk . Many of the songs were written in collaboration with the producer he was working with at the time . Then he split with Zakk . The problem was that Zakk was fired ( though that was a mistake in my opinion ) , but not starting from scratch when he brought in Gus . Gus had to take the songs and do the same thing Zakk did with Down to Earth . You simply ca n't take a pile of crap , give it to a talented artist , and expect him to turn it into gold . Ozzy always has a good ear for talent , but he has to trust them to deliver the goods . I hope he gives Gus the freedom to ACTUALLY WRITE THE SONGS in the studio next time . Then we might hear genius.Garbage in , garbage out . Will you figure that out this time Ozzy ?	-1
Big Ozzy fan , must be honest with myself . I ca n't make myself like this just because it is Ozzy . No melody , just crunching guitars and vocal effects . Not one of these songs is memorable . I give him credit for longevity and an impressive catalog . The reality is , this is not good . I do n't even like Scream , it is contrived . Maybe next time .	-1
OZZY HIRES SOME JOKER NEW BAND AND THEY ALL SUCK . THIS ALBUM IS BORING INDUSTRIAL ROCK . DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE IT SUCKS ! ! !	-1
No Jake E LEE back in the Ozzy fold , I 'm sure Sharon Tried ! GOOD album lots of fun ! Aside from `` No rest for the wicked '' , I not a big fan of Zakk Wilde . I think Zakk should join Lynyrd Skynyrd ! He 's a great player , not the musician Jake E LEE was in my opinion , but a great guitar player ! The new guitar player Gus G. gets his feet wet on this album and the music is Finally more OZZY ! I think Gus G. will get better if he stays in the band , it almost sounds like Jake at times . Jake E. Lee who preformed on two of OZZY 'S best solo albums left because of too many Randy Rhoads comparisons and he did n't have the connection with Ozzy that Ozzy had with his best friend . Simply put this album is decent . I take back this whole review ! ! ! ! ! After many listens , ( 3 ) . This is sub-par . After I bought `` No rest for the Wicked '' I thought this young guy Zack Wylde is so fast an amazing ! ! ! ! Then I bought `` No more tears '' and After the killer title track was over I was in tears ! The Songwriting was n't the Ozzy we all knew , I 'm 35 . Anyway I gave my copy of `` No more tears '' To a friend and listened to a few of the next albums hear and there and there were some fantastic songs on `` Ozzmosis '' but it lacked direction . After that album I did n't listen to the Ozzman too much . I am such a HUGE fan of Ozzy 's Solo work three incredible guitar players lots of great drummers and players ! I took a look at my old tapes on the inside and saw that some of the players he had on the early albums were like session players , Pro 's , you know guys who write songs play many different instruments and stuff . Like Steve Lukather of Toto and Neal Schon of journey but without those 2 guitar hero 's successful bands . Jake E. Lee was a song writer , guitar player , every other instrument , he wrote all the songs for `` Badlands '' Ray Gillian was young and did n't write lyrics , R.I.P . Back to Ozzy , this young Gus G is a more than capable player , but at this stage in Ozzy 's career to take a chance like this you have to give him credit . I would love to see at least Jake E. Lee record one last studio album with Ozzy , maybe a tour ? Before any Black Sabbath last reunion would happen ? I 'm just a fan , but this album is Ok does n't quite have the melody 's or show-case Ozzys unique and at times melodic voice ! Jake lost Ray Gillian a very good friend , Ozzy lost Randy . Who Knows ? Better than `` Black Rain '' !	-1
Was this Ozzie ? the sound he is making sounds like godsmack on crack.At least he got the cover right his music is dead .	-1
It seems I had to put a star rating in to get my review on here , so 5 stars just 'cause it 's the Ozz . I just got this for Fathers Day . I have been listening to Black Sabbath , then Ozzy since the dark days . I love them . Just so you know , I love the 1st 8 Sabbath albums , then all the early , and some later Ozzy 's including No More tears . I 'm a big fan of the melodies of old , not so much the `` heavy metal '' of new ( a million notes and a lot of noise on lead guitar ) . I do n't know this album yet but I will let you know . If I tell you to get it , and you 're old school Sabbath & Ozzy like me , then get it . P.S . Love the Bill Ward albums : Ward One : Along the Way & When the Bough Breaks . Check out one of the latest ones too : `` The Dark Half '' . On youtube or Bill 's site . It kicks ! Bill Ward rules . He oftimes has the Sabbath idea more than current Iommi and Butler . ( love them too though ) .Sept . '10 UPDATE : 2 stars . Sorry , but that means I do n't like it . 1 star if I hated it , but it 's just not my cuppa tea . Too bad for us old fans . P.P.S . STOP THE LOUDNESS WAR ! Leave some breathing room or we 'll all end up hating everything !	-1
Except for the few melodic moments on this album , it all seems like it 's trying too hard to be in your face . TOO Loud , overproduced , and compressed . I will shelf this one and listen to Ozzy as he used to be with memorable songs from his past . Trying too hard to be the `` Price of Darkness '' , hey , just give us some Rock and we will love you Ozzy . This music all just sounds angry ... leave that for other bands .	-1
Attack Attack 's first album did n't really wow me , nor did I expect it to . Clearly they were trying too hard to do something new and fresh . But they lack serious talent , and that got in their way.This album is no different . Utter lack of talent . Though it is a new band and they have a different sound , it does n't really matter because , though they might be able to play instruments and pretend like they 're being innovative , the fact is they do n't have any musical ability . Their songs are written poorly and they 're melding genres incoherently . Who exactly are they appealing to ? They go off on their boring , predictable breakdowns only to suddenly switch into a poppy , cringefully bad refrain out of nowhere . The music just does n't make any sense.What we have here is what we 'd expect out of a couple of high school kids , jamming in their garage , trying to make Lady Gaga sound as hardcore as possible . That 's fine , when you 're a kid and you 're just trying to have fun . But when you make an actual album , one can only assume the artist has a shred of musical talent , but that just is n't found here.Moreover , they have no depth as musicians . They take the most generic aspects of hip hop , electronica and metal and throw it all together into one big mess . That does n't work unless you know what you 're doing in regards to each genre , and what these guys are doing gives no respect to any of them.I will say , when I heard that their old vocalist left , I thought they might try and step in the right direction . Frankly , their old vocalist did a number on my ears with his screeching voice . I also heard they were getting rid of that auto-tune crap that 's been polluting the music industry . The vocals on this album are substantially better in both the screaming and the clean parts . Part of it has to do with the way it was produced , but these vocals are much more listenable.That being said , they 're still not that great . The screaming is OK . I do n't really have a problem with it , though it 's not spectacular . But , although the auto-tuning is n't as prevalent , the clean singing is still poppy , cheesy , disney channel-esque nonsense and I guarantee , you 've heard it a million times before.So , with all that being said , is their any redeeming qualities to be found here ? Not really . I will admit , there are moments on the album where I did n't hate it , but honestly , as a fan of metal , electronica or whatever it is , look elsewhere because this does n't do justice to anything and scene groups like this belong in the garbage .	-1
I ran across this release by pure accident . I was reviewing the Billboard charts ( 7-20-10 ) ` when I noticed this disc was ranked 1 # . I was floored needless to say ! This actually proves a point of mine ... most people are still ignorant to the Blues ! With all the great Blues coming out today how does a native New Yorker with no Blues foundation represented ( ever ) in her music , and puts out maybe 1 record every 5-6 years score a # 1 ranked Blues record ? I recall a few years back Robert Palmer ( `` addicted to Love '' ) making a Blues record ( `` Drive '' ) that was `` heralded '' by critics and fans alike ... soon after he had a heart attack and died . I 'm not wishing that same fate on Cyndi , but to Those who assume they know the Blues should check out the Delmark and Living Blues websites to fully understand the Blues , then hopefully spend some cash purchasing a `` real '' Blues disc from a `` working '' Blues artist/band ... Lauper is easy to love , but novelty can only go so far when compared with the authentic .	-1
... .More like Minnie Mouse.. ! ..She sounds lost & frightened on several tracks , mediocre on the rest.. ! ..I was given a promo copy so i do n't have to trip over myself praising this disaster . I was'nt duped out of a ten spot.. ! .The boys must have had a good laugh over at the local bar after this project wrapped..Still Lauper may cop a Grammy yet as `` Best Comedy Album '' of the year.. ! ..Cyndi stick to what you do best..Top 40 Pop.. !	-1
After `` Deeper than Rap '' which was undoubtedly one of the best albuns that dropped last year , I had huge expectations with `` Teflon Don '' . Unfortunatelly Ross dropped a dud this time.If you release an 11 track album , each one of them got ta be , at least , good , no flaws allowed ! ! More than half the cd is not enjoyable , Mayback Music III , Aston Martin , BMF , Mc Hammer , I 'm not a Star and Live fast die young are not good ... He should have saved some tracks from the Albert Anastasia EP to put on this release ... One of the greatest disapointments of the year so far .	-1
Nachtmystium stands of one of the few American black metal bands that have managed to do something other than rip off the Europeans or try to something so unique that it ends up being lame - until now . Whether they 're trying to become more mainstream or just because all the other American bands are doing it , Nachtmystium has released an uninteresting album.Somehow , this album smacks of Abbath 's side project I , only uninspired and thoroughly boring . What makes Addicts so underwhelming is the overuse of the keyboard , the terrible beats ( both the acoustic and the electronic ones ) , and the almost complete lack of any hook . In fact , you ca n't really call this black metal anymore . What Nachtmystium should have done with this album was strip away the excess , re-tweak the songs , and come up with some interesting drum-patterns . It 's not all bad - just most of it . `` High On Hate '' is a promising start , but the album does n't get interesting again until `` Then Fires , '' which is n't extraordinary by any means - it just seems really good compared to the songs preceding it.But heck , it 's still better than Xasthur or Twilight .	-1
I finally broke down and bought a `` Used-Like New '' cd of Ed 's first solo effort and I must say it 's really not good . What does that tell you when there 's already a bunch of used cd 's out there to buy ? I own every cd Live has made and loved them all until `` Songs From Black Mountain '' which I could only put 3 songs from that onto my IPod , so I was really hoping this would be at least a tiny bit better but , alas , it is n't so . I have no problem with it being religious in theme because all the others touched on it in some way or another but this one is just in-your-face . And even that would n't bother me if the lyrics were creative , unique and interesting and took some real thought but these songs , including the melodies , are just plain boring and kinda sickeningly-sweet . His voice is very good , however , but that 's just not enough for me and I have been a Live-Freak for many years and saw them in concert 9 times and traveled hundreds of miles to see them - so I would n't bash Ed on this if I did n't really believe it . I have thought for several years now that Live really needed something to shake them up because the songs were getting repetitive - they needed new blood or outsiders to collaborate with on song material . I hoped that this split was really going to change things for the better with Ed 's solo , and it probably would have if he had shared the writing with more than two other people on two songs . I will be re-selling my used cd back to a resale shop and tell them to catagorize it as Christian Rock if they want to sell it again and not have it come back !	-1
I 've listened to this several times since I received it . I just do n't like it.Do n't know what I was expecting but it was n't this . The voice is there but the songs are n't . Robert needs to get his head out of his a__ and do a tour with Led Zeppelin while there 's still time .	-1
The album is actually pretty good . Not a big fan of Fat Joe . But my gripe is that the album says 13 tracks ( 12 tracks plus a bonus ) but only 12 show up on my laptop . did I receive a dud from amazon ?	-1
Pleaseeeee ... this has been done a hundred , or a thousand , or a million times before ... just re-creating the past but not any better at doing it ... I 'm sorry . of course she 's not any worse then the male versions also doing the same thing that was done a hundred , thousand , million times before ...	-1
I like the music here but this review refers to the Mission Edition and the `` extras '' therein . This is one of the most poorly packaged `` special '' editions I 've seen in a long while . The extras are online only . The wallpaper is atrocious , pics are few , and band interview footage is of terrible quality and quite short . I paid $ 4 more for this at Walmart and I ca n't help but feel ripped off . I think this is a result of the Maiden team just not knowing how to do this right . Hire a third party who know how to do this sort of thing .	-1
A band of Maiden 's stature and resources should only release material of the highest quality production . Brave New World had it . This album sounds flat- guitars and especially the Drums ! ! It ai n't my system either . The snare is too loud and sounds like a cheap beginner 's drum . Makes you wonder if the band listened to it before they released it . Even if there were worthy tracks ( there are only 2 ) it would not be enjoyable to listen to . A harsh , muddled production !	-1
Like JUDAS PRIEST , IRON MAIDEN has drifted into the awful sound of `` Progressive Metal '' ... They have released nothing like their glory albums of the 1980s ( by choice ) , which is what made them so great . Both bands have done nothing but attempt to `` keep up with the times '' since they reunited . While I will still go to their concerts , I just get disgusted at their last few albums ... Both bands are done .	-1
As stated in another review , this Mission Edition is not so special considering all of the extra content is located online.I was hoping that i would have the video on a disc and other `` cool '' things but the bonus site leaves alot to be desired.Now , the music on the other hand gets 10 stars ! Amazing Progessive Metal . I love it !	-1
I was a diehard Devotee way back in 1980 . When most people were trashing them and never giving them airplay on the radio or on MTV , I was BIG into these guys . Did n't always understand what they were talking about , but I liked them . Now you hear commentators say how ahead of their time they were , and all that , when you know they actually hated them back in the day . My respect for them started to die when they referred to Reagan in filthy , hateful ways . Then Alan left , supposedly because he felt like he was n't being used enough and ignored , and something changed . I grew up and got out of that rebellious phase . Then I saw other things with these guys that were hypocritical . They once criticized the idea of Devo Dolls in their firat video release , yet they sold Devo figurines in stores . They made fun of heavy metal groups ( Evil Clowns anyone ? ) but then take on a former druggie metalhead as drummer . They screamed against capitalism but set up shop on Sunset Blvd and wrote music for commercials and movies . Sold their song to a floor cleaner commercial . Jerry once made fun of people `` sitting around drinking Bud '' but let their song be sold for a beer commercial . Devotees refuse to mention the insidious CD of kids singing Devo songs because it was another sellout . So they are back and I listened to it . I have to say the songs sound alike to me . It 's kind of hard to tell one from another , unless I want to listen to it a hundred times . One song goes after Bush . ( YAWN ) . The easiest thing to do is go after America , Bush , capitalism , etc etc ad nauseum . There 's no guts in that . I suspected them of being leftist when I saw the silly Chinese American friendship pins or suits , whatever it was . That 's not what fuels my dislike , it 's just that nothing is new . If the music was really awesome and different I would like it . Devo , like every other band , set out to change the world . Now they complain it 's still bad or worse . Guess their work never changed a thing . I do n't know what their message is , unless it 's marketing themselves & making money .	-1
Crowded House have produced some of the most beautiful , melodious pop songcraft of any band on the planet . I really like the last album Time On Earth . That release does n't quite measure up to past glories , but hey it is solid through and through and has some good songs . Intriguer just leaves me cold . It sounds lovely , yet empty . It 's just too studied and fiddled with overall to make the songs come through the layers of production . Mark Hollis of Talk Talk once famously exclaimed : `` Before you play two notes learn how to play one note -- and do n't play one note unless you have a reason to play it . '' In otherwise , give the song exactly what it needs ; no more , no less . Neil Finn used to understand this , but nowadays with too much time on his hands and too much money to use in the studio , all sense of what is best for the songs has been sacrificed in the name of a more shiny , hopefully radio friendly product . Crowded House is still a great band . Unfortunately , Intriguer is not up to snuff .	-1
Drake is the biggest fake wannabe I have heard in the last few years . His music is complete torture to listen to . His voice is atrociously horrid , his beats are annoying and his rhymes are too forced . I am honestly not sure how anyone could like this waste of sound waves . Nas was right when he said that hip hop is a dead genre , well , Drake proves it with his crap attempt at trying to make even mildly mediocre music .	-1
Wow ! ! ! He sucks im sorry , but its true . What is he label as a `` Rapper '' or a `` Singer '' idk but his music is wack to me .	-1
I cant believe people serious are atrackted to this album..i personally hate it..Ever single song sounds just alike and same wit the beats..he doesnt change up his pace when he ryhmes just same pace and same beat is what it songs like to me..Only song i actually think is worth the money is Up All Night ( Feat ) Nicki Minaj..Overall there is to much hype around this guy for no reason , yes he is capiable of making good songs but not a whole album ... NOT WORTH IT	-1
Drake ? ... .ha ... lol ! ... .I ONLY GAVE IT ONE STAR TO GET ON ... I WOULD N'T REALLY GIVE IT THAT ! ! ! This is straight up Garbage ... .no more , no less ... .this dude is just the latest fake a** `` hip hop artist '' ... this dude ca n't rap..and the beats ... wait my bad ... what beats ... there are no beats ... ..this sucks hardcore ... .If I hear/see one more fake rapper ... I 'm hijacking a radio station/WITH MY IPOD AND A CRATE OF SOME OF THE FINESTE TRACKS OUT THERE ... BUT NO MORE OF THIS ... flat out ... this is what hip hop has become ... .then im done with it ... .FURTHER PROOF THAT ALL OF THESE WHACK A $ $ NO TALENT ... NO FLOW , NO MIKE ROCKING SKILLS HAVING SUCKAS HAVE DESTROYED WHAT USED TO BE A BEAUTIFUL THING ! *AND WHAT TEARS MY DAMN NERVES UP IS THAT SOMEONE COMPARED THIS TRASH TO MOS DEF , LAURYN HILL AND OTHER REAL HIP HOP ARTIST ... .OMG ... .I MIGHT JUST OFF MYSELF- IF I HAVE TO CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THIS WHACK AZZ WORLD ! ! !	-1
I am a Trace fan . He has had all excellent CD releases ... .until this one.He is , nontheless , a wonderful man full of insight and compasion . He works tirelessly for the troops and Wounded Warrior Project . I am in full support of that too.I have seen him in concert 3 times.The last , in early autumn , at Riverbend in Cincinatti . He was with Toby Keith.The Riverbend concert ... ..left me stunned as to where the other Trace had gone . All poll dancing style music . He was , actually , seeming to be `` not into it '' .However , I did buy this CD ... .listened once , and sold it . I 'm keeping all my others he has done.I truly hope my Trace I knew comes back . I was with friends , and we were in agreement about his new choices.Save your $ $ $ .Write his fan club.Let 's help bring our fine Trace back . I do n't know what sales this has ... .but I do n't expect they were very good .	-1
Deerhoof meets Timbaland and cloyingly contrived at that . Do n't get me wrong , in the context of your typically warped indie hipster 's obligatory of-the-moment-cool , Treats is capable of becoming an occasionally fun novelty- one with little to no staying power .	-1
And they get paid for this ? Man , who said the guys on Wall Street deserved to be locked up for ripping us apart ? This is undiluted crap - end of story . Can one give a MINUS for the star rating ?	-1
ughthis is more general than just talking about this specific album , but overall this album made me even more realize that eminem needs to:1 ) stop screaming2 ) stop singing3 ) stop talking about how everyone hates him , the price of fame , blah blah4 ) start rapping in his old rap voice from SSLP and MMLP5 ) appease his core fans that were there from the beginning with the same witty lyricism he was first known for . the most important word there being & # 34 ; witty & # 34 ; 6 ) get some hotter beats that are n't made by him or dre ( yes i said it ) , and that fit his style7 ) stop trying to be a technical whiz at rapping and go back to the witty content that i liked before ( see number 5 ) i do n't know what else to say , i felt like i wasted my money on this .	-1
I used to like Eminem , but after hearing this im not a fan of him . It was June 18th,2010 , i just took my science final so i had a half day of school . I was watching the fuse eminem takeover and i saw the video for not afraid , it was cool so i went to fye and bought the cd . I thought it would be great but was i wrong ! ! ! ! 1 . `` Cold Wind Blows '' - okay opening , kindda funny ( 4 out of 5 ) 2 . `` Talkin ' 2 Myself '' ( featuring Kobe ) - okay track , not a fan of kobe or the lyrics . ( 3 out of 5 ) 3 . `` On Fire '' - one of the good songs ( 4 Out of 5 ) 4 . `` Wo n't Back Down '' ( featuring Pink ) - not a fan of this song , i hated pink 's part ! ( 2 out of 5 ) 5 . `` W.T.P . `` - okay song , i liked it ( 3 out of 5 ) 6 . `` Going Through Changes '' - another song about his daughter . ( 2 out of 5 ) 7 . `` Not Afraid '' - i used to like it but it gets annoying hearing it all over the radio and s*** ( 3 out of 5 ) 8 . `` Seduction '' - hated it ( 1 out of 5 ) 9 . `` No Love '' ( featuring Lil Wayne ) - this song is getting a one from me because wayne is in it ( 1.5 out of 5 ) 10 . `` Space Bound '' - stupid song , i hate the music video and chorus ( 1.5 out of 5 ) 11 . `` Cinderella Man '' - Great song . ( 5 out of 5 ) 12 . `` 25 to Life '' - kind of boring song ( 1 out of 5 ) 13 . `` So Bad '' - only song produced by dre , so it has to be great ( 4.5 out of 5 ) 14 . `` Almost Famous '' - okay song , not the best ( 2 out of 5 ) 15 . `` Love the Way You Lie '' ( featuring Rihanna ) - my god i hate this song so freakin much , rhianna sucks , the beat sucks and the lyrics suck , worst song on the album ( 1 out of 5 ) 16 . `` You 're Never Over '' - R.I.P Proof ( 4 out of 5 ) 17 . `` Untitled '' ( hidden track ) - good song ( 3 out of 5 ) so in my opinion i didnt like this album , i thought em sould out but after hearing hell the sequal i still have hope	-1
I 've been a long time Eminem fan , but this album does n't compare to even Relapse itself . I do n't get it , he claims he 's king of rap in `` Not Afraid '' but apologizes to the arrogant Kanye West and terrible MC Lil Wayne that he felt threatened by how good they are ( from his perspective ) . Well , maybe it 's up to debate now , since he 's taken himself down a couple of notches in this new release . I guess good things ca n't last forever , meaning the angsty and controversial Eminem is long gone now .	-1
Well , I wonder what exactly Eminem Recovered from ? Because he 's still talking about taking drugs , degrading women , pissed at the world , making fun of people , and throwing a whole bunch of nursery rhyme cuss words around every other line . Now , first of all , I DO think Eminem has talent do n't get me wrong . I think he 's got lyrical skills and his flow can be close to unmatched , however , I 've been waiting for him to mature as an artist forever but he ca n't . He 's still that angry confused scared little boy . And it 's the image he is forced to put out because he 's a corporate puppet , and it sucks but the only way Eminem will ever stay around is to talk about the same negative garbage he 's been talking about since he first came out . I 'm not hating on Em man , I think he 's hating on himself by not coming out with any songs that have positive messages to them . The song `` Not Afraid '' sounds like a positive song until you listen to the lyrics ! Yeah follow this guy that talks about dropping ex and f* & king for christmas , great role model to follow . I do n't know man , maybe I just changed with time and got smart enough to see through this crap . Anyway , if your buying this album looking for the same Eminem you always loved ... you 'll like it , maybe even love it . But ... if you buy this album thinking you 're going to hear something different from him ... .well then he gotcha ! Ohhh yeah if you want to spend your money wisely on an album right now you need to cop Nas & Damian Marley-Distant Relatives , best hip hop album out right now ! ! ! Now I 'm off to go check out that new Roots cd , peace mayne !	-1
I have no idea why so many people like this album . The production is horrid and uninspired . Em ca n't sing and should never try to do it . The man 's rapping even sucks on this `` effort '' . He does a freakin duet with Pink now ? ? Whats next ? ? ? Just a poor excuse for an album by a guy that wrote brilliant material in the past ( Slim Shady LP , Marshall Mathers LP ) Em tried to take himself very seriously on this record . This whole album sounds like a second rate , generic radio offering . In a word , BORING .	-1
Yet another example of a bunch of great musicians falling prey to the `` every great artist has one or two bad releases '' trope . I ca n't believe the reviews I 'm reading -- are we listening to the same album ? What a letdown ... I do n't even know where to start with this one . And if I read one more bit of fluff about how `` Tin Can Trust '' is as good as `` Kiko '' or `` The Town and The City '' I think that I 'll have to get my eyes checked.Anyway -- the lyrics are horrendous , the rhymes are obvious and laughable , and the music itself plods along with none of the aplomb of any of the group 's previous efforts . Cesar 's now-standard album combo of a cumbia and a norteno are barely passable retreads of ANY of his past work , and the rocker with Robert Hunter leads me to question the former Dead lyricist 's self-judgment . I 'm also questioning the cover of `` West L.A. Fadeaway '' -- was that really necessary ? Meanwhile , David 's and Louie 's tunes shamble from nowhere to nowhere with barely concealed sloth and somnolence , with the two best -- meaning acceptable -- songs ( `` Jupiter '' and `` 27 Spanishes '' ) sounding like a better Lobos tune from a past work and a tongue-in-cheek yet resigned version of `` Cortez The Killer , '' respectively . The tossed-off instrumental gets tiresome after about 30 seconds , and reminds one too much of Stevie Ray Vaughan 's `` Scuttle Buttin . ' '' Do n't believe the hype -- `` Tin Can Trust '' lives down to its name , and there is absolutely no way that this work is anywhere as excellent as the group 's past albums .	-1
THe only good hook on this album ( Firework ) was stolen from Erasure 's 1994 hit `` Always . `` Check YouTube and some guy posted a video comparing the two songs.From the autotune to the toni Basil rip-off `` Peacock '' to Snoop Dogg phoning in a guest spot on the 100 % originally titled `` California Gurls , '' this is one of the biggest shams ever hoisted upon the American listening public.Milli Vanilli was more original than this . And to think she tied Michael Jackson 's chart record ! ! The King Of Pop is rolling over in his grave . How can any adult with any sense of pride and dignity release an album this bad ?	-1
Sure , my 9 year old likes 'Teenage Dream ' and 'Firework ' , but then something funny happened . I played some quality old school Donna Summer ( little do the 'teeny boppers ' today actually know that Summer 's collaboration with Giorgio Moroder virtually invented and launched electronic dance music ) and Madonna for her , and she said & # 34 ; WOW dad , this is better than Katy Perry ! & # 34 ; Smart kid ! Katy Perry , like most industry-created minimally talented subpar artists of today , pale in comparison to their great predecessors . If you kiddies want to hear some great danceable pop music , delve into your parents ' CD and LP ( record ) collection from the 60 's through 80 's for some real substantive music ! You 're welcome .	-1
Are you people insane ? Look I understand music is subjective and what is good and bad is defined by the listener , but COME ON ! ! ! This album is garbage no matter how you look at it . I mean , where to begin ? The stupid , hedonistic , purposely trashy lyrics ? ( Its one thing to have adult themes in your music , but this is one step away from prostitution ) . The flat , dull , boring music ( any moron with a keyboard and pro tools can make a catchy beat , thats no reason for a five star review ) ? Her obvious lack of singing chops ? Give me a break . Boring , unintelligent dribble designed for stupid people , mostly women , to shake their asses to while drunk .	-1
There I was , sitting in my comfy chair watching TV , half asleep . Then it happened ! All of a sudden , this great banshee-like cry erupted from the TV , a soul burning screech that nearly knocked me out of my seat : `` AAAAIEE-AIEEEE-AIEEEE , EAST COAST GURLS ... '' .What the heck was that , I wondered . Did someone murder a cat slowly ? Did someone get their toenails pulled out ? No . It was this thing , this human ghetto blaster , this creature in a push-up bra - Katy Perry . Who would listen to this sound pollution ? But then I thought `` It is just one bad song , maybe she is not just some propped-up hoochie . I should listen to her whole CD.That was a BIG mistake . One `` song '' worse than the last . `` AAAAIIEEE-AAAAIEE-AAAIIEEE ! ! ! ! ! '' . Prisoners at Gitmo deserve better . So do you , buy some real music instead of this 3rd grade nonsense .	-1
I was looking forward to Teenage Dream because I enjoyed One Of The Boys . But once I listened to Teenage Dream , I realized that most of the album was composed of generic club songs . There are a few good songs on the album like `` Pearl '' and `` Not Like The Movies '' , but the majority of the songs are just bad . I expected a lot more .	-1
Katy Perry knows how to market herself . The first few lines of the opening title track of new album `` Teenage Dream '' are proof enough before considering the cotton candy nudity of the cover art . She has also clearly worked hard to maintain her career in the competitive couple of years since she released her debut in pre-Gaga 2008.Still , `` Teenage Dream '' is a slave to the unfortunate era in which it was created and equally unfortunate ( uninformed ) audience it was designed for.If a more sophisticated CD is a fancy dinner in a French restaurant , `` Teenage Dream '' is Coca-Cola to be lapped up by the masses - from Beijing to Burbank.Pop radio is by now little more than gimmicky ads and faceless tunes crafted by `` professionals '' that replace melodies with repetitive beats and last just long enough before the average listener 's attention span runs its course . The ads sound like songs and the songs sound like ads . `` Teenage Dream '' is designed to toss off hits deep into 2011 , and it surely will . The problem is that a product designed to appeal to the largest possible audience can only be as good as the average individual 's taste in that audience.This is not music concerned with strong , lasting pop melodies or well-written lyrics , although they occasionally arise on the likes of `` Circle the Drain '' ( a goodbye to a drug abuser with a painfully forced F-bomb for lame shock value ) and `` Who Am I Living For , '' which finds Perry 's voice painfully off-pitch , forced beyond its limits . `` Pearl '' is more exemplary , designed to exploit the average teenage girl 's insecurities with its recycled message of empowerment . Mediocrity is the name of the game.This is a batch of tunes crafted to make money in 2010 by cashing in on the taste buds of an audience that , as of this writing , watches `` Keeping Up with the Kardashians '' and `` Jersey Shore '' and , as it will with these tunes , have forgotten them with the passing of a year or two.Take these lyrics from `` Last Friday Night ( TGIF ) , '' sure to be a major hit : '' Pink flamingos in the pool/I smell like a minibar/DJ 's passed out in the yard/Barbie 's on the barbeque/There 's a hickie or a bruise/Pictures of last night/Ended up online/I 'm screwed , oh well . `` Perry shows ambition . She goes for a surprising variety of subject matter ( compare the left-field `` E.T . '' to more obvious tunes like the highly textured , admittedly catchy `` California Gurls '' featuring Snoop Dogg , having a ball and paying his bills ) and gamely displays her forceful , if ragged ( and estrogen-stripped ) , vocal ability.However , ambition does not equal talent . Results are what matter , and they show that Perry crafts two kinds of songs - sexaholic drivel designed to be hits for the non-thinking general public and decidedly more serious tunes that not only reveal the unflattering limits of her actual talent but that come off hopelessly forced and insincere.In the 80s , when pure pop painted itself all over mainstream radio , kids were exposed to Michael Jackson , Prince and Gloria Estefan , artists who crafted state-of-the-art hits that were well-sung , well-produced and had melodies . They were catchy then and remain so now . What do kids have now ? Katy Perry.It 's a hell of a step down .	-1
If ever a singer was born with a flat boring voice , Katy Perry was/is . Her top song `` Fireworks '' , is another example of a dumb song sung by an even more juvenile singer.When I see Katy Perry sing on award shows I realize that she is n't a singer at all , just another minimal talent dressed up like a sexy lady with silly props to prop up the no-talent . Calling her Generic would be too kind.She is a parody of a singer.Do n't buy this rubbish .	-1
Seriously ? ! People actually listen to this tripe ? I 've heard so much about Perry lately , that I thought I 'd give her new album a listen . If this is what is actually passing as music these days , then we 're in a lot of trouble . It 's childish , mindless and devoid of any inspiration . The music itself is cookie-cutter bubblegum trash and the lyrics are extremely immature and nauseating .	-1
there is little point -- other that revenue generation -- for this iteration of `` Promises Promises '' -- that show which proved that Bacharach and David could not just play with the `` big boy '' but beat them too . but there are no improved performances here . worse , the inclusion of songs that were not in the original only adds to the mediocrity of the effort . mr bacharach and mr david could not have been pleased with this effort .	-1
After hearingNew Blood , Peter Gabriel 's inventive orchestral renditions of his own songs , I had high hopes for this CD . Sting has been my favorite musician since the 80s , and as prolific a career as he 's had , he has certainly earned the right to `` revisit '' his work as often as he wants ( and this project was , apparently , by request . ) Unfortunately , it did n't live up to my hopes . Most of the arrangements have so many pop elements that they really are n't that different from the original songs . There was nothing that distinguished them enough from the originals to make me care about them . They have the same pop beats and follow the same progression and tempo , and the orchestra plays almost the same music that Sting 's musicians played on the original recordings . ( A clarinetist on `` Englishman in New York '' was assigned the dull task of recreating Branford Marsalis ' playing almost note for note . *Yaaawn . * ) Overall the arrangements lack originality and do n't present a unique take on Sting 's songs , as was done with Peter Gabriel 's on `` New Blood . `` There are four exceptions : Roxanne , I Burn For You , Black Seam , and The Pirate 's Bride . Roxanne and Pirate 's Bride in particular are hauntingly beautiful . ( Though I can imagine many Police fans rolling their eyes at a symphonic version of Roxanne ! ) And as much as I love Sting 's voice , I think an instrumental take on the better known songs would have been a worthwhile creative endeavor by these orchestras . It would have distinguished them further from the originals and allowed the melodies to shine apart from the lyrics.The other things that disappointed me about this CD was the song selection . It 's mostly `` B-side '' songs . Sting 's popular hits are not included ( unless you count Roxanne ) .	-1
I would like to start by quoting that I highly value Sting as a musician and composer . At the same time I have the feeling that his first solo album blue turtle etc . has been his best achievement after the police . with an excellent and energetic bandand extremely adequat rithm section at hand . This project with a symphony orchestra is always tricky and my hunch that it will be not very interesting with old stuff polished into a violin setting is confirmed.No surprises in the arrangements and why not try completely new compositons instead of roxanne for the 50th time ? Sting plays it safe again and as he has become financially independant why not try a challanging type of music .	-1
It 's not about copyright infringement , it 's taking the name of an established pop classic song , changing one letter , and pulling one over on those who do n't know better , and for those who do realizing there was a lack of creativity here , as often is the case when you go for the teenybopper market . For her next song she might try these titles : Like a Rolling Stoned , or I ca n't get no Satisfacshun , or another Beach Boys rip off like Good Vibraytions . One more thing in response to the reviewer to whom this is in response to : saying someone/something `` rocks '' is so yesterday , and so passe ' .	-1
I thought this was a joke at first . I did n't think such a tacky creature could exist , but apparently he has three albums out . Great music for elevators , or as a birthday present to someone you hate . Maybe someone who set your dog on fire .	-1
For an album that kept getting delayed and delayed let me say I would have expected a better put together album than this one because let me say this was an album thrown together probably in less than a week.This is an album Diddy did n't put much thought into because really his best songs on the album he already released like `` Angels '' , '' Hello Good Morning '' , '' Loving You No More '' , and `` Coming Home '' .	-1
I did n't hear much on here that was on the show ... I suppose I should have listened to it first and realized that my friend was only kidding when he said he wanted it ...	-1
This is just as bad as their last effort if not WORSE ... .and I did n't think it could get any worse . This album sounds identical to the last ablum ... .and EVERY song sounds like the last song , this is one boring album . There is no song that I need to hear again ( ever for that matter ) . I gave this band one more chance because I liked their first album . This is another band that I will need to turn my back on . It was fun for one album but the last two are so much of the same it has become very stale and boring . How is this band so popular I just do n't get it . Good Bye Maroon 5 you will not be missed in my world . If you loved the last album then pick it up it sounds exactly the same , in fact if you liked the last album just listen to that and you would n't know the difference . So If you ask me what I think about this album , I can sum it up easy for you ... .Stale , Boring , Clone Like , and Lame .	-1
CD is ok , but really wanted Moves Like Jagger . Just wrong that the song is shown as on the CD , but it was n't ! Felt ripped off , to be honest . Just because of that I rated it 1 star .	-1
Sorry for the one-star review . It 's not for Sandy who I believe is one of greatest artists to emerge from the late sixties . It 's a weak attempt to counter the large number of 5-star ratings of a set which repeats itself endlessly and overlaps repeatedly with the material most of us already own.Here is the track listing and see if you do n't agree : Disc 01 -

The limited edition nature of this project has elevated the price to astronomic levels.The single disc of demos on Sandy 's `` Boxful of Treasures '' is wonderful . I would like to get my hands on all of the demos because , like many other reviewers here , I agree that much of her material suffered from over-production . That sad mournful voice accompanied only by piano or acoustic guitar is the best way to hear Sandy Denny.I 'll stick with `` Boxful of Treasures '' , her Fairport , Strawbs , Fotheringay and solo records ( before and after Fairport ) and skip this overpriced , overlapping monstrosity . If the producer of this box would be kind enough to release the other `` unreleased '' demos as a standalone set , I 'd be more than happy to purchase it -- -- even at a premium price . But this set is , sorry , ridiculous .	-1
Apparently , this band went in that route that bands sometimes take in which they want to experiment and what comes out is not a great album , this ... is that type of album.I own every album of theirs and this to me is their worst album . It is n't nothing like their previous ones , it 's too short , too melancholy and it hardly has that riff and energy as their other albums have had . 'Life Turns Electric ' is a bad album by the band . From 10 songs , I liked just 3 . The album opener , 'Pieces Fit ' and 'Famous Last Words'.It is really sad to botch this album but ... it 's really that bad , in my opinion	-1
Unfortunately , it seems that Finger Eleven has completely ditched their old sound of rock and settled comfortably with being generic and trying to make every song radio-friendly . The entire album is generic , stale , and a jumbled mess . As I said , it 's unfortunate because this used to be one of my favorite bands . Then , they changed their style once `` One Thing '' became overplayed on the radio . From that point on , they transformed their style into something that is completely different and much worse than their old sound . To hear good rock-driven Finger Eleven , check out their first two or three CDs . Their first two are their best , the third is acceptable . From the fourth and fifth , you hear the poppy garbage that 's present on this album . Good bye , Finger Eleven , you sold out .	-1
Bret Michaels seems to be everywhere lately . The Poison front man and solo artist has done 3 seasons of Rock of Love for television , appeared on The Apprentice and a few other tv shows , received publicity for the song `` Nothing To Lose '' which featured Miley Cyrus and was in the hospital not too long ago . But to be honest I was always more of a fan of the music he did with and outside of Poison than I am of his newfound celebrity status . I liked the material Bret released with Poison , especially the first few albums , and to some extend his solo career . Custom Built is Bret ` s fifth studio solo album , sixth if you count 2008 ` s Rock My World which had only 3 new songs and was mostly a greatest hits of his solo career up to that point and a promotional tool for his Rock of Love series.I think the material here is supposed to appeal to fans of the Rock of Love series or just Bret Michaels who don ` t know anything about his past music . A duet with Miley Cyrus was sure to bring Bret some attention on radio and bring him new fans who weren ` t familiar with him . I don ` t mean the material on the album is bad but this is almost the same thing Rock My World was , old songs with a few new thrown in and remixes . There are 12 songs on Custom Built of which 7 are new songs , there are two bonus songs included with the digital download only ( other versions of new songs Lie To Me and Wasted Time ) . Out of those seven songs there ` s the song for his new tv show Riding Against The Wind ( which is a very good song , I ` ll give him that ) Nothing To Lose with Miley Cyrus ( which depending how you view it might be good or absolute trash ) plus a solo version of the same song . There ` s also a cover song `` What I Got '' , another version of Every Rose Has It ` s Thorn ( I don ` t like this version , I thought it was such a personal song that including all those musicians kind of ruined it for me in the end ) and two new songs Lie To Me and Wasted Time which are good . Bret stays with the country-rock formula that he has stuck with his entire solo career , for the most part it ` s a pleasant sound and it works for him.So here ` s a summary of what Bret did on Custom Built : -Two new mixes of Driven ( that song has been on Freedom of Sound , Rock My World , Acoustic sessions and now on Custom Built ) and Go That Far . The mixes are not bad but the songs are not new.-Two versions of a new song Nothing To Lose.-His new television show ` s theme song.-Two other new songs ( total of five `` brand new '' songs ) -A new version of Every Rose Has It ` s Thorn with other artists.-A cover song.-Two Songs from `` Freedom of Sound '' .-One song from `` A Letter From Death Row '' .Correct me if I ` m wrong but there doesn ` t seem to be a whole lot of new on Custom Built . What ` s on the album is definitely not bad but I ` d prefer all-new material especially considering how Rock My World had only three new songs . If you just want the new songs go ahead but otherwise you will probably be deceved.I think the two new mixes are not bad , but rather unnecessary . Plus doing a new version of Every Rose Has Its Thorn seems useless as well if it ` s not going to be that great . I don ` t think Michaels will really impress anyone here but his new material is true to himself which is not a bad thing . As much as I love Bret as a musicians I ` d recommend this to casual fans and collectors only . I can ` t give this more than two stars unfortunately .	-1
I am currently listening to this NEWEST by Fantasia . I have to give it a second go to see if I missed something from the first go around . After the first three songs , I sat there wondering if this cd was going to pick it up . At the fourth and fifth track its starts to pick up : Whos loving you , Cornbread ... ..But then , it just never picks up . The singing is stellar but I guess it 's just the song writing or selection of songs . I still love her singing but I just do n't think this cd is THE ONE ! I find this an issue with all top female singers currently : they are singing songs all wrong for their voices . The guys writing for them just do n't know what to do with that power ! I think about Etta James and the songs she sang back in the day . Maybe they should go back and listen to some of those oldies to get a clue as to what to sing about and how ! Remember how Beyonce sung Etta in Cadillac Records ? Maybe she should have just waited for the drama in her life to blow over . I just was n't blown away by this . Sorry . Just 2 stars here .	-1
I still been unable to dig this girl , she just do n't have any talent at all and is not about my taste for music because when she first came into the mainstream of music I got very interested but as time pass by she proof to be `` A ONE HIT WONDER `` She can hang around famous musicians ( real ones ) still I doubt that she ever be able to be one or pull anything worth to spend any money on her music	-1
It 's not very often you will find an artist who still has popularity , selling singles , getting airplay , and than seems to purposely self destruct their career with one bad recording after another . But that 's exactly what Sheryl Crow has been doing for 7 years now . This following 2002 's excellent Cmon Cmon CD and her huge hit single Soak Up The Sun AND 2003 The Very Best Of with the MEGA hit The First Cut Is The Deepest . Ever since she has been putting out material that doesnt have a chance of being successful . It started with 2005 dreary sounding Wildflower release , than even worse 2008 Detour , and now the worst yet 100 Miles From Memphis . She just seems to have lost all ability to write a catchy song and the Southern soul music that Crow loved as a kid just doesnt stir me at all . Drenched in full-bodied brass sections and stirring B3 organ runs , her voice fails to reach the full range of the songs she sings especially on Stop . Sheryl Crow is a great talent , has a great voice , and also she is gorgeous ( I love the cover of the album ) . But her material is just greatly lacking , she needs better songs and better production on her albums ! Some of ther songs are upbeat but they arent catchy and there are still plenty of dreary sounding tunes like her previous 2 albums . It 's all lackluster . This CD is enjoying some pretty good internet sales and on Amazon right now . But going by the poor reviews and even low customer reviews , this CD will burn out fast ! Again , Sheryl has plenty of fans who long for another great album , but it 's just not happening and it 's going on a decade now !	-1
... up to the social security office on the seventh floor to collect my first check , I will hear this music over the tinny loudspeaker in the elevator . 'Nuff said .	-1
I must be getting old ( OK , I AM getting old ) , but I ca n't understand why Eric Whitacre 's music has been embraced by so many , why it 's won Grammys and other awards , etc . To me , it 's like a caricature of new age music ; it 's like a soundtrack for a `` hip '' movie - all it needs is Enya wailing in the last track ( to be candid , I did n't make it that far ) . Not for me at all .	-1
Well , when it was first heard in The Last Samurai , it was different , simple , yet epic . Then it was used again in Batman Begins in a more darker , mysterious and subtle approach . Then , The Dark Knight introduced that same two-note motif in it 's most aggressive performance ever . Now , for Inception , well , it 's epic again ... or is it ? After four soundtracks released with this Two-Note motif approach , you start to wonder if Zimmer is really trying to convince himself that he is still doing something different and creative . As a listener , and a fan of Hans Zimmer , you really feel that this is not different or epic at all , like when it was first heard . In my personal opinion , I find it to be a complete lack of effort from this composer , and it worries me . If you listen to Hans Zimmer 's compositions , apart from these two-note motif inspirations , you will find an array of beautifull unique compositions that do not resemble each other ( The Lion King , Spirit , Gladiator , Pearl Harbor , Tears of the Sun , King Arthur , POTC : At World 's End , The Holiday ) and still convey a sense of grandeur and emotion . Even The Da Vinci Code used a bit of this two-note motif prolongation in the masterpiece song Chevaliers de Sangreal . So ... until when are we still gon na be amazed by a two-note prolongation ? I really ca n't say I wan na buy this soundtrack because it 's yet another variation on the two-note motif heard already in The Last Samurai , Batman Begins , The Da Vinci Code and The Dark Knight . Since I already have all of these soundtracks , I 'm really not interested in hearing it again.What started out as a good and innovative idea has become , ironically , an excuse for staying in the same comfort zone that worked so well , initially , for The Last Samurai . It 's no longer creative nor innovative , it 's the contrary : a complete lack of creative thought in the composition process and a very predictable outcome .	-1
I 'm hoping eventually A7X will achieve a solid album start to finish . As of yet , the whole does not equal the sum of their individual parts . They 've got a good vocalist ( for the genre ) and an awesome guitarist . But this latest offering feels lazy and uninspired . They can do better .	-1
First off , if you know you will disagree with my review and call me too `` shallow '' , or , more politically correctly put , ca n't accept me having a different opinion than you , stop reading this review right now . You wo n't change my mind , and I would n't even try changing yours . Anyways.Yes , the death of an amazing drummer was shocking to me . I kinda knew about his drug addiction but honestly never thought it would be to the point where the Rev would die . That said , when I pondered A7X 's future , I was unsure if they 'd be a band anymore , but like any band should , they will carry on . Jimmy would be pissed at them for just quitting because of his death . So rest assured , hopefully we 'll get more albums from Avenged.That said , Nightmare is a disappointment . After 5 spins of this album , I can honestly say I do n't like it . I was expecting this though , since their self titled was a disappointment . A flip through the songs will show that most of the songs sound the same and Shads sounds so boring here . Seriously , first time I heard the album , I thought `` WOW , he 's going through the motions . Like he 's reading the lyrics off a paper . `` Nightmare is an ugly pop song . It reeks so much of `` song written by mainstream success '' and `` rehash '' it is n't even funny . The lyrics are awful and childish . I hate how Shads keeps yelling about `` You '' , or `` your nightmare '' , or how `` You should have known the price of evil '' . Plus , there are are some UGLY inflections in Shads ' singing , right from the end of each line in verse one : BELOW ! ! ! ! ! ! SHOW ! ! ! ! ! ! ! FOREVER ! ! ! ! ! ! MIND ! ! ! ! ! ! SIDE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! . The midsection confirms that they have now turned into what I call `` Ed Hardy Wearing Douche Bag Rock '' . And then of course , the insertion of the piano which is a total rehash of a previous song , `` Tension '' . My poor ears ! ! ! Welcome To The Family is a decent song . Liked the verse but the chorus was boring.Danger Line is an awesome song musically but we 're getting a WWII message . And if I wan na be lectured about WWII , I 'll dig up one of my history books.Buried Alive is the reason people call A7X emo garbage . While I disagree with the often repeated stereotype , this song is showing A7X are quickly becoming what their detractors have called them from the beginning . Boring music and sucky lyrics , although the solo from Syn is cool.Natural Born Killer is easily the best tune on the album . I love the hardcore , all out feel . It just makes me want to headbang and it 's a perfect reminder of their old days . Problem with it though is that it seems really out of place , sequence wise , as it sounds like it should be placed later in the album.So Far Away is a decent ballad . Shads sounds emotional and painful , the music is some of A7X 's best ever and the lyrics are heartbreaking . However , a big problem with this album , and especially with this track , is that they 're losing their metal edge , and are now just becoming straightforward rock . Which brings me to the next song.God Hates Us is probably the second of the three only good songs on the album . The intro can fool you . It certainly did for me , then SUDDENLY IT EXPLODES , and just beats you while you 're down . Why not a whole album like this song ? Victim begins with church bells and a chorus , and it 's clear that A7X is throwing sound at us again , like the tribal drum beat on Brompton Cocktail . I listen to a Bruce Dickinson song ( Man of Sorrows ) that has a chorus in the opening and I feel like it 's there for a reason . The lyrics are touching , but they deserve better music . Why is half the album boring ballads ? This is seriously the most bipolar album I 've ever heard , and not in a good way.Tonight The World Dies . It 's an OK song but put it on City of Evil and I would have hit the `` skip '' button.Fiction is really interesting to me . The gothic piano is intoxicating . The lyrics are very sad- it seems like The Rev knew he was going to die , telling us he wanted us to be OK without him . This was a demo called `` Death '' , which was given to the band 3 days before his death . I broke down crying the first time I heard it . The best thing about it is Jimmy 's vocals . The worst thing about it is the fact that the best thing about it is Jimmy 's vocals . If not for his vocals , in fact if M. Shadows had sung on it , it 'd be the weak track it is . It kind of seems as if it does n't have a good ground to stand on , like you know there SHOULD be more . It 's a cool track that at the same time is a very weak track.Save Me is the final TRULY good track . An epic , it 's basically the band trying to get out of the nightmare . It has a frantic feel to it , the music is just outstanding , and it 's in the same vein as The Wicked End.I 've said enough things about the songs , but I ca n't say anything about the actual ALBUM as a whole . I ca n't just listen to a single track . An album is like a classical music symphony- sure listening to a song/movement is fun , but it defeats the purpose of a body of work as a whole . I guess you can say this is a good collection of songs , but as an album , it fails miserably . Every track feels out of place with the one before it . I listen to City of Evil , and I feel like I 'm on a fun heavy metal roller coaster ride . I listen to this and I feel like I 'm on an elevator to the top floor of an office building.As for Portnoy , he 's a great drummer and he does good here . Jimmy would be proud , knowing his favorite drummer is filling in for him . However , a dead drummer does n't make this album magically better , and for that , this album simply fails .	-1
the girl is a really `` virtuosa '' one , but drives me crazy with her shouts , Sorry about it , is just my opinion .	-1
There is no doubt Esperanza is talented and beautiful but she suffers from self-indulgence and repetitious scat singing which I 've never liked . I can put up with a little of it when someone like Curt Elling does it , but she scats more than she sings and her thin reedy voice just ca n't keep it interesting . Her meandering compositions are not melodically strong enough to hold my interest . All three albums suffer the same flaws to my ear . One can only hope as she matures that she will write more songs with actual words and melody and some emotional depth .	-1
I probably should not even be rating this CD because I only listened to it once . I read an interview with Esperanza Spalding and she sounded interesting and I thought her music sounded like it would be good . One of the things I kept reading about in the interview and in different reviews was how she often wrote her own lyrics . She also set music to poetry . So , I was excited to hear this . However , what nobody mentioned at least everywhere I looked , was that at least half of the songs on this CD ( probably more ) do not have lyrics at all . She is singing but I guess really it is just scat that she is doing . Anyway , it is very annoying to me and it just makes the music sound pretentious . I like the first song quite well actually and I like the other songs which do have lyrics pretty well but all in all I think Spalding needs to work on tightening what it is she is trying to say as an artist and musician .	-1
Did one of the members of the band write the description ? ? ? This is generic guitar pop , and not especially good pop at that . Poor production as well . Better not quit that day job at the hipster boutique just yet ... ..	-1
This review is not coming from a cynical or spiteful perspective , but I expected a lot more than this . I have been an Ours fan for a long time and have seen them perform live countless times . I saw Jimmy play a solo show a few weeks before this album came out and was a bit underwhelmed by the material . After a few weeks of spinning this album I still feel the same . `` I Heard You Singing '' was one of my favorites until it was placed on this album . It is poorly produced and comes across as extremely cheesy . I will never listen to `` Gravity '' ever again . This album fails to excite the listener into the ups , downs , grooves , and hopes that were always a major part of Ours ' music in the past . I really want to like this album but it is simply unimpressive . On the surface , it comes across as an attempt to cater to a more commercial audience ( to sell more records ) , which is the death of all good music . This a giant step backwards for Mr. Gnecco . A few standout tracks do come to mind though : `` Light On the Grave '' and `` Patiently Waiting '' are both tip top , but save your money on this one kids .	-1
I have Love On The Inside and Enjoy The Ride which I really enjoy . This one however is simply not good . They take a more rockier approach on this record which is nice but the songs are just not as memorable as their 2 previous albums . Probably 3 tracks are worth downloading at the most . Really disappointed !	-1
I am a big Sugarland fan ! I have all their cds ! I got this new one for my 23rd birthday and I listened to it in my car 2 times all the way through and I HATE IT ! It is different then the other albums yes way yes ! but there are a couple of songs on the cd that ae good like `` EVERY GIRL LIKE ME '' , `` STUCK LIKE GLUE '' & `` LITTLE MISS '' only songs I like really . glad i didnt buy it and it was a gift ! I feel this is a big let down for us sugarland fans ! but i love the LOVE ON THE INSIDE CD ! ! !	-1
the only thing to be incredible is how this garbage can sell so much . No fiddle , no steel guitar , no B-3 , no dobro , no banjo , no feelings , no soul , NOT COUNTRY.If you want to have a TRUE country music album this is just not for you , you 'll find your stuff with George Strait , Alan Jackson , Travis Tritt , George Jones , David Kersh , Clay Walker , Easton Corbin , Chris Young , Sammy Kershaw , Randy Travis and some of Brad Paisley , Miranda Lambert and Dierks Bentley roots . But even if you are looking for some country-pop artists go to listen at least TALENTED artists such as Carrie Underwood , Keith Urban , Tim McGraw , Kenny Chesney , Darius Rucker , Blake Shelton , old Taylor Swift stuff , The Band Perry etc . and do n't listen to this horrible band and album .	-1
I bought this album expecting something new and fresh ... instead ... I got the same rehashed music from the last three albums . This CD is sickening and I will NEVER listen to it again ! I HATE it ! It is pure TRASH ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I have been a fan of Tom Jones for a long time and have every cd he has out , but I must say that this cd is a hugedisappointment and his voice has really lost a lot of his power . The music selection is not what I expected . Donot reccomend and I really do not like .	-1
This is an initial review as I may re-listen and re-review ... Good sound and musician ability , the female singer has a really good voice and can howl with the best of 'em , but , It can get a little too invasive.It 's not a selective scream to convey a point it 's just constant and repetitive , just a little too much ... The songs with limited screams are very good , the one 's with repetitive screams , especially when they scream all of the lyrics and repeating the chorus in screams , are just too much . Alot of potential here just TOO MUCH SCREAMING ... 2.5 stars would be more accurate and if the screams were more selective , and less invasive , it could easily get 4.Update 1/16/2011As originally stated just too much screaming , when she sings and punctuates it with an appropriate howl ( pain stress mad etc ) it 's good but again 4 solid minutes of screaming especially from a really good voice is too much ...	-1
Not the greatest band but I enjoy the first two albums because there is a mix of melody and screaming . `` Wasteland '' has way too much screaming which gets tired and annoying , not too mention that we lose out on hearing a beautiful voice . A better balance is needed .	-1
The entire album is very predictable , both lyrically and musically . Where did the soul go ? His political views , which layered his lyrics of old are all but gone . The spacing and arrangements that made his voice and sound so textured are no longer there . What happened to his baritone ? His albums are starting to sound a lot alike and too polished . Not his best effort.I 'm listening to John Legend & The Roots new album which is layered in old soul and funky grooves and then I listen to this and I 'm disappointed . Like most of Franti 's songs , they will sound better live.Strip it down and get back to basics , but then again when you go mainstream that 's hard to do . He 's gaining a lot of new fans , but the old ones will be let down ...	-1
I loved his first CD and was very excited to order this new cd based on all the great consumer reviews . To my disappointment , this album was awful . All the songs sound exactly the same and all the stories are slight variations of the other songs . Beside the `` Come Back Song '' do n't waste your money .	-1
Summer 2010 was filled with many forgettable disappointments , and Predators was not the exception to that sad rule . Alan Silvestri was busy providing a bland score to the utterly forgettable A-Team movie and so left John Debney the chore of scoring Predators.If only they switched.The Predator is really Silvestri 's baby , and his intricate , nuanced scores for the first two movies really do not get the credit that they deserve . Debney is not a bad composer , but has absolutely no clue how to handle this movie , choosing to copy-and-paste wholesale from Silvestri 's work while filling in the blanks with trashy , 90s-era teen slasher flick dissonant filler . It 's an absolutely shameful effort . Imagine Justin Beiber taking the lyrics and melodies of Frank Sinatra and trying to make his own material out of it by adding something `` new '' here and there as if that is enough to disguise the fact that it is something we 've all heard before.Not quite as bad as Marco Beltrami 's bastardization of the Die Hard scores after the death of Michael Kamen , but a lazy , half-assed effort and an annoying reminder of what could have been .	-1
First off , Ray Lomantange has an awesome voice - - pure talent . That is his major strength . The songwriting here is very MOR - - most of it recalls 70 's era singer/songwriters like Joni Mitchell . Original it is not . It 's all been done before ( and much better ) so why do it again ? `` Trouble '' remains his best album - it is outstanding . Each subsequent release has been less than satisfying . This album is not bad - - but after you listen to it you really do n't feel like you 've actually heard anything special . The band sounds great and Ray 's vocals are great - - help is needed in the songwriting department .	-1
You know , this was once one of the best alt rock acts prior to alt rock breaking out . They had the enthusiasm of Bon Jovi , and the attitude of the Replacements . It is my view that they peaked with Superstar Car Wash , which is a GREAT American rock album . Following the success of the song `` Name '' , it would appear that they realized hey , we can make more money singing softer . Well sure , they followed that hit with the album Dizzy up the girl and yes , their new formula worked and there are a bunch of great songs on there . Then they released the depressing Gutterflower . Gone was the carefree youth and exuberance of Hold me up and Jed . I had almost given up on them entirely when they released Let love in , which is a solid cohesive and well written/performed/produced effort , so I was very excited to see what they would do next . I read on their website that they were writing the new album together and I had the fanciful notion that they would return to Superstar car wash style flavor . Instead we get this boring piece of mediocre soft rock . I just hope that they have made enough money singing ballads that they say to heck with it , lets jam again !	-1
After an eight year hiatus , Dru Hill returns with their first album in eight and the first album with new member Tao . When I first heard Dru Hill was re reuniting , excitement came into as play as Dru Hill was one of my favorite groups from my high school days , however on their newest CD , the group fails to capture the glory days form their first two albums . First & foremost the group uses the voice coder on every single song which hurts the disc more than it helps . All four members of the group have a natural singing ability and instead of showing off their natural vocal talent the groups tries to keep up with current trends . The first part of the album is filled with secondary Will I Am styled beats that sounded better suited for Justin Bieber or Bruno Mars instead of a group like Dru Hill . The album does n't really pick up any steam until track 9 , State Of Emergency followed by four more slow cuts which are the only real album highlights . Sisqo & Jazz both have a chance to shine on Back To The Future & Love MD , but as whole this is the worst album in Dru Hill 's catalog . The CD ends with a filler track where the group covers Tears For Fears Everybody Wants To Rule The World , followed by 3 snippets from Nokio 's solo project which shows he needs to keep his day job . If Dru Hill wanted to come back and take the industry by storm they could have , as their is n't one R & B group who is prevalent in R & B today , instead the group digs their career into a deeper obscurity with this disc .	-1
Mediocre voice . But , if you like country-pop with an attempt at some humor , this might be for you . Not to be considered a classic .	-1
I really did n't like this cd . Chirping birds did not help me sleep . Thought it would be more forest sounds	-1
His first single , Cooler than Me , is actually a very interesting and complex dance pop song ( at least when it came out a year or so ago ) , but the rest of the album really seems to fall completely flat . Which really surprised me , Please Dont Go has an interesting music video , but the song is mediocre . I 'm usually not too harsh when it comes to music , but I have to point out when an albums not worth buying . I was expecting to be surprised but wound up disappointed . I thought Synthesizer was really lathargic , Cheated was n't really that special , and I was n't a fan of Save Your GoodBye . There 's better pop music that 's similiar to this Esmee Denters AND Taio Cury ( there not very well known ) . Watching him in an interview , he seems extremely smart , and I 'm sure he just wanted to be smart and market himself towards a teen audience . I think he 'll have better releases over the next few years .	-1
tip was released married tiny stayed out recorded a album and went back to prison he loves those boygirls in there that 's why he keeps doing drugs and going baXCK AND NOW we know why tiny 's lips are so big she 's smoking that meth pipe . see ya next year tip wonder will he crossdress now .	-1
This is terrible ... the 'New Work ' of an old man with nothing new to say and just going thru the motions for money . No shame , but that 's just the way it is . I was and always will be fan of his earlier music as well as recognizing him as one of the great influences on 20th century music , certainly a great influence on how I approach music . But this crap . We all get old , eh ?	-1
this is another example of country music over saturating the market with greatest hits packages year after year . enough is enough i refuse to keep buying these repackages of the same songs over and over just to get one or twon `` new songs '' time to go to itunes and stop buying this junk . same review for Tim McGraw and alan jackson # 1s coming out soon	-1
I bought this based on one song I love by the Hoppers : Yahweh . It is the only song on this CD I like . They do sing very well , but not at the quality level I expected . They just do n't hold a candle to what music I can get from Nashville and New York . What a huge disappointment !	-1
Imagine a 5-year-old waking up on Christmas morning to nothing . That 's how I feel about this latest Ben Folds effort - a release that I was really looking forward to . The sound is erratic and mind numbing while the lyrics come off sounding like they were made up as he went along . Fail .	-1
But then does n't everybody know by now that these recordings are made for no one but Bocelli fans ? Bocelli fans do n't care what Domingo or Corelli or Gedda did with this music . They only know that they love their man and that 's why they want to hear him sing . When Andrea focuses on a song or aria he can sound pretty good . It 's just everything else that finds him straining or sounding under rehearsed . People who enjoy Bocelli will enjoy this recording . People who are looking for a good recording of Carmen should pass on this one because this is not good compared to about a dozen other recordings ( none of which would interest a Bocelli fan in the least ) . Even Terfel sounds weak in a role that would seem perfect for his voice .	-1
are you kidding me ! oh heeeeeeell nooo ! ciara is a most talented singer dont get me wrong , but my goodness she must didnt have much time to put it together because the hooks and titles are crazy stupid and lame and she sing like she just want a check out of it , com'on cc you have gots to come better than that ! she had a couple of ok tracks but not repeat worthys or ipod destination worth it bottom line cc go back in that studio fire your producers get your money back and have luda produce your album next time because this one tanked and stanked big time ! im so dissapointed and i love my cc !	-1
Do n't but this . Come on . Do yourself a favor and get Age of Winters please . Its a masterpiece and this album is ... well its the Never Say Die ! ! for the Sword . Even Gods of the Earth is awesome , Warp Riders ... .no . I want to give it one star but its not THAT bad I suppose . Point is , its not horrible but it is their worst album so far .	-1

Mr. Sanata ( aka Santana ) , has finally gotten on my nerves.I hope you read this you old fool ! They used to call you guitar god , now you 're just a pauper for the studio machinery.Para boludo !	-1
My main complaint is that the songs on this album were recorded too hot . As in all the controls set on '11 ' , no dynamic range , too much bass ( Although there was a time that such a complaint would not have come from me ) , harsh glaring highs that get uncomfortable for me to listen to ... Unless I turn it down , and there 's no fun in that.I did n't read all these reviews , but I gathered two main points from the negative ones ... 1- Song selection -- is n't this always an issue with compilations of previously released songs ? Overall , I enjoyed the choices made , but would 've made 2 or 3 changes.2- Not up to Sanatana 's standards -- I 've a little trouble with that one . Starting from ALL the way back , I always thought he played a pretty guitar ( speaking as a music fan , I 'm not a musician ) but was never crazy about his songs . I liked his latin flavored instrumentals ( 'Festival ' , on vinyl , is the only Santana I ever bought ) the best.I stumbled across a couple John Lee Hooker songs that had Santana playing on them . Tell you what ... 'The Healer ' and `` Chill Out ' are two great tunes if you 're interested in JLH with a latin flavor . I wish there were many CDs with these two guys together.Anyway , the JLH songs got me to investgating Santana a little , which brought me here . I guess I have to agree ... the guitar is n't sweet , or alive , like you 'd expect from CS.So , song selection I 'm basically ok with + Borderline unlistenable recording + lifeless playing = 2 stars .	-1
This is a mistake from start to finish . A concept that is obviously ONLY about money , and I 'm a little surprised Santana allowed himself to be used here since he 's already got plenty of it.The guitar obsessed will also be disappointed cause Santana simply does n't do the Jimmy Page or hard Rock thing that great . He 's a spiritual player in the Coltrane vein. [ ... ]	-1
Quite disappointing in selection of tracks , performers and performances . A CD I definiitely could have done without . What we need is Carlos himself playing the greatest guitar classics , not delegating them out to others .	-1
Some bad choices for songs . Ca n't stand many of the guests . Combine bad guests with some bad songs you get a poor CD . Santana 's guitar is fine but not enough to bring this to mediocre.I kind of like the end of While My Guitar Gentley Weeps and I guess my favorite would be Under The Bridge done with the original singer from The Red Hot Chili Peppers . Other than that pretty much unlistenable.Wasted a nice car ride on a beautiful autumn day in Connecticut . Save your money .	-1
Boy , how I hate to have anything negative to say about the work of Carlos Santana , but I just ca n't give Guitar Heaven : The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time a passing grade . I already own most of the tracks in this collection performed by the original artists , so why would I want to purchase a collection of covers ? Good question , but I did , so I do n't have a good answer.I have to agree with what some others have had to say . While the music is acceptable , the individual tracks do lack the passion most of these hits had when first recorded . Understand that the music is okay , but each of these songs is a classic in their own right and were played nearly perfectly in their original iterations . Simply put , there is a lack of intensity in some of these performances and that 's stunning given the names on the cd.Perhaps I 'm just a purist and hard to please and one day twenty years from now this collection will be regarded as a classic . Anything 's possible . I 've always said that I grew up during a time when we had the best music in the world . From 1964 ( maybe earlier ) all the way into the ` 90 's , American and British Rock-n-Roll and Blues set the pace . At the risk of alienating many , pop music is a wasteland now . Then , of course , I 'm showing my age.Peace to all and rock on .	-1
Two stars for Carlos 's musicianship . Otherwise , terrible . As the other reviewers have suggested , this represents the worst in the current music business -- -hype anything just to make a buck . Only a few of these songs are guitar classics , and Carlos 's version does n't make anyone want to forget the originals . Every town has at least 20 bands that can cover these songs , and with the exception of his gift for playing guitar , just as well as the versions on this recording . For a musician of his stature to stoop to this at this point in his career is simply embarassing .	-1
I had made up my mind to purchase this cd when I heard about the concept , and bought it despite the negative reviews ( one out of four stars in USAToday ) . It 's not terrible , but the songs do n't improve on the originals and do n't bring any Santana flavor . There are only a couple of cuts that you can listen to and immediately identify Santana 's guitar . He sounds like a session musician on his own disc . While My Guitar Gently Weeps is good , and the album ends with a nice 1-2 punch of Little Wing and I Ai n't Superstitious , but that 's it for the highlights . I wonder how much input , if any , Carlos had on song selection . This project sounds like a money grab or a fulfillment of a contractual obligation . When I listen to Nas on Back in Black , I can only wonder how much better a choice Run-DMC 's Rock Box would have been , with Carlos playing Eddie Martinez ' ferocious guitar lines . Shoot , there are even better cover versions out there of some songs - Living Colour 's version of Sunshine of Your Love from the True Lies soundtrack smokes this one . I really did n't think Carlos Santana had this album in him ... and I DO N'T mean that in a good way !	-1
Definately made for the promotion department , not for music lovers . A piano playing the guitar rift on `` While My Guitar Gently Weeps '' ? They are an experienced band that can cover lots of songs , but the band at your local watering-hole can probably do about as good as the week tracks on this CD . Carlos rarely seemed inspired and mostly left his MoJo at home . I guess Clapton is God .	-1
I have always like Megadeth and have all their records and think Mustaine is one of the greatest guitarist of his time PERIOD . Rust in Peace is my favorite record from Megadeth and looked forward to hearing this once it was released . I purchased it on Blu-ray and CD and I must day it is not that good . So I will make a easy to read list.The GoodSongs kick ass.Dave 's guitar tone is great sounding.Drums and bass are good too.The BadThe vocals are overdubbed afterwards because Dave 's voice was completely blown out , do n't believe me look at raw footage taken by fans at the actual show on youtube . Now I really do not care that the vocals were re-recorded but the overdubbed ones are not that great and are out of time on Rust in Peace , its really bad.Chris B. guitar track is way too low in the mix.Chris B head bangs swinging his head left right left right and looks lame , yeah it really bothers me.So if you are a hardcore Megadeth fan , yes its worth having , but if you are not , do not bother .	-1
Remember that terrible awful duet , `` wedding day '' on his awesome previous album ? ? ? That is this album.. slow , sappy , boring-we 've heard the beats , the same background singer sounds ( which he does n't need ) , same lyrics . Yawn* ... come on ! There are 2 good songs , which are unique and layered with awesome instruments . `` weight of my mistakes '' and `` big time '' .I 've loved all Seals albums ; this is such a huge disappointment.. DO OVER	-1
I did n't have the case opened more than ten seconds before the satanic images jumped out , The lyrics are all about trashing G-d and promoting evil . The lyrics themselves , like much of Wylde 's writing have all the depth of the kiddie pool at a Holiday Inn . The guitar work , while impressive as only Zak can play , is still just the same re-hashed scales and licks from the previous BLS albums . BTW Zak , the harmonic squalling is getting really F'n old ! Very disappointing Zak . You really should grow up and evolve your music without having to pander to the `` Satan Rocks ! '' crowd , who would pee their pants if they ever met a real demon . The finest irony is in the credits where Zak thanks G-d first ! This album just sucks like a Hoover on steroids . I actually tossed it in the trash .	-1
After the last black Label society cd , I trhought being fired by Ozzy this would be Zacks best.Unfortunately this is the worst cd BLS has ever put out.I rushed to buy it , now i will be rushing to sell it.stay away from this one .	-1
I said it in my review for Jupiter 's Darling . The Wilson sisters are too old and need to retire ! Or at least they should n't put any new music out there . Tour with the classics is fine , but why putting us through this boring CD ? Besides Ann 's voice is not what used to be ... it sounds so strained ! This music does n't have any of the magic or power Heart 's music used to have.Sorry .	-1
I rented this from my local library after completely giving up on Heart after the Brigade debacle but after listening to old Heart they dragged me back in.. the main problem with this disc is that it has nothing about it that stands out . It 's about as mundane and lifeless as I 've ever heard . WTF is catchy , Wheels is ok , but does Ann and Nancy actually listen to what they record ? This is as by the numbers and ineffectual as it comes . If it was n't Heart it would be one star .	-1
Disturbed has made the same album four times in a row . No originality . Everything sounds the same . Why are people giving this CD more stars ? If you liked the previous three cd 's , you 'll like this one I suppose ... same music , slightly different lyrics . I think it sucks !	-1
The first Disturbed album I ever bought was believe . After purchasing that album many years ago , I thought Disturbed were going to be one of the bands to watch out for over the years . I was pleased that someone had come onto the hard rock scene who had talent , and knew their craft well.. But sadly , over the years , it seemed Disturbed got weaker and weaker with each new release . They seemed to be one of those bands who threw memorable melodies and skilled playing out the window.. They replaced solid song writing with harder edged music filled with nothing but speedy riffs and power chords . I held hope for this album when I heard a band member say that the new disc was going to be a bit more musically complex than some of their other efforts . But the truth is , all disturbed did here was slow down some of the zippy playing and added a hint of melody to the music . In short , this album is a watered down version of their last CD , ( which the title escapes me because I was so disappointed in the release . ) In closing , all I can say is that Disturbed was not the musical messiah of modern heavy metal that I thought they would be . They have show us that they have talent , but refuse to let it shine as they continue to release new material . As the years go by , this band seems to be sinking into the obscurity of a zillion other groups that rely on speed rather than ability and originality .	-1
I am astounded at how popular and commercially successful Disturbed is . I like their first two albums , but their last three ( Including this one ) are virtually INTERCHANGEABLE . Their sound NEVER changes ! It 's a shame that more challenging , talented , thought-provoking , and progressive metal bands ( Iced Earth , Opeth , Nevermore , etc ) remain somewhat underground and on the fringes of the mainstream while the likes of Disturbed consistently have # 1 albums and tour big sheds.Kiss ' `` Asylum '' from 1985 is also a lot better than this !	-1
Let me start by saying , I am very sad to write this review . Because if there has been a bigger fan of Elton John 's than me , I do n't know who it is . Listening to his piano-playing taught me how to play piano , and studying his songwriting taught me how to be a professional jingle writer . I have owned many of his albums on vinyl , cassette , CD , and remastered CD -- including so-called duds like `` A Single Man '' ( which I cherish for `` Shine On Through '' and `` Georgia '' ) . I can quote lyrics from all the album cuts from any album he made through the late '80s , and enjoyed many of his hits after that as well . I thought `` Songs From The West Coast '' was brilliant and long overdue , and `` Peachtree Road '' -- especially the version with cuts from `` Billy Elliot '' -- quite a decent effort . I even thought `` The Captain And The Kid '' had some moments -- not many , but a few -- with `` The Bridge '' being the high point for me.This album , this Elton John , is a pale and sadly pathetic imitation of himself.Now he 's reusing chord progressions and melodic 'hooks ' from his second-rate songs of the last five years . His torch-singer vocals are so stylized and forced they 're cloying to listen to . Perhaps eeriest of all , Taupin 's lyrics , usually poetic and thought-provoking , are banal at best , and the production seems not to notice.Let me give you an example you can hear for yourself , before you spent the $ 12.99 or the $ 7.99 for mp3s : a simple vocal doubling test . Off the top of my head , here are some EJ songs which use vocal overdubs to great effect : in `` Someone Saved My Life Tonight , '' Elton sings , `` And it 's one more beer and I do n't hear you '' and he overdubs himself on `` anymore . '' Brilliant , well-placed , moving and affecting . In `` Border Song , '' the doubling ( a choir effect ) is on the lyric `` holy moses , '' and you can hear the passion from the storyteller 's point of view . In `` Ticking , '' the doubling is on `` throw out your gun , walk out slow , '' and it makes sense because it 's the policemen talking to the gunman.Now click on track # 8 's sample.The overdub harmony is on the lyrics `` cayenne pepper '' in the line `` ... sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl . `` Please , if you do n't believe me , listen for yourself . If you 're moved , touched , or inspired by the accenting of the phrase `` cayenne pepper , '' buy this album immediately . But if you are n't , really take an honest look here . To paraphrase the first track off the aforementioned `` Songs From The West Coast , '' the emperor -- and EJ is truly an emperor of great music -- has no clothes . And unfortunately , I ca n't lie about it , or deny it , anymore . Ever since `` West Coast , '' each succeeding album has had successively less originality , less passion , less ... Elton-ness . Time used to be when almost every track came from a place of genius . This train do n't stop there anymore.Why ? I do n't know . I have no idea what happened to my musical hero . The only reasonable explanation is either age , or disconnection from the creative wellspring which got him to where he is ( whatever that might be ) . I believed that with `` West Coast '' Mr. John had decided to make great albums again , and I was very excited for the future . But looking back , I now think that might have been one last gasp at greatness . And he had what seemed an unlimited supply of greatness , so it 's a shocking thought to have . But based on the evidence -- the work since -- it seems likely he dug down deep for genius one last time ... and that 's all he had left in him.Believe me , it pains me to write this.Save your money . Write me and I will send you a LONG list of Elton John albums you should buy instead of this one . Have no doubt that I am an Elton John fan : truth is , the word 'fan ' does n't describe the deep effect the man and his work has had on my life . But I am a realistic human being . Many of his albums are among the best pop/rock recordings ever made . But based on this release , his new songs are no longer worthy of purchase.P.S . I 'm an admirer of Mr. Russell , particularly older greats like `` Manhattan Island Serenade , '' Lady Blue '' and of course `` A Song For You . '' Russell has managed to keep his edge , and apparently his connection to his source , so he comes off much better than Mr. John on this album , but it 's not nearly enough to make this album worthwhile in this man 's opinion .	-1
As a huge Paula Cole fan , I buy everything she releases . The last few releases have been highly disappointing in my opinion . The songwriting and delivery has become muddy . Paula , like Tori Amos , peaked early , delivering releases that were clearly visceral and urgent . Since those early releases Paula has devolved in what I consider bland confessional songs that lack something for me as a listener . Sometimes it appears Paula puts her journals to music . Is there such a thing as too literal ? Well sometimes her songs are . Yes , I like autobiographical music , but something in Paula 's later work just does n't click for me-its maudlin and depressive and not in a particularly poetic way . I am glad others continue to enjoy her later work , but clearly me and a lot of other fans have become disinterested . I love Paula , but I ca n't get into her recent releases . She seems pretty unhappy and I guess I 'm missing all the redemption she talks about in her music . Just not feeling it .	-1
EXCEPT FOR & # 34 ; LITTLE GETTO BOY & # 34 ; I 'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE THIS ALBUM OUT . LEGENT SOUNDS SO MUCH DIFFERENT ON THIS ALBUM	-1
I was not impressed with this collection of songs.If this was intended to be more of some political statement then there are better means of getting the message out.Music-wise , I felt these songs were uninspired , arrangements monotonous , bridges not powerful enough.This is not John Legend I was hoping to hear.Music skills , per se , are indeed exemplary - the band is tight and well put together .	-1
This album was a disappointment on two fronts -- the song selection and the arrangements . When I looked at the songs peformed I was a bit puzzled ; but , since I 've heard so much about The Roots and John Legend , I thought the arrangements would bring out something special . While Mr. Legend has his own reasons for picking the songs he did , I could n't help thinking of better substitutes for the songs included here as I listened through the album . What about something from Marvin Gaye 's `` What 's Happening '' like `` Flying High in the Friendly Sky '' ? How about a Curtis Mayfield tune like `` Freddie 's Dead '' or `` Thin Line '' ? And , as far as political messages go , a Gil Scott-Heron song like `` Gun '' or `` Pieces of a Man '' would have been nice . Since the band on this album is supposed to be top-notch , why not include a Mingus song or let the band stretch out and include an instrumental like Coltrane 's `` Alabama '' or an Art Blakey burner like `` Free for All '' or `` Freedom Rider . '' Of course , there are so many great Soul and R & B tunes from the era covered , it 's hard to pick just a handful to record but I think William Parker 's tribute to Curtis Mayfield `` Inside the Songs of Curtis Mayfield '' is the real deal that Mr. Legend may have been striving for .	-1
I have been a fan of of Montreal for eight years . Finding them was one of the most exciting musical finds in my life . I own all of their albums . I like some of them more than others . But I will not be buying this new album . It is bland , horrible , and forced . It sounds like aweak uncle rock secretary booty shaking white man 's poor man 's P Funk . It is awful.I was not a fan of their middle period . ( The Bedside Drama : A Petite Tragedy-Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies ) It was ok , but too wordy . It was clever , but gave me a headache . Could n't listen to it for too long . I loved Cherry Peel and The Early 4 track recordings.Satanic Panic is their best album and Sunlandic Twins had some strong songs on it , but was weaker . When I first heard Hissing Fauna , I hated it . It was not the of Montreal I was used to . My wife and I went to see them in concert on this tour . ( We had seen them many times before and had always enjoyed them . ) She began to cry during the show and we left . She could n't take looking at Kevin . He upset her . He disgusted her . She felt sorry for his soul.That album finally grew on me . ( Not my wife though . ) Skeletal Lamping was weak , but there were moments of sweetness on it . I was hoping that False Priest would show him moving in another direction.It does n't . It 's one of the most disappointing albums I 've ever heard . It 's even hard for me to go back and listen to the other albums that I loved . Kevin makes me feel ill now . I keep picturing that dude in Silence of the Lambs dancing in his basement . That 's what Kevin is in my mind . I do not want to be part of his world.But more importantly ... The music is just bland.False Priest.Kevin , you are the False Priest.For those of you just discovering of Montreal try Cherry Peel , Early Four Track Recordings , The Bird Who Continues to Eat , and Satanic Panic.False Priest does not represent this band that was once great .	-1
I was hoping for something better than this after hearing `` Impossible '' but this album fell short of my expectations . I was not a fan of her first album either but I thought after much time has passed that she would come out with a better second effort and this one sounds like the first . I could not even listen to the whole album in one sitting because it was painfully bad . I think she has a nice voice but this genre may not be for her . I will not listen to any more of this artists music unfortunately .	-1
Shontelle has barely any talent at all . her only good song is `` impossible '' i wouldnt give any of her future work a listen	-1
This album is so cheesy and bland , I now use as a coaster . VaShawn 's vocals were average , and he does not have any innovative chops . Daniel Weatherspoon 's production is still as drab as it has been for years . The whole point of a live album is to capture energy and ingenuity that live adrenaline brings . The arrangements sound sloppy and thrown together . If this is reminiscient of the `` birthplace of Gospel music '' , Triumphant '' should have been aborted .	-1
Poor Bilal . If only the rest of us could speak his language so we could understand his music better . Alas , we live here on earth while he orbits the universe developing his own idea of what music is.Is it too much to ask for a track like `` Soul Sista '' or `` Fast Lane '' ? I suppose so because they are n't any tracks like that on this album . Sometimes I wonder if artists get so caught up in there own world that they forget to throw a bone to their fans who may not understand the ideas and philosophy 's they are trying to convey . Still you must give credit where credit is due and Bilal 's vocals are brilliant if not displaced .	-1
This disc is nothing like Resurrection or Crucible . This disc has not 1 stand out track or anything remotely close to being as creative or heavy as anything Rob recorded with Fight or Halford . His Christmas disc was horrendous and now this . C'Mon Rob ... stay heavy ! When we shell out 15 bucks for this junk , we have every right to criticize or praise it as we see or hear it . Not everyone will agree with all reviews but I think someone who has listened to metal for 30 years is quite capable of reviewing it for what it 's worth .	-1
i own the very expensive japan release of this cd . was pleased to see it finally get released in the uk went straight out to purchase was worth the price for the remastering alone . so i thought . got it home it sounds awful compared to the japan release . if you can afford to buy the japan release then do so ... ... was very dissapointed . the album gets 5 stars but this release just 1 star and thats being kind .	-1
I ca n't say that I 'm surprised that Stone Sour would make such a soft album , but it 's still just as disappointing . How many metal bands do you know that start out somewhat soft and then get heavier ? I can name quite a few that go the other direction , and I can now add Stone Sour to that list , too . I think it 's safe to say that the songs in Stone Sour 's previous albums were about half heavier , half lighter , and then a couple acoustic songs that ca n't even be classified as metal.A majority of the songs on this album are those wimpy acoustic ones , with a few lighter songs , and only a couple heavier songs ; however , this album 's heaviest song , nylon 6/6 , is the only one that I actually like . The other heavier songs start out alright , but they both ( that 's right , the whole two others ) kept getting wimpier as they progressed , and the lyrics were n't really interesting me . Although nylon 6/6 is somewhat guilty of the same , it 's still metal enough for me.Slipknot has been pretty heavy from the start , and I hope they stay that way . You hear me , Corey Taylor ? ! Do n't do this to Slipknot ! DO N'T DO IT !	-1
Bought it , lied and returned it in exchange for the new Cradle Of Filth ( Which is a 4 out of 4 stars ) . Stone Sour has become the Backstreet Boys of the metal community . I enjoyed the first CD but since then they are really focused on getting radio play , which is fine but it distanced me bit . I also think that Slipknot is going down the same path . I dont know , not much here .	-1
I give the band all the credit in the world for making the album they wanted to make . But to my ears , it came out sounding cheesy and soft . Really loved the first Stone Sour album , and the second one grew on me , but the ballads on this one are banal and the lyrics sound like they are torn from an 80s power ballad . Sad display .	-1
I am a long time fan of Helmet . I love their music . When they got back together I was thrilled . I loveSize Mattersand I loveMonochrome , so when I saw they had a new album I bought it on the faith that it was Helmet and I could n't go wrong . BOY WAS I WRONG ! ! ! ! ! This album is horrible . I can not listen to a whole song on the album . I last about a minute before I fast forward to next song . I have tried to listen to it multiple times . It is so bad that I am upset that I spent money on it . I will be taking it out of my Helmet playlist . I saw another review talk about the live tracks and that is not a reason to buy this album . If you want to enjoy a live show , go see them and have your own experience . As a summary , SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DO N'T BUY THIS ALBUM . Buy something else you had your eye on .	-1
This album is an abomination . Do n't give me this garbage how it 's a different direction or the other side of Linkin Park . They put this out hoping it would ride on their name alone . They are better than this . The only reason I gave this two stars is because I respect creativity . I will say that they 've done more than I ever could but it still sucks .	-1
I am just speechless at whatever this thing is . Its extremely hard to describe it in words but the first thing that comes to mind is Total and absolute failure or something along those lines . Its really painful to listen to this album , not because the music is horrible , but its the soundtrack of a band trying to be something its not . This band is INCAPABLE of writing this type of music . I 'm sorry but this is about as bad as it gets , and its SOOO FAKE . This is fake . I ca n't stand fake people and really ca n't stand FAKE music . If you look up pretentious in the dictionary there is a picture of this album . The great albums of history like the Dark Sides and White albums and what ever else were successful due to the artists playing from their heart and people identified with this and connected with the music . The great artists were n't `` trying to construct the greatest album ever '' and that is what A thousand Suns sounds like . Its like they planned out an album that they could point to and say `` Look at how talented we are '' , like they went down a check list and fabricated an album . Listening to this album , I really felt embarrassed for them to make such fools of themselves . It really is rare to get something this bad and In the end I am just speechless.Linkin Park , in their current form , are a disgrace to the species .	-1
These songs are horrible in respect to Rock . These are more like 80 's Pop and Rap . The Catalyst sounds like U2 and one of those J-Pop . Where is the bass and the guitar ? and anger and sadness ? I want more New Divide , Pushing Me Away , and What I Have Done.This CD makes Justin BieberMy World 2.0a better CD !	-1
4 years after releasing the mediocre , at best , MtM , Linkin Park releases `` A Thousand Suns '' . I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish here . This is a complete schizophrenic , unfocused record that does n't seem to know where it 's going , where it 's been or how to get there . This record is all over the place and makes no sense . This band really needs to take a step back and find their roots , because this experimentation stuff is n't working . I give it 2 stars because there are 2 or 3 decent tracks , but nothing at all that wows me . I would steer clear of A Thousand Suns .	-1
First and foremost , let me declare myself a fairly big fan of Linkin Park . After seeing them live in 2007 , and picking up all of their other albums , I was eagerly anticipating the launch of A Thousand Suns . I waited awhile to pick it up , and after hearing all of the negative reviews , I decided to pick it up to see for myself . What you get here from LP , is a good , heartfelt effort , but one that ultimately leaves long time fans of their music , feeling angry and disappointed . If you want the gist of what my conclusion is , Do n't buy this album unless you want to experience how bad it is for yourself . Now , allow me to go a little more in depth.ATS opens up with , `` The Requiem '' , which is an alright instrumental intro into the album . The track however , is two minutes long , and loses your attention quickly . Hybrid Theory opened up with the fast paced `` Papercut '' . Meteora opened up with the 13 second long , `` Forward '' that gave way to the hit , `` Do n't Stay . '' Minutes to Midnight began with `` Wake '' , and following in those footsteps , ATS begins with an instrumental that is too long , and leaves you wishing the next track would hurry up . That next track is , `` The Radiance '' , which is a vocal track that serves as filler in an attempt to give you that `` epic '' feeling going into the actual music that we have now waited almost 3 minutes for through the first two tracks . This vocal track is n't necessary , ready for the music to actually begin ? Sigh . Here we go . `` Burning in the Skies '' is our first taste of actual LP music in the album . What we get here , feels like something off of Minutes to Midnight . As people have said , this album is ultimately an extension of MTM , but the third track was passable the first time for me . After a few listens , I began to grow sick of hearing Chester whine , and feel bad for himself . As much as I love his voice usually , his whiny tone , coupled with the uninspired BG music , made me want to scream . I began to skip this song after my first listen through . Next ? Who would have thought we would have another vocal track ? If you can even call `` Empty Spaces '' a vocal track . What you get with `` track '' 4 , is a clone of Metallica 's beginning of `` One . '' Some military inspired track that features soldiers yelling and guns firing . If you do n't mind listening to 18 seconds of filler , listen to this , and get ready to laugh . On to track five . `` When They Come for Me '' literally envoked laughter on my end the first time I listened to it . This song ultimately serves as an attempt from LP to try to get back to their hard rock roots . The end result however , ends up being a laughable fusion of Mike rapping , and strange background music . The song opens up with some strange sounds , and an annoying ticking noise . The lyrics here are so terribly elementary , that it is a little funny . It almost feels like a Weird Al cover of a LP song . `` I am not a robot , I am not a monkey , I will not dance even if the beat 's funky , opposite of lazy , far from a punk , ya 'll better start talking , start tryna catch up , motha ****** . '' Is an example of an attempt to sound hardcore here in this song . What ends up happening , is Mike sounding like a disgruntled gang member that got kicked out of his clan because he was caught watching Dora the Explorer alone one day . Chester had his chance to play fool earlier , now it 's Mike 's turn . This song falls flat on it 's face , and features nothing audibly pleasing . Ready for some `` Robot Boy ? '' Me neither . `` Robot Boy '' is probably the sadest song on ATS . No no , not sad in the sense that it envokes emotion or tears . Sad in the sense that you 'll be thinking , `` Why did I pay for this ? '' `` What happened to LP ? '' Robot boy is the most uninspired song on the album , and features Chester whining again . With a piano track that sounds like something from Elton John 's greatest hits , Chester begins to croon on about how there 's no one to give love to , I cringed when I first heard this song . A radio friendly ballad that almost crosses into the range of R & B ; , not for me . Fans of Ne-Yo may eat this song up , but it 's far too long for it 's own good at 4:28 , and deserves to be skipped over . Hey , does n't it feel like time for another sweet vocal track ? I think so . `` Jornada Del Muetro '' is another minute plus of useless filler . I think I heard somewhere that it 's the words from the first track in Spanish . Either way , I el skippo this one every time since my first listen . `` Waiting for the End '' was the first song that I truly enjoyed on this album . Pretty sad , that on track eight of fifteen , you finally find a listenable song . `` Waiting for the End '' is radio friendly , but finds a way to sound good since it correctly blends Chester and Mike together for the first time on the album . The music is decent , and the lyrics finally do n't sound like they were written in grade school . This got lots of radio time before the album 's release , so many are familiar with this one . Give it a listen , if you 're an I-tunes user , buy this one . It could pass for an unreleased song off MTM.Now on to what is my personal favorite song on the album . `` Blackout '' shows that LP is still capable of making good tunes- That they have n't completely lost themselves . This song features interesting musical work , followed by Chester coming in with `` Im stuck in this bed you 've made.. '' to be followed by him screaming , for the first time on the album . LP tries something new for the first time on the album here as well . At about 2 minutes in , prepare yourself for a cool little breakdown . The guitar is altered , to be followed by Chester 's voice being manipulated in what sounds very cool . This part of the song had me moving my head for the first time of the album , as I tapped along to the the cool sounds . Chester sings again , and the song comes to a close . This tune is good too , pick it up if you buy online . `` Wretches and Kings '' comes next . The song opens up with a clip of Mario Savio 's famous rant in the 1960 's about passively taking part in the operation of the machine . This song is `` meh . '' Inserting Mario 's quotes actually utilizes sound clips in a way that makes sense for the first time on ATS . It 's an alright song , you may wish to buy it seperately . It has a nice , fun feel at times , I declare this song passable for the third straight good track . `` Wisdom , Justice , and Love '' is a vocal track , of a quote from Martin Luther King Jr. His voice is warped as the track fades out . As great of a man as MLK was , the track seems to have no place , or purpose . Listen to it once , and skip it every listen after- it 's historically important filler.Now that they 've guilt tripped me with a quote from the great MLK , trying to make me feel bad about hating the rest of the album , I will continue . `` Iridescent '' is nothing new . More radio friendly garbage from Chester , with softly played guitar , Chester playing his new role of , `` Poor pitiful me , stop the violence and down with the hate , do you like my self loathing and whiny auto tuned vocal tracks ? '' Listen to `` Iridescent '' once , and never come back.With a few tracks remaining in the album , we get another vocal track to ease us into the final couple of songs . Hooray . We get another altered version of some of the lyrics we 've already heard . Out of all the vocal tracks on the album so far , this one may be the most useless yet . More filler , that simply features another part of the album , slowed down by about 75 percent . This garbage goes on for nearly 1:30 , which is way too long for something that could have been put into the front end of another song . Do n't even bother listening to this once , unless you 're trying to kill time . Skip it , and prepare for `` The Catalyst '' , which you 've probably already heard . `` The Catalyst '' was one of the bigger songs leading up to the album 's release . After gaining fame on Youtube , the song is placed at the very back end of the album at track 14 . Not what I would have done if I were producing it . Personally , I do n't see the thrill in this song . While it is better than the musical compost found on the beginning of the album , it 's nothing you have n't heard before . This tune sounds more like something that would be on in a night club in the center of your nearest big city . Alcohol influenced youths would probably get up and dance to this one in a nightclub , which is not what LP is supposed to be known for . The agony goes on for over five minutes . Some like this track , but I am not one . While it 's passable , and not nearly as bad as say , `` Robot Boy '' , I have come to hate it after my first full listen through.Alright , the final song . Will it be epic ? The song we 've been waiting for ? Nope . Just , `` The Messenger '' . Chester steals the show again , and bombs it to close out the album . Chester continues to whine , and soak your ears in self loathing . By this point , if you were n't wearing make-up and tight jeans , with an attitude that everyone is out to get you , you are now . Chester 's attempt to convert you into an emotional wreck that thinks your life is a big conspiracy , ends with this.. erm.. accoustic ? .. track.. `` Love leaves us blind . '' `` Love keeps us kind '' No , those are not quotes from Kelly Clarkson , they are lines from this song . Close the book on the album with a bitter taste in your mouth , and anger in your ears.While I ca n't justify giving this album 1 star , I will reluctanly give it 2 . The album saves itself from ultimate failure with a few good songs . `` Blackout '' , `` Waiting for the End '' , and perhaps `` Wretches and Kings '' will give true LP fans a little something to listen to . While the new wave of `` fans '' who eat this album up , singing Chester 's ballads in the shower , will tell you otherwise , turn the other way . This album is nothing more than LP giving the finger to their true fans . If you do n't believe me , give Meteora a listen . Heck , give Hyrbrid Theory a listen . LP 's debut , Hybrid Theory , was good . Their sophomore , Meteora was fantastic , one of my favorite albums of all time . Minutes to Midnight was passable , but this , this is just unacceptable.While this review will get thumbed down by fanboys , and mainstream listeners who heard `` The Catalyst '' on youtube , or `` Waiting for the End '' on the radio , and declared LP their new favorite band , those of us who know the true nature of LP will see the truth . This is musical garbage , do n't even touch it unless you feel like you need to own the beginning of the end of LP . Unless the band turns it around in their next release , LP is dead . Fed to the dogs that are MTV and Billboard Top 100 Charts . You had a good run LP , rest in peace . For true fans , the first two albums are still there to be enjoyed . Perhaps we see the band clean up their act over the next couple of years , but this album offers little hope towards that .	-1
I was n't going to fall into another LP trap , and buy this while ignoring the bad reviews . The last album has n't been opened since I bought it , and listening to the samples of this alone tell me this is crap . If I do n't hear some heavy distorted guitars , actual drum beats , and a DJ scratchin in the background , ... then this band will never be the LP I know . Glad I did n't buy this just because it was LP . This band has become the biggest let-down I 've ever seen in the modern rock era . What is this sound they make ? A rave party ? Disco pop ? Gospel DJ ? I have no idea what it is , but it is n't rock . It probably should n't even have a music category .	-1
i 'm shocked and astounded . i 've really liked everything else Linkin Park has done , and that I got a hold of this ... ... ... .i have no idea what words to use to convey how bad and how much of a disappointment this album is.musically , it 's OK , not something I would listen to . it 's like listening to a Kanye West album , with Chester singing like Rhianna or something.there is one word that keeps coming to my mind with this ... ... ... ... YUCKnow , i 'm going to listen to `` A New Divide '' a few hundred times to get this out of my head .	-1
to all those who gave this a good review , what the heck are you talking about ? one of the best tracks on here is the cricket noises ... its as if the band is mocking us saying `` yea cricket noises that 's what we think of this album also ... and yet you still wasted your money on this ... haha '' this album is a joke . LP is mocking the world and how pathetic the music industry is for allowing something like this to be published . they can just throw anything they want together and know that it will sell.more noise than `` music '' and i use the word music looselyif you loved LP before do your self a favor and pretend that this album never existed .	-1
This review is written from the perspective of an old-school Linkin Park fan ... '' A Thousand Suns '' is nearly a complete departure from everything that made Linkin Park famous . There are a few glimmers of the old Linkin Park here and there , but that 's it.I find that they have gone more and more for this bizarre , experimental , pop-saturated , sound which has really disappointed me . This album is only half songs ... the other half is intros/outros . When I buy an album , I buy it to listen to music , not robotic voices or strange sound effects . It 's as if they tried too hard to come up with something different , and they nearly failed on the part where they 're supposed make good rock music ( save `` The Catalyst '' ) .This is what the band says about `` A Thousand Suns '' : '' We were not making an album . For months , we 'd been destroying and rebuilding our band . The experiments that resulted filled the studio hard drive with diverse , abstract sounds . Amorphous echoes , cacophonous samples , and handmade staccato merged into wandering , elusive melody . Each track felt like a hallucination . We did n't know if any of those unorthodox ideas could be incorporated into a traditional album , but we knew we did n't want our next album to be predictable ... We asked ourselves : were we all earnestly willing , more than ever before , to abandon the precepts of commercial ambition in pursuit of what we believe to be honest art ? `` To their credit , Linkin Park accomplished some of what they set out to do . They created an album which is very unpredictable and chock-full of `` unorthodox ideas '' . The band calls this album `` honest art '' and some people call these changes evolution , but with all the changes , Linkin Park has distanced itself from a large portion of its fan base , myself included . It appears that Linkin Park has reached so high , they 've lost their footing . If this is honest art , it 's almost too abstract and bizarre to enjoy.I bought this album on a whim , hoping to be pleasantly surprised , and I 'm sorry to say that I regret the purchase.The only songs I enjoyed on `` A Thousand Suns '' are `` The Catalyst '' and `` Waiting For The End '' . The latter is only worth your time if , like me , you have a broad taste in music.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion , and that 's mine.0.9 of 5.0	-1
... after listening to this CD . Hybrid Theory is one of the best albums ever made . Meteora was damn close . Minutes to Midnight was upsetting as they changed direction and I only enjoyed a few songs . This CD is just a travesty . If you love Meteora and/or Hybrid Theory , do yourself a favor and do NOT buy this CD . This CD is so bad you will end up liking those CDs less .	-1
Congratulations Linkin Park ! You just wiped off half your fanbase , I remember the good ol ' days when Hybrid Theory came out and LP was all over the TV , radio , shows , and when everyone was jamming to their music . Then Meteora came out , another rock solid album . They were at the top and hardly anyone had any complaints about their music - I still remember how awesome it was to speed in my car with their songs at max volume when I was a teenager . However few years ago , Minutes to Midnight came out , which was somewhat mediocre - some songs were a throwback to the older albums while some were just plain shocking - I felt as if I was listening to The Fray and All American Rejects ; nevertheless , it was still a decent CD that was worth the money . They rolled downhill with Minutes To Midnight and they literally fell off the cliff with Thousand Suns.This CD is extremely disappointing and the only good song that I really like is The Catalyst ( I love the live version at MTV 's VMAs ) . Do n't bother with the rest because it is pure garbage and it will make your ears bleed . I do n't care if the lyrics are good when the song itself is n't . Those of you who are saying that this is a masterpiece , I assume you are post Meteora fans because that is the only reasonable way to explain this . Honestly , I think that this album should have been named `` Epic Fail . `` The change from NuMetal to technorock I guess is shocking . It 's like Eminem releasing a metal CD.I 'm sorry Linkin Park , I am no longer your fan .	-1
The product description pictures something totally different to what the costumers may expect . LP have turned their backs to the fans because even if they changed into something `` innovative '' or different it does n't mean it is good , in fact the word ROCK is virtually non-existent with this release.They seem to have changed their instruments into computers and devices to have an electronic experimental approach which even if it is not mainstream , is much more accessible , so be prepared to listen these guys on every radio and most on psychedelic parties.The fame rushed to their heads so these arrogant guys are now trying too hard to be cool , you can notice the songs sound too forced , they changed their passion to be `` artsy '' ... Heck maybe they will stop doing concerts and play as Dj 's on trance parties , lame ! Fans , please do n't kiss their a*** because this release was not for us , they 're pleasing themselves ! As somebody else said : As slap in the face !	-1
Wow , many of these reviewers are correct . My wife listens to LP and after she heard some of the new material she was very disappointed . I will not be purchasing this one for her . I can understand why they would want to change their direction musically and I hope its just a CD on that journey.I had a feeling when I read the description a few weeks before release that this could be something special or somthing really terrible . Sorry guys its the latter .	-1
basically theys old out with this album , no more hungry linkin park who sang songs for their fans , now its all about keeping the record company happy , thats what happens folks when people become rich they forget where they came from . treasure the old park , now its just a bunch of useless screaming , and there is a bunch of wasted space with no songs except beats ? someone needs to tell the rich linkin park band this old fan wants his money back , what a waste of money for this garbage ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Linkin Park returns as emasculated as ever . This cd is a disgrace . Linkin Park has become but a shadow of their former selves . This is electro , techno-pop balladry at it 's worst . There is nothing heavy about this album at all . You got ta love all of the excuse making by some of the other posters here about how the band has evolved and is getting in touch with their inner feelings . Utter crap ! These guys have re-invented themselves as a parody of what they once were . I previewed this album before buying it , which I wo n't do at this point . Do n't buy this ! ! ! !	-1
There are plenty of bands out there who made 1 good albumn . There are even lots of bands who were lucky enough to come out with 2 successful albums ... but creating an anthology of CD 's that are loved and cherished are what separates truly great artists from mediocre ones.Congrats to LP for producing 2 amazing CD 's in Hybrid Theory and Meteora , but those days are long gone , just like Metallica 's glory days . Sure their classic songs will always get them recognition on the airwaves , but everrything new they produce is just garbage . It truly does make me wonder how great a band was to begin with.Maybe LP are just tapped out of ideas ? Maybe they plaquerized the songs off their first 2 CD 's ? Seriously ! I seriously think they just ripped off the fun songs from Hybrid Theory and Meteora ! Now that they are left with creating their own music , they are just lost and clueless.I love music , and can appreciate good music , even if it 's not my cup of tea , but this latest effort is just a joke . It 's a big `` F YOU '' to their fans by creating something that is barely music . Paying $ 15 bucks for a CD is costly for some , and nothing sucks more than forking over $ 15 just to listen to something unlistenable ... knowing you will never play this CD again.It 's CD 's like this that make me listen to every albumn BEFORE I buy it . I would hate to have wasted my own cash on this abortion of a CD . You should be able to file a class action lawsuit or something when bands make music as bad as this . They pretty much are robbing consumers and fans of their money.Even the coverart is stupid ! Just some hokey photoshop radial blur filter ? ? ? lol	-1
If a new band came onto the scene and released this , a lot of people would like it . But when you are an established band with a past , then there are expectations.It is not bad , but it is nothing I would have expected from Linkin Park . If they had changed their name and made it clear that this was a side project/experiment , I would have reacted differently.If you are NOT expecting Linkin Park , then maybe you can appreciate what is there .	-1
Although this album is a lot of styles all mished and mashed together , and is sometimes kind of innovative , to a degree , it could be best described as 'artistic crap'.Not long after Linkin Park became Nu-Metal heroes with their debut album , 'Hybrid Theory ' , Nu-Metal lost it 's standing in the rock community . Although Meteora from 2003 basically continued in that vein , Linkin Park had to sink or swim ; since 2001 Korn and Limp Bizkit have suffered massive loss in sales , and Linkin Park was going to follow them down that path if they did n't adapt . In 2007 they released 'Minutes to Midnight ' , which was a major departure from their earlier sound . It was more ambitious and diverse . It was essentially a completely different style . Obviously LP were well educated on the low opinion of them in this post-Nu-Metal world.They have followed this up with 'A Thousand suns ' , which is a kind of social-conscious album that is full of statements . To understand WHY I give this album a low-rating , it 's worth comparing to an album almost 20 years ago by a hair-metal band ; 'Three sides to every story ' by 'Extreme ' . 'Extreme ' were labelled a hair-metal band in a grunge world that suddenly did n't like their style . They came out in 1992 with an ambitious album full of social commentary , including anti-war anthems . What also makes the two albums worth comparing is because on that album 'Extreme ' used a sample from a speeach by social activist Martin Luther King . 'A thousand suns ' uses three excerpts from activists ' speeches , including one from the same Martin Luther King . However there is one clear difference between the two.While 'Three sides to every story ' is a very well-thought out album that has a lot of meaning , 'A thousand sons ' does n't really mean anything . The lyrics have a lot big statements and emotion filled passages of sanctimony , but the overall meaning is often vague to the point of having no meaning at all . There 's a lot of complaint and discontent , which has always been a feature of Linkin Park music , but now that they 've cloaked themselves in Rage Against the Machine like activism , it 's even more frustrating that the lyrics really do n't amount to anything . And the music itself is a step-back from 'Minutes to Midnight ' . Genuine good song-writing and complexity , who showed their heads occasionally on the last album , have been replaced by a lot of effects and sampling . There are some good vocal harmonies here and there but that ca n't save songs that are desperately trying to cover their own lack of substance . That said , the songs 'Catalyst ' and 'The Messenger ' are genuinely high quality , 'The Messenger ' is particularly lovely.Shame really , I have been intrigued by these recent Linkin Park albums , since I have discovered them recently , because I thought there might be a Nu-Metal band that can come good , but 'A thousand suns ' is basically a meticulously and thoroughly crafted piece of crap . To all the music critics giving this 5 stars and going 'wow ' ( not Amazon reviewers , but actual critics ) , you really do have low expectations of what music can achieve , do n't you ? A REAL rating : * ( 1.00/5.00 )	-1
My favotrie band evar ! ! Their were like brutal , heavy medal at first but then they went to other stuff wich is automacically amazing and i liek how he screams at me whatever song i play 2 wich autimaticly makes them very motional , it makes me cry too . OOh , and i get to by the album again as liek one song , cuz there not only r they that good , you just cant get enogh of it and I dont have 2 hit bakc on my ipod or else i get tendonitis . An as allwayz the words r soo emotinal 2 . All hu give dis one star are lame nd close minded cuz its not medal liek there frst 2 . I herd in ther next alblum , they make covers of tales like the three little pigs , that part of `` then he huffs , and he puffs , and blow THE HOUSE DOWN '' will b clasick ( i put ick insted of ic cuz ther da best ) ! ! ! 1111 ! !	-1
I may go back and listen again to this , but I 'm not that into this type of music . Their other albums have more guitar work on them and a hard rock edge . This is more electronic and industrial sounding.I equate this to when Metallica put out St. Anger . It is an experimental record . If you are a completionist , you should get it . If you are expecting it to sound like their last records , DO N'T !	-1
I was so looking forward to this album- The Foundation is one of my top albums . Part of the reason I loved TF so much was because for the most part , it was a `` smart '' album- really emotional songs ( not necessarily sad emotion , but some emotion- fun on Toes , tear-terking-ness on Highway 20 Ride , foot-stomping action on Where the Boat Leaves From , etc . ) Sadly , the new album came out and I was so disappointed . All of the songs either lacked emotion or were just very hickish and stupid ( lots of yelling , etc . or just plain gross ( why do you have to put in a line about `` Lick my sack ? '' ) ) . I do n't like redneck country , though , so if you like that , you might like it.The only song that I really liked was `` Colder Weather , '' but it still was n't the emotional powerhouse that I was expecting to follow up `` Free '' and `` Highway 20 Ride . '' I would stronly reccomend LISTENING TO THE WHOLE ALBUM before you buy , so you wo n't spend twelve bucks on something you do n't like .	-1
Can you say over-produced . I like Lyfe and I understand , as an artist there is the need to grow . This CD does show growth and I compliment that but it is 360 from where he started . When Lyfe popped up on the scene he was a raw gritty kid with a guitar and heart . He represented and embodied a spirit that you ca n't put a label on . He was PRINCE without the heels , he was a stick-up kid , he was unapologetic . This new guy cut the hair and got a suit and the sound is 100 % commercial . As I listen to this CD I ca n't help but think he hates the person he use to be , and that makes me sad . Ok I understand that you want to warn your daughter about the wrong men but that is no reason to turn all Oprah on us and tear the few good men that are out there down . After all you are a statistic to let 's not forget about the jail stint , and ducking child support . I just wish this LP had a little less of the new Lyfe and a little more of the old .	-1
I was expecting some memorable music here . After what he 'd done in albums such as & # 34 ; Frantic & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; Mamouna & # 34 ; , not to mention his previous albums and his stint in Roxy Music , you 'd expect great tunes out of this man . Unfortunately it was not to be . I 'm not going to comment on the quality of the recording or the mastering , just the music . And it is forgettable . A mortal sin from the likes of Bryan Ferry . Any other schmuck I could accept it , but not from BF . The production is slick and on the side of poppy . BF 's voice has aged , but that does not excuse him from this really bad album . Play it if you can from a popular video website , and you 'll see what I mean . Not a single memorable or good song here . It appears be an album full of fillers . I am very disappointed . No wonder this album is so cheap for sale on CD here on Amazon . Maybe if he would have taken a bit more time to work on the songs and improve them . I do n't know .	-1
A very good effort ... . if you like Avalon , Boys and Girls , Bete Noire , Mamouna ( my personal favorites ) you will like this record , 4 stars for music . Recording is TOTALLY over blown over compressed 1 star . When will these sound engineers responsible for these HOT digital recordings all be forced to do something else for a living . How can they not notice this style of recording RUINS dynamic range of our beloved music . Very upset we had to wait all these years for new original Ferry only to get stuck with this CRAP still happening with recordings.Update : I have gotten some enjoyment listening to the CD on my Itouch , It actually sounds much better and dynamic . However , I should n't have to go to my Ipod to listen to a record . Still , I would really like to listen to this CD through my home system ( Bryston/Magnapans ) where his other records are so dynamic and transparent .	-1
Nothing of any real relevance here -- -yeah , there 's a few good songs , but nothing that can top anything on `` major lodge victory '' or `` new miserable exp . '' Most of the stuff here to me is just `` watered down gin and tonic '' , kind of a `` phoning it in '' type production , sorry , but true . one more album like this and it could be the end for em ' .	-1
Its been a little over a year since this album came out ( Sept 28 , 2010 ) , and i thought that was enough time to write a decent review : Not in the few days of excitement just after the release and enough time to give it a few listens if I did n't like it at first . I am a very big Jimmy Eat World fan . I have seen them 8 times in concert and `` Clarity '' is my favorite album of all time . I first discovered J.E.W . in 1998 when a friend borrowed `` Static Prevails '' and we both loved it . Since then , I have bought every one of their records the day they came out . Unfortunately , since `` Bleed American '' there has been a steady decline in each album that my favorite band has released . `` Invented '' is no different , and in fact , I believe that it is their weakest effort to date . I do n't know what it is , but the same emotion and drive just is n't there . I have tried several times to play the album and find something to like , and I just have n't been able to . I was so excited to hear that Mark Trombino was producing , that maybe some of that old magic would return , but it seems like it did n't . `` My Best Theory '' is there shot at a radio hit , but I could easily name 30 other JEW songs that are better . `` Coffee and Cigarettes '' sounds weird , and I ca n't even recognize Jim 's voice because they layered it too much and distorted it . The title track is barely listenable with an emotionless , almost forced build up . Maybe I 'm getting too old , or my expectations are to high . I do n't know . Anyway , that 's my 2 cents , and if this is the first JEW album that you have heard , maybe you like it and think its their best . That 's fine , but to me they have fallen far from the mountain top they used to occupy .	-1
Teddy Thompson rips into the single and opening track `` Looking For A Girl '' like there 's no tomorrow ... he 's got my hands dancing across the steering wheel of my car , my heads bobbing , and I find myself repeatedly turning up the volume . The same with the song `` I Feel , '' both are brilliant , expertly laid out to capture your attention in mid-stride , turn your gaze inward , and send your feet right to the music store . Sadly for me that 's were it stopped ... while I found the other tracks good , they seemed to be bombastic , way too over the top , shot loaded for big game and discharged with an underpowered rifle . The other rest of the album is too operatic , sounding like the man 's taken himself a might too seriously and full of pretense . So skip the rest , download the two I 've mentioned , and you 're gon na have one fine day , not to mention a couple of extra dollars in your pocket.Review by Jenell Kesler	-1
This is not Elvis . What a travesty . This is Elvis for the brain dead . Crap is crap . This is crap !	-1
I normally do n't write 1 star reviews , seems kind of petty or piling on . But this CD is bad . Really bad . I have heard the show is fun , but I have n't seen it . I do n't think that matters . Taking Elvis 's recordings and mucking them up this way is just a mistake , in my opinion . I really ca n't see an Elvis fan liking this at all . If you went to the show and want to hear it again , here you go . As a music fan of many years ( and not a giant Elvis fan ) I 'd give this 1 star . Maybe 0 . The Beatles one was OK . This is bad . Really bad .	-1
If you like your Schubert smoothly played and bland , this set 's for you . If you want to hear any semblance of passion or drama , look elsewhere . Not only is the playing anemic , but it sounds like the orchestra is sightreading.Admittedly , I have a hard time recommending any of the complete non-HIP recordings , but Kertesz , Muti , Davis , Blomstedt , and even Bohm have more to offer than this . Among incomplete traversals , try Dausgaard or Maazel 's early Berlin recordings ( last seen as part of a DG & # 34 ; Original Masters & # 34 ; set ) . And for HIP , Bruggen or Immerseel .	-1
I was eagerly awaiting the release of Jazmine 's second CD . However , this CD is all over the place . I am not sure what direction she was going for and honestly it does n't sound like she knows either . The best effort is Holding you Down . For me it when downhill after that .	-1
The movie was better than the soundtrack and that 's not saying much ... ... a few good songs but I am hoping to return this soon . Quite boring ... ... ... do not buy	-1
What were they thinking with this volume in the 'essential mixes ' series ? Sorry , but Avril Lavigne does NOT fit the lineup of artists in need of a MIXES collection . All we really get here are acoustic and live versions of her songs with a couple of bad remixes of her hits thrown in to cover the 'mixes ' part . A greatest hits compilation of her studio recordings would be sufficient . track times : Complicated ( The Matrix Mix ) ( 4:04 ) Girlfriend ( Dr. Luke Mix ) ( 3:26 ) Hot ( Wolfadelic Remix ) ( 5:04 ) Sk8er Boi ( Live Acoustic Version ) ( 3:38 ) My Happy Ending ( Live Acoustic Version ) ( 3:56 ) Take Me Away ( Live Acoustic Version ) ( 2:53 ) Nobody 's Home ( Live Acoustic Version ) ( 3:39 ) He Was n't ( Live Acoustic Version ) ( 3:16 ) When You 're Gone ( Acoustic Version ) ( 3:59 ) Girlfriend ( Junkie XL Extended Mix ) ( 5:43 )	-1

All seemed a little forced . I would have liked an offering consistent with her place in the jazz world- a promising beginner .	-1
Okay , here 's the thing ... I love , love , LOVE Joshua Radin . His style is ( or was ) unique , his voice quiet and thoughtful , his lyrics emotional and deep . We Were Here was such a groundbreaking album for me . It is largely responsible for my being a fan of acoustic music . Winter , Star Mile , Closer ... These were classics that have been stuck in my head since the first time I 've heard them . Simple Times , though different , had some very high points , such as Sky , I 'd Rather Be With You , Brand New Day , Friend Like You , and so on . The Rock and the Tide , at least upon first listen , seems to be so far out of the range of what Mr. Radin is known for , what he does best , and what got him where he is , that it 's like he 's going in a direction I 'm not really willing to follow . He was once a subtle voice in a noisy world . Now he 's just part of the noise . I understand artists have to progress . I 'm a recording artist myself so I understand that all too well . But you ca n't go so far beyond where you came from that you ca n't see home anymore at all , and it feels like that 's where Joshua Radin is heading , as if the acoustic stuff he wrote was only out of necessity because he was n't big yet and could n't afford his own band and so he 'd settle for acoustic songs for now until he could do what he really wanted to do . I mean , there 's only like two songs were the acoustic guitar is the main instrument it seems like . There are no female vocals -- that 's part of his sound ! Where 's Priscilla Ahn ? Where 's Ingrid Michaelson ? Now , I 'll listen to this CD again and see if I think differently . It may just be that I 'm refusing to accept his new direction because I 'm too fettered to the old one . It happens . And sometimes , I 'll re-listen in a few weeks and go , `` Wow ! What was I thinking ? ! This is GREAT ! '' And sometimes I 'll listen and go , `` Yep . Still sucks . '' So , what will happen here ? I do n't know . But I will give it a chance . But my initial response , quite frankly , is disappointment.A note on the live DVD -- Okay , first of all the mix is way off . Thin acoustic guitars and massive pounding bass drums . I do n't know who mixed this or who the sound guy was , but someone fell asleep at the switch , as it were . Also , where are those favorites ? I mean , there were a few , but NOTHING from We Were Here . It 's a good thing the DVD came free with the CD because if I had spent money on it I would be jacked.To Joshua Radin , I would say this in summation : The acoustic guitar has been around for many a year , and no one 's tired of it yet . Yes , from complex finger-picking to simple chord strumming , countless people play the acoustic guitar and still sell CDs , get people to listen , and so on , and they do so because the songs they play are real , they 're organic , they 're human . Of course , rock n ' roll has been around for quite some time , too , and many people enjoy it 's loudness . Personally , I do n't think you do the loud stuff good enough to make your way in this world with rock n ' roll . You did , however , do the acoustic stuff with such passion , elegance , realness and humanity that you could 've made ten more albums building on what you started in your first major label release and would have made a name for yourself as the quintessential acoustic singer-songwriter . Now you 're just another guy sounding like the rest . So my advice , for what it 's worth to ya , is take a step back , regroup , and try again . You do n't have to put out We Were Here part 2 , but you do n't have to try to put out Born in the USA either . Springsteen already did that , and he did it better than you 'll ever do it .	-1
At the time David Archuleta was a contestant on American Idol Season six , I was a huge fan and was hoping he would be the ultimate victor . Given another voting scandal ( despite David Cook 's consummate popularity ) , Archuleta lost heartily it seemed , despite easily out-singing Cook on finale night . I did n't purchase Archuleta 's first effort , though I did hear single `` Crush , '' but did n't find myself impressed by any means . Similarly on his second effort , I am not truly impressed with the material , finding Archuleta 's great vocal talents sometimes compromised because of lackadaisical , ill-fitting material . It is not a horrible affair , but bland to say the least . `` The Other Side of Down '' strikes a bad chord with me because its dance-pop production work would not be my first choice of production work or style supporting Archuleta . Archuleta sounds uninspired at times and the breeziness of this cut does not captivate me as a listener . `` Something ` Bout Love '' is slightly better , exhibiting Archuleta 's fine falsetto , but again , electro-centric based production work is not my first choice for a vocalist with the talents of Archuleta . Again , I do not feel a connection with this song , which makes this cut come over as generic . `` Elevator '' may be the albums first noteworthy cut , given Archuleta a better `` look '' as far as production work with guitars supporting him . Again , Archuleta 's falsetto is solid , even though the heaviness of the guitars cover him up during the refrain . This cut is corny , do not get me wrong , but it is much better than the big , electro-driven cuts and let 's face it - the hook is catchy ! ! ! `` Stomping Roses '' is ok , but the production grows ` overwrought ' and this cut feels like another rewrite of the same cut , which is another issue I have with The Other Side of Down . `` Who I Am '' finds Archuleta sounding good , though the gimmickry and repetition grows annoying . Again , there is no connection with the material between vocalist and song or for the listener . `` Falling Stars '' suits Archuleta better than most cuts , though it is by no means his ` saving grace ' on this oddly compiled effort . Finally through `` Parachutes Airplanes '' does Archuleta capture the spark that made millions of voters vote for the singer . It is not going to be the next big hit by any means , but `` Parachutes Airplanes '' is actually solid without much to quibble about . Just when some momentum was being mustered up , `` Look Around , '' a blatantly underachieving cut is interesting , but clunky in overall songwriting and conception . Again , gimmickry does in Archuleta rather than finding more interesting and inspired material to showcase the singer 's great talent . `` Good Place , '' `` Complain , '' and `` Things Are Gon na Get Better '' are authentic cuts from this rather inauthentic album . `` Good Place '' finds Archuleta supported by a traditional pop production scheme ; Archuleta 's vocals strengths are hence showcased . `` Complain '' features superb vocals by Archuleta and sound songwriting - again keeping in mind even the best cuts are by no means innovative or revolutionary . `` Things Are Gon na Get Better , '' is a moving and uplifting number , including a choir . The bridge section of this cut is particularly beautiful and noteworthy . Closing cut `` My Kind of Perfect '' may not be as good as `` Good Place , '' `` Complain , '' or `` Things Are Gon na Get Better , '' but it accentuates Archuleta 's vocal strengths well , better than the two clunkers that open up this album.I would love to say that I absolutely loved this album when listening to it , but alas , I just did not . With so many pop-tarts assimilating to every trend that further threatens to take away their personality and individuality as an artist , it is hard to get excited about anything . This is that album that further alienates Archuleta from commercial success because it does nothing to set him aside from other artists . Not my cup of tea , unfortunately .	-1
I had listened to this CD streaming online before purchase and I will not be purchasing this CD . Do a search and listen to it first.It really comes down to 2 decisions.A . If you like the sound of Savior Sorrow this CD is right inline with that release and you will like it.B . If you love the old school sound then you may not like this as much . I personally like the old school sound and could listen to that in heavy rotation.Musically I loved the dance/metal sound with keyboard being more of a focal point instead of filler . Now is seams guitars are the focal point with keyboard as filler.In short I am on the path of being an old fan.Happy listening .	-1
I love GOOD music , but this ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! It all sounds the same . Taylor 's first song `` Tim Mcgraw '' was fantastic but I have not liked one since .	-1
This album lacks creativity and soul . 90 % of the songs are unimaginative and simply boring ; Second song `` Mirage '' sounds like every Tiesto song out there ( and I do n't mean in a good way ) , and the other ones are unworthy of comments ; I recommend Gareth Emery 's Northern Lights album [ 2010 ] over this , so you ca n't say my review is completely negative and useless ; - )	-1
Blues Image were a great group from the seventies era so I have to question this release of mostly cover material ... ..They wrote enough of their own material and vocalist-guitarist Mike Pinera stood out on his own merit.To hear versions of American Woman , Hold Your Head Up , I Got A Line On You etc is strictly bar band ! ! ! Stick to the Blues Image original material as this release does not represent what this band was about .	-1
I have been a fan of Putumayo World Music for many years . I have trusted their label for its quality and great music . I was disappointed when I listened to `` Yoga '' . This music does not at all set a mood or add to the yoga experience.I have found other music more fitting yoga exercise . There were no music samples and I did buy the CD sight unseen . I will be more careful next time .	-1
What a brilliant artist Kanye West is at his best . He really is an artist , too , because he produces for himself and others , he raps and he ( tries to ) sing . He 's a visionary . Unfortunately , the vision he had for `` My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy '' was quite a bad vision . I saw a lot of people in the store buying this album and I see all of the positive feedback this effort has received . I was also impressed with the album 's lead single , `` Monster . '' Additionally , I really enjoyed `` The College Dropout '' , `` Late Registration '' and `` Graduation . '' Needless to say , Kanye had set the bar high and my expectations were high . After listening to this , I was so very disappointed.This album is horrible to me and there is just no getting around that . I listened to it with an open mind and even listened to some tracks more than once to see if I could get from this album what others have apparently gotten , but nope , I feel the same way with every listen . This album is very `` dark . '' The instrumentation is very experimental and haunting . I do see his vision ( I guess ) , but it was executed all wrong on so many levels . `` Gorgeous '' is really bad . It brings to `` My Mind is Playing Tricks on Me '' by The Geto Boys but it 's not nearly as good . `` Gorgeous '' has lots of guitar and features Raekwon . Even a legend like him could not save this trash . `` Dark Fantasy '' is lame , but lyrically , this song is about as good as it gets on this album . I have seen Kanye be so much more profound on other songs than he is on this album . He really is a creative lyricist with some hilarious and great one-liners . But here ? Child , please . They are few and far between . You 'd be lucky to get 3 catchy lines in each song . `` Devil in a New Dress '' is a guitar-laden song that features the incredible Rick Ross . This is one of the album 's better moments , but it 's still not great . It 's OK at best.I could not get into this album and never will be able to . It 's one dimensional and overall bad . I still believe in him . There is nothing wrong with stepping outside of the box , and he definitely has that to his credit as far as this album is concerned , but he 's right , this LP is `` dark '' and `` twisted . '' But beautiful ? I think not ! Grab his first two albums . They should just recall it and be done with it.Mikeisha 's Top 51 . `` Monster '' 2 . `` Devil in a New Dress '' 3 . `` So Appalled '' 4 . `` All of the Lights '' 5 . `` Dark Fantasy ''	-1
Ouch ! What was Andy thinking when he made this monstrous disaster ? I am sorry to report as a Combichrist fanatic that this album falls short of anything I could ever proudly give anything other than a single star rating on Amazon . This is the worst Combichrist album to date . Actually , this is the only bad Combichrist album to date but still ... .ouch ! ... Ouch ! Ouch ! Ouch !	-1
I love The Birthday Massacre . I have been a fan for a few years now since I first heard of the band on a Cleopatra records compilation . Their song `` Video Kid '' was what got me hooked on the band . 4 or 5 years later , I find myself not saying that about the band 's latest effort Pins & Needles . I never have been so disappointed in a band until now . Pins & Needles lacks the addictive pop hooks or originality that made me fall in love with them to begin with . I also found a few songs on the new album to be regurgitation of songs like `` Red Stars '' and `` Looking Glass '' from their previous full length album . Not very original IMO . I really did want to like Pins & Needles but sadly I did not nor can I recommend it either . I 'll take the new Cylab and Unter Null cds over the new TBM cd any day .	-1
I am a huge fan of TGAS ... and have noted the lame attempts of various artists to cover it in the last 20 years . With the exception of Linda Ronstadt , I have n't found any of them listenable . Goes triple for this one , which a well-meaning friend gave me for Christmas . I am a big Rod Stewart fan , but the man simply ca n't sing these songs . Not only does he not have the voice for it , but he does n't have the chops either . Nor do the musicians , arrangers , and producers who put together this awful album . For heaven 's sake , people , stop buying this dreck and that Buble stuff and go out and get yourself some Frank and Ella and Tony . Enough with the second-rate karaoke !	-1
This man has not recorded an original song since 2001. Who could have known when he sang the classic standard `` That 's All '' wayyy back on the FIRST American Songbook that he would spend the rest of his career churning out one `` covers '' album after another ?	-1
... is that you listen to the first track on this recording ( or the snippet on Amazon ) and then go listen to the same song ( or snippet ) on `` Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Harold Arlen Songbook '' ( disc 1 , track 8 ) . Nothing against Rod , who is a great singer in his own right , but when it comes to these songs , there are dozens , if not hundreds , of versions that are superior . Perhaps it 's not fair to put Rod up against Ella , the Queen of the Songbooks , but this particular song illustrates why it 's not worth anyone 's time or money to buy this version when far better - incredibly , indisputably better - versions exist out there . If you love this music , go buy one of Ella 's songbooks . Or Sinatra , Tony Bennett , and so on . But do n't waste your money on Rod 's versions .	-1
In the words of Elton John , `` karaoke albums do n't count . `` Ever since he started recording these abysmal theme records nearly a decade ago , Rod Stewart has been more about surface appearance than sound . His album covers from this period make that evident . Unfortunately , donning a snazzy suit and singing chestnuts does not make one Tony Bennett any more than tossing on a leather jacket and ripped jeans makes one Joey Ramone or sporting a soulful swoon makes one Al Green.In the world of Rod Stewart image is consistently at the forefront , especially on this disc , where he sounds in perpetual need of a throat lozenge . While his voice has coolly mellowed , not every show biz veteran emanates nostalgic gold on cue.This music is as much about marketing and product-placement as the drivel being spilled out by acts such as Katy Perry or Ke $ ha , with little to no soul , substance or artistry behind it . The only difference is the demographic being aimed at - here , baby boomers with only a minimal amount of sophistication or taste ( if that ) who know this material is `` good for them '' but do not have the energy , drive or impetus to locate performances of these songs from better , more suitable vocal interpreters . `` Rod Stewart '' is therefore more a brand and familiar face in this context.The arrangements are textured and nicely orchestrated , and Stewart usually sounds like he is supplying differing emotions as he moves in and out of the tracks - and these are , after all , some of the best songs ever written . Even a minimum of competence as a singer can make the likes of `` What a Difference a Day Makes '' and `` I 've Got the World on a String '' sound fine.Stewart displays a minimum of enthusiasm for the material and his job as singer , so it all does sound `` fine '' - not transcendent , not brilliant , not particularly soulful , rich or stirring - in other words , not good enough.In an era where we , by some wonderful luck , still have Tony Bennett regularly touring and hitting the backs of concert halls , unmiked , with his rendition of Bart Howard 's `` Fly Me to the Moon , '' there is simply no need to hear Rod Stewart sleepwalk his way through it . It is redundant , reductive , excessive and unwholesome all at once , much like the experience of Michael Buble performing Sinatra bastardization in a predictable suit and tie . Mimicry is not art.Go to the nearest jazz hole in the wall you can find if music really matters to you . Order a cocktail and sit down . You are guaranteed to have a more genuine experience than you would have playing this CD or seeing one of Mr. Stewart 's overpriced concerts.And if that 's out of reach , try any album by Madeleine Peyroux .	-1
`` Issa '' is a project by Serafino Perugino -- the president of Italian Melodic Rock record label Frontiers Records -- and brings Uli Kusch on drums , Nobby Noberg on bass , Peter Huss on guitar and Tim Larrson on synthesizers with contest-winning vocalist Isabel Oversveen , a glamorous looking singer that graces the front cover of this debut release . Whether browsing the photographs throughout the CD booklet , watching the music video or listening to the music , it is clear that Perugino 's primary objective with this project was to make a record Frontiers could market in the North American music market by cloning Avril Lavigne . If female-fronted rock with cynical lyrics is your forte , this will be your album . However , if you are looking for songs that are optimistic about love , you can buy the 7th track , `` Unbelievable , '' and stop right there.After listening to this album several times in a row , I ended up enjoying at least half of the songs on the disc once I was able to mentally filter out Issa 's nasally vocals and the whiney lyrics . The raw feeling of the music with often mono guitar tracks and rough , heavily compressed drum tracks reminded me of early M & ouml ; tley Cr & uuml ; e , including the gratuitous motorcycle sound effects on `` Flying High . '' I think my favorite thing about this album is Nobby 's deepy , throaty , heavy technique , with thick plucking and lots of string rubs . Great examples of that are on songs like `` As I Live and Breathe , '' `` How Will I Know , '' `` River of Love '' and `` Falling Angel . `` Nevertheless , I had to give this album a lot of chances to appeal to me because it took a long time for me to appreciate some of the better aspects of the record . I was bored to tears by the opening track , `` Angels Crying '' and what could have been a sexy song in `` I 'm Alive '' ended up being , really , anything but for a lot of reasons . I usually do n't care about lyrics at all but if the music is unimaginative and deliberately produced in such a way as to suggest the most important musician on the song is the vocalist , then I end up focusing on the least appealing aspect of the record.Specifically , I thought the endless use of barre chords on the guitar tracks and the irritating synthesizer were a particularly unfortunate combination . Perhaps if the compositions were n't so bland and generic on the majority of the material recorded for `` Sign of Angels , '' I could have given this a better rating . However , I have to say , this is the most disappointing release I 've ever purchased with the Frontiers Records imprint .	-1
I listen to this cd 2 times . I can not find one song that I like . This guy can not sing and the music is bad . I could have wrote better songs .	-1
I lost interest in Clapton long ago , not because he had stopped doing the `` Cream thing , '' but , on the contrary , because he did not evolve as a guitarist . Instead , he became some sort of bland performer for all seasons , who just happened to be able to fall back on some fine guitar playing when people began to fall asleep due to his expressionless voice and bluesy noodlings . He actually became a singer who could play guitar on the side , and no one told him that as a singer he just was n't all that great ... really not . Between cringeworthy sentimental pop and tired , repetitive blues , he had erased himself off of my radar . But recently , I saw this CD at a friend 's and thought I 'd give it a try , for old time 's sake . I was flabbergasted . To descend into mediocrity is bad enough , but to descend to the depths from which even a cohort of brilliant helpers can not extricate you - wow , that takes some doing . This must be the most boring album of the month . I can not believe all these five-star reviews . Man , it 's great to have such faithful fans . Is it possible that none of them crave something new ? This must be the crowd that is able to listen to `` Darling , You Look Wonderful Tonight '' for the millionth time without snoring . Well , not me . Goodbye , Eric .	-1
I 've listened to clapton since the late sixes . this cd stinks ! I like an artist to make changes in there music at times . but for the better ! clapton says he 's is happy with this cd . if that 's the case this will be my last clapton cd . the cd is just to mellow . out of fourteen songs rolling and tumbling is the only song i like . rolling stone gave this cd four stars . they must be doing better drug 's then me . at my age i do n't need help falling asleep eric . lets play some good blues guitar more then once in a cd . not tubes and violins !	-1
Owning virtually every Clapton record/CD since his stint with Cream and being a giant fan even through his ups and downs , this record scrpaes the bottom of his creative barrel . Just a terrible record . It was so bad , I had to listen to it twice just to make sure the garbage I heard the first time through was in fact so bad , and not just a figment of my imagination . This makes his other recent Reprise-era releases from the last 15 years look like masterpieces . You will start seeing a bunch of these showing up used at your local campus record store in short order . Stay away from this CD and donate the money to charity instead . You will feel better and your ear drums will thank you .	-1
This is plain unenjoyable ! Clapton is drifting into blues and Nawlins jazz , too much now . A little more gravel in his voice and he would sound like Satchmo . Autumn Leaves ... .are you kidding me ? ! Nat `` King '' Cole RIP ! Eric , PLEASE , PLEASE go back to your roots ! I saw Clapton in Feb . He was rockin ' then ! Wha ' happened ?	-1
Sorry , Eric , you probably are my biggest musical influence , but this album is like listening to a Vegas lounge act . I struggle to stay awake listening to this , and that 's while I am driving . Man ... ..very dissapointing	-1
Ok , let 's be honest and I mean HONEST . This record is total CRAP and not just compared to their previous works . The people rating this 5 stars are doing so because 1 ) They ca n't stand to rate a Kamelot recording anything other than 5 stars ( not being true to themselves ) or 2 ) Writing a 5 star just for the helpful review bumps.Now that that 's out of the way . I am totally PISSED OFF at this recording . My jaw was agape while listening to this entire album . Where are the memorable melodies ? Where are Khan 's signature operetic vocals that make you get goosebumps ? Where are the signature guitar rifts ? Where are Oliver Palotai 's magnificent keyboard spotlight moments ? All of these elements are absent in this record . The artwork is very alluring , sinister and one of the better album covers - but the goodness stops there.I 'm not sure if they are under a new record contract , have a new management team or what , but SKIP this album . I saw Kamelot at the Pearl Room in Mokena , IL a couple of years ago and was not more than 10 feet from Khan . I am a loyal follower of this group , but honesty has to win here.Sorry guys , but this is a MAJOR stinker . : (	-1
The original production of this musical was a surprise hit , and after seeing it on Broadway in the 1980s , I could certainly understand why . I have very good memories of that specific production , not the least of which is the truly terrific score by Jerry Herman . So , I knew this recording would have those wonderful songs in place . And it does . But , after listening to the new recording twice through , I am convinced that this production must be seen as well as heard . A lot of talk has been generated by the scaling down of the production , but that 's a valid consideration of this creative team 's viewpoint . A `` smaller '' professional `` La Cage '' is entirely valid . What is not valid , and is astonishing to me , is Douglas Hodge 's performance as recorded . That 's where the `` I guess you had to be there '' comment comes in . As recorded , Hodge obliterates any possible sympathy we might have for the character of Albin . It 's almost unbelieveable that a listener would pick up this recording and think his performance is Tony worthy . He sounds like a bad , drunken impersonation of ... I do n't even know who ! Slurred , twisted , incomprehensible , and completely from out of left field , how could this interpretation have been deemed appropriate ? Kelsey Grammer is wonderful , as are all of the supporting performers , and the smaller orchestrations still work their magic with those very , very good songs . But not when Hodge is performing them . Almost unutterably disappointing .	-1
There is one song on this CD that is disgusting . It talks about a woman removing her clothes or he will . I know that TK is sexist in a lot of his songs , but this one takes the cake . If he ever does any more CD 's , I will not be one of the purchasers until he cleans up his act .	-1
The disappointment with this NEW album is the change in sound and most of all , Quality . As i 've mentioned many , many times before in other reviews for female artists in the pop/rock or rock community , They 've all gone electronic-dance or elctro-pop due to the sound of pop music changing . I 'm seeing now that `` Guitars '' are n't `` in '' anymore , For female artists atleast . We do n't have many ( If any at all ) female rockers or female pop/rock that 's equivalent to their male counterparts . Is there a market for female modern-rock anymore ? ? ? , Im just not understanding.The stuff on this album is comparable to The Veronicas , Aly & AJ and even Tatu 's latest work . I like all three bands but as you can see That 's why I like `` THEM '' , Because that 's what `` THEY '' do . I do n't need Lillix to do what they 're doing . if that 's the case I can just listen to one of those three bands if I want to hear music like this . Huge mistake for Lillix , These girls definitely made a wrong turn.Lillix is not the band they once were when they first arrived . They 've changed drastically from a rock quartet to a pop/dance duo . This is not even the same band , Everything 's different . Is this even considered the same genre of music ? What happened to songs like `` Tomorrow '' `` Quicksand '' `` 24/7 '' `` Promise '' , Was it all just a fad ? , I thought that was a signiture sound for them . I feel as though the true colors are being shown , `` Falling Uphill '' was just a sound that was `` in '' . No offense but the best vocals IMO ( Miss Louise Burns ) has removed herself from the band . The only thing about Lillix that still exists is the name . Everything else is altered or thrown out . Which is probably why Britt Black escaped before this album was released because she knew this was n't going anywhere . I did n't realise the impact Louise had on the band.Tigerlily is comprised of synthesizers and polished dance-grooves , Great combination but not what I had in mind . Let 's get one thing straight . I 'm into dance music heavily , I love electronica , I also love the more polished and shallow side of pop music , I love all of it , But I already have a set list of what artists I listen to when I 'm in need of that particular sound . I became a fan of Lillix because of their own distinct sound . There 's not ANY female rock bands at the moment that are mainstream . They 're not out there , Which is one reason I `` was '' so fascinated and focused on this band . These girls get worse and worse each album . `` Inside The Hollow '' and now this.I 'll admit `` Back Up Girl '' & `` 7 Days '' have a familiar `` Falling Uphill sound '' , `` Say No More '' is something different for the band but still sounds true to what Lillix is all about . `` Dance Alone '' sounds like a rejected track from the last album , Which leaves me bitter when I hear it , I 've already reviewed the single ( Not so great ) . Everything else on this album is disposable manufactured shiny pop music.I truly believe that Lillix will not go far as a duo , It just does n't have the same effect as an all-girl band writing and singing alternative rock songs . There 's nothing special about a digital pop/dance duo , Especially today . It 's like ... What 's the point of duo named Lillix when they 're doing what all the other girls are doing . There 's really no point in their existance at this point , they 're just taking up space and making people angry . Just two basic girls with average music , How different is that ? , Do n't we have enough of those ? . So I guess all we do is wait and see what happens next . I bet this is it .	-1
One of the best hard rock albums in recent years , no doubt , BUT in my opinion-buy it on CD or simply download it.For some reason vinyl sounds horrible.I was expecting quality of sound close to Music on Vinyl or may be recent DSD re-issues , especially looking forward to the sound of Bonamassa 's guitars and Hughes 's bass and voice.Nothing like this happened.Flat , colorless mixing reminded me of some bad monaural recordings from early 60 's . I would n't mind to pay top dollar once again in case somebody like Bob Ludwig will take care of it , after all in my opinion-this album deserves it .	-1
I am the biggest Bonamassa fan on earth . With that being said , he and his buddies put out a hasty , half-cocked effort . The singer screams , the guitars blare ( out of sync with the singing and the lyrics are pretty cliche ' . I wish that I had listened to the samples prior to buying it . The sound is Stone Temple Pilots/Seven Mary Three.Joe underplays in sections and overplays in others .	-1
A general evolution continues into vastly overproduced hollywood soundtrack material with little resemblance to original DIMMU BORGIR . In fact , as my son put it , `` this sounds like a so-called black metal version of KAMELOT . '' Not too far off the mark . There is little black metal about this but that is not the problem . DIMMU is what DIMMU is ; a theatrically based musical production group employing occasional elements of both old-school and neo-black metal . `` Kings of the Carnival Creation '' anyone ? These days they use less metal influence and more over-the-top orchestral passages and gimmicks . And losing the clean wailing bassist ( ICS Vortex ) was a HUGE mistake . But hey , if you like that sort of thing , you 'll enjoy this . But if you are looking for any sort of heavy metal ( I use the term broadly ) stick with the best DIMMU albums ; 1 . Enthrone Darkness Triumphant and 2 . Puritanical Euphoric Misantropia . I will say also that the opener on In Sorte Diaboli ( `` The Serpentine Offering '' ) is an excellent track and video , worth purchase of that disc .	-1
Dimmu Borgir should be ashamed of themselves , this is a complete disgrace to black metal ... disgrace to metal in general . Sounds like Dimmu Borgir has officially turned to sellout metal . The album sounds like it has no heart and was just pumped out for a producer hence all the guest appearances . This is hands down the worst Dimmu Borgir album . It may even be the worst album I have heard this year in metal.. do n't waste your money .	-1
I heard the song Dazzled by You as part of the promos for House MD and was blown away by it . That was why I bought this album . Unfortunately , the rest of the album does not have the same level of inspiration and is odd to say the least . Am quite disappointed as I had high expectations .	-1
Un disco pop que no aporta nada al g & eacute ; nero ... letras demasiado pop y ligeras , sin ninguna profundidad , s & oacute ; lo para fans .	-1
I was really looking forward to getting this collection , 3 coloured vinyl records mastered by Bob Ludwig and a DVD with all the videos on it as well as lithographs , a 7 '' vinyl of Black Rain also coloured and 2 CD 's . The package is very well done , does n't feel cheap at all . Everything fits nicely together and the vinyl is in a separate side of the box set to the CD 's , DVD 's and booklets , as it should be . So ... where does it go wrong ? From the first notes of the first LP or CD you 're in for a big disappointment . Another release gets ruined with overzealous dynamic range compression.Now I was n't too concerned about how the CD 's were going to turn out , I got this first and foremost for the vinyl and secondly for the DVD of the videos . Due to low sales numbers and the methodology in which vinyl records are created , vinyl editions of recent albums have seen better mastering than their CD counterparts . Do n't get all defensive and launch into a CD vs. vinyl debate , because this is n't about that . What I 'm saying is , the vinyl releases of new albums from Alice in Chains , Dave Matthews Band and others have received less dynamic range compression and less tools that result in dimished dynamics of the master that is to be used to create the vinyl , resulting in a more dynamic performance , one closer to what the producer was hearing in the studio one would hope.This is n't the case with Telephantasm , the vinyl is as poorly mastered as the CD is , perhaps even worse . The sibilance does not hold up well in Cornell 's high notes and Cameron 's cymbals and hi-hat , it sizzles into obscurity . There is little in the way of dynamics , everything sounds like your typical 2010 CD . This is very disappointing given that there are supposed to only be 5,000 copies of this . The loudness war sucks wholeheartedly , but with top bands usually only moving between 12,000~25,000 copies of their records per year the vinyl usually escapes as the idiots in A & R ; at the labels and those musicians who do n't know any better usually do n't care about the vinyl , it 's not getting into enough people 's hands , therefore the mastering engineer can master with dynamics intact like most of them want to.I compared Outshined and Rusty Cage from SIDE THREE of the coloured vinyl with my 2003 German ( EU ) pressing of Badmotorfinger , man what a MASSIVE difference , the sonics and dynamics of the recording are wonderful on the 2003 edition , which can still be found on the Amazon Germany website , ASIN B000057UWZ.If you want to order one of the two copies left , just follow through the buttons , you do n't need to read German to navigate , it 's all the same set-up as Amazon Canada or US . I highly recommend this pressing at 24 Euros , even though you 'll have to pony up 14 Euros for shipping to North America it 's still worth it to get the best sounding version of Badmotorfinger I 've ever heard , although if you do n't spin vinyl be content with the original CD , it 's also very good.I was hoping with Bob Ludwig 's name attached that the CD 's might be okay , but should have know the label and project team probably said `` no , we need this to be loud like other bands albums are these days , or kids wo n't like it '' - which is TOTAL BLOODY NONSENSE . You can see a comparison between the Badmotorfinger CD and the Telephantasm CD in a post I made at the Steve Hoffman forums by googling `` Soundgarden outshined telephantasm vs badmotorfinger dynamic comparison '' and click on the first link that says `` New release sounds like crap '' and check out post # 20.The 2010 tracks are clearly boosted , well outside the scope of CD 's limits resulting in brickwalling and/or limiting to prevent a massive amount of clipping . Dynamics are suffering , what a shame . It 's nowhere near as bad as Death Magnetic , but it 's still poor.I will say that the CD actually sounds better than the vinyl to my ears , or maybe it 's just that the vinyl sounds so poor compared to the 2003 EU pressing of Badmotorfinger that I do n't even remember how bad the CD sounds.Now maybe there is one saving grace for this package ... the DVD . Nope , it suffers too . The audio is n't as bad as the CD and vinyl from a dynamic perspective , but the bitrate afforded the DVD 's audio track is poor . They 've gone with 2.0 Dolby Digital only at a bitrate of a little over 200 Kbps . No effort was made to visit the studio and create a 5.1 mix , they did n't even add a 2.0 PCM uncompressed stereo mix which would have been much more palatable . I 'd love it if they 'd included a Blu-ray of all the videos , but really the source material is probably video in most cases and the Blu-ray would only allow for less compression ... but a high resolution 24-bit audio track would n't have gone amiss . Anyway , that 's neither here nor there , it 's nice to see some of these videos and remember watching the Buzz Bin on MTV in 1991 seeing Outshined ... but the lack of fidelity in choosing only a Dolby 2.0 mix takes away from it . Had they used the full 448 Kbps allowed on DVD for Dolby it would have been a much more enjoyable sonic experience.Overall I can only give this collection 2 stars . It 's well put together and definitely great for collectors , but the sonic misadventures that afflict the DVD , the 3LP 's and the 2CD 's are just not welcome in my house , I 'm probably returning mine to Amazon .	-1
Very disappointed . These tracks sound more like album fillers and rejected B-sides than a whole new album . True , they regain the `` sound '' that characterizes them , but the music , the hooks , hell - even the LYRICS ( not that they are worth THAT much to me ) are simply not there . They should have reworked this album until the songs actually solidified . As they stand now , they are not worth more than a second or maybe third listen , just to confirm your first impression of the album was not wrong . Why wo n't they remaster their ENTIRE old catalog instead ? That would have bought them more time and earned them extra money from royalties while they reworked these awful and corny tracks . I am VERY disappointed with this piece .	-1
I should have just burned these off of old discs . They are ALL remastered with remakes of the music done by Yoko , Sean and their musician crew . While they kindly left John 's voice in they did n't do that with the original backing musicians . I 'm giving it a 2 out of respect for John . He would n't have wanted it THIS way !	-1
Take a great first album by a band with a dramatically good lead singer . Tindersticks , for example . On the first album , everything was balanced . Music , vocals , reverb and other effects ... all balanced to good effect so that the individual song , as a whole , was the focus . Second album , gone is the balance . Its all lead vocals , and the music pushed to the background . Same here . On the original mix , Lennon 's voice was mixed in the context of the song . Everything was balanced . But , on the new remix , its all about Lennon 's voice , so anything which might detract from that ( background singers , reverb , compression ) are all striped away , along with things like character and atmosphere . The result , to me , is unlistenable . Yes , I understand that John 's voice was good . I do n't need that shoved down my throat ( ... .well , ears ) to appreciate that fact . In particular , given his history of edgy recordings , I think John would have preferred the original mix , with any flaws , to the new declawed version .	-1
John never wanted his voice up front and center . He always asked George and Geoff to mess it up , making it sound not like John Lennon . I remember reading that as soon as he discovered reverberation he sang nothing without the `` echo in the cans . '' I have bought and read more Beatles related books then I care to admit to my wife , and my humble opinion is that the voice you hear on the original album is `` what John wanted '' in 1980 and that 's it.The whole thing about Paul and Let it Be Naked is that this was what he intended his songs to sound like in 1968-70 . He himself made the changes , not his wife after he died ( oh , do n't start that up . Ha.ha ) .I personally have something against all this `` cleaning up '' of old work . For crying out loud ; the Beatles recorded Sgt . Pepper to be a mono album . At that point they could n't care less about stereo . : )	-1
I loved Matt Costa 's prior two albums , especially his last album , Unfamiliar Faces . I was excited to see he has a new album out . Boy , am I disappointed.This is a 180 degree departure from his prior style . Weird 60's-emulating music with funky sound mixing as if using 60 's equipment , but it 's NOT at all modern sounding . It 's as if a time machine took Matt back to the 60 's , he recorded this album in the past , and then the time machine brought him back with this album on vinyl to the future . Huh ? Do n't get it , sorry.If you like lame , almost all boring ( a couple songs are half-way interesting and catchy ) songs that sound like they were recorded in the 60 's , this album is for you . If you love Matt Costa 's prior albums a lot , caveat emptor before buying this one - check it out on-line at a free listening site first to make sure you like this new style . I 'm just glad I got this for free through my Rhapsody subscription and did n't pay additional money for it ( beyond my monthly subscription fee ) .	-1
Amazon has reviews of the various editions of `` West Coast Seattle Boy '' lumped together . This review pertains to the one CD/DVD version . You can get a one CD version without the DVD.The audio CD consists of tracks culled from the box set . Having heard these , I 'm glad I did n't have to sit through all of it . If you thought `` Valleys Of Neptune '' was crap , wait until you hear this . The alternate takes of already issued material are pointless . The remaining tracks are demos worth one spin . Hendrix would never have agreed to its release during his lifetime.Experience Hendrix could release this garbage for the next 10 years , and will as long as it sells . Value is subjective , of course -- if Hendrix was recorded belching after downing a shot , some fans would consider it a lost treasure.The DVD was OK , but did n't reveal much about Hendrix the person ( he did have parents and siblings ) as opposed to Hendrix the stage act ( he wanted to upstage Elvis and got dropped from the Monkees tour -- so what ? ) . And at the end there 's the announcement that Hendrix was dead , and some shots of his casket and people arriving at the cemetary . No more groupies or royalty checks for Jimi.Why did someone so massively talented live life in a stupor ? So loaded that he choked to death on his own vomit while unconscious . Did n't anyone tell him he was n't Superman ? Maybe it would have been better for Jimi if he was Jimmy -- maybe he got too deep into his own BS . We make heroes of people like Jimi , but he was just a human being.It would be absurd to place Jimi Hendrix on the same level with Charlie Parker , but they shared the same self-destructive tendency . On some level they both must have known they were pushing their bodies to the limit -- and when you hit the limit , you 're not around to see it happen.Unless it 's a live set , this is the last Experience Hendrix release I 'll buy . I 'd give `` West Coast Seattle Boy '' ZERO stars if I could .	-1
Like many , I 've just bought `` BBC Sessions '' again for the bonus DVD , after the hype build-up led us to believe that the DVD would include Hendrix 's 3-song T.V . performance from the Lulu Show , but all we get are brief snippets , interrupted by interviews with BBC D.J . 's ... ..so the 3-song performance will continue to appear on bootleg DVD's.And the closing credits , which thank Experience Hendrix 's previous label distributor ( MCA ) suggest that this piece of crap video program has been sitting on the shelf ( and with good reason ) for a few years.If you 've got the previous 2-CD edition of `` BBC Sessions '' , stick with it . The bonus audio track on the new edition is a soundtrack from a T.V . appearance where Hendrix sang live over the backing track from the studio version of `` Burning of The Midnight Lamp '' . Hardly essential . Janie Hendrix would sell ice in the winter if she could get away with it . She owes the public an apology for the worthless , disappointing DVD included with this 2-CD set .	-1
RCA/BMG Living Stereo RIP : ( If you can bear the poor zero star sound quality [ dull , no balls , with occasional clipping ] the performance is 4-5 starsSony now owns & # 34 ; Living Stereo & # 34 ; and they have dragged the sound down in the mud to level of most crap Sony CD releases . Previously the RCA|BMG|Sony Living Stereo CD 's and later SACD [ 1993-2007 ] were transferred using vintage restored tube playback equipment then mastered with the utmost care to preserve the tonality and full lifelike dynamics of the original LP 's . Well Sony does none of that - they fired the engineers who knew what they were doing and now have the same hacks master it who ruin the bulk of their modern CD 's . RIP RCA/BMG Living Stereo and Boycott Sony Classical Living Stereo for murdering them ! To be clear I think the Sony BMG Living Stereo CD/SACD remasters from 1993-2007 are excellent . The 2010 - present [ From Sony ] are the horrible remasters .	-1
Pretty disappointing album , but I kinda saw it coming when they started to be really popular . I hate sounding like one of those music snobs that only likes bands before they 're popular , but most of the time it 's true . Is it just me , or are these songs really boring ?	-1
I started listening to Kings of Leon back when their first album debuted . I loved it . Their second album was a bit more evolved , less rowdy , more structured . I loved it . Their third album was a total departure , we saw the band go from a southern garage sound to a stadium sound ... I LOVED IT . That 's right . Loved the change . What you find about KOL fans that defend the early work is that they include Because of the Times in the `` glory days '' , even though it wasnt the same kind of music as the earliest material . If that goes to show anything , its that the reason the early fans of KOL do n't support them anymore isnt beacause they 're famous , and is n't because the style of music is different . Plain and simple , the songs arent as good . Only By the Night was the album that made them huge , but it did n't pick up right away . I bought it the day it came out , and realized how the punch that was in their other albums was missing . I do n't dismiss the entire album though . Crawl , Sex on Fire , and Use Somebody are all great songs . Only by the Night sounded like Beacuse of the Times without the energy and creative ideas . I was hoping for something better this time around . Not so much a return to form , but a return to looking at songwriting from a more creative process.When i first listened to this album from beginning to end , I honestly couldnt remember one song . Nothing stands out . They played it very safe , each song sticking to a mid tempo , over produced feel . Songs like Black Thumbnail and Arizon from Because of the Times have totally different personalities . Nothing on this album sounds unique . There 's just simply a lack of good ideas , and a lack of passion in the songs . When you listen to something that you love , you can FEEL it . Trying to listen to this album was difficult , as I found myself spacing out halfway through trying to pay attention to each song . The music is uninspired and trudgingly boring . It became background music to me , as hard as I tried to find something to like . `` Mary '' had its moments I guess , but not enough for me to justify it as anything more than the best song on a bad album . I love this band , they had 3 and 1/3 great albums , but I ca n't back this record up . I 'll still pay attention to them when the next release comes around , but I 'm hoping its better than this .	-1
Kings should have stuck with a theme on this album . It would have been cool if they would have stuck with the southern roots theme with songs like `` Back down south '' , `` Radioactive '' and `` Pick up truck . '' Songs like `` Mary '' and random anthems make it sound like a random mix of songs.Now that they are too huge to care about sales , this was KOL 's chance get experimental . Give us something unexpected ie : Radiohead 's Kid A , MGMT congratulations . Even if it was an experimental failure , they could have expanded their sound . It is all the same here . They played it too safe with this album and now I have little faith they will have the balls to put out another classic like Aha Shake . `` Another downer is that the songs are too slow-a big reason I was dissapointed with their last album . Give us some uptempo songs ! I enjoy `` Radioactive '' a lot and I like the southern hick themes in songs like `` Pick up truck '' , but overall , this is a big disapointment . Especially since now they have room to put out whatever they want .	-1
Went to their myspace site to sample the new cd . First two tracks were so bar band boring , I could barely continue . Yes , there are a few listenable tracks , but these guys have never made a consistently strong cd . For fans only .	-1
I usually do n't write a review on a band in a genre which I generally find to be oversaturated with a lack of talent and/or lack of artistic value , but a friend of mine ( who usually recommends good bands , if not , at least respectable ones ) suggested this to me as an album that I needed to have a listen to . I have to say , this album is the worst I have heard this year ( and I have listened to hundreds ) . The writing is very basic ( they even dumbed down a cover of `` Come Undone '' , originally by Duran Duran ) , and lyrically , this band offers nothing at all . I can honestly say that I did n't enjoy a single track on this album . It 's not that there is n't any musical talent in this band ; the lead singer 's voice is decent , and the guitars are played in time , but any band of 12 year-olds can play/write this stuff . This is just another `` Hollywood '' , glamour-type band who is trying to make a name for themselves by using the words `` Porn Star '' in their hit , to bring attention to themselves . If you are even thinking about purchasing the album , have a listen first . If you want my advice , do n't waste your money on this album , and turn off your `` popular rock '' music station and find something with some substance .	-1
Great lyrics with below average beats . It 's been that way since Mostasteless . A couple good sounding songs and the rest will put you to sleep . Worst PSY release of the year , not hating but just being honest . A Twiztid and Mike Clark release would be great .	-1
What can I say ? It 's difficult for me to endure an entire CD of Syd Barrett tunes . I do n't particularly enjoy his style . For me , Pink Floyd really became important after Syd was removed from the band . The only enjoyable thing about this CD is having Pink Floyd 's `` Apples And Oranges '' . Syd was talented ... but his lyrics sound like the ramblings of a lunatic . I just ca n't absorb them . Sorry Syd fans . You may love Syd 's stuff , and you recognize Syd 's value . I just do n't get it ...	-1
I ordered this because `` Laws of Jazz '' is one of my all-time favorite albums , and because this got such a high user rating on Amazon , but I was very disappointed . This album consists of a few longish , very slow ( dreary , IMO ) pieces with none of the melodic inspiration of `` Laws '' . I could n't even finish `` Amazing Grace '' , one of my favorite songs .	-1
To me this is a big opportunity that Neil has blown by not getting in Crazy Horse to flesh out ( and rock out ) this current set . Stronger songs ( and structures ) like Peaceful Valley Boulevard , Someone 's Gon na Rescue You & Walk With Me unfortunately get lost in the quagmire of sound.OK , so there are still a large body of Neil Noise freaks out there ( and those that love this album ) but I 'm afraid even after a number of plays it comes across as half baked , half arsed and even pretentious.At least Neil has got a body of previous works that fans like me can fall back on.Approach with care ( and decent head phones ! ) .	-1
Cool album cover but ... `` Le Noise '' , gim me a break , like its the first time he has ever done noise before . Some of `` Le Noise '' is fairly interesting noise , perhaps cause it was sheened up a little with the Lanois magic but guitar parts and lyrical ideas are nothing that we hav n't heard from Neil a 100 times before . Is it better than any one of his last 4 albums ? Thats a Yes ... but that does n't mean its a 5 Star album folks . The 5 Star reviews are baffling . I have said it before , if this is a 5 Star album , then what is `` Hawks and Doves '' ..6 Stars ? How about `` Zuma '' ... 8 Stars ? etc , you get the idea . Just because it is marginally better than mediocrity how can we be convinced that its brilliance ? OK , you like it , great , are you going to be magnetically drawn back to it at this time next year ? My guess is no . I listened to it 10 times or so and got tired of it very quickly . I think I need a submarine or something cause I just ca n't get to the right depth to find any signifigant meaning in these lyrics . `` Love and War '' has some beautiful guitar in it , reminiscent of `` Look Out For My Love '' or `` Hey Hey My My '' but do we need a song called `` Love and War '' that reminds us that Neil sings alot about `` Love and War '' . Its short and tight and worth listening to a few times just to see what he is up to , especially after all the Neil/Lanois hype but for me thats where the road ends , case closed on `` Le Noise '' . He has 20 other albums that I will comb through for good music before I return to this .	-1
Just wanted to let the old Neil Young fans know that this is yet another one to pass by . As a 53 yo who grew up listening to Neil Young albums , many of them excellent , I find the bus he is on now is heading toward that huge pile of horse crap in the field . I think Neils voice is best when he is making magic with his guitar , playing a distortion drenched rock and roll soundscape , or a rocken song played loud and hard . The occassional softer song would be fine , but this whiny high pitched stuff is soooooo irritating after awhile , i can not find one song i like on this new one . I will be digging into some of his much older albums , next time i want to hear Neil Young . Sorry to my fellow Neil Young fans , I cant take it any more .	-1
Neil , what happened ? You were so good . I know you are getting older , and your voice is changing , but why not do like Dylan did , and just write some songs that go with your voice.Trying to `` cover up '' your songs with extraneous background `` noise '' , certainly justifies the meaning of your title , however , it does nothing to help carry on your legacy.Neil , please take my advice : Do like Dylan . If your voice has changed with age , then simply write songs that will support your talent , do n't try to `` drown out '' your age-related diminished vocal ability with a blatant cacophony of background `` NOISE '' .	-1
Neil Young just makes too many albums . I have all his albums , but even I get lost when i try to put together a play list of what to listen to . Naturally though there is much more to add from his 70 's and 80 's material with Crazy Horse . And less from the 90 's but even LESS now in the 2000 's . The problem is he shouldnt be putting everything on CD that he thinks of . Going into the studio has become like a hobby for Neil and now you have those Neil heads that will go out and buy any CD he puts out . They all sell around 200,000 copies , the better albums slightly more . The same was true when Todd Rundgren was cranking out albums in the 80 's like crazy and Todd heads would buy 100,000 ( almost every album ) . Neil 's new album is not one of the better ones . His last several have not been the better ones . Le Noise is very short , only 9 songs just under 40 minutes . This was not the case with Prairie Wind or Chrome Dreams II which are his only two decent releases from the last decade . Unlike everyone saying here all his CDs are 40 minutes . The BAD recent albums have been yes , because he has very little to put out ( like I said it 's become a hobby of his ) . Oh sorry I forgot to mention Greendale which was almost 80 minutes and a GREAT CD by the way . See what I mean when Neil has good stuff , it 's substantial to the release . Le Noise is not well recorded either , the guitar is too loud and drowns out the rest of the music . Many of the songs are not very well written musically , just little experimental pieces . Neil has MUCH MUCH better albums than these , unless your a Neil head , pass on this one !	-1
I 've been a Dream Theater fan for around 20 years and I absolutely LOVE James ' voice , so I ordered this CD without even listening to the samples first . Big mistake . The growling ruins this album ( for me , at least ) . I 'd like to imagine how it would be without it , but it 's impossible - when you are getting in the mood of a song , Cookie Monster appears and destroys the it.I like rough voices provided they are still singing : old Metallica , some Megadeth , Pantera from Cowboys and Vulgar , but when all they do is scream and yell - nah , thanks , I can do that myself.And almost the entire album sounds like ... Evanescence ? I do n't know , just not my cup o tea.Only good song is the opening track , the rest ...	-1
I guess this CD would be great if you are a 13 year old girl . Sophomoric teenage angst lyrics sung in a high pitched whiny voice . All these 5 star ratings it 's been given should be a warning . Read carefully who is rating this record . From an adult male point of view this CD is truly atrocious .	-1
I heard Kid Rock sing the title track to this new record on the Country Music Awards the other night . Got ta tell ya , it was painful . For starters , he ca n't sing . He just screams . And his new song , `` Born Free , '' sounds like a bad Springsteen cover that does n't use all the lyrics . The song makes no sense , lyrically , and goes absolutely nowhere musically . I mean , watching and listening to him on the CMA was downright unpleasant . At one point , it appeared that he had forgotten the lyrics or gotten lost in the arrangement . The song just sorta hung there in the wind , like nobody knew what was next . So KR just started yelling , `` Born Free ! '' again , and the trainwreck was mercifully avoided . Hey , I like American Rock music , and Country Rock as well , but this guy is just plain awful .	-1
Using a hook singer to push a single is nothing new in the hip hop genre , some time the results are successful , such as the classic Ghostface Killah & Carl Thomas song Never Be The Same of disastrous the Lloyd Banks & Musiq Soulchild track Addicted from Bank 's second album . Last spring rising hip hop artist B.O.B . had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B. , Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire . On the heels of a possible jail sentence , we now have Bruno Mars debut album . Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot.1 . Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno 's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally . Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ . *** out of ****2 . Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop . I 'm a grown man so this song did n't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good . *** out of ****3 . Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD . The arrangement reminds me of something that Robin Thicke would do . **** out of ****.4 . Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song , I knew I would n't like it . Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999 . * out of ****.5 . The Lazy Song - Listening to this track , I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc . Just as the title implies this is a lazy song . ** out of ****.6 . Marry You - I 'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence . *** out of ****7 . Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time . I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one.8 . Liquor Store Blues ( Feat . Damian Marley ) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it . *** out of ****.9 . Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be . If he does n't go to jail and with a great band backing him , this song will sound great live . ****10 . The Other Side ( Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o.B ) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it 's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing . *** out of ****Overall this is n't a horrible debut album , it is a mediocre album . I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R & B ; album with top notch production , instead he 's given us a Jason Marz sounding album . Bruno has a naturally smooth falsetto voice and while he could n't handle to other falsetto 's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant , the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps . Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he did n't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he 'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg 's .	-1
Only a few of his hits songs on this cd . The second cd he released is a lot better . A little disappointed in this one .	-1
Do n't get me wrong -- Bobby Vee is great . It 's just that this is the biggest collection of dreck I have ever heard . Sometimes it 's best to leave the legacy alone . Out of 61 tracks , there are probably less than a handful of decent songs . Just because Carole King 's name is associated with some of these unreleased tracks does n't qualify them for such . They probably were n't released for good reason . And the bastardization of `` Take Good Care of My Baby '' is truly disgusting . The ballad version originally released on his UA album in the 70s was nice but this alternate version asks the question -- what happened to the melody ? ? ? And you have no idea who produced or arranged anything since the new producers decided to lump all the credits together ( but keeping their 's prominent . ) Shame on them . They even leave off some first names of the writers but keep both names of others . Makes no sense . Most of the songs sound like `` The Night Has a Thousand Eyes '' backwards and sideways . Save your money .	-1
Seriously ATR : This darkened heart and The fall of ideals were great albums ! What happened with Overcome and For we are many ? Stop trying to appeal to the masses and showcase your talent in an original musical piece ! You sound like a rehash of every other generic metalband out there ! I used to look forward to your albums . Wait patiently for that first single to be released . Now , I will just wait and very casually give your next album a `` gander `` because honestly , I am not excited . You are a bunch of poop heads .	-1
If you were born after 1980 and you rated this CD highly , then clearly you know NOTHING about music . May I suggest , therefore , that you forage into your parents ' record collection and see if you ca n't find some DISCO that was recorded before you were born . If they , like you , however , have had their musical sense culturally lobotomized and think this sounds in the least bit respectable , then I suggest you get on your cycle and ride as quick as you can down to your local record shop . When you get there ask the shop-assistant where the DISCO section is and closing your eyes just grab a few CDs that were made in the 1970s - anything should do . When you get home and you start to play these bargain-basement tunes , you will be like 'Hmm that sounds familiar ... is that early Jamiroquai ? ' 'Wow ! Is this Jamiroquai 's new album ? ' 'Man this band sound like Jamiroquai ! Are they a tribute band ? ' Answer : NO ! You have got history WRONG ! Music existed before you were born , in fact most of the good stuff was cut before you were even thought of . You are NOT the centre of the universe , nor the focus of history and your music taste ( like the dreadful CD ) SUCKS !	-1
very sad I really liked this movie and wanted the soundtrack.. however the one song I really wanted `` give into me '' isnt even sung by who does it in movie.. As is with much of the soundtrack.. So I will save my money thank you ... I hope when this comes to dvd they rerelease the soundtrack correctly or do a combo pack with it and movie.. something . the singers are great but we want the MOVIE SOUNDTRACK PEOPLE ! ! ! . this is not it	-1
I loved the movie on the History Channel . The story line based on true facts was engaging . As a backround score the music was good . As an album ... terrible . There are no substance to the songs . One sounds like the next . Kevin Costner is a great actor . He is not a band leader nor an inspiring vocalist . The music as trying to pass as music from the Appalachian mountains is totally unauthentic . This was one of my worst impulse purchases .	-1
Very disappointed . The sound quality on this is very poor . It sounds like a cassette of a sound board . Most of the vocals are distorted as if no one watched the levels . It is not stereo.This is a rip-off ! You can talk importance of the performance but others were doing high quality live sound in 68 , example Cheap Thrlls.Pass on this . I 'm not overstating how poor this is.I got ripped off by Collector Choice before with a Quicksilver they claimed was Happy Trails quallity or exceeded and the recording was n't listenable with guitar tracks so low that it rendered it worthless.This double album is a con job . Avoid . Totally over-hyped con .	-1
Although I have never been the religious sort for any number of reasons , I have always enjoyed the music of Jars of Clay for one simple reason : they write smart songs . Arrangement wise , production wise , musically and lyrically , they are just a group of talented , intellegent songwriters who look at faith with a mixture of doubt and belief that is terribly interesting , and usually terribly creative.Now I am not going to say that their latest project , `` The Shelter '' , is terrible , because it 's not . The basic idea of the record , that of a worship record with an underlying theme of community , is not a bad one . And to go one even further they colloborated with a great list of people from the christian music world , such as former dc Talk man Toby Mac , Brandon Heath , Leigh Nash ( who also appeared on the excellent `` Mirrors and Smoke '' from Jars of Clay 's excellent `` Good Monsters '' record ) , and assorted others . On paper it looks like Jars of Clay would once again succede with a smart record that tweaked the conventions just enough to make it interesting.Well , sadly this time the group fails.As I have said previously , I am not of the religious sort , but a good song is a good song . Sadly most of these just are n't good songs . They lack compelling melodies , interesting production or affecting lyrics . The songs are mostly leaden , with the lyrics following a pretty easy , repetitive quality that might lead to good sing alongs in church , but outside of that community will probably not warrent more than a few passing listens.The one song that rises against the trent is the title track , where a comforting message , beautiful harmonies and a vaguely Peter Gabriel-ian vocal melody from Toby Mac ( which is interesting when you consider that his former bandmate Kevin Max has spent a large protion of his solo career miming the career of Gabriel , but whatever ) , add up to a truly memorable song , and easily one of their best songs.I give this record two stars because it 's not miserable , or terrible , but rather background noise . It exists , and will continue to do so , but I ca n't see many people going back to it more than a few times . Jars of Clay made a decent worship sort of record a few years back called `` Redemption Songs '' that is far superior to this . You 'd be better off sticking with that one and letting `` The Shelter '' pass you by .	-1
When I first heard the name Wacka Flacka Flame I thought it was a joke . He had one small radio hit with `` O Lets Do It '' and I thought well that 's it . Then over the summer he came strong with `` Hard In The Paint '' . Still did n't know it was him . By time `` No Hands '' was everywhere on the radio , I did n't know if it was his single or Wale 's ( I hoped it was Wale 's track ) When I heard his album title was `` Flockaveli '' I thought `` Hell Nah '' . Who is this young cat with no lyrics using the great Tupac 's name to get more publicity ? So of course it made me even more skeptical.The first thing I noticed was how much the beats sound like Rick Ross 's B.M.F . Then I found out that this album was produced by young producer Lex Luger ( who also produced Ross 's B.M.F & MC Hammer ) . His work is very impressive . The hardcore , bass thumping beats on `` Bustin ' At ` Em '' & the summer street banger `` Hard In The Paint '' remind me of a young Lil ' Jon . His beats lay the perfect background , too bad Flame is a horrible lyricist . I have n't heard a rapper say his name so much in a song since Mike Jones . His rhymes are cartoonish . It does n't take a musical genius to rhyme `` Flame '' & `` Mane '' . ( You can see the huge lyrical gap between Flame and Wale on `` No Hands '' ) The song titles tell you everything you need to know about the song . `` G Check '' , `` Bang '' & `` Smoke , Drank '' , lets you know there is nothing intelligent being said in these songs.Not since Young Jeezy 's `` Thug Motivation 101 '' , has a true gangsta , hardcore rap album came out . Theres no sing-along hooks , no sappy love songs & no auto tune . Just pure adrenaline rush beats that will keep your head bobbing for days . But you ca n't live off beats alone . You have to say something and that 's where Flame fails miserably . For the younger generation who do n't care about lyrics this will be their album of the year . But for the generation who grew up listening to the real Makaveli , this album will annoy you by the tenth track .	-1
Other than the bluesy stomper `` Father 's Son '' ( which carries some deliberate/ maybe not deliberate meaning since George Harrison 's son Dhani is in this group ) I found this album to be pretty forgettable . I barely made it all the way through it once .	-1
Take the offspring of a well known person and when new product is released it 's BIG news . Does n't matter if it 's any good or not as the attachment of sentiment is there or the hope of past memories to a prior time and place will somehow `` live '' in the here and now.Honestly this is first takes of a demo tape . I do stress FIRST takes . There is no great instrumentation to drive the songs . No polish , no pizazz , nothing pretty . But what can you expect from first takes of a creation of something new ? Rather than unleash this in it 's current format it would have been interesting to see what would have happened if the demos were taken and worked on hashing them out to a higher musical ilk.I suppose standards are lowered these days . And that is unfortunate . Perhaps they can get together again to take the demos and hash it out to a more palatable form . And perhaps they can even offer to accept copies of this format in trade for what should have been done in the first place . That would be the merciful thing to do in this case.File under overly overblown & hyped , but the emperor is wearing not a stitch of clothing .	-1
Shakira is back with a new album , ` Sale El Sol ' and if you 've been unimpressed with her past few efforts ( mainly the lackluster ` She Wolf '' album ) then you should probably give this album a try . It 's back to the basics for Shakira : no Lil Wayne collaborations , no Timbaland-produced hip hop tracks and for the most part , no real breakout tracks to speak of . While I applaud Shakira for realizing that her quest to remain relevant in the U.S. was killing her music , I caution her for going to such an extreme as ` Sale El Sol ' feels . It 's a timid , safe , sleepy album . Missing from the album is that edgy , a times uninhibited and suggestive , fun Shakira that caught the world 's attention with `` Whatever , Whenever '' and she 's replaced with a rather sterilized version of that artist.The Good : What works best on 'Sale El Sol ' is that Shakira does n't seem to be concerned with making an album just for the U.S. as happened with 'She Wolf ' . Sure , she sings a few tracks in English but this album is really made for an international , non-English speaking world and that fact alone makes this musical effort a bit stronger than her last few outtings . 'Sale El Sol ' plays a lot with wordly sounds and genres of music - you have a lot of Spanish-influences , a little reggae-ton , a dash of hip-hop and a lot of rock . The tracks that work best are the ballads and down tempo tracks that are sung in complete Spanish . These are the tracks that feature Shakira at her best - sure , those who do n't speak or know Spanish may feel a bit loss in the lyrics but you are able to connect with her emotions and the sentiment that she exudes through her delivery of the lyrics . Those tracks include `` Antes de las Seis '' , `` Rabiosa '' , and `` Devoci & oacute ; n '' and to me are among the best tracks she 's done in a long while . Again , what I liked about 'Sale El Sol ' is that its target audience is n't as limited to the U.S. as 'She Wolf ' was and it has an encompassing feeling with its lyrics , genres of music and overall vibe.The Bad : There are things I really like about this album but a lot more that I 'm just not crazy about . I 'm actually glad Shakira attempted to ditch her efforts to break into , or stay relevant , in the United States . That being said , 'Sale El Sol ' feels somewhat timid and reserved . It feels like she 's responding to her declining successes in the U.S. with an album meant to remind the world of her better days but in doing so some of her edge , spontaneity , creativity and that sexual prowess that she tends to exude in her music was lost as well . A lot of the music on this album feels watered down , weak and forgettable . Usually there 's at least one or two tracks that stands out as being potential big hits but I really do n't see any of the tracks on this release doing much for her career . The album being mostly in Spanish , while a good creative choice , feels a bit alienating to those who do n't speak Spanish . I found myself mostly bored with a lot of the tracks and feeling as if many of the songs had a similar sound to them . However , I 've heard from others who do know Spanish that they feel this is probably her best effort yet and that the lyrics are the sharpest they 've been in a while and passionately written . So , depending on your knowledge of Spanish , I think you 'll either really enjoy this release or it 'll feel somewhat off-putting . It did n't help that as usual a few of the tracks are actually the same track , simply done in another language . To me , she should have done either an all Spanish album or done more English . The Spanish/English tracks for the most part were the weakest tracks but those that were all Spanish with no `` translation '' track were stronger , more compelling and better produced.In all , Eh . Personally , I really expected a lot based on `` Loca '' but found the album to just feel too reserved and safe for Shakira 's usual standards . I did n't hear any real stand-out , billboard 100-worthy tracks on 'Sale El Sol ' and that 's not necessarily bad . She seems to have taken a bold decision in making an album that 's a bit understated and takes her back to her roots . Still , I was hoping for something compelling and interesting but after a few listens ca n't bring myself to replay many of these tracks.Listen to These : `` Antes de las Seis '' , `` Rabiosa '' , `` Devoci & oacute ; n '' .	-1
Major disappointment again from the world 's greatest voice , I have to say that a couple of songs are not extremely bad ( Sale el sol is tolerable ) , but the album overall is a pain to listen to , what a departure from `` Pies Descalzos '' , where are you , the Shakira of 1996 ? ! ? !	-1
