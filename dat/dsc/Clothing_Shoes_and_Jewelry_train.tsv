I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter for dance class , she wore it today for the first time and the teacher thought it was adorable . I bought this to go with a light blue long sleeve leotard and was happy the colors matched up great . Price was very good too since some of these go for over $ 15.00 dollars .	1
What can I say ... my daughters have it in orange , black , white and pink and I am thinking to buy for they the fuccia one . It is a very good way for exalt a dancer outfit : great colors , comfortable , looks great , easy to wear , durables and little girls love it . I think it is a great buy for costumer and play too .	1
I received this today and I 'm not a fan of it but my daughter is I thought it would be puffier as it looks in the pic but it 's not and the one they sent me is pink underneath and the waist band is pink which is not what I wanted due to the fact she already had the sandals she was gon na wear with it now I got ta find another pair of sandals , ima just keep it cuz she likes it .	1
Bought this as a backup to the regular ballet outfit my daughter has to wear . So far , she 's using it to play out her Cinderella dreams but I am sure we 'll be able to use it for a recital sometime soon . The quality is just fine for the price we paid . I was not expecting a designer skirt for this price and got exactly what I paid for .	1
Great tutu for a great price . It is n't a & # 34 ; full & # 34 ; or high quality skirt , but it is perfect for my daughter to wear over leggings for her little outfits .	1
My daughter liked this , and it with her costume , but she would have liked it to be a bit fuller .	1
For what I paid for two tutus is unbeatable anywhere ! I ordered a pink and turquios and they are vibrant and beautiful ! The tutu is very full ! Princess style ! Not cheaply made ! Not cheap materia ! Obviously someone made these with love and care ! I paid less than 7 bucks for a tutu I and I feel proud of my self for researching to the point of finding gold ! Recommend 2-6 years ! My daughter is two ! Wears size 4t and this skirt ( one size ) fit perfect and will probaly be able to accommodate her quickly growing waist for some time !	1
My daughter has worn this skirt almost every day since she received it and it 's even been through the washer along with the other clothes . It 's amazing quality ! She fits a 4T and it 's just above her knee , and has a little bit of growing room , although I 'm not so sure as much as others are saying . But considering how often she wears it , I 'm not worried ! ; )	1
Purchased this tutu for my granddaughter 's first birthday . It fit nicely with room to grow in . I 'm very please with it and will purchase more in varying colors in the future .	1
Full and well stitched . This tutu is a beautiful purple color that looks just like the picture . It looks just adorable on our little fairy .	1
Perfect for my budding grand daughter ballerina ! Beautiful vibrant color . Fits great and easy to clean ! I bought several more colors !	1
Nice and puffy tutu skirt . I would recommend this for girls under 10 yr. old . It will be too short and small for older girls .	1
Bought this for my niece as part of her fairy outfit . She loves it and wears it all the time . Well made for the price .	1
My 4 year old daughter always wants to play dress up . I bought this for her for Christmas and she never wanted to take it off . It is almost a year later and she still has it ! ! It was well worth the money and has held up this long with nothing wrong with it ! ! I would recommend it	1
Prompt delivery , and it is exactly as described . The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I have n't washed it yet- so I do n't know how it will hold up ... Other than that my little girl LOVES her tutus ( we got one in light pink also ) , especially spinning and running in them : ) She 's on the little side , so my concern was that it would be too big , but the fit is perfect ! The elastic waist will expand with her as she grows .	1
The minute I saw this my heart skipped a beat . What a nice case to sort my collection . I love all the compartments and the layout too . You will love this color too . If this is a gift do not hesitate . It will please even the most fussy , as I am . The price is fair if you check around as I did . Seems well made too . It is suitable for an adult though . Not meant as a toy . This is for serious jewelry lover 's . Buy it ... ..	1
Love this Jewelry Box so well put together holds plendy ... Love the pink & looks so nice on my vanity .	1
Really nice box , a bit cheaply made . It is made of carboard with pleather . Although the organization for all your jewelry is great , I 'm not so sure how it will stand up to my tween daughter 's use . Every inch is useable space for jewelry & very compact , which is a nice feature .	1
Since learning a language from software is not exactly the same as learning a language from going to live in the country itself , I suggest picking up the Rosetta Stone software 1 level at a time , like this French level 1 . That way you know if you are able to learn from the software , before investing even more money into it . Since total immersion into another country to learn is not always an option , Rosetta Stone it the next best thing . While a class environment might work better for some , there 's not always time for that either . Sometimes there 's just enough time on the weekends , or in the evenings after work to get a few hours of studying in . Or maybe you just do n't want to sit in a school like classroom , trying to learn from an instructor . That 's where Rosetta Stone comes in.Rosetta Stone tries to be more than just a computer program . Instead it 's interactive , and is a cross between software and an at-home classroom Spanish lesson . The software comes with a headset and microphone so that while you are learning , you also speak into the headset and respond to questions . The software helps one learn how to pronounce the words and practice what you 've learned to help retain it . Unlike a classroom environment , you can work at this at your own pace , which I appreciate . When I took a Spanish class , some of the students flew ahead of me , while the rest of us were just trying to keep up . Rosetta Stone lets a person learn at the pace they learn at ( fast or slow ) so they do n't end up missing anything along the way . I 'm more comfortable learning from the program as well , than in front of a group of strangers .While going to France and living there for a while is probably the easiest and fastest way to learn French , Rosetta Stone is the next best thing , and a more realistic option for most people .	1
The first question was which computers to install this program - Rosetta Stone has a two seat minimum . I ended up putting the 2nd installation on a laptop , expecting to use the program in other locations . However , Rosetta Stone 's immersion method feels too intensive to me for use in most places away from home . Installation was easy enough even though the program got stuck a couple of times along the way . The gear , headset with microphone , is sufficient.Pros : * For total immersion-type instruction without the benefit of communicating with other people , this seemed very good . * The voice recognition software is impressive . I was able to immediately begin speaking and progressed to the second level of difficulty fairly quickly . There are plenty of exercises and repetition , and this will surely help in many ways including pronunciation . * There are learning sessions in this software to allow speaking with native French speakers . *For me as an individual , this is a better way to learn than a formal classroom.Cons : * The limitation in the number of seats ( 2 ) . This was n't a problem for me yet it 's something to know about . * Lack of matching supplemental physical material such as index cards with conjugations and grammatical rules . I feel the need for this and can source it out separately , but again I prefer to learn outside a formal classroom . * Lack of simple visuals to help with identifying grammatical patterns .	1
Okay , I admit it . I 'm one of the millions of Americans that massively struggles with any language either than English . I have recently returned to college to finish out my Bachelors . The university I 'm enrolled in requires two years of a foreign language . Ugh . Kill me . Kill me now . BUT with using Rosetta , I was not only able to get through my class without sounding and feeling like an idiot , but I actually got A 's ! ! I never thought that was a possibility . I 'm not ready to jet off to France or anything but I 'm not a complete moron any more either . I 'm calling that a huge success . Once this whole bachelors things is under my belt , I will be back to pick up the next level ! !	1
I really enjoy the Rosetta Stone software ; it 's easy and fun to use . The Rosetta Stone `` dynamic immersion '' method is different than traditional methods where you see a word in English and then see a word in the new language to memorize . L ' & eacute ; tude du franais est r & eacute ; ellement amusement et facile !	1
I 've never had french , learned french , or know anything about French . Now , however , I feel like I could do OK with a quick trip and to get around conversationally . Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning , but it 's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros : - Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept , rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons : - Does n't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 does n't contain a whole lot- It 's obviously pretty expensive . I guess if you 're *really* interested , it 's worth it.For it 's purpose , it is almost perfect software . You will feel confident with the basics after this .	1
I have had this product for a while to evaluate because I have so enjoyed the format and the refresher course . I have 7 years of high school and college French but like so many Americans , I never learned to speak or aurally interpret native speech properly . I found the visual and sound exercises extremely helpful and enjoyable . I have been through the entire course multiple times and found that I was able to put a DVD on `` French '' and actually understand much of what being said . I 'm not sure I 'd learn formal French grammar this way but I do n't think that is the point of the course.I was disappointed that I could not get the speech recognition microphone function to work despite many weeks of attempts , use of customer service and other techie help . My computer is quite up to the task and so was I but I was never able to get that working . Even so , the parts of the course I was able to access were very enjoyable and enhanced my French skills . Merci ! Based upon this experience , I 'd definitely consider buying the next course if I could be assured the voice recognition piece would work .	1
Bring French to life ! If your child is taking their first year of French or you are ready to head off on vacation and want to learn the language yourself , Rosetta Stone is a great learning tool for you both ! Version 4 comes with the learning lessons , headset with mic , app to use with your iPhone or iPod Touch for on the go learning and access to a virtual community online for lessions , games and chat ! I really do n't think you can ask for more from a product.My only regret is that I did n't know about this product sooner ! I certainly would have bought it for each one of my children throughout their schooling ! What a GREAT product for homeschooling as well !	1
I got this product for my sister who enjoyed taking 4 years of French in high school . Here is what she had to say about the product : > > > THIS IS AMAZING ! I loved working with this product ! I picked up on the words and phrases very quickly , and it was fun to do . They show you pictures and then show you the French word , pronounce it for you , and then you say it . It reviews the same things in different ways so practicing the words is not dry and boring . You can do it on your time and at your own pace . It also teaches you the four areas of language - speaking , listening , reading and writing . It offers activities that have you practice a combination of skills ( reading and writing over listening and speaking ) , as well as lessons that focus on just one of the skills . I would highly recommend this product to my fellow peers ! I am excited to try French Level 2 and learn even more ! & lt ; & lt ; & lt ; I asked her if she had tried any other language learning products that she could compare it to and she said she had not , but she was very happy with this .	1
If you really need to learn a new language , and learn it fast , Rosetta Stone is the way . I 've taken college/high school and even junior high classes and learned . I took a Berlitz course and learned . But by far , the fastest way to a new language - and outside of taking one as a kid in public school - the cheapest way , too , is Rosetta Stone.No , I do n't work for them or even get to date that spokeswoman in the tight blue dress . But I do love learning languages and I really like RS . Lots of options to learn so you wo n't get bored . Very little of the repeat-after-me stuff from normal classes . And actual fun lessons . Plus iphone apps and internet based learning . They have the bases covered.Ok , what I do n't like - the complexity of the install with all the verifications and such . I understand the need to prevent software theft . It seems like , as usual , the legitimate purchasers end up paying the price ( $ and install-wise ) for the people that do n't . Arg ! I 'm not sure how easy/hard it would be to install it on two machines or even how hard a reinstall would be should you need to move to a new computer , but I dread finding out ! That little caveat aside - and it only pertains to installing the one time - this is a TERRIFIC product . It ai n't cheap , but real learning seldom is . And the benefits to you are huge .	1
Never having studied Italian before , and never having used Rosetta Stone before , I was definitely excited to give it a go and find out what all the hype was about.I went through the whole lesson over the course of a couple of months , spending only about a day or two a week on it.In the end , I think it was a smart system , one that has specific advantages , but also marked disadvantages.POSITIVES : +++ IMMERSION TECHNIQUE -there is no English . you will only see pictures and hear Italian . This means you 'll learn more effectively , as your brain is forced to make certain connections on its own . Additionally , when you see pictures , for example , of a `` male '' , the picture will be different each time : one time might be a young boy , and then it might be an old man , then a young man , and so on ... and the first time you see the picture you might think it is a boy , but when the second picture pops up you realize that the word must mean something else , and you relate the two , and pick the commonality . Anyway , this is a hard example , and it is simpler than this , but the idea is that you see different pictures representing each word , each time.++ WELL DESIGNED/VARIED -there are multiple modules which are scattered throughout -listening & comprehension , reading , pronunciation , typing , and so on . It is impressive.++ GOOD REVIEWS -when I finished a section I was happy to find out that many of the concepts came back -- not right away , but later when they were n't the freshest in my mind -- this meant I had to remember it , and basically memorized it through this recall . I thought Rosetta Stone did a great job bringing up concepts and reminding me of the concepts later on . I did not feel the need to review previous lessons ... ++ PAINLESS . This system is about as fun ( can I say that ? ) and as painless as a computer aided language learning system can get.NEGATIVES : -- - PRICE , PRICE , PRICE -for most people the $ 200 cost for a single lesson ( less as you buy more modules ) is really too high . Yes I know these things cost money , and I know they are better than other systems , but the pricing suggests that they are worried you wo n't like it , and you 'll feel pressured to continue because you spent so much , OR , they are trying to convince you to pay only a few hundred more to get the whole set . I 'd argue they 'd be better off dropping the price in half for the first module , and then I 'd recommend it more . ( And give me some sort of discount if I buy lesson 2 separately . I am not going to buy multiple modules without buying the first one , and testing it out . $ 500 for the set is too much of a committment without giving it a shot first . ) - READING EXERCISES ARE BUGGY SOMETIMES -I have spent 5 minutes ( unsuccessfully ) on several sections where I am supposed to say just one syllable , and the voice recognition system fails . I mean , I KNOW what I am hearing , I have studied 4 languages , have good pronunciation , and I ca n't for the life of me get the computer to believe I said `` PO '' ( for example ) instead of something unrecognizable . It was very frustrating , as I tried to enunciate it every way imaginable , with no luck . Yet , when It was a multi-syllabic word ( with the same syllable ) the computer had no problem.- NO DICTIONARY -yes , I know this is n't part of their system , but it would have been nice to have a dictionary so that I could learn some additional words on my own . ( Sometimes you just do n't want to wait to lesson 5 to learn numbers , for example ... ) But probably the biggest criticism is that this program is no substitute for classroom participation . ( Yes , I know that there are some online modules that you can pay more for , but I was n't interested in paying any more ... ) My wife was taking classroom Italian at the same time I was doing this system , and we would compare experiences . One thing I noticed is that the `` putting-sentences-together-on-my-own-and-saying-them '' part of Rosetta Stone , was one of the weaker sections . She , on the other hand , got many opportunities to practice . Mine was more about listening and comprehension.Overall , if classroom Italian really is n't an option for you , because you do n't have the time or you just do n't like classrooms , AND you have a lot of money to spend , then I 'd say this is a good deal . ( If I were forced to move overseas I would definitely invest in the system . ) But , if you are a starving student , then you 're better off looking for other books and CDs from the library before trying this system.Recommended , but with reservations .	1
Although I have n't kept up with the lessons as I should have , I have learned a lot of Italian with only the first level . I spoke some dialect , but have conjugation issues ! This is most assuredly the best program I 've used to learn Italian . I have the older version too , and I like the new audio-visual matching ; it 's different from the older version and moves a lot faster.With this version , you can move at your own pace a lot easier , and see your mistakes sooner , which is helpful.Not only does this have visual learning , and learning by audio , but also by speaking , and comparing your pronunciation to that of a native speaker , which I think is the most helpful part of the software . The way the teaching of the language is set up , is I believe , the closest to learning it naturally with native speakers . I highly recommend this software ... grazie !	1
I love Rosetta Stone it is easy to use in a few quick lessons you are speaking Italian . I like how the lessons are short and easy to finish.i like the pictures I ca n't wait to go to Italy .	1
Install Machine : Intel iMac 3.06 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo , 4 GB DDR3 RAM , OS 10.6.6Install was smooth and easy . No hangups . It immediately asked if I wanted to update after I installed . It was about a 4 MB update and downloaded/installed quickly . Need admin privileges to install software . Total install time with level 1 language pack was maybe 20 minutes or less ( there is a lot of data copied to the PC ) .Launching the software was straightforward and launching into the first lesson was easy . The only issue I had was getting the included microphone/headset to work right . It kept telling me to say `` 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 '' into the microphone , but it kept saying it could n't configure the microphone . I finally made some random noise into the mic and it worked fine . In the lessons the mic worked fine.In the first lesson it was obvious what needed to be done . I was slightly disappointed that the headset headphones did not play the audio , and instead the computer speakers played the audio , so why do I need a headset for just the microphone ? Oh well , no big deal , just different.I did the first lesson with my 5 year old son , and he enjoyed it a great deal too . He quickly picked up what he needed to do for each lesson , but as a downside many of the lessons show only four pictures , so you can just start clicking on boxes until you get it right ( an issue for my son ) .One thing I appreciated is the first lesson had absolutely no English . It was only images and Italian words and speaking . This is a better way to learn to make the association of the foreign word to the object instead of translating it in your head through your native tongue first.Maybe being level 1 it is easier on me , but I found I could be pretty far off in pronunciation and it would still accept my spoken words . However , it is still nice to have some feedback if what your saying is close to correct , and this software provides that.I think this software is excellent , but the price of entry is high . However , how much would it cost to take a foreign language class ? The textbook would probably cost at least 1/3rd what this software would cost . So given the high price , I still think this is a good buy if you are a good solo learner . Great for those who do n't have time to take an instructor lead course .	1
Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1Rosetta Stone Italiano Level 1 is easy to install and use . The included instructions are simple and straightforward . Activation required 2 tries , but it appears the code is only valid for 3 months so I suspect online access may be terminated after 3 months but the software should still continue to work.The pace starts off slow , but within the early portion of Unit 1 , the vocabulary starts to pick up rather quickly . Since I am not a language expert , I had a hard time keeping up initially because different tenses of words , or the plural , were thrown in . Rosetta Stone relies on photographs to help you out , which is quite useful but I could not get a good grasp of the language to actually use it in normal speech . Once you start getting used to the phrases , the software begins to kick it up by throwing in more words . Unfortunately , like other users , the phrases are too simple for use in everyday conversation.The Level 1 kit includes a USB headset with a microphone to allow you to speak the phrases using the built-in speech recognition . This helps with pronunciation , although I found that it will disable my main audio and I have to switch back and forth . This is n't a big deal for most people , and there 's no easy workaround.The box advertises that many Government agencies use Rosetta Stone , like the US Army and State Department . There certainly is value in the Rosetta Stone software helping Soldiers or agents learn a foreign language in the shortest time possible , but I felt it should focus on more useful phrases . 45 minutes of repeating various forms of `` Boys eating '' , or `` girls running '' are not phrases that have much tactical value when you 're visiting or operating in a different country.Overall : 4/5 stars	1
I was prepared to be disappointed with Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 , the first Rosetta Stone I 've tried . It was the voice recognition I was leery of . Though I 've studied two languages through classes , I have no aptitude for speaking languages at all . The languages I 'm most familiar with are the Teutonic/Germanic gutteral sounding languages ; I have such problems with the romance languages . I married into a Portuguese-American family and they still howl with laughter when , after 21 years , I attempt the language.In addition , I 've broken my ear drums a couple times , and have suffered loss of hearing as a result ( compounded , could be , by age ! ) .I am very happy to say that I have had no problem hearing or understanding the Rosetta program . The included headphone/microphone combo fits comfortably and I forget it 's on while going through a lesson . In addition , I 've only had a couple times where I had to repeat a phrase because it was so off-base the voice recognition program did n't think it would pass as Italian . Now , granted , this may be because the bar is set really low for how authentically I speak Italian ; but I would think that with a program teaching Italian as a second language , it would have to be . For most people , it is n't teaching you how to pass as Italian , it 's teaching you how to pass IN Italian . And , if the voice recognition program was too fussy , I would get discouraged and just throw it away.Lessons start out with pronunciation , one syllable at a time , spoken and written . Then vocabulary , spoken and written . Then phrases . Total immersion , everything is shown on the screen in Italian and spoken in the program in Italian . Occasionally , you have to type in the answer to a question , rather than say the answer . Everything is accompanied by photos . So your learning is reinforced in three ways : you hear the phrase spoken , you see the phrase written , and you see a photo illustrating each phrase ( a boy running , boys running ) . In later lessons you dive into conversations with full sentences.Your Main Menu shows you which lessons you 've completed . Based on that , you can access Rosetta Studio , which is practice with real people . Your main menu will tell you if any Rosetta Studio sessions are available at any point in time . You schedule a session and you and other students take part in a session lead by a native Italian speaker.You get a two-disc CD set for additional practice when you 're not on the computer . I have used mine in the car , only occasionally feeling silly for `` talking to myself '' . There 's no voice recognition , of course . You are only repeating what is said on the CD . The CD is divided into the same chapters as in the computer program , and each chapter starts with pronunciation , then vocabulary and phrases . Good reinforcement , though , I have to concentrate so hard on what is being said on the CD , that it 's a little distracting for driving.If you have an iPhone or another iTouch device , you can download a mini-version of the computer program , including photos . I have n't tried that as my phone is a dinosaur.Included with your program is three months access to Rosetta World OnLine . I have n't tried this yet . From what I understand , after you 've completed each chapter on the computer program , you are told how many games , stories and activities are available to you on the OnLine center . You can play individual games , or games with other players ( learners ) logged in , or with a native Italian speaker . Unfortunately , Rosetta World OnLine is only available 8am - 8 pm for me in Pacific Standard Time zone . Many times I 've sat down at the computer after the kids are in bed , and then it 's too late . If you 're in the Eastern U.S. , it 's available from 11 am to 11 pm . After the three month introductory offer is over , you pay a fee , but I actually ca n't find what the fee will be.Incidentally , Rosetta Stone offers a six-month unconditional money-back gurantee , but according to their website , you have to order it direct from Rosetta Stone . I only checked the price for Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 and as of writing this review , the price is the same as the price on amazon.I am using this program on a PC XP with no problems .	1
I actually have used the Rosetta Stone Spanish Level 1 & 2 and found it great in terms of learning the language . At first , the Rosetta Stone method seems harder because you associate pictures with words and phrases but their whole premise is that is how you first learned a language by seeing something and then associating the word with that object or action . It is way better than pure memorization ! I have gone through several lessons and I am picking it up rather quickly as I have a background in Spanish . Overall a great way to learn a new language !	1
I 've been using this for a few weeks . Previously , my Italian was limited to stuff I 'd see on `` The Godfather '' and a few foods . I 'm a bit better now , and eager to see what the further levels of Rosetta Stone look like . Rosetta Stone is no substitute for deep immersion learning like living there , but it 's pretty useful as a tool to learn the basics.Pros : - Builds a LOT of vocabulary quickly- Helps understand what words mean by associating them with a concept , rather than translating- Internet community is pretty cool.Cons : - Does n't focus on grammar at all- Level 1 does n't contain a whole lot- It 's obviously pretty expensive . I guess if you 're *really* interested , it 's worth it.For it 's purpose , it is almost perfect software . You will feel confident with the basics after this .	1
I 've had the opportunity to review several Rosetta Stone language software programs and have found them all to be quite good . They all seem to follow the same basic structure which I find to be very helpful in acquiring language skills , and in this case , the basics of Italian language . I 've always wanted to know more about the Italian language but am not motivated to try and become fluent . Level One for me , is just right . However , if you are wanting to learn Italian in depth please do n't just purchase Level One since it only takes you through some basic elementary language skills.No English is spoken , only Italian and I 'm given a lot of visual selections from which to choose the action that represents what I 'm hearing in Italian . I seem to do fairly well having both audio AND a visual component to learning a new language . Also , I like being able to speak my new Italian words into the included microphone and have the program correct my speech mistakes . I have n't tried the 3 month on-line service where you can speak with a native speaker ( tutor ) , maybe I would if I were trying to learn the language on a deeper level , but for me I 'm happy with just the program itself . After the 3 months are over you have to pay a fee and I do n't like paying fees.I feel fairly confident that anyone who applies themselves regularly to any Rosetta Stone language program will learn a lot of the language being studied . I find it to be a very natural way to learn a language . Of course it would be best to be totally immersed in the Italian culture to learn it , but for those of us who do n't have that option I think Rosetta Stone does a good job as a cultural immersion substitute .	1
I wanted a refresher course in Italian so I ordered this Rosetta Stone Italiano - Level 1 . This package is certainly unlike any other language learning program I have run across and even with brief usage , has yielded great results . Although I have no major complaints with the program itself , the price factor did influence my rating.If you have issues with installing the software , I would check to make sure your pc has the latest version of software installed . For example , Windows XP requires Service Pack 3 for this language software to work properly and Vista needs SP2 . It is easy enough to download the latest service pack with Windows but I hear mac users have more problems . If you have an older pc , you really need to check the hardware requirements . Also note that you must have broadband service to access all the features.The box includes a quick start booklet , installation cds , software cds , headset , user agreement booklet , keyboard stickers to convert for Italian usage and online services . The quick start guide is important to read first and provides support online or by telephone ( called about getting it onto my iPhone and received US based help without going through a phone maze ) . The software installed easily on Windows 7 as did the included headset via usb port . The global end user license agreement booklet was printed in microscopic print so I have my fingers crossed it is the usual stuff since I could not find a magnifying glass to read it . The stickers to place over the keyboard to convert it for Italian usage might prove problematic . I had an extra keyboard that I placed the stickers on and could switch to when using this software . I do n't know if you would want this on your keyboard all the time and peeling it on and off does not seem ideal . I think you could get away without using the stickers.This software helps with pronunciation ( the headset has a microphone ) , builds vocabulary and phrases , and teaches simple conversation . The software has 4 lessons in each unit covering : basics ( unit 1 ) , greetings and introduction ( unit 2 ) , work and school ( unit 3 ) and shopping ( unit 4 ) . Rosetta Stone advertises a learning application for your iPhone or iPod Touch but an account with Rosetta Stone 's online services is required . Although the box states it includes free online features , they are free for three months only . There is a $ 25 monthly fee or a $ 149 fee for 15 months for online services after the trial period . The 3 month trial starts the moment you activate your online account and you must be at least 13 to create an account . I strongly suggest you use the software only and then use the online services to get the most out of this software . The online services are great and allow you to access online tutors , games , and an online community to practice your Italian . I really liked the options provided online but wished I had activated the free trial after I had gone through the lessons to get more out of it . It 's hard to converse or play simple games when you are just starting to learn Italian.Overall , this is a great tool to learn Italian if you can afford the hefty price tag . For the same price you might be able to audit an Italian course at a local school but this software is more convenient and provides more personalized service . Using this language software in tandem with its online services is almost as good as a private tutor at a lower cost . I do n't think I will continue with the online services given this is just a hobby for me but if you urgently needed to learn Italian , this would be worth the price . I consider having friendly customer service available by phone a big plus .	1
I got Rosetta Stone Italian Level 1 a few months prior to a vacation in Rome , mainly because the last time my wife and I visited Italy , we went without knowing any Italian and all ... and that made for some frustration.I speak Japanese and some Spanish , so I am familiar with the challenges involved in learning a new language . However , Rosetta Stone made it easy and fun to learn very basic Italian . This allowed me to keep the travel book with frequently used phrases in my pocket when asking questions at shops and for directions , mainly.The main problem was once I asked in Italian the person usually would speak to me in Italian and I had to confess , in Italian , that I only knew a very little Italian . So at least they could understand what I was able to say ! Thanks to Rosetta Stone I was comfortable not only listening but also speaking Italian because I had so much practice doing both.I 'd give yourself at least 2-3 months before trying this in-country , but the pace in which you learn is really up to you . There are so many options that I did n't use ... like the online lessons , the games , the community . I just did n't have the time for those and found the basic tutorials quite sufficient ( and excellent ) but it 's great to have those options .	1
ROSETTA STONE is famous for teaching language the way little children learn language ... naturally , quickly , without studying verb declention charts , memorizing vocabulary lists , or navagating grammatical oddities . However , there is an obvious problem with this philosophy that ROSETTA STONE has based their teaching method upon . The people who buy and learn from ROSETTA STONE are NOT 3-5 year old children . Any Linguist will tell you , children are hard wired to learn grammer , and to speak perfectly their native language . As we age , the ability to speak certain sounds disappears , and the ability to learn certain types of grammer also disappears . Once a child is past that stage of absorbing grammerical rules naturally , or pronouncing certain native sounds , the door shuts . You can still learn , but not perfectly . This is why a russian who learns english , will NEVER understand exactly how to use definative articles . Also , this is why Russian constanant clusters are impossible to pronounce for English speakers . There are almost NO exceptions to this , except for language savants i suppose.However , as far as learning language in a natural way , on your own , ROSETTA STONE is the best you can do . As anyone knows who 's studied foreign languages in high school or college , you start with learning to pronounce the alphabet . Then , you learn the most common words , along with the way basic verbs ( TO BE , TO HAVE , TO KNOW , etc ) are conjugated , how the nouns and adjectives interact , etc . ROSETTA STONE turns that learning process on its head , and the center of its do-it-yourself language class , is the SPEACH RECOGNITION system . The RS Kit comes with alphabet letters for your computer keyboard ( in case your target language has a different alphabet , than the English alphabet ) , and the computer files , plus four CDs to pracitice pronounciation when away from the computer . Also , the buyer recieves in the box , this headset w/microphone that plugs into the USB port of your computer . ( plus a few simple instructions to get started . ) Unlike the oldest voice recognition programs from a decade ago , this headset just sets the volumn level , and you are ready to go . Instead of learning to pronounce the alphabet , you just learn to speak the first words a baby might speak ... '' cat , run , read , boy , girl , hello , 1,2,3,4,5,6 '' , stuff like that . Rosetta Stone assumes you will learn the pronounciation rules automatically , `` BY EAR '' . First , not everybody CAN learn strickly by ear . Some musicians can hear a song , and they KNOW every chord they heard , and the notes , and can reproduce them instantly , because they can PLAY MUSIC BY EAR . Other musicians need to learn what notes belong where on the instrument , and they need sheet music , and chord theory . WHY ? Because some people are more right brain , others more left brain ... maybe some people HEAR better , and others analyse better . So , if you are trying to pronounce the Italian word `` ZIA '' ( Aunt ) , you will never GUESS it should sound like TSEE-ah . When English speakers see a `` Z '' , they will not pronouce `` TS '' , as in German , Russian , Italian , etc . SINCE ROSETTA STONE DOESNT TELL YOU WHAT THE ITALIAN `` Z '' OUGHT TO SOUND LIKE , you need to guess . THis is when the ROSETTA STONE voice recognition just doesnt work . You might hear TSEE-a , but if you see `` ZIA '' , your brain will think it 's hearing what it 's used to hearing -- '' ZEE-ah '' , and that 's what you will say . AND , the voice recognistion WONT recognise the correct pronounciation . Likewise , Italian has other sounds not at all like English , and unless you have some kind of heads up on how each letter SHOULD sound , you may never get close to the correct sound . I have a good ear . But i could n't hear that Italian has a more dental sounding `` D '' than english . I didnt know the other oddities associated with pronouncing the Italian language . At times , I would click on LANGUAGE LAB , where you get directed to a page that SLOWS DOWN the pronounciation of the word , as well as showing you the voice print , and how the native speaker 's voice rises and falls naturally , during the pronounciation of the word . ( Apparently for correct stress . ) If you are 50 % or less away from getting it right , you see a brown cirle that tells you about how close you are , to correct pronounciation . ( Plus the system records your attempt at pronouncing the word , so you can compair what you are saying , to that of a native speaker . ) If your circle turns green , you are 80 % or closer to perfect pronounciation . HOWEVER , this system DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK . Once , i tried to pronounce ARRIVIDERCI for 15 minutes . I was UPSET , then angry , then bored , and finally , dejected . Frustration kills motivation , and I think that 's why problems with the voice recognition bothers so many people . IF i knew what was wrong with my pronounciation , at least i could TRY to figure out how to say it . I think this happens to EVERYBODY who uses Rosetta Stone at some point . The computer program doesnt say `` The Italian 'G ' is PRONOUNCED HARDER THAN ENGLISH 'G ' . '' Instead , you are suppose to just KNOW this . Sometimes , i just believe the voice recognition is just not able to read normal variations in pronounciation correctly . For example , ROSETTA STONE wants you to roll your R 's . But , very few people even in Italy can actually make that sound . So then the voice recognistion hears the lack of rolling R 's as a mistake in pronounciation . The computer program considers these mistakes as WRONG on your part , and at times the mistakes start to stack up . IF you dont get thru a lesson with a good score , you 'll need to repeat the lesson , and also repeat the offending word . ( the program tracks a LOT of parameters , including how long its been since you have taken a lesson . Too long , and RS makes you review things before you can start the lessons again . But that 's good . ) All I can say , is when I could not pronounce a certain word , i almost never knew why . Even tho ROSETTA STONE gives you 4 CDs for pronounciation practice , if you 've an inability to say a certain word , you might not ever speak it correctly.My other problem , was that there is NOTHING in the kit , that explains GRAMMER the way you learnt grammer in school . Sometimes , those photos that go with the spoken or written exercise , dont get the idea across very well . THE ONLY SOLLUTION , is to buy some kind of cheap TEACH YOURSELF ITALIAN paperback book , that covers basics of grammer , pronounciation , vocabulary , and all the other holes in the learning of the language , that ROSETTA STONES leaves untouced . AMAZON.COM sells a pretty good book , very cheap , that would help anyone using their ROSETTA STONE class immensely . `` ITALIAN MADE SIMPLE '' by Cristina Mazzoni , for around $ 8 new . I bought that book , and only then , were the grammer lessons beginning to make sense . ALSO , this book spends time in the beginning , to teach the differences between the way OUR alphabet is pronounced , and the way the Italian Alphabet is pronounced . You NEED to get a book like this , so you understand italian grammer , and have a little bit of an Italian dictionary as well.There are a few other problems with ROSETTA STONE . Everybody says `` DONT SIGN UP FOR LANGUAGE LAB , UNTIL YOU GET THRU THE LANGUAGE BASICS '' . Because , depending on how fast , or slow , you are motivated to move thru the lessons , those 3 months of FREE LANGUAGE LAB go by really fast . WAIT TO SIGN UP ! ALSO , its good to know that you cant just sign up for language lab a day or two before you want to use it . THERE IS A TWO WEEK WAIT , to have a lesson . Besides the speach recognition problem , and the lack of a good text book so you can learn grammer , pronounciation and vocabulary the way adults learn language , everything about ROSETTA STONE 's classes are LOTS OF FUN . Really . They have games that help you keep those new words constantly in your mind . There are stories that help with reading , that are clued into your number of finished lessons . ITALIAN LEVEL ONE , for example , is divided into UNIT ONE , language basics , UNIT TWO , Greetings , UNIT THREE , Work and school , UNIT FOUR , shopping . By the time you finish that much of the course , you should be able to get around Italy , and make basic conversation . I would guess your proficiency level might be FIRST YEAR COLLEGE ITALIAN , or two years of high school italian , or 1-2 Italian grandparents . ROSETTA STONE is very visually interesting , and will keep you motivated once you get past that first unit ( language basics ) , so long as you dont have major problems being understood by the voice recognition software . I wish i had waited for the langauge lab , because i 'm SURE that would have helped . However , if you do n't use it as much as you want after the first 3 months , its only $ 25 a month , for more time with those online tutors . All things considered , VOICE RECOGNITION really DOES work remarkably well . I 'm sure most of the problems people have , come from their inablity to pronouce certain sounds specific to their target language , rather than the program 's inability to understand your voice . If you are speaking the language correctly , I would guess anywhere from 96-99 % of the time , ROSETTA STONE understands EXACTLY what you say . If some word ( like my problem with ARRIVIDERCI ) comes up , you can easily skip the word . There is NO OTHER SELF TAUGHT LANGUAGE CLASS that can perfect your speach , increase your vocabulary , and engage you in an `` immersion '' type language adventure , like ROSETTA STONE can . NO OTHER SYSTEM has the native speaker 1 on 1 language lab . The only REAL problem is if you learn on your own , its hard to keep your motivation for learning high . You 'll need discipline and some kind of reward , ie , a trip to Italy if you finish LEVEL 1 ? ( Or maybe just a FELLINI film . Whatever rocks your boat . ) Good luck with your language adventure , and ARRIVIDERCI !	1
We got this costume for my son to wear to Disneyland . My daughter likes to dress up like her favorite princess , so he wanted to dress up , too . This costume is better quality than I had anticipated , based on some of the other reviews . It runs a little small , my son is five and the Child M ( 7-8 ) fits well over his clothes . The boot covers pull on over the white jumpsuit pants , and the costume can be worn without them . The arm panels , however , remain attached . The suit has an opening in the back , under the hood , for the child to get into it , and the opening has two Velcro dots to close it . This makes it a little bit awkward to get into , and especially awkward to take off to use the bathroom . To use the bathroom , you have to take off the whole top of the costume , and then hold onto it so it does n't touch a dirty bathroom floor ( I definitely had to help my son with this in a public bathroom ) . He absolutely LOVES the costume , and has worn it everywhere ( except school ) since he got it .	1
Purchased this costume ( size 3T-4T ) and it 's a perfect fit for my very tall 2 year old son . I could n't have asked for a better fit if we 'd tried it on in a store first . I also bought the inflatable jet pack/wings . Ca n't wait to see him all dressed up on the big day !	1
I purchased this costume for my 6-year old grandson for Halloween 2011 . It arrived one week earlier than expected , and I was happy about this . My grandson absolutely loved it ! I 'm glad I ordered the larger size ( Size 8 ) because it barely fit him . The material was durable and well made , I think . He 's worn it many times just to play in since Halloween . I was happy with the purchase which was worth the dollars I spent .	1
Everything perfect . Thanks , nice quality , excellent price , great deal ! ! ! I recommend it 100 % , the color and size are as I expected .	1
Good costume . Very detailed . I like that the body is a foam so it stands up a little on its own . You might not be able to tell from the picture , but there are shin-guard type pieces for the legs , and gauntlets on the sleeves . Nice touch . It is a little thin overall . You 'll definitely want to put something underneath if you 're in a colder climate . My only disappointment is that the back of the torso is entirely black . It 's ok for us because I bought the inflatable wings , but without the wings , I think it would look weird .	1
My grandson wore this costume for Halloween . It was just as pictured and he had a blast wearing this along with tthe inflatable wings and helmet that we purchsed separately .	1
My grandson has been a costume lover for the past three years and I have ordered many from Amazon , His picture that his mother sent was adorable . SO thumbs up	1
This costume is adorable . My child loves it . He puts it on all the time and it 's not even Halloween yet .	1
My son would n't wear it because he can be a stick in the mud . However , the costume is very cute , came within e boot covers , holster , bandana , hat , and one piece costume . I only wish it ran a little bigger so he could wear it in a few weeks or months if he ever lightens up and enjoys dressing up in costumes .	1
my boy is almost 4yrs old and size chils s fits perfectly even with room to grow.boot covers are awesome ! he loved them ! .would definetly recommend this ... for 10 bucks it is really great !	1
better quality than I expected for the price - was able to adjust it so it hung at the side rather than straight in front easily - this was our 'go-to ' passport storage solution in Italy where there were a LOT of pickpockets .	1
Exactly what i wanted as a gift for a friends 1st trip to europe.This is made from the soft kind of fabric that is comfortable to sleep with against your skin.Just the right amount of space to fit a passport and 2 additional sections of the same main pocket , for currency , credit cards , tickets , etc.It 's important to get one like this that has no metal , so it can be worn through security check points , with metal detectors without the need to remove it.This is crucial as no one but you should know this is where the bulk of your important items are.The one main pocket is closed with a velcro strip.It also has a nice thickness to the cord and well chosen adjustment buckle for it .	1
I bought one of these neck stashes for my most recent cruise and used it everyday while on vacation . You can adjust the strap to fit your taste . There are three sections and you can get quite a bit in it . I stuffed cash , my passport , driver 's license and several credit cards in it and still had some room to spare .	1
leaving on my trip soon -- have tried the pouch on around the waist -- it lays flat -- and seems comfortable -- check with me in a couple of weeks to see how it did on the trip .	1
It gives you room to keep your passport ( even in a leather passport coverAmerican Tourister Leather Passport Cover ) , credit cards , important papers , and even has room for some money , and keeps it in a secure place around your neck . You can keep it tucked between your shirt and t-shirt for security and still get easy access to whatever you need in it . It is of lightweight nylon construction that does n't make you hot where you carry it.Do n't travel without it ! Pluses : Prime eligibleSmall , lightweight , but holds a good bit of 'stuff'Minuses : None at this time	1
Love this product . Its small and fits over your neck and under your shirt . I used it on my receint trip to Ireland . Its a lot better then a money belt . Its a lot easier to get to your money or papers and it is harder for anyone else to get to . I will take it on all my trips from now on .	1
I bought this to replace another one I had that was kinda heavy ( in comparison ) . I like this one MUCH better . The strap is long so you can wear it in a purse style or tighten it up and wear it under your shirt . Fits everything really well , and it 's really light .	1
Used this on our last vacation saves from fumbling through your pockets or bags for passport or reservations . I loved using it , fits comfortable under your shirt . Had my passport , credit card and wallet in it while going through the airports .	1
This was a very handy wallet that I used in India.The color is near neutral so it does not show through a shirt but best to wear a vest or a jacket for additional safetyNice velcro closure keeps money safe.You can easily carry 1,000 rupee bills with comfortAlso can carry valueable documents or passports if you wishNice long neck strap that can be shortenedEasier than carrything a thick wallet in trouser pants	1
I bought two of these pouches for a recent vacation to Europe . It was comfortable to wear as long as I did n't put too much in it . It was fine with credit cards , driver 's license and some cash but when I added my passport it became a bit heavy and bulky , but not prohibitively so . I think if you are planning on carrying your passport with credit cards it will work well for you , but if you are not planning on carrying your passport around , a pouch that is smaller might work better.This pouch is likely a good size if you are carrying quite a bit of stuff , but it will stick out under your clothes if your passport is in it . A lot more comfortable with only a bit of cash and credit cards.It is also a l longer in length than I realized . Its so long that I could wear it around my neck and tuck it into my pants . My daughter refused to wear it since it is quite bulky under your clothes .	1
This is the type of pouch recommended by TV travel hosts . Bought one for my son for trip to France ; VERY HANDY and VERY HIDDEN.RECOMMEND .	1
I recently used this neck stash on a two week trip to France . It was wonderful ! I loved it at the airport and at train stations , especially . It is so helpful to have my hands free yet my passport and bording pass ( or train ticket ) ready to pull right out instead of fumbling in a purse . I also carried money and credit cards in it and in extremely crowded tourist areas ( like the Eiffel Tower ) I wore it under my shirt for extra security . It 's lightweight and the adjustable neck strap , when adjusted properly , makes this pretty unnoticeable under a shirt . I love the different compartments , as this makes it easier to find what you 're looking for right away .	1
This neck stash is very comfortable and it 's a nice size . There are two zippered pockets for cards , passports , cash , etc . and a large velcro flap for larger bills or boarding passes .	1
There 's nothing special here , but this is what I expected . It 's very light weight , and I suspect it would n't hold up to much abuse , but hard to beat the price . My only real complaint is that the zipper pockets are only barely big enough for my passport , so it takes more concentration than I 'd prefer to use them for passport storage .	1
Quality material , easy to wash and dry , lots of zipper areas and holds more paperwork and currency than you could imagine from seeing just pictures of it . Discreet and comfy to wear around neck for men or women .	1
I have n't used this yet , but I purchased it for my next trip . I already have a waist wallet , but I ca n't get to it without going to a restroom and partially undressing . This seemed much simpler to use .	1
I really like this . I ordered several different ones but this one is really convenient for the documents I want to carry close and safe where I can get to them easily ,	1
I wore this one all over medetaranean . I felt safe EVEN in the Istanbul Grand Bazzar , the most crowded , pushy , pickpocket attracting place on Earth .	1
Purchased two of these for a European Trip . They were invaluable . We placed our money , cards and passport in them and tucked them under shirts and out of sight . Light weight and they DO NOT rub or irritate the skin which surprised me . they are washable too !	1
the last time i travelled i got one of the waist ones , and it was so annoying i never used it . i have n't yet really used this one but i already feel much better about it . i tried it out when i first opened the box when it came and wore it for a bit around my neck . i do n't like the toggle , but i doubled up the strap and tucked the toggle in the top flap of the stash and it works great . i also wrapped it around my calf just below my knee to see if that would work too . it worked just fine and i might wear it there when i wear my boots . i 'm not sure if it really needs all those different departments , but that 's ok. i do n't think it 's too big or too small .	1
This has a lot of pockets and yet is very slim . Took this on a trip outside of the US and the item was lightweight , discreet and very handy . Holds 4 passports easily along with receipts .	1
great no one got my good stuff It was all hanging around my neck . sturdy and durable , i bought one for my husband	1
It might just be me . Although it seems well made and sized right . It just seems a bit flimsy to me . I debate if I really should not give it 5 stars as it does everything it advertises itself . When I travel out of country , I have this around my neck and under one layer of clothing . I have my & # 34 ; throw away & # 34 ; wallet in my pocket with expired cards and a few dollars.I like the various pockets and zippered security to keep things in place . The neck cord is a little long so I had to tie it off so the stash would fall mid chest making it a bit more concealed.4.5 stars - minus 1/2 star for long cord and a flimsy feel . Again though perhaps being flimsy is a good thing being under clothing making it conceal more .	1
The item arrived on time in perfect condition . I took a 3 week trip to Africa and it was the perfect item to have !	1
My 16 year old granddaughter was going on a trip to France for 10 days with a student group and needed some security that her documents and money would be safe . Worked just fine , also handy at airport	1
Soft and really light . Works really well and is very well thought out with 2 zippered pockets and an large Velcro pouch with 2 separate pockets . I find this a very good arrangement . Money in one zippered pocket and card and license in the other and the cell phone in the Velcro pocket . I also like the adjustment on the length of cord so you can wear it high or lower . Not my everyday wallet as a full size Spec Op but this is great for days when more security is need or no pockets .	1
This is lightweight , nice material , easy to wear under clothing , secure place for passport , money , hotel key , driver 's license . The strap is a little long so we just cut it off shorter . Perfect for detering pickpockets and not noticeable under a shirt ( not so under t-shirts , but still safer than in a pocket )	1
I bought this strap to hold two suitcases together while running through airports on vacation . We just got home and the strap was a life saver . My suitcases did not have one attached , so this rugged strap did its job well .	1
Highly recommend this product . I was easily able to `` piggy back '' or connect 2 luggage pieces by the handles to easily transport 2 pieces of luggage with my carry-on resting on the top piece of luggage . Have used this now 3x 's and highly recommend it.Wish I had it for earlier travels .	1
husband needed this strap to be able to attach his briefcase to his carry-on luggage to make navigating through the airport to the gate easier . product fits the bill , is well-made so it should hold up over time . he 's already road-tested on a couple of recent trips and is happy with it .	1
I travel 3 weeks a month and carry 2 50 lb bags everywhere I go . I have been using this strap for a couple months now to pull both bags together and it works awesome . I would n't go back to traveling without it and the convenience for the price is great.I can even get both bags , when piggybacked , on an escalator and the strap is strong enough to hold the second bag in the air without snapping or anything .	1
This is a must have item for travelers . Very sturdy , adjustable . Could n't live without it for carrying multiple bags .	1
This adjustable straps fit around my messenger bag , which has to pieces of cloth on both sides of the front flap , and have sufficient length to secure it , as a back up to the velcro closures . They have a heavy plastic clip that & # 34 ; clicks & # 34 ; to make sure they close . Very useful .	1
Every roller bag sold should have strap like this - always keep mine close at hand and use it all the time !	1
I bought two of these , and we have used them both multiple times . They are made well and the clip is heavy duty . Make sure to use it with a strong handle on your suitcase , as the design is such that it pulls significantly on the handle when carrying the second suitcase . This item is also useful to attach other items , such as on small carryons or your travel pillow . Two of these belts were VITAL to my international travel alone with a toddler and tons of suitcases/stroller/carryons/car seat , etc . They helped to strap items together for easy transport , and I was able to get through the airports with everything in tow . I highly recommend them ! UPDATE FEB 2012 : I have used these straps on multiple trips and they have held up well . At one point I used the strap on three suitcases at once , including a large rolling duffel bag , a large suitcase , and a medium suitcase . It kept everything together and I was able to navigate through international airports with multiple suitcases strapped together , car seat , diaper bag , backpack , and toddler ( in an Ergo baby carrier ) . Without this strap , I do n't know what I would have done ! Such a little product , and so important ! ! !	1
The Inflatable buzz lightyear costume jet pack did arrived on time . My son did like it but it did not last long . It was OK gift for my son .	1
Very fast shipping ! Inflates easily and stayed inflated well.The elastic harness Velcros , so it 's safe and it 's gives a small 1/4 '' adjust-ability to their size.They do stick out quite a bit from the sides of the child , but I think it adds to the excitement for the child.a lot of fun , The material is the same as that as a blow-up pool , so there is some durability , but seriously you have to expect that it can easily be punctured just the same if you are not careful .	1
This jet pack is easy to inflate , and my son can put it on himself . I like that it 's inflatable , so my son can wear it as long as he wants , and then when it 's time to take off , I can just deflate it , fold it up , and put it in my purse . The only problem we 've encountered is that it rides up pretty high on my son 's back , above his shoulders , so he keeps pulling it down lower , but it wo n't stay . It 's pretty durable for an inflatable . My son crashes into things , the dog has stepped on it , but it still works .	1
plastic is a little fragile , but it will probably last as long as his attention , my grandson just loved it	1
My nephew loves this . Wore it for Halloween and played Buzz at home for weeks afterward . A terrific item .	1
Ordered this as an accessory to the Buzz Lightyear costume my Son wanted to wear for Halloween . Was easy to inflate and put on . However , there is a pretty heavy chemical smell that comes off the item - not sure if it 's from the materials it 's made with or from the coloring on the jet pack . Rating would have been 5 stars if not for the smell .	1
My son loves this . We had one before but after a year of being banged around they died , which is acceptable . So we got a replacement for him .	1
These were great for my son 's halloween costume . Looks fantastic . They are inflatable - I do n't know if you can tell that from the picture . You have to get them really inflated in order for the wings to stick out straight like they should . My chief complaint is how the straps ( very thin 1/4 & # 34 ; elastic ) are attached to the jet pack . It looks like they will break loose any moment . Mine survived a halloween party and halloween itself , but I do n't expect this to stand up to much more . It did look great with the costume , though ! ! !	1
We bought these wings to go with the Buzz Lightyear deluxe costume , and it really made the costume whole ! They are inflatable so some care is needed but we have had them for a year and a half now and my son still uses them for & # 34 ; super hero & # 34 ; play time . Great buy , would recommend to anyone buying the deluxe costume for a great and i believe necessary add on .	1
My boys are very much into the superhero stage , and these were perfect ! ! They are inflatable back pieces , with white elastic straps similar to a backpack style . The great thing is no one gets injured from being whacked with the wings of these mid-flight . ( as one who got smacked in the face while my Buzz was off to save the galaxy , I can vouch for that ) . Price was great , these are super fun !	1
I purchased my Suunto in 2005 ( not from Amazon ) and wore it daily from then until 2013 . It has good to combat twice , multiple airborne jumps , and EVERYTHING ! I had to replace the band once during this time ( loctite my friends , loctite ) and the battery just a few times . I am going back to Afghanistan in a few months and considered getting another Suunto , the Core , however , the reviews seemed pretty bad so I decided to get a new battery and keep the Vector . When I was stationed with the Special Forces , this watch was an issued time piece , and EVERYONE got one who was deploying to Afghanistan back then . I was n't deploying at that time , so I purchased mine since everyone else had one . The face is large ( 52mm ) and a majority of the painted numbers have rubbed off , however , the watch has never failed me . I seldom use the Compass or other functions , but when I did , they where dead on . Actually , one time flying on a mission I compared my ATLI reading with the planes instruments and it was dead on . Also , when I used the Compass for radio antenna set up , it was dead on as well . Actually , when doing land navigation testing , these watches are n't allowed because you have an advantage . In all , I have considered getting other Sports watches but this one has yet to let me down . When it does , I will stick with the Suunto Vector due to the lackluster reviews of the Suunto Core . The price has gone up since 2005 , in which I paid $ 150.00 via an eBay sale , those days are apparently long gone . I 've gone swiming , and even light diving and had no issues . The alarm works well , and the computer does all the fuzzy math so you do n't have to worry about shorter months , leap years , blah blah blah . A solid product . If you know someone who is in the military have them purchase it for you because they are cheaper on military bases.My only advice would be to get some loctite to reinforce the screws . You can take it to a locale jewler and they can perform this service for you , likely for free .	1
This may be the 'outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . It 's big , it 's ugly , but has functions to make the fattest Swiss Army Knife sit in the corner sobbing in jealousy . Overall , I like it but there are a couple of things that sound better than they are.The timepiece : Outstanding . It has HH : MM : SS DD : MMM , of course , with a year setting to avoid leap year issues . This should go without saying in a modern digital watch . Stopwatch with lap function ( not that I ever use the lap function , but I 'm sure someone is interested ) . Countdown timer that can run up to a 24 hour countdown ( very easy to set ) . Three daily alarms . Special kudos for the alarms , this is one of the loudest watch alarms I 've heard , and I 've missed too many watch alarms to not appreciate this.The Altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind of neat . Over four days , my bedroom went from 100m above sea level to 25 m below sea level ( by the maps , about 40m ASL ) . Not surprising because it is driven by the barometer , and I never recalibrated it , but a graphic demonstration of the importance of calibrating it when you want/need it.The Barometer : Yup , it 's a barometer . The part I like is the little display that shows the rising/falling trend , especially as this is always active ( even in normal 'time ' mode ) .The Thermometer : Take the watch off to get an accurate reading as the sensor is too close to the wrist.The compass : Easily the best 'special ' feature . Accurate , precise ( enough for orienteering , not for surveying ) , easy to use . It can be programmed for a declination , but knowing me , I 'd forget to reset it , so I do declination the hard way . The sighting notches are small but servicable . The spirit level bubble is unique among digital watch compasses to Suunto , and greatly enhances accuracy and confidence in the compass . An outstanding wrist compass.The package : Big . Really , really big . But the controls are very easy to use and seem fairly resistant to accidental button pressing ( a problem for me with other watches ) . The battery has a shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but has a hatch , so you do n't need to take it to a jeweller to get it replaced without ruining the water resistance . The display has large characters and high contrast to the back ground , and the display light is just right , readible , even , and glare free , but not an emergency flashlight . Personally , I 'm going to swap the resin band for a velcro strap , but the stock strap is n't bad , just not great.Overall , not a watch for the office or a suit but very good as a watch , compass and barometer , and about what you could expect as a thermometer and altimeter . Well designed , thought-out , and manufactured , but really big .	1
It does everything I need a watch to do and it looks good too . I have several of these watches in different colors , and since the battery is so easy to change I do it myself . which saves money .	1
To my way of thinking , there are only TWO factors which keep the Vector from receiving a full 5-stars here . # 1 is the watch face . It is not very durable . It is n't even glass . It 's made out of VERY easily scratched plastic . I own several watches , and even the plain glass face models scratch at the drop of a hat , but this one takes it to a whole new level . I 'd be worried to sneeze too close for fear it may implode. # 2 is the fact that despite the promises of being water resistent to 100 Meters ( ie 300 feet ) this watch is n't ... FAR from it . You are in danger of ruining this watch if you even enter a bathroom while someone ELSE is taking a hot shower . The humidity alone may cause problems . Pretty sad when a watch advertised as at the very least capable in a pool can not honestly pull off a basic shower in a bathtub.Now , with that said , if you take care to avoid moisture whenever you can , the Vector is a fine wrist computer that works quite well in a variety of areas . It 'll tell you the temperature ( under the right circumstances , of course ) , help you predict the weather , give you a bearing on where you need to go and then ( after proper adjusting ) tell you your altitude . I found the altimeter to actually be rather accurate -- oh , and those reviews I have read on-and-off by folks bragging about telling the altitude INSIDE of a pressurized passenger plane are BOGUS.Considering what this watch can do , and it 's limitations , I believe that the price is a bit high ( you can buy a Casio watch that 'll do the same thing -- and is solar-powered , AND is REALLY water-resistent , all for LESS ) but the Vector has one thing that not all Suunto watches , or altimeter/barometer/compass watches come with : that little bubble on the face which allows a more accurate determination of specific readings . If Casio add 's one to their model , I 'll probably become a full-time convert . If you are looking for something similar , but smaller , try looking at the Suunto Observer . It 's a dang-good-looking watch , but the price is considerably more , so that may be a rather important factor for you ( I know it is for me ) .All in all , Suunto makes great products , but water resistent models are unfortunately NOT one of them ( unless you are going for one of their products that actually are designed for underwater use ) .	1
Purchased at Bagram Afghanistan PX in 2007 and this watch is a must-have for anyone treking into the mountains ( of which I did , alot ) . Over the years the watch has taken a beating - the bezel is scratched up but , I still get a lot of comments about the watch . The altimeter ( incl the memory function ) worked very well . Battery replacement is easy ( and has to occur about once a year ) . The watch is a typical ABC watch , that looks good and does the job .	1
Amazing watch which I use on a daily basis . The time is large and is easily read and the date is just below that which is very useful in my job . The altimeter and barometer work great once they are calibrated correctly . Easy to use watch with three alarms that can be set quickly . The watch fits well and is very comfortable to wear for long periods of time .	1
I 've bought this one and works perfectly , but I 've changed it for a X-Lander with Aluminium case , wich one is perfect .	1
I 've had this watch for several years now and it still holds up . It is a little pricier than some of the competition from Casio and Timex . However , it offers some nice advantages over most others , with only a couple drawbacks . I wore mine for two tours in Iraq and it performed perfectly . Not that I truly ever relied on the Comp-Baro-Alti features , because we always had other more advanced devices for that . But it was reassuring to have those capabilities on my wrist at all times . And the basic time , stopwatch , alarm and timer functions were used often and performed well.Pros : User replaceable battery - very helpful in the field and easy to do , saves money.Broad array of functions - easy to manipulate the various features with a little practice and reading the manual.Very accurate - the watch loses very little time over the months and years , good quartz movement.Good water resistance - not a dive watch , but it holds up well , even under several meters of water , which I 've done.Comfortable despite its large size - pretty light weight and a large , comfortable band.Easy to read - large face , big numbers.Attractive design - very distinct look.Cons : Not solar-atomic ( like Casio Pathfinder ) - however , battery is easily replaced and the quartz movement is very accurate.Thicker case - more so than the Casio PAW1300 , but not too bad.Bottonology - the button function layout is different than most Timex and Casios , but is n't too hard to figure out.Price - higher than many , but not excessive for what you get.Overall , despite the drawbacks referenced above , I highly recommend the Suunto X-Lander and I would assume the other Suunto models are also good . Serves me well .	1
I collect watches , and I am NOT one to shy away from big watches , and in some cases , the bigger the better . What I really love about the X-Lander is that it is big but also very light-weight . Normally when you see a wrist watch this large you have to exercise your arm quite a bit just to get used to telling time , but not so with the X-Lander . And best of all : it does WAY MORE than just tell time ! Interested in knowing where you are going ? How about the current temperature ? Are you just the slightest bit interested in what your current altitude may be ? GO BUY THIS WATCH ! 'Course for those Suunto enthusiasts , this IS N'T a watch , its a Wristop Computer that just so happens to be able to tell time . Unlike the Suunto Observer which is about half the size ( and more than a little extra spendy ) , this baby will do all that and still look great doing it . From the 3 different Suunto models I personally own , I must admit that they make a great wristop computer , or for the picky out there , watch . I mostly use mine to tell simple time , but I must say that as I drive over the mountains up to Montana or over to Oregon and Washington , it IS handy to know a few extra details just by looking down at my wrist . Oh , I almost forgot the barometer ! It tracks the barometric pressure and helps you track and even predict the weather ! I must say that I have n't been able to figure out the finer points of how to do that just yet , but I AM working on it.I guess if I HAD to point out one flaw , I would say that the night-glo feature it comes with is n't all that bright , and the alarm could stand to be louder -- but it IS about 5 TIMES more audible than the absolutely embarassing alarm built into the Observer . Other than these minor complaints , I whole-heartedly endorse pretty much everything manufactured by Suunto , and especially the models I own , the X6HR , The Observer and of course the X-Lander . Sylish , multi-functional and quite durable . Choose one of these models and you will no doubt be as satisfied as I am .	1
GREAT ! ! ! Service , I got excately what I ordered and received it in 4 days ! I recommend'em and will to my friends and family as well..	1
This was for my grandson for Halloween and he loved it . He is a huge spider man fan . He look great in it .	1
this is a great costume . size is true . i ordered it with the matching gloves . great gift for little boys who love spiderman	1
It was a big hit with my 4 yr. old . He loved it . It fits perfectly with room for growing . The price was really good too .	1
Yes , this is a good lock especially for the money . But I had to laugh when I realized I could not enter my own combination numbers ... ..the maker actually gives you the combination you have to use on your lock and then you get to memorize THEIR numbers ... ..how stupid are we getting ? ?	1
Master Lock has been around for a really long time . I purchased because of the name , the sturdiness of the lock and the color . Easy to spot which locker is mine amoungst the dozens , most sporting boring black locks .	1
For the price , I think this is a fine costume . No more cheaply made than the next Halloween costume but because it 's so simple , you ca n't really tell . It was a hit at the party I attended ( I went with someone dressed in a priest costume made by the same company - great couples ' idea ) ! It would earn an extra star if it came with the cross . I had to buy one for another ten bucks at the last minute .	1
I have a friend and she is not dating for a few years untill her child goes to college.She said I feel like Im a nun now so I sent this to her . She laughed her ass off .	1
As it turns out , I did n't have a chance to use the costume but it seems to be well made . Look forward to using it another time .	1
Happy with it . Good value for the money an would recommend it to someone who is looking to purchase one .	1
This came fast and it 's of great quality ! Perfect for the price , a little better actually . I am going to enjoy this ; ) Happy Halloween !	1
I love this . It was cheap , and it is super cute and the kids just adore it . Anything to do with Dora is always a hit , and they felt like it was similar to her backpack ...	1
Great for a toddler , perfect size for the little ones . Durable and no chocking worries at all . Enough in the purse to role play and hold interest great price too !	1
I bought this for my 2 year old cousin . She has a habit of taking her mothers purse and walking all over with it so I figured it would be perfect . When I first saw it I fell in love with the soft material and girly colors and she absolutely loves it . She always remembers to put her things in her purse so she can be `` just like mommy . ''	1
This purse is very cute and my 15 month old g-daughter loves it . It 's her favorite purse of the two she has .	1
I bought this for little 2 year old for Christmas & she loved it . The price was fair too ! ! ! I will probably buy from this company again .	1
This is a fun little purse for a toddler . It 's a manageable size and comes with fun things inside . Just wish the steps were a bit longer .	1
my 2 year old daughter loves this product ! she is not crazy about the purse which is pretty small but she really likes the things that come with it . I wish the phone would have been made to work with batteries , so it would make a noise or something but it is just a piece of plastic with fake buttons .	1
My 15 month old daughter received this for Christmas and she loves it . I wish the phone buttons could be pushed or did something . Other than that , it is a fun toy and she walks around the house carrying her handbag just like mommy . Too cute !	1
& # 34 ; What is thaaaat ? ! ? & # 34 ; That was the shriek exclaimed by my 2.5 y/o when she opened this up on Christmas ! She is so super excited about this purse set ... She loves the credit card , phone and & # 34 ; Chapstick ( lipstick ) & # 34 ; the most . The size of the enclosed items are . Perfect for a toddler . The price was really good , too . We are definitely very happy with this purchase . Oh , for those who may care , the mirror that came with her set was yellow vs the shown blue , just FYI .	1
I have n't opened it yet but it looks really cute.fast delivery also ! cant wait to give it as a gift to my 2 year old shes going to love it !	1
I bought this for my friend 's three year old daughter and she absolutely adored it . It 's been about a month since then and my friend said her daughter still ca n't leave the house without it ! For the money , this gift is perfect !	1
very nice first purse for a little girl . My granddaughter will love it , I am saving it to give to her for Easter .	1
My niece loves this little purse with all the items that go in it . She walks around caring her little purse just like her mom 's .	1
My kids liked this and have fun playing around with it , the only thing I felt was the price could have been better . Saw it much cheaper at Walmart not too long ago and then believe it or not at the dollar store.However , the product itself is durable and nice , not kids hazards jumping right out or frail designs .	1
This is adorable . The fabric of the purse is nice and soft and the little items inside are cute . I like the size of it as well . Not too large , not too small . My granddaughter will love it .	1
The child I gave it to loved it , she carries it around all the time . Cool toy for the Mommy mini me girly girl .	1
My daughter wanted a toy cell phone , ( 911 dispatchers probably would n't agree its a good toy , but oh well ) so I got to looking and I got this set for just a little more than just a phone would have cost . She loves all of it and carries it around the house , she just turned 4 . Great product for the price , I would recommend it .	1
Bought for my 15 month old Granddaughter . She thinks it 's great . I think her favorite piece is the fake lipstick . It 's worth buying .	1
I have n't actually gotten to see the product , but I got a call from my sister-in-law and she told me how much her daughter loves her first purse . She said she carried it quite often and that it was a perfect gift for a 3 or 4 year old girl !	1
My neice loves it . She really likes the cell phone . She is so cute with her little purse ! She loves the little mirror in it .	1
My granddaughter loves it & all the adorable goodies inside it.She carries it everywhere with her and happily plays with the accessories .	1
I bought this when I saw it on Amazon . I also bought a book ( Lillie 's Purple Plastic Purse ) to go along with it as a gift for my 2 year old niece . Lots of fun for a little girl .	1
My daughter had one of these when she was a toddler . It was really sweet and she loved carrying it around and taking the stuff out . I ended up buying one for my step-grandaughter this Christmas . She was thrilled with it and just like my daughter used to do , she had a blast pulling everything out , going through it and putting it all back in . Everything is easy to hold , fun to look at , and just grown-up enough to make them feel like this really is their own purse .	1
I got this for my 17month granddaughter . She enjoys the toy . She really likes the phone and lip stick . I think she will enjoy even more as time goes on .	1
I was in a hurry and needed an easy little gift for a one year old 's birthday . It does say on the tag that it is for 2+ but the pieces inside were n't too terribly small . It came in the mail quick with prime so generally I 'm happy and so was the kid . Win win !	1
My twin cousins loved this ! They are not yet two but said & # 34 ; ohhhh & # 34 ; and sighed like they were so elated : )	1
This was so much fun for my niece , a two year old . She liked the items so she could be & # 34 ; just like mommy & # 34 ; . She loved the purse for other items as well , like carrying her other precious things . Nice little toy gets a lot of use .	1
This is a great little purse , and my daughter still plays with it a year later . The design is very cute , but the phone could be better ( like if numbers could actually be pressed and perhaps sounds made ) . When you put all the accessories in the bag , it is pretty full and barely closing . But my daughter has since found a better phone to put in her purse , along with the rest .	1
It 's very durable , perfect for your & # 34 ; little princess & # 34 ; . Now my 2 year old princess is using it , and loves it , now she has her bag /phone and make-up too ! So cute !	1
My twin girls got this when they turned two and they both love it and still have it at almost 3 1/2 . My only complaint is the little plastic card holder . For some reason , neither of the girls can open it . But overall , they love the purse and it 's lasted this long with very destructive twins !	1
My oldest daughter , who is now 5 years old , got one of these purses a couple of years ago from my mother . Out of all of the toys that my daughters have , this is the one that they would fight over the most , so for my youngest daughter 's 3rd birthday I got her her very own `` First Purse '' . They both love playing with all of the included accessories , and often throw in a few additional items of their own . The purses and accessories are all very durable , in fact , I had to put my daughters ' initials on everything because I really ca n't tell the difference between the new items , and the items that we 've had for a couple of years already . Out of all of the little purses that I 've looked at online and everywhere else , I definitely feel like this is the cutest and best deal out there .	1
bought this for our daughters 2nd birthday and she loves it . its great for any little girls & # 34 ; first purse & # 34 ; : )	1
I gave this as a gift for the daughter of a friend . I was not able to check the age requirement but it turns out , the gift was still a hit , especially the cellphone . This is a good buy .	1
My daughter is 1 and loves to play with this purse . She takes the items out and outs them back in . She also tries to talk on the phone and thinks the debit card is fun to carry around .	1
SHE ESPECIALLY LOVED THE LIPSTICK & PASSED IT AROUND THE TABLE . IT WA SO CUTE WATCHING HER JOY FINDING ALL THAT WAS IN THE PURSE . GOOD BUY GRANDMA	1
I got this for my two year old granddaughter ... she loved it ... it is safe and the different objects in the purse are very appealing .	1
My first purse is very sturdy and nice for any little girl developing into a big girl . I love it .	1
Bought this for a baby in the family , she loves real purses so I had to buy her the baby version ! she loved it .	1
Great watch , extremely light , nice sinister metal color . I 'd rate it as more than acceptable for dress wear . My friends are green eyed envious and want one . My only question is why does n't the secondhand click evenly on the numerals on the watch face ? I ca n't believe that one reviewer was upset that the watch crystal was n't as bullet proof as the titanium watch case and band .	1
Son 's had his for 3-4 years . My 18 yr old son liked his so much . He even got compliments on it . Just bought another as a gift . It arrived in a frosted plastic display cube - looks nice . Good price for this watch .	1
Bought this for my husband-great watch . However , we had to take to a jeweler to remove links . Lightweight-goes with everything .	1
The baby loves his little Dora bag , but why they ca n't make some of this stuff in blue or grey or any other color is beyond me .	1
I wish I had the camera out when our little girl first saw her Backpack . Her face lit up . She was so excited . She also loved 'Map ' . Our girl is a small 1yr 9months , so the straps are a little big . Aside from it being a little too big on her back , Backpack keeps our girl entertained . She really likes putting things into it . I 'd highly recommend this for every little Dora fan .	1
The bag is great . The map seems to be a little cheap . It 's connected to a small piece of rope . The map is hard for my 3 year old to roll up & Velcro back together.. Otherwise , the bag is sturdy .	1
Bought this backpack for my daughter to carry her Dora books in and it fits . But the weight of the 2 books made the magnet snap pop off constantly . I think it would be fine if you do n't put anything inside the backpack , but if you want to put books in there like my daughter , then you would have to sew on your own snap or button . Cute !	1
Nice quality , my daughter loves it to wear to her preschool ! She has it on her back all the time ! I do n't want her to outgrow this any soon ! ! The quality & finish is great ! highly recommend ! !	1
The kids just love this . Why -- -no clue . I ordered it because my friend asked me to order it for her daughter , so I ordered 2 -- -one for my daughter as well . We live in the caribbean , where it 's hot , so a thick plush backpack is something you do n't want to have on your back . The color is cute too , but I can see it easily getting soiled . I did n't let this backpack out of the house , and ended up giving it to another child.I liked the pull-out map feature that comes attached to it though . The flap stays closed with a magnetic closure . Good size .	1
I needed an everyday digital watch that I can wear to classes and gym . This one does the job very well at its kind price ( can find at a cheaper price online ) and looks good as well . It stays very comfortable on my wrist due to its thin and small face . I have a relatively thin wrist ( Sz 6.5 ) so it looks proportional . I can see how this one can look a little small if you have a thick wrist but worth a try anyway . It even looked a little small on my wrist at first but I became to like the look of it as time passed.I also just switched battery on mine since the lcd looked a little weak . It 's extremely easy to change the battery too . Just unscrew the 4 bolts on the back , take out the watch inside ( it 's one piece ) , open it by opening four corners , swap the battery , then put it back together . Even if you have no experience with battery changing on a watch , you will figure out easily.Overall , I 'm very satisfied.The only con if I have to pick one - the light could be a little brighter . But no problem reading the time .	1
The buttons are n't overly sensitive ( problem with my old watch ) , good fit , easy to use . I highly suggest to anyone .	1
These watches go forever . If you do not use the light or stopwatch , the battery can last for years . The band is the only thing that has ever broken on mine and a band cost almost as much as the watchYou can wash your hands or get caught in the rain and not worry about the watch since it is water resistant	1
Love it.it 's a bit edgy and bothering at first but soon its very comfortable.does it job.Considering buying ? You should .	1
I thought it would be a bit bigger , but it was not . I 'm keeping it anyway , it does the trick . It 's also on the small side around my wrists .	1
I have had many big fancy watches and have settled on the Casio F-91W Casual Sport Watch.It 's light , cheap , super accurate , and easy , intuitive to operate . You do n't need a manual to set time or alarm . No need for those big clunky heavy watches to bang around . Those timepieces are just silly .	1
It works well and gets the job done . I have a small wrist and it fits like a glove . I love the stopwatch ( although I keep forgetting it . Completely recommend !	1
I wear my high-top chucks until they have holes everywhere so I know my size and style . These were cheaper than the chucks on the converse website so I took a chance and am happy that I did . They are the same ones I get every time , perfect size , perfect fit . They are just as comfy as always , needing only one double-socked wear to break them in . I love them . & # 9829 ;	1
I got these for my daughter because I favor black Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star high-tops myself when I wear sneakers , and she likes to clomp around in them , so I thought I 'd get her her own pair . Once she found out they come in pink , no other color would do . Sigh . But they are SUPER cute , and the lacing up the ankles means they fit tight and wo n't come off , but lots of room to grow through the toes . One drawback , the laces are hard for a toddler to manage , and she has extreme difficulty getting them off by herself .	1
So wonderfull I liked a lot and I will purchase it whenever I will need it and I received alot of comment of it .	1
Product came on time , was exactly as described , were the correct size and the correct color . I had no problems with this order . When I was going through the reviews , I noticed quite a few complaints , and was worried . I needed new sneakers and figured 40 bucks was not all that bad for the shoes . I used to wear Chucks until they fell apart , and will probably do the same with these .	1
This is a great high quality pair of shoes . The canvas is high quality and the stitching looks good . The inside of the shoes are also great . Buy chucks here for $ 20 ish less than at other places . Also make sure to buy a half or a full size smaller than what you normally wear . If you get these in the correct size you wo n't be dissapointed ! If you found this review helpful please make sure to hit the helpful button to help others see this too . Thanks !	1
I gave this snikers to my 15 year-old son and he loved . It has a juvenile color and it can use it daily , are confortables , the color is durable . Their friends have liked it . I recommend it	1
I work with a friend who is the biggest Chuck Taylor fan of all time . She has who knows how many pairs of Chucks ( over 20 ) , and always seems to wear a different color every day . So to be a good friend , I had to get a pair . Red , being one of my favorite colors , seemed the right choice . I bought size 6.5 Men 's , which translates to 8.5 Women 's . The fit is good ! These are heavier than I would have expected , but they are n't uncomfortably so . They are very sturdy considering so much of them is made from canvas . My feet feel well supported . While I probably wo n't go bonkers over them , I might have to invest in a second pair .	1
They say that `` it takes a real man to wear pink '' , but even among women and girls who wear Converse , pink is an uncommon color . These make quite a statement no matter what crowd you run with . In some ways it can even be a safety measure , as they make you easy to identify in a multitide . Because they are so unique , people that would n't normally remember or even pay you a second glance will tend to look twice and/or learn to recognize you - I think that alone makes these worth the money compared to any other shoe.In addition , unlike many shoes , Converse do n't mind being thrown in the washing machine for occasional cleaning ( just avoid the bleach , or you 'll fade them quite fast ) . Thus , I do n't mind wearing these everywhere , because if they get dirty it 's no big deal.Speaking of fading , pink Converse have to be worn for awhile before they resemble the color of the image shown - they are a bit more bright , deep pink than they appear . They are not `` neon pink '' ( a separate and easily distinguished color ) , but nonetheless pinker than the image.Converse almost invariably seem to run a half size larger , and these are no exception . So if you 're a 9.5 , get a 9 , etc . These were my very first pair , and I 'm glad that I tried them on in a store to learn this before ordering - it would have been a rather unpleasant surprise.Also true to most Converse , these have little to no arch support , a thinner sole compared to most modern shoes ( i.e . you 'll feel it if you step on a rock or such ) , and do n't take too kindly to being worn in the rain , mud , snow , etc . I certainly would n't run a mile or take a hike in them . For those reasons , I 've got to knock one star , as much as I otherwise love these shoes .	1
I bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loved them . They are very comfortable and help to support her ankles when she goes walking . great price was helpful in purchase . recommend this product .	1
Order a size , up..always with this style and brand as my son has bought several pairs and loves them.good quality..arrived on time well packaged	1
what can i say stylish and comfortable black goes with everything , my husband has many pairs in assorted colors he likes the so much	1
Simple , comfortable and lightweight shoes . Dense fabric . Good quality rubber , soft sole . I hope that will be pleasantly worn.Delivered in a timely manner . I 'm quite happy .	1
Love my converse ! I remember them from high school , and they also ran a half size too big back in the day . Once you get the right size , they 're great . I wear a 8 ( womens ) and ordered a 5.5 in Men 's .	1
I 'm a major Converse fan , I like to collect them in all different colors , why not pink ? I already knew my Converse size from the other Chuck Taylor colors I already owned , so sizing was n't an issue at all , even though most of my other Converse are low-cut Oxfords . The high-tops can take a little more work to get onto your feet , but it 's worth it I think for the high-top style . And the pink is a nice subdued shade , not a gaudy hot pink or anything like that . Definitely recommended for both women and men who are secure enough in themselves to go out and about wearing pink Converse . They look great .	1
Man let me tell you , I always wanted a pair of these but I was being cheap and didnt want to spend the money ... But as you can see I broke down and went for it . I searched and searched and I am so glad for Amazon 's buyers writing reviews because this is what made me go for it . I read most all of the reviews to make my determination of size because I made a mistake before because I did n't know to order a size smaller . If you a female and are buying a pair of Converse you better get a size smaller if the listings say Converse Men . I Love , Love , Love these dang shoes and I love the fact that now that I know what size to order . The fit is perfect .	1
Always wanted a Converse but was somewhat indecisive . Now I regret not getting one of these sooner . Awesome ! A very good decision .	1
All star is my favorite brand of tennis because thier durability , thanks for sending it just on time , Im very thankful .	1
Well made , wider cut than adult version to fit blocky toddler feet and chubby ankles . Completes that old school hip hop everyone wants for their kid .	1
This was exactly what I was looking for . If you are shopping for this item , you will not be disappointed.Item arrived within 2 days .	1
i had some converse and long story short i drew on them and they got messed up so i got a new pare and these are perfect . fit good . and these are mens . ok so these shoes say mens five but really they are a womens 7 i think or 7 and a half ! so just go on google and search what your size is in mens and you can get the mens ones too . they are exactly the same as the womens so ya ! i hope this helped	1
I bought these for my nephew 's birthday and they were exactly what he wanted . They arrived in the right amount of time and in perfect condition . Would recommend this seller to anyone .	1
Got these for my son , as he is a fan of Daniel Tiger , and I thought they could match . He has had them for 6 months , and has worn them constantly - they are still in great shape , and he gets really good traction . He climbs a lot and runs , and is very confident in these shoes . It appears he gets good support too , so he looks forward to wearing them . Great product .	1
Im glad I listened to the advice posted and got a slightly smaller size than usual . I normally were a size 12 and the 11.5 fit perfect !	1
We purchased these shoes for the girls in our bridal party as they were wearing Latte dresses . The boys wore black to match their suits . I wore white , and my husband black.The high-tops were a better choice so short socks could be worn by the ladies and the boys did n't have white socks peeking out under their pant legs ' hems.All arrived quickly and in one large box .	1
Excellent article.It was what I expected.Excellent Shoe and good service delivery.I am satisfied with the package.I recommend them.My daughter loves it .	1
My Doctor Who wannabe son asked for this shoes , and he is THRILLED with them . Fit well and look great with a red bow tie and fez .	1
Always in style , no matter what era ! These converse shoes are the exact style I wore in the 80s and my dad wore in the 50s . Now my daughter is wearing them today . They dont provide any kind of cushion or support , I am so surprised they were actually worn for basketball back in the day . Fashion and color choices make these shoes a forever classic .	1
Nice fit , looks like the picture . Delivered promptly , price was excellent . No issues at all would recommend to others . thanks	1
I stand on my feet for 7 hours at a time in a professional job . This is my shoe w/ a walking insole inside I work it out just fine and no one notices I have on sneaks ! I am on my fourth pair and looking for several replacements . Works great w/ slacks or khaki pants . ( make sure if you are getting them as an alternative to a ladies dress shoe get the all blk w/ the all blk gumsole and all blk laces ) Most dress shoes for ladies are very very uncomfortable even though they are fashionable and this one does both very well . The fact that I can machine wash makes them even more likeable .	1
The ultimate rocker or groupie shoe . So cool and never goes out of style . Wear them with a tux or jeans or a mini-skirt . You can not go wrong with these shoes . Great price . In Europe they cost three times more !	1
Born in the mid 60 's and going through the 70 's , my mom would always buy me these . Still feels the same to.Every time I wear them , it really takes me back to those fabulous 70 's .	1
They 're classic converse - what is there to say ! ? I 've never had a pair , but they fit as I thought they would . They 're a little more narrow than I expected , but that 's not really a problem . They fit true to size ... I originally got a slightly larger one , but sent it back for my true size .	1
Just your basic , hi top chucks . I have them in almost every color , and they are a good shoe when you need the ankle support.Will only give 5 stars if the item goes above and beyond expectations , which is why I only rated 4 stars . .	1
these shoes are very cute and comfortable realmentes find them at a very affordable price more to give away this Christmas will be the perfect gift for my brother .	1
I knew I had the best shoes when my then 10 year old cousin went nuts for my pink hi-tops a few years ago ! And he was even more excited when I gave him the key to my SUV so he could see the new pair of limegreen ones I had just purchased.I think that I wore the pink ones while travelling in California a few years ago . While we werehaving lunch in Santa Barbara one day , I noticed a store across the street and found some supportsthat allowed me to do even more walking while on that 2 week vacation . I was in my late fiftiesat the time , and it was fun to see the expressions I got while wearing those shoes ! ! ! Since Imisplaced the old pink pair , I am now replacing them . My favorite shoe of all time ! ! ! Mary	1
Harkens back to my youth . I truly love these shoes ! Fit perfect , get dirty throw them in the wash. Heck yeah !	1
These have been a staple in America for decades . They are sturdy canvas that wears extremely well over time . The soles are rubber and glued . After extreme wear , some parts that are glued can get loosened . Shoe goo can be used to make most if not all repairs on these . So they can last longer than nearly any shoe . They make them exactly like they did decades ago , with the same quality , with one caveat , Converse , the iconic American shoes , are now made in China . This may or may not matter to you . It does matter to me , due to labor practices , and environmental standards , which is why I typically buy New Balance shoes , still made in the USA as of 2013 . I 've worn made in USA converse in the past , but never the new China-made ones . On arrival I could n't tell any difference in the shoe itself , just as sturdy as ever.On a side note : This particular style is pretty trendy among celebrities . My wife saw this color/style on some female singer and had to have them . Lots of female celebrities buy these `` male '' high-tops . Which I find interesting , it does n't look bad at all , but it definitely screams trendiness to me . You can google `` celebrity Converse '' to find pictures of the myriad of celebs who don Converse . If you do or do not want to be trendy , is your call , but these are definitely being revived in current `` pop culture '' . To my wife , that is great , emulating her favorite artist , to me , I would n't be caught dead in them due to that reason alone . Although I thought about buying a matching pair just to confuse her , and be `` that '' weird matching couple , since pop culture has made them unisex lol.Hope that helps !	1
I 've been wearing Chuckie 's since I was a kid ( over 40 years ! ! ) . Original Chuck Taylor 's are the biggest icon ever to hit sneakers , with the same bulletproof looks and simple construction throughout the years . They might offer zero arch support ( easily fixed with a set of insoles ) , and can wear down a bit faster than newer brands , but there is no denying that , for the price paid , there 's no finer example of what a sneaker is.With all of the new colors available , it has and will always be the king ... .buy a pair and find out for yourself why .	1
Excellent ! ! They fit my daughter perfectly . They are her second pair . The first pair lasted and lasted ! ThAnks for a great pair of shoes !	1
you know the shoe and you know the star . the comfort level is the truth and they feel so good and have much style and Profile then as now . I have bought Chucks all through the years and they are always chill and they got style . real nice , real nice .	1
Bought these for him and he enjoyed them . Very flexible and easy on your feet . I own a pair of these myself , and although the sole can get scuffed very easily , it 's still a great shoe in regards to running or when you need black shoes for your outfit . Runs a half size bigger than usual so know your size before you order onlinel	1
Got ( the white ) these for my 7 year old he loves them ... they are realy cute and they fit him realy nice ... Shoe is 100 % and he says they are very comfortable	1
Cute . Functional , Comfortable , Easy to Clean . My daughter liked the all black design . Exact same quality always delivered by Converse .	1
I SEND THEM TO MY GREAT NIECE IN LAS VEGAS AND SHE LOVES THEM , EVERYONE KNOWS THE QUALITY OF CONVERSE , I HAVE BEEN WEARING THEM SINCE I WAS A CHILD MYSELF .	1
I love my black on black converse tennis shoes , straightgangsta ! Now this is my style . It goes with any I wearthat 's casual or street wear . Thank you .	1
Arrived in good time , fit like a dream , perfect for the actor playing Gladys Herdman ! Just a little pricey but worth it . .	1
My 13 year old daughter loves this shoe and said it looks even better than displayed . It 's very comfortable and the price appeared to be the lowest that we saw at the time the order was placed .	1
Get these ! They stay on ! ! Yes they are a pain to get on.. But they stay on ... And are super stylish . Good for playing or dressing you little one up on showing him off !	1
Got so many compliments on the color . They look really nice on and are so comfortable . Wore them with my Breast Cancer Awareness shirt and jewlry , and they matched perfectly !	1
I remember buying these exact same Chucks for 39.99 not too long ago what happened since then ? Other than that , still a great shoe , comfortable and classic . Wear them with anything anywhere . I did buy my normal size and half a size down but I ended up keeping my normal size . The smaller size did fit but I was more comfy in my normal size , I do n't feel that they run abnormally large . I am now ready to order in pink and green next . I love the high tops , I never liked how the low tops looked on me , the high tops offer more option and style in my opinion .	1
My daughter found these at a major department store , the last pair they had and the clerk went to check the sizes and had one 6 and one 8 so she checked other stores and we could not get any . I came home and looked them up and they were basically the same price and they were sent to my door . Now for a dance team she needs another pair and I will just order them from here , so easy ! Thanks !	1
While I have to agree that these seemed better years ago , they were still what I was looking for and what I expected . Received quickly and fit well . You ca n't beat the classics .	1
I live by converse . I wear converse everyday . It goes with everything and I love it . I really liked the black one and had always wanted to own one so I am happy XD	1
This pair was for my son . All 5 of mine love these shoes and wear them until they are literally in tatters .	1
Retro shoe , great fit for toddlers with a little extra to room for wide baby feet . Look really cute , good price	1
I like the shoes but they sent me the wrong color ( Kelly green instead of Charcoal ) so I had to return them and order the correct color again which is a somewhat hassle . Shoes runs a bit bigger but not too much ; I had to tie the laces a little tighter . They are good looking with reasonable comfort but not too much arch support . I guess you can say they are a fashion statement and good for short walks . Overall , I like them .	1
The Converse Unisex Chuck Taylor All Star Hi-Tops were a gift that I gave to my Nephew from the Netherlands . This is what he picked out from many possible choices . They were sent to him and as far as I know he liked them very much . Apparently , they were very popular in Holland . He was 16 at the time and in high school .	1
Fit is true to size and she loves them . She is fourteen and they are apparently all the rage . Not good for someone with a wide foot .	1
Nothing to tell you more about these shoes of what you surely already know . They are great , my favorite ones even because I live in the Caribbean and the canvas is fresh and my feet do n't like sweating ...	1
I wear a size 7M and was leery about ordering one size smaller , but did it and I am very happy . I use orthopedics in-soles which fit inside nicely too . Very comfortable shoe and quality is excellent . Highly recommend . With Amazon , if the shoe does n't fit , return it for the right size , but on your initial order I recommend ordering 1 size smaller .	1
These boots are so comfortable I wear them almost every day , I combine everything . I am very happy with this purchase .	1
It 's a Chuck Taylor through and through . Not much support but I do n't care . These were for my son and he wears a custom orthotic anyway . So we just dropped it in and he was good to go . He wore these with his tux for the prom . He was stylin ' and comfortable . I do recommend going up 1/2 size if you have narrow feet and a full size if you have a medium width because they run a bit short .	1
Unfortunately I ordered the wrong size . They were good enough to send UPS to my door to retrieve the sneakers . I loved them , but they did n't fit the baby . : ) I would highly recommend buying these !	1
Good fit for my son who has a slender foot . Good colors to choose from ... ..good fit ... ... all good ! Try a pair and see !	1
i liked the idea of getting a pair of converse b/c my now fiancee has a pair he wears all the time . i found this pink pair and i love them .	1
Excellent quality .	1
I now have several in white , red , and black ... I might just have to get a couple more , you can never have too many shoes	1
I have always liked Converse All Stars and when I saw the charcoal color I had to have them . The size is good for me . I had a blue pair ( low tops ) last year and they were snug on my right foot because of a previous injury . Those were a size 8 so I got these in size 9 and now no more pain : ) . They run narrow in my opinion so if your foot is a bit wide I 'd size up .	1
These are extremely tight , and they are meant to . I have some back problems and often wear these under my regular clothes . They help compress my muscles and help align everything . By the end of the day , I 'm sore but the next day I feel great . Will definitely buy more .	1
The shirt is fine , good quality , fresh , comfortable , like the picture . It is a little delicate if you touch with it surfaces irregular ... some strip can fall out . I bought two sizes more thinking about my son could wear it for more time and it will not fit too tight like picture ... maybe that is uncomfortable for a kid BUT although that size fit relax but fine the sleeve is too long , I had to cut it so I think that the better way is to buy it in the correct size or maybe one size more and cut the sleeve . Wherever , my son loves to wear this tee . ( Sorry for my english )	1
First off , I just ordered the shirt late Thursday night & received it at 9am Saturday ; talk about fast delivery ! I was told delivery would n't take place until 12/21 - 12/27 , so kudos on going out of their way to FedEx it overnight.The shirt looks & feels great . I ca n't tell you how well it fits as it 's a gift for my son .	1
both love these shirts.. I get the grey ones for son and white for hubby . They keep the moisture off them when they work and play and a perfect everyday undershirt .	1
I am a huge fan of Under Armour 's workout apparel , and in addition to owning two of these Heat Gear Compression Shirts , also own several each of Under Armour 's Tech T-shirts ( 0382 ) and the Loose Gear shirts ( 0084 ) - I 've written reviews on those as well.Ok , let 's get this right out front - this is a serious athletic shirt . It is n't for everybody . It 's tight - a compression fit , the equivalent of wearing a pair of running tights , but on your upper body . Not everyone likes or is comfortable with this fit , and not everyone looks good in it.Having said all that , it 's a high-quality , great-performing shirt . It provides a lot of muscle support , and wicks sweat from your body to keep you dry . As I said , not everyone will like the fit , especially at first , but the feeling does grow on you after a few wearings . Athletes in competitive team sports - football , hockey , etc . are probably a lot more used to the feeling and will definitely appreciate this shirt.The fact that you do n't have a perfect body need n't intimidate you if you want to wear a shirt that provides a lot of support , regardless of what sport or workout you are into . In fact , if you 're just a little bit soft , it does a nice job of pulling everything into place and holding it there - you might even be surprised how good it looks . You can always wear another shirt over it if you 're self-conscious , just do n't like how it looks on you , or have n't quite burned off enough fat yet . If you have a good physique , what can I say - you 're going to look hot in this shirt . In fact , it 's not unusual to see younger guys wearing it as a club shirt.I would not buy this shirt without trying it on first . I usually wear a size XL in the other , looser Under Armour shirts , but had to size up to XXL to be comfortable in these . They tend to ride up on the bottom or bunch up under the arms if you buy them too tight . I love this shirt in black , but there 's a full palette of colors from which you can choose.The shirt requires a little more care - you ca n't just toss it in with the rest of the laundry . UA recommends hand-washing and drying on low heat , and people not willing to take the extra care have reported problems with the logos peeling off . I 've not had this problem with any other UA shirts in the line-up , even when machine-washing in warm water and drying them in the dryer on low heat , but it may have something to do with the fabric in this particular shirt and how much it has to stretch ( a lot ! ) . Either way , I have n't taken any chances .	1
I got two of these shirts in anticipation of the DC summer heat . Got to try them out for the first time today during my morning run . Kept me cool and wicked away sweat quite nicely . A word of caution , they are a bit sheer , so if you 're bashful get a darker color .	1
This shirt feels great at the gym . It limits the outward appearance of sweat , allows for your body to cool off while working hard.. Comfort is key when working out , and so is working out and not have to worry if you have giant pit stains . Wonderful shirt	1
is the 3rd time i buy compression shirts and is always a great thing to do , other brands or kinds are just not good enough , high quality and low price is all i need	1
there are alot of rip-offs for under armour products these days and I 'm not gon na lie ... I 've tried a few of them to save a little money . but i ended up being very disappointed every time . then going back and spending extra just to buy the under armour to replace it . it is such a great line of products , and very versatile . i use it for hunting , i use it for running , i use it at work . it 's worth the extra money because i know whenever i buy under armour , it 's going to be a solid product . keep up the great work .	1
fits true to size i can wear this with anything since it being a darker shade of purple wont stand out as much but still has that color its great just what i was looking for totally would recommend to anyone !	1
My daughter loves converse so the fact that it fit her witout us having to return or try on in the store was a plus - it arrived on time	1
These fit great and feel great to walk around in . I highly recommend these shoes to anyone for a great shoe for the summer .	1
My wife loves the shoes , however the size convertion was a little off no biggie , just send 'em back and get the right size .	1
I 've been looking for red chucks for a while now . I love these ! ! I would recommend getting a half size to a full size smaller though , they run quite large .	1
Converse has been making these for as long as my kid has been on Earth and longer and now he 's asking for them . He loves them . This is his 4th pair , each in assorted colors . Nothing to complain about whatsoever . They do n't really change much - which is **exactly** the point , right ?	1
Purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter . She wears them all the time . I may borrow them as well .	1
I bought these for my grown daughter for Valentine 's Day and she loved them ! They fit perfectly . Any age would love them..	1
My 4 yr old son needed black shoes for a play he was in . I did n't want to buy dress shoes as he would not get any additional wear out of them . I opted for these black Converse . They were adorable , they fit him well - he is about a size 11 little kids but I ordered the 12 and they are fine with a bit of growing room . He calls them his & # 34 ; Chucks & # 34 ; and thinks he 's cool when he wears them ... well , he is pretty cool - he has worn them several times since the play so overall , it was a good purchase .	1
Love my new , black converse ! ! ! Nice fit and go well with my new pants ! ! ! Very pleased with the product and delivery ! ! Thank you ! !	1
Ok the title is based on Julie Sarinana check out her blog and you too will see why . The shoes arrived on time to my girlfriend house . A perfect fit she said , as she is wearing a mens 4.5 for her 6.5 . Strange I know but that how they are listed . I purchased these Converse in White Canvas shoes for my little asian cutie she is 5'1 & # 34 ; and maybe 118lbs . My girlfriend will be wearing these new Canvas Converse at Disneyland . She 'll copy the amazing fashion style recommendation in Sincerely Jules web site . The complete outfit for the day at disney : Tangerine Sweatshirt , Crisp WHITE Roxy Cotton Shorts , Sneakers : White Canvas Converse Chuck Taylors , Sunglasses : Karen Walker . Another great purchase . Enjoy your All Star White Canvas Shoes . I am sure enjoy my asian cutie wearing hers .	1
Nice quality , great fit , and a fun pair of shoes that are reflective of my personality . Makes you stand out .	1
They are comfy and flat . I did not want to buy specific weightlifting shoes due to price so ended up with these . They perform well while squatting and lunging though they do have a small toe box .	1
These run bigger than normal tennis shoes ... my son has only worn these since he was born . We are on our 19th pair and get tons of use out of them ! !	1
I have wanted Green chuck taylors for the longest time ! I got these right away and loved them ! They are the bright kelly green as pictured . I am a women 's 7.5 usually , but 7 's fit perfectly . I was also really happy with the price this seller had it as . Anywhere else seemed to be $ 60 or more ! Ca n't complain about these shoes at all except that I 'm worried about getting them dirty !	1
Love itWas a pr & auml ; sentIt was verry NiceEvery BodyLiked itAnd gave onlyCompliment 's on the item	1
I had been wearing converse for years I had them in every single color but never an all white pair lol so I ordered them and they just look amazing with anything u wear I usually wear a 5.5 in boys I ordered a 4.5 in men 's they fit a little big so for next time I 'll ordered a size 4.0 overall I live them shipping only took 2 days I would recommend .	1
From high school on , these have been a staple . Nothing much to them , just canvass and a fairly poorly supported insole on a fairly sturdy shoe bottom . Cool and comfortable , these are the perfect & # 34 ; knocking around & # 34 ; shoes . No delivery issues - came in the two business days promised by Prime .	1
I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM .	1
Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lo Top Black Monochrome CanvasI love this Converse , excellent quality and stile looks sexy : )	1
This shoe is as to be expected strong and durable for my teenager - she loves it and I am very happy with this purchase	1
Ordered for my daughter for Christmas . Fit perfectly and she loves them . I would easily recommend these to anyone . Great shoes .	1
You cant go wrong with Chucks . I have been wearing them for the passed year out here in Afghanistan . They hold up nicely in the rough terrain and keep my feet cool during the summer months when the temperature reaches 130 F degrees . When I am back in the states , I wear pencil skirts and pumps to the office but I will never outgrow Chucks . I wear them on the weekends during coffee runs or for grocery shopping .	1
this sneakers is just what my daughter ask for , the sneaker fit her great . the sizes are true to what they say they are.and converse sneakers last a long time . it a real good value for these shoe , worth every penny .	1
Got these for my niece for her birthday . She seems to like them . They fit perfect soooo yeeaah that 's it	1
These were huge for my son . Which is likely on me ... we just put them in his closet for next year and bought a second smaller size for this year .	1
I get compliments on these shoes everytime I wear them . The fit perfectly as expected and are very comfortable . If you are considering whether to purchase them or not , DO IT ! You wo n't regret it . They also make a good gift for all ages . These shoes are timeless .	1
Okay I love everything Converse . I already had pairs of Converse in sizes that fit me , so sizing was n't an issue at all , I ordered the size that all my other Converse are , and it fit me well.The green color is just awesome though , lots of people have commented on them . I like Converse in every color , but the greens are probably one of my favorites.If you like Converse All-Stars and you like the color green , then go for it .	1
I chose gray/white , they look & feel great . I wear them all the time , and of course they get a little dirty .	1
zapatos de excelente calidad , muy comodos para realizar cualquier actividad llegaron en el tiempo acordado y sin ninguna novedad los recomiendo ampliamente	1
Purchased these for my 12 yr old daughter and she is in love with them.. wears them EVERY day . Shipping time was immediate ! I can not complain .	1
Very nice looking shoe and very comfortable ! ! You can wear them all day and no problems.I bought them for my daughter and she loves them .	1
always wear a size 11 in every shoe . these were too big but i wear an orthotic/insole so they were perfect . most definitely order a size down	1
They fit great width wise but seem a little long , but I think that 's just how Chuck 's are . I wear size 7.5 in women 's shoes and the 5.5 were a good fit for me .	1
My 11 year old granddaughter asked for these for her birthday . I was happy to find these Converse shoes on Amazon and the price was less than any other site ! She beamed when she opened them and could n't wait to try them on ! They were perfect ! I was so pleased that she liked them and I got to be a big hit with my granddaughter !	1
Great shoes good price arrived quickly great Job Love the shoes what else can I say Converse shoes like these are cool and durable Happy customer	1
I enjoy them every time I wear them . Comfortable , sporty and hip enough so that my daughter 's friends actually listen to me .	1
DONT stop selling the low top of these chuck taylors . I keep finidng high top ones but finally found these low top ones and boy EVERBODY loves these shoes on my baby boy ! ! I must admit they look so much better on him than I even thought . I am so pleased Im gon na buy another pair in a different color . They really do look awesome on and as long as these shoes havebeen around they still top the cake with comparable cloth sneakers !	1
This Product is highly recommended.Ordered my regular shoe size . Perfect fit.Color , Material and size exactly what I wanted .	1
I love these shoes , so cute and I wear them every day ! I wish I had them in every color . And they shipped so fast	1
the shoes look good , they are confortable , and the price is not that high , these are the classic converse , they are good	1
They fit better as expected , I 'm a 12 EE and the 12 M fit fine . I ended up returning to get something else but they fit good ( even if you have duck feet like me ) and arrived as described .	1
For a long long time I have wanted a pair of these in pink . I think years ago these were made only for males because my brothers had them . From time to time I have seen them but never in pink . Well finally pink and I jumped on them as soon as I saw them . I have worn them and got some really nice compliments . I am a & # 34 ; young & # 34 ; senior and I wore these with my crop jeans and with my long jeans folded up and they really look great ! I am a fashionista !	1
I keep buying this shoe because I know exactly what size I need and it 's comfortable and Converse does n't change it to something that does n't work .	1
I keep buying both the low profile and high top versions for my son as he grows , and he loves them . The shoe fits nice , has a good flexible sole for running on both pavement and grass , so for a toddler , that is a plus . Also , he can wear them all day , and is comfortable . I think the fabric is good for developing feet that need to stretch , but still give enough support . He likes these way better than the Saucony 's I bought him , which seemed to never break in , and were a bear to put on .	1
I bought these shoes specifically to wear while I am performing squat exercises when working out . Of course , I wear them for the whole workout , not just during the squat . I do n't wear them any other time , they are strictly gym shoes for me.For working out they are excellent . They keep my feet flat and stable when I am straining to lower and raise the weight bar on my shoulders . They are comfortable and utilitarian during the other exercises.I would not wear them as everyday shoes - to me they are not *that* comfortable . I only wear them for about six hours a week , but they are good quality and still look brand new after many months . If they wear out before I do , I will certainly replace them with the same brand and style .	1
I love my classic converse ! The are very comfortable and I can wear them with pretty much anything ! I love them ! They are exactly what they described them to be ! Very nice !	1
Hey , it 's Converse , what more needs to be said ? ? ? My son bought these for his girlfriend for Christmas as they were on her Amazon wish list . Let 's hear it for & # 34 ; old school & # 34 ; chic ! ! ! : )	1
Perfect bright color , love these Chucks ! A perfect new look for a wonderful classic , goes with everything , but gets noticed , too !	1
Getting these in white was n't that easy , had to wait a couple of weeks for the price and size and color options to be right . But finally got them and my girlfriend was pretty happy ! The fit just right .	1
Always loved Converse , so this was perfect for my son . He also loves the bright color . The fit is perfect .	1
daughter loves these shoes for school . fast shipment with no issues . will buy again from this seller .	1
Purchased for my daughter . She loves the sneaker , runs slightly larger than normal shoe size . I would order 1/2 size smaller .	1
As anyone who has ever own Chuck 's knows , they are narrow . However , they stretch out after a while . My husband has wanted a pair for a few years now and this was the only place I could find his size . He has big old Flintstone feet .	1
One of the very few places that sell these above a size 13 and a few dollars cheaper than buying directly from Converse.These are the real deal , in case there were any concerns !	1
I bought these for my daughter who wore her previous Converse into the ground . She was a little hesitant about the gray color , but likes it now . She gave them 4 stars because she wishes they had arch support .	1
I 've many many pairs of Chucks in my life and these were just what I expected . True to size , great color , and awesome quality . The shipping time was decent .	1
These shoes hold up better than any of the imitation ones I have tried with a similar style , so they are all I was hoping for . Good quality and the style I like .	1
My granddaughter put these on her 13th birthday gift list and I was fortunate to get the last pair in this size and color . ( Evidently no other color would do . ) Personally , I thought they looked a bit stiff and uncomfortable , but she seemed to find them just right . I loved them because she loved them .	1
these chucks in the charcoal color are darker in person than in the picture . they are true to size for my husband and they are a great neutral color .	1
When buying Converse brand shoes be sure to buy them a size smaller than what you would normally wear with most other brands . Converse uses a different measuring system than other major brands ( which makes no sense to me ) , which is why you should order about a size smaller for males or females . I ordered a female size 7.5 for someone who normally wears a 8.5 in women , and it fit well . Hope this helps !	1
Absolutely Love them . Quick shipment , perfect fit , color and comfort ! Love them . Cant say anything negative about them . Hope everyone else enjoys	1
I wanted a pair of low-cut Cons All-Stars for just hanging out , and as a reminder of the ones I wore as a kid . But for sure I did n't want to spend a hundred bucks ! These are great . Fit is good , quality good , and they came with an extra pair of shoelaces ! No arch support at all , but you need to know that before you buy , so you wo n't be disappointed . I put in a pair of my Dr. Schols inserts and I 'm a happy camper , lol . Have been wearing them constantly since they arrived .	1
These shoes are true to size , are authentic converse , are comfortable , and arrived on time and in the correct color . My only complaint about converse is that they are a bit too narrow . However you can find them at pretty much any shoe store so you can always try them on first before you buy them . I am happy about the price too ( they were $ 10 more expensive at DSW than here on amazon ) . They do n't offer much in terms of arch support , but overall I ca n't complain .	1
I have been wearing Chucks since I came out of the womb . I 've been through many pairs , and after I decided to retire my old black ones due to a blown out heel I wanted to go with something new . The white is really an eye catching color , and more subdued in person than some of the pictures out there . BE WARNED , Chucks are about a size bigger than your actual shoe size . For example I wear a size 7 in women 's , which would be a size 5 in Chucks , but these are really too big so I went with the size 4 . I find the white adds some contrast , especially if you wear dark colors like I do .	1
If you did n't already know , make sure you order 1/2 a size smaller then you normally would when ordering Converse.Love these shoes .	1
I purchased these classic converse to replace the old ones my boyfriend had . They fit true to size and are very comfortable !	1
Unlike what other reviewers said , this shoe is EXACTLY the correct size . I will say , though , the tag on the inside of the shoe has weird sizing information . for instance , it says that my size 11.5 men 's shoes ( US ) are size 9.5 Mens ( US ) ... I ordered 11.5 's and these are , in fact , 11.5 ... I have no idea why the sizing info on the tag is wrong as these do not appear to be counterfeit shoes .	1
I bought them as a present for my boyfriend and he could n't be happier . The color is vibrant and full of life ! Also , converse are great shoes .	1
The shoe is as expected , although a little more mushroom colored than the gray I was expecting , and there was no extra pair of black laces even if it clearly stated that there would be . So , the price was good and the shoe fits , but the lack of the & # 34 ; extras & # 34 ; lost it one star in my estimation .	1
I have been looking for a great pair of Converse to wear with skirts and dresses . It has taken a while to find the right color , but I love this dark green . It is unique but subtle and very versatile . Obviously , the structure of these shoes is well known , the sole is thick and strong with good tread , and it laces up high . My one issue is they ran a little big . I usually wear a 9 1/2 , but I knew I wanted to wear them without socks , so I bought a 9 . Even the half-size down , they are a little big . Still , a great shoe and fabulous color !	1
I thought I 'd never be able to wear chucks because I 'm a half size , and they only seem to sell whole sizes at the stores . I finally realized I could just buy them online ! The shoes took about a week to wear in , but now they fit my feet perfectly .	1
I have 10 pairs of Chucks , and I will keep replacing the ones that get so worn out , as these did . Ca n't go wrong with the classics !	1
Chuck Taylors are about as classic a pair of sneakers you can buy . These pink ones have a great bubblegum color and are perfect for the lady in your life who wants to rock pink kicks and look cool .	1
This are my favorite shoes . For some reason they make me feel slightly quirky . I wear them whenever I need a little positive mental boost ( like taking a mid-term ! ) .	1
These are the standard Chuck Taylors so not a ton to say but ... * These are MUCH brighter than the picture , at least in pink . It 's refreshing but also a bit intimidating . * I said in another review for a different color that buyers should go half a size lower than normal . I repeat that here in this case .	1
This is my second pair of chucks so I kind of knew what to expect . I also have a pair of high tops and love them but decided to get a low top for the summer . I got them in carmine rose and they are such a pretty color , so glad I went with them ! It is a light and airy shoe for spring and summer and the color is n't too girly or childish , I just love it . They will look cute with anything from shorts to skirts to jeans . Converse is a go to classic . But , if you need arch or ankle support these are not for you .	1
First pair of converses and look really good . I went with red cause its cheap but they look great ! ! word	1
I love converse SO much . i wore my old ones until they had holes in them and were falling apart . i just got these and of course I LOVE THEM . they are 100 % REAL AUTHENTIC converse . the shipping was extremely fast , and very safely packaged : ) thank you so much	1
I love these . So cute and just right	1
I love them in every color ! ! : ) The shoes are simple and perfect ! I have worn them for many years and I will continue to do so ! I highly recommend these !	1
These are classic Converse shoes . They arrived quickly . The fit was true to size and they look great with our school uniform .	1
Product itself was great , but the size was n't marked well , so I ordered a 2 toddler . My daughter is 8 years old so I needed a 2 youth . Watch the size you order !	1
Fits well , looks good . Great work apparel for working in a game studio & # 128515 ; A little narrower than I 'm used to . Fit is nicer though .	1
call me crazy , call me weird , call me what you want . A girl in chuck taylors is a girl in my heart . high heels schmigh heels . chucks are where its at . The low key throw em on and classic style you see everyone wear . The first of many for my girlfriend , she will have about 13 different colors ^__^	1
I had been wanting another pair of the unbleached Converse Chuck Taylor 's for years . I am so glad that they fit the same as they did years ago . My feet are a little wide . So I order the unisex size and not the women 's shoes , as I find the women 's fit snugger . These are made well and I 'm completely satisfied .	1
I love my chucks they fit perfect . It was exactly what I expected and at a great price . I would definitely recommend it to everyone that falls between sizes cuz the stores usually only Carrie the full sizes . Half sizes make a difference .	1
I bought these for my 13 yr old son . They cost about the same price at the mall but it 's always a plus when you can avoid going to the mall . Chuck 's run larger so you have to get a size smaller than what you would normally wear . I found that out when I had to do a return and reorder . Other than that , he seems to like his Chuck 's . I 've bought a few more in different colors because he likes them so much .	1
My ... 10th pair of cons in 10 years . If you have never owned a pair of Cons , they will last about a year of regular use . They are not good in bad weather . They do not have any arch support or cushioning on the sole . They are not waterproof . They have poor traction . That being said , I love them just the way they are .	1
I have never been so lifted dependably in all my life , probably since a teen . I can run , work , do anything and they stay in place .	1
I ride horses and some of them are a little on the rough side when it comes to trotting . I feel totally secure with this item holding in the 'girls . ' There is a little bit of bounce , but I guess if there was n't any , I 'd be a boy . ha haDefinitely want to order a size larger than what you 'd usually wear . It can run a little on the tight side . After washing , it feels tight , but then after a day , it stretches out enough to be comfortable.It does take a few wears to get used to it and to `` mold '' it to your body . It can be quite uncomfortable at first ... feel like a straight jacket ... .but only at first , then it 's great . You do n't notice you 've got it on.I 'd recommend this for anyone who wants a good hold . I 'm not crazy about the pink color , but what the heck , it 's not lingerie !	1
What a releif this bra is for me . I can run , jump rope , and perform other aerobic athletic activities without a hint of a jiggle ! This is a muist have for the active well-endowed !	1
This is the only sports bra that I have ever worn that can also be used as a minimizer as well . It worked very good at flattening my big chest making it impossible for the big huge sacks I call breast to even budge one centimeter.The downfalls of this bra is that it is hard to put on the first time and really does not break in and feel comfortable and natural until you have worn the thing many times . Also it took time to put the bra on as it has over 10 hooks to fasten painstakingly one at a time.However , the positive is that I had this same model bra for over 2 years and has survived constant wear , tear , and abuse.To sum up this review it is worth the money if you are up to enduring some discomfort until the bra breaks in and is looking for an excellent minimizer.AS for an actual sports bra for activities where you will be doing alot of moving and flexing of the upper body I do not recommend this bra . You might want to try the Moving Comfort line as they have excellent support for big chests .	1
This is definately a great bra , well made but it runs alittle small , imo . It has a great support built in and I 'm sure it would last a long time as the quality is great . I will try for another size !	1
This is a great product ! It offers the best support for me when I go for a jog or just working out at the gym . It holds you in place and you do n't have to worry about any bounce . You 'll feel super supported and wo n't want to use another bra after trying this one out !	1
If you are a busty woman ( anywhere from C cup or above ) , then this bra is for you . I have tried numerous other ( very expensive ) sports bras , but none has provided the level of support AND comfort that the Enell does . Now , I have no problem with the fact that there are no strap adjustments , but apparently some women find the straps are too short/long for them . It fits me perfectly and I have changed sizes over the years . Be sure to take the time to measure your rib cage ( below the breast ) and across your breasts to determine the correct size to order . The basic calculation is breast size ( let 's say a 40 ) minus rib cage size ( say 34 ) equals your cup size ( 40-34 = 6 ) . Count the alphabet to 6 letters ( in our example , F ) and that 's your cup size . Many products use double and triple D , so an F = DDD as well . As anyone with large breasts knows , it can be difficult to get excited about exercise when every bounce hurts , but exercise is SO important for our physical and mental health . So take a little time to figure out your size , and spend a little extra money , and get a good bra !	1
I 'm a very active person with a 34DDD chest . I am forever on a search for the perfect bra . For sports , this is it . I can wear it in my highest impact activities , and everything stays put . It 's not really attractive , and sure does n't look great with a spaghetti strap work out top , but it does the job . Getting into it is a little tricky ; you start at the bottom hook and work your way up , adjusting your breasts as you go . It is supposed to feel tight , so you might think you have the wrong size at first . But after wearing it for a few minutes it feels comfortable . ZERO bounce or movement . Incredible !	1
I usually wear a regular bra plus two to three sports bras . Now I can wear just one . It is amazing !	1
38DD . You MUST use the Enell specific sizing chart -- as far as I can tell it 's not on the Ammy link , so use the website for your measurements ! It 's Ugly , it squishes , and the fit feels weird at first and did I mention ugly ? It 's also long lasting , and does what it 's supposed to . Keeps the girls still so I can go running . I would not wear it for anything but exercise because after I 'm done it would get a little uncomfortable . However , I 've done up to 2.5 hrs of running and done sprint triathlons in this bra.There is only one other bra I find as satisfactory ( and only discovered it because Enell would not ship to APO/FPO ... and in fact would not even ship to a different address to let someone else mail it to me -- my BILLING address was FPO and they refused to service that ... so do n't try and buy this as a gift if you are going through Enell ... obviously that was before I could pay for it on Amazon ... but I digress ) .Despite my unhappiness with Enell , I do love the product and I 'm vey happy ordering via Amazon has made purchasing this product a viable option again . Particularly as I start making plans to do another sprint triathlon , this style works very well under my suit.Extremely Highly Recommended for larger busted people who are doing something high impact like running.JTG	1
I have tried several types of sports bras , but always come back to the Enell . Have to admit , they are n't the most attractive but you will not find a better supporting sports bra . I wear a D cup in a regular bra . I can run wearing the Enell with no bounce and it makes my run so much more comfortable . I would tell every women to at least try it . In support and comfort , you will not be disappointed .	1
This bra is great for running ... The girls stay in place ! It 's a different feel with this sports bra than with others , but once you get used to it , this bra is perfect for high impact activities .	1
I wanted a bra that kept everything in place whether walking , jumping jacks or running . This bra has kept up with the pace . There are alot of eye hooks , but it works . I would buy another one again if I needed it . I would recommend this bra to anyone .	1
I bought a white Enell about 3 years ago and had it fitted in a store . So that was helpful because I was confident in what size I needed to buy . But the size chart provided is helpful and seems to be accurate for me . This is SO supportive and makes my workouts so much better . Also this is the only bra I can run in . I will say the purple one feels slightly cheaper than the white one I bought years ago . The straps are a little papery/less padded . I 'm not sure if that is because it 's newer and they have changed them all or just this purple one is different . But either way it 's still great and very supportive ! Will probably order one more in black just so I have a clean one at all times .	1
With a 32FF bust playing squash and doing karate can be trying . This bra is like an armour but it allows you to breath and move . NOTHING jiggles ! ! ! You will never buy another sports bra .	1
I had a hard time choosing between the size 2 and 3 . ( 42 bust and 37 rib cage ) The 3 seemed like the best fit for the rib cage , but I thought I 'd need a 2 to really compress everything . I 'm glad I went with the 3 , because if it were any tighter , and it would probably hurt my rib cage . As it is , it seems just right.When I first put it on , I thought it would n't control bounce enough because it felt just a tad roomy in the top part , but it works ! There 's still some movement , but it does n't hurt at all , and I do n't feel like the breath is being squeezed out of me . In fact , I hardly feel constricted at all , other than in the band around my rib cage , and that part is n't uncomfortable at all . The top and bottom control panels do exactly what the video says -- they minimize bounce . I did several jumping jacks without a problem . It 's really hard to believe that it can do that without being squished too much.It does make you look a little like you 're wearing body armor , and under a shirt it definitely does n't look like you 're wearing a normal bra . But I think it looks fine . It just flattens you , and depending on the fabric you 're wearing you can sometimes see the seam between the top part of the bra and the bottom support . Turbo Kick and the elliptical trainer are n't places to have fashion shows , anyway , though , so I 'm definitely keeping mine.Shipper , OneSweetOne , was also fast . I ordered on a Wednesday , got it on a Tuesday -- one day earlier than indicated.UPDATE Jan 31st 2012 . I wore my bra to a hip-hop aerobics class and it worked great ! We did a lot of jumping around and bouncing , and I enjoyed it more than I 've enjoyed aerobics or dancing in YEARS . I think there 's still a shifting movement in the bra , but I honestly do n't notice it since it 's not impeding my workout . I feel like I have better balance and control as I move .	1
I have 40/38 DD size breasts but I love to run . : - ( THis bra has been my go to bra when running , doing HIIT and Turbo Fire . I 've tried other bras such as the Panache and to double bra other bras but nothing compares . My ONLY gripe is that it 's not adjustable and at 64 bucks a bra that sucks especially if you 're losing weight because you 'll have to spend more money on a smaller bra . Get this bra if you 're looking for maximum support . I 'm actually going to buy another one because I do n't want to have only one .	1
This bra does what it claims it will do -- it provides firm support even for plus sized women , and the support does n't go away after washing . I just wish it were n't so shiny . It 's not terribly attractive , just functional , but the straps will show with most clothing , so you may want a lacy camisole over this . Unless they can change the shininess without reducing the support , I 'll live with it 'as is ' . A great bra in terms of function !	1
I bought this bra not with sports in mind . This is not a 'pretty , feminine ' bra . As a large busted woman , I was tired of being disappointed with ill fitting bras . I needed the back/posture support and ample coverage . This bra provides both -- however the drawbacks are : 1 ) the straps are not long enough for me and 2 ) It gives you that 'minimizer bra ' look . Nice wide straps and it provides cleavage coverage . You may want to wear a tank or camisole with lower/open neck tops .	1
If you are blessed/cursed with large breasts you need this bra . I have never had another bra that actually holds you in place comfortably while you exercise without choking you . It is a bit pricey but definitely worth it . I would recommend this to any woman who never thought they would be able to do a jumping jack without hurting themselves or others ! Terrific fit , great bra .	1
I love running , and I hate when flat or small chested woman tell me to get a breast reduction surgery . I wish I could slap them in the face . its not my fault I have big boobs or that guys prefer my boobs over theirs . I love this bra , it is the best ; most supportive bra I have ever had . I can finally run without pain or discomfort .	1
This bra is so secure and hides some stuff too in the back . The bands on the shoulders are wide and do n't hurt . I love this bra so much that I purchased more of them and wear them as a regular bra . The only thing is sometimes I have to come out of them because of blouses with low cleavage or open shoulders .	1
i ca n't wait to try it on . it is so hard to find comfortable bra 's that fit big busted women . i like the fact the hooks are in the front . order came fast !	1
As a bigger lady its hard to find sports bras that fit and work . This one is great . I would suggest looking on enell 's website to get your size .	1
keeps the ta tas in place ! go to there website for sizing info . although front clasps are a bit tricky , i feel like i am in some kind of super hero bra suit armor type thing and feel excellent support at the gym .	1
I have used a version of this bag for many years and keep coming back to it . I tried a Baggallini bag recently and decided I did n't like it so well because it actually had too many compartments for me and I 'd forget where I put things . With the Ameribag , I find things more easily . I also need to carry a water bottle with me and this bag has just the right amount of space for it , whereas I did n't have that with my Baggallini . I have lengthened the strap to use it cross-body style , which is more comfortable for me to carry . The extra-small version is just right for me , a short person . The larger ones are a little too big . With this size , I can fit a baglet inside , which can be handy at times . I like that this nylon bag is washable . It cleans up easily !	1
Great bag and I love the nylon material . The color in person is richer in red than in the picture .	1
This bag holds a lot of stuff in easy-to-access pockets . The wide shoulder strap is very comfortable and has a no-slip backing that keeps it in place . The overall design of the bag does seem to cause less stress on my shoulder and back . I will buy another one in a different color .	1
This is a review of the Crimson color distressed nylon bag , extra small.I have major back problems and chronic pain , and went on a search for a lighter everyday bag . This is perfect . I work in a casual office and can carry this everywhere without worry that it wo n't be suitable . I have a smaller clutch that I use for occasions that call for more formal attire.While not one of those women who carries around everything but the kitchen sink , I am still amazed at how much I can fit into this bag . Everything that was in my regular purse fits in here , with room to spare . What 's more , this bag is noticeably lighter than my purse , which is precisely what I needI agree with other reviewers that the inner water bottle holder is small . However , it does a great job of holding my sunglasses , which is more useful to me for daily use.The only negative is the small , narrow size of the two outer pockets . I love the magnetic closures , but the so-called cell phone pocket is too small for my iPhone with Otterbox case . Instead , I use it for my little pill container . I have n't put anything in the smaller side pocket ; seems to small for most things.Other reviewers have rightly pointed out that this is NOT the classic bag , no matter what the advertisement says . It 's the newer HBB-evo bag . That does n't bother me , but it may bother someone else , so I think it 's worth mentioning . If you look closely at the picture of the crimson bag , it shows only one flap pocket on the side . There are actually two.I guess I 'm so impressed with the overall weight and function of this bag that the outer flap pocket design is really not a big deal . For an organized person like me who strongly believes there should be a place for everything and that everything should be in its place , this is almost perfect .	1
I purchased this due to the good reviews it has on Amazon . I plan to use it for long day trips , weekend trips , and vacations . It has plenty of room , separate sections , and extras that will work out great for holding all kinds of stuff ! I ca n't wait to use it ! I have smaller bags like this where the strap goes across the body , and I prefer that when traveling or walking around all day long , but I definitely needed a bigger one ( but not too big - haha ) . I feel safer knowing it ca n't be stolen from me and it is also more comfortable to wear . It is made well and I like that the material will repel water . Great bag !	1
I own multiples in this style Kipling . While I think it is plain for me for everyday , it makes a fabulous travel or day trip bag , especially if you have children . The bag is lightweight with tons of organization . The strap is comfortable and does n't rub and burn your skin . it 's a durable but soft , unlike some other nylon strap bags I own ( and need to get rid of because they do n't compare ! )	1
I 've totally embraced the cross body bag style and I was looking for a brown bag for Fall after enjoying my Keen Brooklyn II Hemp bag all summer and loving all the organization that that one offered . This is almost identical in style so it was easy to transition all of my items into this secure bag and still have them relatively in the same spots . As a bonus - this bag is lighter ! It even appears to be water resistant , although I do n't plan to test that theory . It holds my wallet , make up bag , small umbrella , two pairs of glasses , ear buds , cell phone , Kindle , and various little items in the interior small zip sections like keys , gum , kleenex , etc . I even squeezed a lunch bag on top and was still able to zip it shut thanks to the adjustable flap snap . This will be a great bag for travel as well but for day to day commuting into the city with slots for everything and everything secured with zippers , it 's great . And although it lists for $ 78 on numerous websites , I found it on Amazon for $ 55 . Sweet ! Thanks , Amazon ! Oh and the monkey is cute too .	1
I ordered this ring because I needed something gold on my right hand to go with another ring . It 's very pretty , just a bit too yellow . I still like it and will wear it when I need to balance out the gold .	1
i really like this ring , great for everyday or dressing up . it is a little thick but the gold looks very real in person . i already got one compliment on it .	1
Fits , is wearing well ... looks good . Only things I would say is the gold is a little too bright/shiny for me .	1
Very pretty . Looks like the real thing . No one has ever asked if its real , they just assume it is and that it 's worth a lot !	1
I wish I read the actual reviews when I put it on my wish list . Come to find out , you need to ORDER IT IN A LARGE SIZE ! Once I purchased a larger size , it is beautiful ! Excellent quality and matches well with my wedding rings .	1
This is a very useful bag and is as described . The only caveat is the leather - it 's rather stiff and not very good quality . That said , it 's a bargain for the price .	1
I LOVE this bag/bilfold ! It fits in my compact little purse ... but doubles as a purse in itself . What could be more perfect ?	1
I was looking for a bag that was small enough that I would n't have to carry on my shoulder or would be too heavy ( I have a medical condition ) . This bag had enough space for all my important credit cards , and a handy one for my driver 's license and a mirror next to it . It has a change compartment in the back , also a compartment for bills and another zippered compartment on the inside . On top of that , there is space to fit my cell phone , lipstick , nail file , and it could accommodate a couple more items ( small though ) . It has a small hand strap that pulls out from inside the bag and a long strap if you wanted to use it as a shoulder bag which can easily be taken off . The leather is quite soft and the bag itself looks quite classy . The only complaint I would have is that the snap that closes the bag can be hard to close , but it is very secure . i would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a small bag that accommodates all your important stuff .	1
I really like the nude color of this clutch as I can use it with different outfits and colors.The size is perfect for my cell , lipstick , cards and ID . Lots of space in a small bag .	1
I bought this purse as a backup because I like the pockets and various compartments and do n't like to carry a large purse around with me . I also like that it has a strap that I can put around me and there I go out shopping without worrying about where my purse is	1
This is the fifth Buxton of this style I 've owned . They are a grab and go item when running errands/shopping . Because I tote my own canvas and insulated shopping bags to the farmers ' market and grocery stores , I no longer carry a hand bag/purse . The Buxton clutch is tossed into the shopping bag.As to layout , credit card slots are in perfect location , easy to see and access . I use the checkbook holder for folding money ( the little that I carry ) . There 's a zipper compartment for plenty of coin , spare key fob is attached inside , mirror is attached on flap , and there 's room for cell phone , lipstick , kleenex , what have you.I have tried other higher end wallets which look good but ca n't touch the organizational ability of this clutch . I use it without the easily removable strap.I would be hard pressed to find the quality and convenience at this price anywhere else . I 've owned black , beige , brown , navy , and red , and they are all equally attractive ( do n't look cheesy ) .	1
I had just about given up all hope of finding a replacement for the wallet I have had for more than 15 years . This one is almost identical to my old one ; only the color is different . It is sleek , functional , well built and even arrived earlier than anticipated .	1
My wallet appears to be a taupe color . The colors I would have preferred were out of stock . Having said that , there is nothing wrong with the color I got . It is n't fully leather so do n't yet know how long it will last . It comes with a check book cover which can be removed . Have n't any cash , so ca n't tell how happy it would be in the compartments , but my credit card and insurance etc cards seem perfectly happy : ) . I especially like that the ID view pocket has a hole in the center which makes it much easier to get you DL out when needed .	1
I have had my wallet , card/ck book holder/attached coin purse for about 7 years . It is perfect for me . When my Mom saw it she loved it so of course I bought her one as a gift and she loved it . Then about 3 yrs ago her wallet was lost/stolen and she bought herself a different wallet that she did n't really like . Anyway , we all Prayed her wallet would be returned and 8 months later somebody put in in her mailbox ! ! ! ! Of course the $ was gone but her personal things were in tack.. Today she said she was looking for a new wallet because hers was a little shabby looking ( mine is fine because I do 90 % of my shopping `` on-line '' with Amazon . ( no wear and tear shopping on line ) My Mom said she looked in a few stores and wanted a wallet w/ the change purse attached and has n't found one yet . Well of course I went on Amazon typed in buxton wallets and in 30 seconds I found our wallet . I called my Mom and just asked what color she wanted.. She said black would be just fine again.. I have just started my Christmas shopping ! ! Since my Mom does n't ask for anything it 's hard to buy something I know she would like AND use . So , thank you for still having this wallet on the market . I am going to fill up the credit card slots w/ store gift cards for Her . So a $ 21.00 plus gift turns into a $ 220.00 when it 's opened . I also ordered the key chain/store scan card holder for her . ( Mom does n't keep her scan cards on her key chain so I think she might like it -- I ordered it in red so its easy to find ) I may just order myself another wallet just to save in case its discontinued ... Great organizer/wallet ...	1
Great item ! ! ! Would recommend to anyone who wants a great wallet , perfect size and color for the money . Would purchase again	1
The Buxton Clutch carries the needed items a person must have when entering the world outside the home ! Yep , it carries them all and is easy to carry itself . For me , there is plenty of room for credit cards , ATM cards , a special place for your driver 's license , etc. , plus paper money and even a coin purse.What more could you ask for ?	1
I needed a new one and say this and bought on a wim , But love it , I will buy a new just loke it when it & if ever falls apart !	1
Good quality , handy and functional , no bells and whistles just a leather product that works . I like the coin compartment being on the outside and available without having to open up the whole thing . I do n't like the zipper coin compartments because they do n't open wide enough so this is just right . And the style and color is nice/classy . It also has a check book holder inside and about 5 credit card slots . The place designated for your driver 's license has a cut-out in the center of the plastic to help get hold of it to take it out when needed which is handy . It also has a zipper compartment inside to store stuff you want to keep but do n't use as much . Very nice .	1
I had to replace my Buxton organizer clutch that I have had for years and years and years . Poor thing was definitely looking dog-eared . I was delighted when I received the new one , and found it was exactly like my old one . No cheapening of the product at all.This is not the fanciest purse organizer that you can buy , nor the most expensive . But if you want something that just gets the job done , than this is it . I expect that this will last for years also.Definitely recommended .	1
This wallet has already been part of my handbag assembly for a week or so and I coudl n't be happier with it-nice construction , design color , texture , and functions great . I 'm very satisfied .	1
I 've only used the Buxton Convertible Billfold ( my last one for over 7 years ) as a wallet ! I love the leather and color choices that are available . You get a great coin pocket with snap closure , insert for your license with removable plastic card pockets with another snap closure , plus your bill compartment . It 's a great wallet for a wonderful price ! !	1
My favorite style , by my favorite company ! Buxton really makes nice items that stand the test of time . I was so happy to see all the colors and styles available . I would not hesitate to purchase item again .	1
This is a very nice wallet . I purchased this one to replace the exact same wallet . My old wallet was identical to this but was about 15 years old . ( They do wear out after 15 years of constant use . ) Buxton always makes beautiful quality leather goods . I like that the change purse closes with a metal clasp and not a zipper . I especially like that there is a divided change purse -- - I use one side for pennies and the other side for all other coins . Also , I like that there are two paper money slots -- -- I use one side for bills and the other side for checks . ( yes I am very organized . ) I like this wallet very much .	1
I absolutely love this wallet . I 've had it for about 2-3 weeks and its durable and pretty . It looks exactly like the picture , its got plenty of space . The only thing I will mention is that in the cash parts , there is an opening , so you ca n't put loose pieces of paper or anything in there , because it might fall out . Otherwise its great , there is enough space for a bunch of cards , cash and change . The wallet can feel a little bulky when completely full but its great .	1
I really like this wallet . It has plenty of room for bank cards and I do not have to fold up the bills when I put them in the wallet . The only thing that I was originally looking for and this did not have it , was to have my ID in a window outside the wallet so I would not have to open it up in order to show my ID . Aside from that , it was just what I was looking for .	1
Have used this very same ladies wallet two times . It holds everything you need and hold up really well . Will definitely buy this brand and style again .	1
I 've been searching unsuccessfully for a few years for a French purse style wallet , as I do not like the long wallets . This is absolutely PERFECT . Holds everything and is beautiful to look at . Buxton has always been an excellent brand , and they continue to produce beautiful and functional accessories . I am very happy with my purchase .	1
you can fill fill fill it and it still has room to close and snap . it is well made and does n't smell of leather . It says real leather on cards inside it too ! I really like it ! perfect size too : ) AB	1
I like the looks of this wallet and especially the color , and all the spaces for cards and your license . The only thing I had a problem with was the slots for your cards were hard to use . I had alot trouble pulling my cards out , I do like the wallet so I 'm going to keep it and hope they will stretch out a little in time .	1
When I was a young lady ( am now 90 ) , Buxton was a very good name . It has n't changed today , in my estimation , and I am quite pleased with the wallet I purchased .	1
This is the 2nd time I have purchased this wallet . I love it ! ! It has two places for folding money and a divided coin purse . It also has many slots for credit cards and other cards you need to keep up with . It also has a place for your driver 's license . Buxton makes a good , quality product at a very reasonable price .	1
This leather wallet is soft leather , holds cash , cards , and change . It is easy to close and closes tight . Does n't take up a lot of space in your purse .	1
Just like all the others , this is the best wallet on the market . Made well and fits all my needs . Who needs a checkbook in the wallert anymore . I just keep the checkbook in a zipper in my purse for the few times I need it . I like the change purse without a zipper . This should last many many years .	1
Where do I even begin with how impressed I am with this wallet ? It was slightly bigger than I thought it 'd be , but when I opened it up , I discovered why - slots GALORE ! There are probably 20 card slots alone all over the inside of this wallet , and there are 2 large pockets and perhaps 3-4 small ones for receipts , cash , and whatever else you 'd like to store inside your wallet . There is a clasped pouch on one side for your change.Overall , this wallet is extremely well-designed and very useful for those of us who constantly carry a lot of cards with us . The colors are as expected ( I got the warm pink shade ) and the texture is matte , smooth and durable . Plus , the price is unbeatable ! Overall , I 'm very happy with this purchase and will look into more Buxton wallets in the future .	1
VERY NICE , I LOVE IT , ALSO GOT ONE FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SHE LOVES HERS AS WELL ! HOLDING UP GREAT SO FAR !	1
I wanted a small , but reasonable size wallet to fit in my tiny purse , and came across this in Amazon and knew I had to give it a try . The price and quality makes sense . The pink one looks very classy , although a ltitle bulky , but ca n't complain ... There 's many credit card/card compartments and 2 sections where you can put your bills in ( I 'd say one is more than enough , but it 's there ) .Overall , great purchase .	1
Just wish the company had maintained the all leather wallet as opposed to using vinyl on the interior of the wallet .	1
This is the closest thing I have found to a wonderful compact wallet I bought in Italy and used to death . It appears to be well made and I think it will stand up to wear . It has as many pockets and compartments as I need . I appreciate the change purse part that opens up with a snap fastener . Many other wallets have a small gusseted change section that is zippered and does n't open far enough for you to see what change you have . I wanted something that did n't require me to empty all the coins out to find what I needed .	1
Trying to downsize my purse contents and this wallet is perfect . It holds everything that was in my much larger wallet and I love the color . Buxton has been making quality products for years and they continue to do so .	1
I just ordered this item for my wife as a gift . She was very happy with this product . I do n't know anything about it , sinceI do n't carry one of these . All I can advise to the customers is , what she said about this product . She stated that itwas a well known brand , and she liked the soft leather and the well organized compartments in the billfold . She reallyliked the quality and the full rich color of the leather.She advised that , a product such as this , is hard to find in the department stores locally . She was very pleased with thelooks and color , and the percise arrangement and the design . Must be a good one , she is very happy with it.The picture and decription of this item , is right on the money , on the sellers page ... ... ... ... .	1
I love my new wallet ! The color is beautiful and the size is perfect , it is what I was looking for ! I am very glad I bought it ! Also the seller was great ! Thank you so much !	1
has room for what you need to run out of the house , only thing wish the handle was made a little stronger , but overall size is great	1
I bought this purse because I do n't like carrying around a large purse but I need a lot of pockets for all my stuff . This fit the bill perfectly . It 's large enough yet large enough to hold what I need	1
Actually this bag is made great but it has twice as many places to put cards as I need . I bought it so I would always have a small black bag and now I do mission accomplished .	1
I bought this same wallet last year for myself . My mom liked it so much that I ordered one for her as well . We are both very happy with them . I carry a Nokia 1520 cell phone and it fits perfectly , even with my checkbook . So easy to stay organized with all the pockets . Its held up pretty well too , and I 'm not overly careful . I would definitely recommend this .	1
hoping to use it as large clutch wallet . it 's too big for that but too small for a purse for me , an adult woman . It 's nicely made so I 'm hoping to use it as a gift for a younger girl..	1
As with any Buxton product this is a fine quality leather clutch . Bought it for my wife and she loves it . Tastefully designed and nice and roomy with plenty of dividers and zippered pockets etc .	1
Buxton is my go-to for wallets . They have so many compartments that are perfect for all the things you need/want to carry in your wallet . This taupe color is very pretty & goes with any handbag I carry . Buxton is always a great product !	1
This is one of my favorite orders from Amazon and it a great wallet and high quality . I will look for a purse to match .	1
Great wallet , plenty of room for cards , and anything you need in your wallet , holds checkbook and register , only thing can not pull them out . Very well made leather on outside very soft , pretty sure wallet will last a long time	1
This is the best wallet I have ever bought and I am a purse and wallet freak . Look good and fits all .	1
Beautifully made with high quality materials . Very nice and at a low price . It had many more pockets and compartments than were apparent from the pictures and descriptions . Am thinking of getting another one as a spare .	1
My sister and I purchased this clutch and we both love it . The features are great and the clutch color is so rich looking , I would highly recommend ... .in any color .	1
This clutch wallet passed my expectations , very happy with this wallet . The color and suede feel is a great plus . I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a great clutch wallet at a reasonable price . In similar products , other clutch book wallets would not have as much available space , for all items needed to be placed in the wallet . The size can fit into any pocketbook without the bulge when filled , a deep pocket , or used as a carry-along without pocketbook . This clutch is great , and would not be a disappointment to anyone who is looking for this type of wallet . I Love It ! ! !	1
To me it appears almost brown rather than mahogany . It is well made and functional and the price is quite good .	1
This is a wallet every woman should own . I can put everything I had in my previous wallet and much more that I can add to this new wallet . It is leather . I would order it again .	1
I think this is such a great wallet ! Fit everything I needed it to ! Great color ! Love the leather ! Matches my new bag perfectly	1
I was shock on the price of this clutch and what quality I received . Excellence can only describe how pretty and soft the leather is . I have so much pain in my hands , soft leather is a treat to me .	1
I have had several zip around clutch wallets and it is the style I prefer . The color is not fire engine red just a nice red color . The leather is medium soft with a nice feel to it . Love all the card holding spots and the area for a check book is easily used for something else . The snap closure is handy and keeps everything in place , you can access your money without having to open the clutch , just open the zippered area . Having a zipper change pocket on the side is so handy or you can use the zipper pocket in the zip around . When all filled I still found this Buxton clutch to be fairly slim . I 'm very pleased with this clutch and would buy it again .	1
These do n't give me much support but I did not really expect them to . I wear a 32D and ordered a size C they covered perfectly . I feel like this may work better if you are fuller on top . I 'm fuller on bottom and the tabs just pull the skin and makes me look wrinkly . They did give me some support , however they also made a strange cone shape and made me look quite pointy . I would wear these with something that already has some support or is a thicker fabric . However , they will definitely come in handy with certain outfits and would be perfect for a special occasion dress that already has some structure .	1
I am a 34 C. You have to play with them at first to get the look you want , but once you do , they are awesome . They look like I have perky boobs with no bra . Be patient though . Also , they may not work so well with thin fabrics . . . makes the skin look kind of wrinkly .	1
You do have to trim them with a scissor to make them a suitable size for your own body shape and the clothing you are wearing them with . They provide just enough lift , but do n't expect them to make you look like you 're wearing a full bra . They just reduce the jiggle and hold you in place .	1
These definitely take practice to apply without leaving wrinkles . We had to cut this to size so nothing peeks out . Got lucky as it worked the first time !	1
this bra is really comfy and supportive . the only downside i have is that it actually rides a little high , so you ca n't wear it with lower cut tops or it will show .	1
This bra is one of the most comfortable garments I 've purchased in a very long time . It provides the support I want while being comfortable and quite pretty also . I have been purchasing bras at a much higher price , they were excellent ; however , at this price and the satisfaction with the garment I 'll be happy to purchase this item again .	1
This bra fits properly and is beautiful . It 's nice to find a pretty bra in larger sizes . Most of the pretty one stop at size 40 .	1
I love this bra . doesnt ride under arm or did n't even need any adjusting . Plan to buy a few more soon	1
I ordered the black one first and was so pleased with it that I ordered the navy one . Love the satin finish on the back . VERY comfortable with GREAT support and coverage . If the rating went to 10 stars , I 'd try to give 11. : - )	1
This bra fits perfect and I bought it to go with my blue dress . It looks so sexy to , love it	1
Lovely , fits , and the lace pattern is gorgeous . Only 4 stars because I had to bend the underwire in the middle to make it not poke me in the underarm .	1
The bra is certainly not one you want to wear out to the club or for good cleavage . It 's incredibly comfortable and one of my favorite bras for lazy days . However , if you want to show the girls off , I suggest something else .	1
This bra quickly became my favorite . I wear it practically every day . It 's so comfortable and seamless ! I can wear thin shirts and there are no bra-lines showing . Love it .	1
This was a gift . This was excelent and like it . Playtex is good . They arrived on time and has the quality and desing that amazons offers .	1
It is everything as described , however , for me that bra did not cover everything as I expected . Pretty , comfortable . Can also be used as a one size up pusher bra because it is thick enough , but it is not thick thick . I recommend it . My girlfriend liked it too .	1
This bra is incredibly comfortable , and at least for me , it is true to size . I am deployed in Afghanistan , so I do not have the luxury of trying items on before I buy , therefore , I am very impressed with the fit and will be ordering more of this exact bra , but in different colors . The shoulder straps are a perfect width - not too thick or thin . And the back strap is a good width for support and keeps `` bra muffin top '' away : )	1
this is a great bra . it was so soft and comfortable I really like it . I will be buying more in the future and do recommend it toothers .	1
I purchased this slip in a dept store many years ago , & it has stood the test of time very well . Now , it is nowhere to be found locally . But trusty ol ' Amazon has it ! Yay ! Ordered 2 . Black & neutral . So happy to find this item . Ordered by my bust size . Perfect fit !	1
Washes and dries well in the dryer . Stays true to fit and keeps its shape wash after wash . This is the best lace full slip . I will be ordering another one .	1
This slip is not gorgeous or luxurious , it is just okay . I wear them as nightgowns or around the house in the summer . One of the straps consistently twists around the hook which is annoying and keeps me from wearing it as often as I would otherwise . At least it was inexpensive but you get what you pay for , especially in this case .	1
This slip is going to work great under a light colored summer dress . Slip is the perfect length for the dress and fits just as expected .	1
My Mother has difficulties getting out to shop . We found this , knew the brand was a good brand , ordered it and it was just what she wanted .	1
Really like this slip but it runs smaller than my size . I even ordered a size larger than I normally wear . The slip & # 34 ; clings & # 34 ; to your body but does not seem to ride up when wearing . I would definitely buy again but will purchase two sizes larger next time .	1
The fit was good ITS A SLIP WHAT CAN YOU SAY THE ITEM ARRIVED AFTER I NEEDED BUT THAT WAS FINE	1
This is a very nice , well made slip . I plan to order one in a longer version . Sometimes I want the ease of a full slip under my dresses/skirts . I would recommend this . The slip arrived within a couple of days of my order which surprised and pleased me . I got it just when I needed it .	1
Because this item was so inexpensive , I was not expecting much . To my surprise , it was of decent quality . It 's not a luxury item by any means , but it works fine for my purposes . I 'm 5 ' and weigh about 110lbs , with a 34D bra size . I ordered the small , and it fit me quite well .	1
This slip was the most economical I could find online . I rarely need a full slip so I did n't want to pay an arm and a leg . It 's comfortable , cool ( that was my biggest thing ) , and fits well . The straps do tend to fall down a little bit but you could easily stitch them in place . I do n't see this lasting 20 years like my mom 's Vanity Fair slip , but I 'm happy with my purchase and would recommend it !	1
I ordered this slip using Amazon Prime 2 day free shipping and received it one day early . The package was in excellent shape . I am very happy with Amazon Prime delivery.The slip was exactly what I wanted the nylon material feels very good next to my skin and the lace adds a very nice touch to this slip . The fit is excellent and the length was just what I expected . I will be ordering more of these in different lengths and also in black . I wish there were more color options than just black and white . I have purchased other Vanity Fair slips and have not been disappointed with any of them .	1
My second time purchasing this item . I wear it under dresses as a slip is supposed to be worn and it does the job perfectly . I ca n't believe how hard slips are to find and this one is perfect for the job .	1
The slip arrived on time and was just as I expected . It fits true to size . I wanted to wear it under a dress that exposes the top part of the slip , but it just looks too much like a slip . I will definitely use it as a slip , but I want to try and get something else for under this totally sheer dress . I tried wearing a camisole , but it did n't work at all with this dress ,	1
This is a wonderful slip . The fit is perfect and exactly to specified measurements . Excellent value !	1
These are great . They go on how they should and they stay the whole day . I 'm pretty sure they 'd stay a whole week if I wanted them to . They 're very cute too ! One note -- if the fabric you 're wearing is white or somewhat sheer , you might want to buy tan petals instead , as the pink is very light and will show through as a white bra would .	1
I am wearing a wire bra in a parade and do n't want any wardrobe malfunctions . After buying two other more expensive pairs , one too light ( who would have thought that Jennifer Lopez was considered & # 34 ; dark & # 34 ; ) and one whose reviewers swore it was adhesive and it was n't , I finally found these again and they arrived quickly . I 'm SO pleased ! ! ! ! !	1
That I sweat a lot and my skin pores were itching , I have a problem with my skin breathing , how ever they did not come off ... ..I did end up having a nice irritated skin .	1
These work very well . Love the color and the feel . Stick on very smooth and ca n't see under clothing unless it 's a light colored thin shirt . Best I 've found for the price . Very easy on the skin and easy to take off , no pain at all , and stay on all day long . Middles sometimes tend to puff out if sitting or laying a certain way but go back when standing up . Great for the price and no pain when removing !	1
These fit wonderfully , very indiscreet , and I didnt feel them at all . There was no pull when taking them off . Very nice , I would buy again .	1
Love these for helping to hide that bit of exposure that always seems to attract the wrong & # 34 ; attention & # 34 ; . Completes the look .	1
I made a Halloween costume , but it soon became apparent that the inside was n't padded well enough ... Ordered these pretty much last-minute , got them the day of the party , and I must say that they certainly did their job ! I could n't even tell I was wearing them , either . After the party , I ended up falling asleep with them on , and even then when I went to take them off the next day , it did n't hurt at all . It pulled just a tiny bit , like pulling off one of those cheap bandaids with really weak adhesive . Also , they had n't come off at all during the night , and I toss and turn a lot when I sleep , so they seem to last well.I was wearing something with a little bit of padding , so I ca n't speak for how well they will do underneath something very thin , like whether or not the edges will show .	1
When looking for a solid pair of pantyhose I look no further than Berkshire Silky . These are high quality and durable . I love the little extra shine on them , it adds a lot of class.I also love all of the colour options . They have a lot of types of nudes that are wonderful . I have every colour and love them all.I would recommend these to anyone looking for an awesome pair of nylons .	1
These do not bind or roll , perfect for dressing up or wearing to an office . I will buy these again !	1
I am so happy with these ... they feel great and very sturdy . The sizing chart was accurate ... I am 5'6/200 and I ordered 1x/2x which fit fine . The control top is very comfortable compared to other brands . The fabric is very smooth , not too flimsy but not suffocatingly thick either . It also is not snagging like other nylons , nor do I notice any pilling . They are so comfortable , and I expect to get many more wears out of these . I am so impressed with these I just bought 2 more pairs .	1
The product was large , but I am glad I purchased them , they are very roomy indeed . Great Price and I will order again .	1
these are the most durable ph i have ever bought , they come in aarray of colors ultra sheer to opaque , designs.. something for everywomen in you	1
These fit nicely and are very comfortable . Great product and excellent value . What else can be said about pantyhose ? ? They fit and stay put	1
I hate panty hose . I bought these because for my size I was told this was the best brand . They fit fine , did n't ride up or roll down , and did n't bunch up around the legs . Wo n't plan on wearing again but it 's good enough for the one time I needed them .	1
This is my second garter from Rago and it 's amazing . If you 're looking for shapewear , this is the brand you want . Do n't bother with Spanx , they 're not gon na hold you in . They 'll smooth all the lines , but this one will give you the firmed up , 1950s look . I work at a 1950s clothing shop and I 'm not the only girl who wears Rago ! Also , I 'm a petite girl and Rago has sizes for me . Shapewear in smaller sizes can be difficult to come across.Anyway , Rago is an amazing brand , please do n't hesitate to get something from them . & # 60 ; 3	1
Very sexy and gives nice finished look under your favorite retro dress . I love it . Pulls in without rolling down at the waist or hiking up . Nicely made .	1
I wear a rago 1359 obg every day . with it on I have a flat tummy again . Wearing a girdle does meanwearing panties under ( Vanity Fair Nylon Rivissant ) - to help put it on and stockings ( Berkshire It Fits ) toprevent ride up . Dressing in the morning takes a bit of time but my girdle does stays in place . At first it is tight , then comfortable , and then I forget that I have it on . I do not have that girdled look and I really dolook better with my girdle on .	1
I thought the hooks were too small for my bra straps- but a kind commenter helped me out . I now realize they wrap around the bra strap and hook to themselves . So now that I know how to use the strap it works well but is not super comfortable . I 'd recommend it still though because it beats having your straps fall down .	1
For $ 7 you get 4 of these things - what more can you ask ? I bought these as opposed to buying new racerback bras . They are certainly tricky to install - probably best if you ask a friend for help . BUT once in place , they work really well to keep your straps in place , and if you have a top or dress that dips in a little as I do , they are great for helping to hide your straps ! The beige color is more of an ivory than a nude , which was my only disappointment . But glad I got them !	1
They serve their purpose to keep bra straps on the shoulders . They were what I expected them to be , period .	1
A perfect fit for grandmother to wear daily . Easy to wash and dry and fabric was comfortable for daily wear	1
This night gown is very pretty and a nice clear shade of red . It is comfy in terms of fit but the fabric makes it clingy and warm specially on a humid night . I was hoping for a breezy , cool nightgown and should have paid more attention to the description of the fabric	1
I have been buying Shadowline night gowns for years . They took the place of the Vanity Fair ones I use to be able to find . With this recent purchase I noticed that the fabric IS a lighter weight compared to my other Shadlowline gowns . Maybe the company is trying to cut down on their cost and therefore using lighter weight fabric . Either way I love the color and am happy with it . If they go any lighter in the fabric weight I will NOT buy anymore .	1
Great gown and the material is wonderful . Bought the red and petal pink . Red bold , pink deep . These are quality . Little long bare foot , but perfect length in slippers . 5'3 & # 34 ; Will come back and purchase other colors and from this company bought darker colors due to not wanting to be sheer looking in the light . These are what I wanted . Wash delicate HE machine and use Tyler detergent . Hang to air dry . Then quick fluff in air HE dryer . Wonderfull in feel and fragrance .	1
This gown is very well made and great weight . I have other Shadowline gowns and they wash well and color stays true . I would recommend this product to others .	1
A little too transparent . Not so bad that I ca n't wear it . Pretty color . Size seems true . Mine was `` soft peach '' . A nice color .	1
I was happy to see this style of gown that is almost impossible to find in a store . I had several that were identical to this made by Vanity Fair years ago . They were the best gowns ever . This one by Shadowline is a close second . It 's comfortable and lasts a few years before fading . I have the sapphire color which is not see-through . The lighter colors are see-through . It 's made in Mexico .	1
Love the color and this gown washes so nicely . Nice and long to give that extra warmth and keeps the shape really nice too .	1
All the Shadowline products I have purchased fit perfect and the gown or robes have been well made . I would buy Shadowline products again .	1
Very elegant looking gown . Fits nicely . Washed up very well . Packed well for travel . Would definitely purchase this gown again .	1
I bought this for my elder mother , who wanted a LONG nightgown . Turns out it was a little too long for her : - ) and I hand hemmed it . Not a big deal . she is very particular about the length of her gowns . Quite a pretty gown , nice color , nice neckline and coverage ... .only wish the fabric was not so thin !	1
surprisingly warm and soft feeling . Beautiful , good price , an excellent buy for anyone to enjoy . I love it anytime , any place .	1
I have bought Shadowline long gowns for several years . I love the colorsthey are so comfortable and last for a long time . Own almost all the colors.THEY ARE WONDERFUL AND BEAUTIFUL	1
Having previously purchased a Shadowline long gown in 2002 ... .I was in desperate need of a new one ... with red being my favorite of colors , this was a no brainer . A red Shadowline ... hands down ! My previous purchase was from a local upscale dept store and through the years it has seen it 's share of some rips and tears ; however it is still together , just a lot of wearing , but I will not part with it even though it has now been retired.I 'm so glad this item was available ... and will be a continued customer of Shadowline ( until maybe I have every color ) and Amazon ... amazing service ~	1
I like to put this on when I get up as a coverup when I make breakfast . Pretty looking gown .	1
Since a few customers have commented that the quality has changed- and I have NOT found this to be the case , I want to include some information from a comment by one of the sellers . It will be after my own review . I have worn these gowns for more than 20 years . I used to purchase them at Dillard 's Dept . Stores , but they quit selling them some years ago . I was so happy to find them available here on Amazon because absolutely NOTHING I have found , for any amount of money , has been as nice as the Shadowline . The pale pink , peach , and periwinkle are not quite as opaque as the other colors but I do not find anything unusual about that ( think white pants ! ) . If you find the darker colors to be too revealing , you should probably consider flannel nightgowns . Just saying . : - ) ___________________Shoppers please note : There was a short period of time ( late 2011 ) when Shadowline used a different fabric for the Petals gowns in Holly Red and Deep Lavender . It was not as nice as their traditional Opacitrique fabric . When they changed this in 2012 ( and changed the color names to Red and Purple ) , the listings got mixed up here and were combined into the same page ( for Purple and Deep Lavender ) . ALL of the new Petals gowns are made from the same fabric now , which is their trademarked Opacitrique fabric -- the original Shadowline Petals fabric . The new owner is extremely picky about the quality of his products . And I believe the Deep Lavender and Purple are now the same gowns . If you have doubts , it is a simple matter to contact the seller of whichever size & color you are viewing and ask them whether it is Opacitrique fabric : select a size and color , then click on the seller 's name that shows up . On the right side of the page , scroll down to the link that says Contact Seller . Hope this helps !	1
I bought this for my Daughter in Law for Christmas . She has worn Shadowline gowns for several years and appreciates that the fabric is heavy enough that she can go around the house with the young children with out worrying about having to put on a robe first . The gowns are comfortable as well as durable . Had difficulty finding them for the past year or so and understand the company has changed hands , but these gowns appear to be equal in quality as the older ones she has .	1
the color is as beautiful as in the picture and very very comfortable . fast shipment also . worth the money spent	1
I love the Shadowline nightgowns because they 're comfortable & the fabric is usually thicker than similar nightgowns by other manufacturers -- the only complaint I have about this one is that the fabric is lighter weight in this rich purple color -- the lighter colors use the thicker fabric and they should 've used the same fabric for the purple -- the lighter the nylon fabric is , the more static-prone they are -- not so terrible , but an issue nonetheless .	1
Well made with opaque fabric of a good weight . Past reviews extolling the fabric convinced me , and the design is attractive . If it came in another color in my size , I 'd buy it .	1
By accident I purchased my first Shadowline gown back in 1995 . Have been buying them ever since . They are the best gowns . Material is soft ... and wears like iron . The length is perfect . I love my gowns long ... ..not ankle length . I am 5'6 & # 34 ; and the gown brushes the top of my foot . This gown is worth the money .	1
I have a 96 year old Mother who still wears girdles with garters . Therefore , I could not find any & # 34 ; standalone & # 34 ; stockings at all ; Everything is now a pantyhose . I tried these stockings first to see if I could get a color match and size . She loved them , so I ordered more .	1
they fit really good and they feel fantastic on my legs . love wearing them..will buy more . they make my legs feel sexy	1
Bought these for my girlfriend . They are not her choice but she wears them for me . Definitely a long of fun compared to panty hose . I do n't think you will find a better bang for your buck . Do n't forget the garter belt !	1
I find & # 34 ; control top & # 34 ; pantyhose very uncomfortable . Thigh-highs are the best solution , and these are reasonably priced . I ordered one size up as I have large sized thighs ( I am & # 34 ; pear shaped & # 34 ; ) . The color , & # 34 ; nude , & # 34 ; is a bit whitish for my needs . I have medium color caucasian-type skin .	1
These are really ice hose . I am short and plump and they fit great . They are actually true to size .	1
At the moment , I can only wear nylons on one leg.The other foot is still wrapped from surgery and will befor another few months.I recommend these stockings even if you can use both.They stay up without garters or garter belts . No need forpantyhose . The elastic is firm but not too tight.I may use them when I have the use of both legs .	1
The stockings are excellent quality and I am very pleased with them and will probably buy more in the future .	1
I have been on the prowl for thigh highs that do not have the very uncomfortable synthetic material to hold them into place . I thought these were it , but I was wrong - I failed to read the `` Elastic leg bands for stay-put support '' part , but I did not give them 4 stars due to my human error . They received 4 stars because the `` fantasy black '' was hella black , barely sheer . Maybe the `` off black '' would have provided the sheerness I was looking for.I thought about keeping them any way , but I finally found what I believe to be a pair of Berkshire thigh highs with lace and without thigh choking rubber involved so I 'm sending these Sheer Thigh Highs back . If these are the kind of thigh highs you are in the market for , I suggest ordering a size up because my thighs are small - I 'm 5'4 '' , 120 lbs - and the C-D still dug in enough to create that unsightly bulge at the top . I believe if they were one size larger , they would still stay in place and be flattering and somewhat comfortable at the same time .	1
I 've always liked Berkshire hosiery and these thigh highs are good . I ordered queen size but my thighs are small so they were a little big , but I could still wear them and they did not fall .	1
SURPRISINGLY THESE STOCKINGS ARE WONDERFUL ! MY Lady loves the way they feel on and they actually stay up on her Big ThighsWOOO ! HOOO !	1
This bra fits true to size and is comfortable . I was able to find this via the id number on the tag of my old bra . Thank you Amazon for making searching for items easy and having a better price !	1
I 'm wearing this bra as I type this rating . It fits very well , and is extremely comfortable to wear . I disagree with some of the other reviews that say this bra is & # 34 ; scratchy & # 34 ; - not at all ! Very smooth feeling and well made . I will purchase more .	1
Been wearing this bra for many years , recently lost weight but cant wear a C cup.Looks great , that is what you expect from Bali	1
Great bra for the money , I just wish there where more colors to choose from for my size . Its great .	1
I have to start out by saying , I thought this was the brand of bra I have been wearing for the last 8 years , ( it looks exactly like what I wear ) I did n't realize mine is a different brand until after I placed my order.. I am Sooo Happy I did order this Bali ! ! The fit ( for me ) is perfect ! ! It stays in place , the back is & # 34 ; U & # 34 ; shaped so I do n't have to keep adjusting it through out the day ! ! It has GREAT SUPPORT , ( I 'm 64 yrs . old , 5 ' 5 & # 34 ; , 137lbs ) . I purchased a few T-shirts at the beginning of summer , little did I know how clingy they would be ( I almost sent them back ) with this Bali Bra however , I look great in those T 's ! ! ! I LOVE & # 34 ; This Bali & # 34 ; Soooo Much Better than my brand ! ! ! I LOVE the U shaped back , I love the support , I love the comfort , and I Love the way I Look with this Bali Bra ! ! ! I ca n't wait to buy more ! ! ! Thank You Amazon and Under Moments ! ! !	1
I 've purchased this bra for many years . It is never my only purchase . I use this bra for specific purpose in specific garments when I was to have a true shelf type bra that hold your breasts up and out . Wearing blouses or dressed , or even casual tank tops , can make the breasts look droopy and thereby making you stomach area look thicker , and your torso shorter . With this bra , the band does most of the work holding up the breasts so that the stress is not felt exclusively at the shoulder straps . No the straps are no elastic and it is n't due to being cheap . the do the job of holding the breasts in perfect place and they have soft fabric under the strap which makes them very comfortable . The only discomfort you should feel is you choose the wrong size because they do n't have a lot of & # 34 ; give. & # 34 ; They wear like iron and look great through many washes . I recommend never putting any bra through a dryer , nor using any fabric softener or high sudsing detergents that destroy the elastic . ( sulfates causes sudsing ) Try Charlie 's Soap . You can purchase it through Earth Fare . You will never regret it and it keeps the washer clean as a whistle , even the moving parts . What I also like about this bra is that there is no side breast because of the wonderful & # 34 ; stays & # 34 ; on either side of the bra . These push you side tissues towards the front . Just own it and throw your shoulders back and look great even if you are n't used to looking so good . You will be glad not to bounce all around if that is an issue for you i other bras . Do n't let the less expensive price break distract you from getting this bra . Inexpensive does n't mean it is & # 34 ; cheaply made. & # 34 ; Remember to lean fully forward while making the connections so you distribute tissue . Enjoy this purchase . Cindy T. God Bless	1
Great fit and super comfortable . Never rides up my back and wide padded shoulder straps are great . Plan on buying several more !	1
great support for running , I have worn this ugly bra for 20 years , it has the best support and comfort .	1
I am enjoying my new bra . Well I have been buying Bali bras for years . I have been very satisfied with them . I would continue to buy tthis product .	1
Nipples Upward and fashion backwards , this bra is a blast from the past that takes getting used to for those of us with larger endowments ( 40D and up ) . Usually I am trying to slightly minimize the overwhelming appearance of my chest ( I wear anywhere from a 38G-44C , depending on the brassiere manufacturer ) , but this rather comfortable buttressed wonder is `` an all signs point to two Kilmanjaros '' kind of affair ! The sort of high-construct , seamed directly-over-the-nipples cups , heavy-duty , thick-banded bra that macho litterati Ernest Hemmingway and Mickey Spillane would have waxed over , and the Godfather of bras , Howard Hughes would have machinated . And while it does fit great ( though runs large ) , and makeS you feel sexy as all get out , it does NOT work with about 75 % of my wardrobe , or most modern wardrobes I would venture , as clingy knits , spandexes and thin t-shirt cottons are the order of day . The back band of the bra sticks WAY out under any rayon-thin , drapey fabric , and that 's with the correct size ; it is just a clunky kind of bra.But since Amazon sells these Bali Flower Underwire Bras so inexpensively , I decided to keep it anyway . Under thicker shirts the back band is less noticeable ( but not the upwards-pointing nipples ! ) . Hell , I might even buy another one in the suggestively named navy , `` Midnight . '' You could run without bouncing with the bulls in this ! Spain is waiting .	1
Dave 's wife : I bought this bra at a local small business and have n't been able to find the petite band size I need since then . I finally found it on Amazon for a better price than I paid in-store . Thank you , Amazon !	1
The Bali Flower Underwire Bra is the most worn Bra I have ever worn . I have several colors to wear and have never gone wrong with my attire . The underwire is uplifting and very comfortable	1
Myself and my girls are just loving this bra , they fit comfortable and i feel lifted . I would recommend this bra to all the ladies in the house with no regrets this is a wonderful buy	1
Have owned this name of bra for quite awahile and would't wear a different good style fit and price . good uplift	1
The rings and adjusters are plastic in the DD 's and below which I do n't like , other then that they are a great fitting bra that looks great !	1
Well made . A bit small 34B , thinking of returning for larger size ... not sure if I want to go through the hassle .	1
Large breasted women will love this bra ! This bra makes me look and feel like I 've lost 20 pounds ! Good support . Very comfortable . Perfect in warm weather . No shoulder ache or cutting in . The straps stay in place ! An underwire bra that does n't poke me . Ideal for wearing under button front blouses and retro fashions such as sheath dresses . Highly Recommended ! ! !	1
Other reviewers have said it and I must wholeheartedly agree ! The Flower Bali is the best garment that Bali manufacturers , and they 've been making them just like this for many , many years . If you are looking for something to give you a neat appearance under sweaters , t-shirts , dresses -- casual or dressy -- you have got to try the Flower Bali .	1
This is my second Bali bra . I have both the beige and white . I would buy more if they offered other colors in this style and size because it 's the only bra I 've found so far in a 42B that does n't need `` enhancers '' to fill the cups .	1
First , some sizing notes : This bra runs big in the band . I wear a 30F or a 32DD , depending on the brand/style . This bra fits me perfectly on the smallest hooks . In the long run , that 'll make it uncomfortable and big on me , but it 's so awesome otherwise , I 'm giving it five stars , especially considering the low price.Small band sizes are hard to find . I 'm glad Bali makes some 32 bands . Most American companies do not , and those of us with the unfortunate combo of small band size/large cup size usually have to purchase very pricey European brands . That 's another reason I 'm giving this bra five stars . I paid sixteen dollars and change for it . It fits as well ( and is more comfortable ) than most of my fancy high end bras . No , it is n't as pretty , but one does need some plain bras ! Yes , this bra is truly old school . It 's not stylish enough to be called `` retro . '' Has Bali been making this bra since the early 1960 's ? It looks like that might be true ! Thing is , for those of us who are big and saggy , this shape can be very flattering . I 'm a small gal with a big chest , and old school bras are really great for my shape . No , I would n't wear this under a tight t-shirt , but it 's fabulous under any other clothes . I am surprised at how `` natural '' it looks with clothes on , 'cause it really gives one old school torpedo shapeOn to the scratchiness that so many are complaining about . Out of the package , this bra feels really fake and almost plastic-y . That sounds awful , does n't it ? Well , I do n't find it scratchy on , and believe me , I am very , very sensitive . I 'm always complaining about bras ! This one is very comfortable ! However , I would venture to guess that if it was too tight , it would n't be . The elastic seems less scratchy to me than many of my other bras , and this weird fabric actually feels quite good on . Another thing is the straps . Some have complained that they fall down . I am surprised by this , too , as I have very small sloping shoulders and I 've found the straps stay up easily.Gals , get fitted . If you 're wearing a bra that does n't fit properly , you 'll be making the straps too tight , and that 's when they start falling down a lot . A bra in the right size is a must . It 's hard to find when you are my size , and I wish this bra came in a size 30 , but it 's so darned close to perfect and such a great price that I 'm very happy with it !	1
This is nothing short of a screaming deal . If you are full figured , you know what a problem it is to find a decently priced , well made , designer bra . Bali is a name brand in this area , and their bras are excellent quality , and pricey . To get this bra at $ 7.80 , in white , including super saver shipping , is incredible ; you cannnot even match this price at outlet stores . I originally bought three of them about three weeks go , and they just arrived . The sizing is true to other Bali bras I have purchased . I just put one on , and it is wonderfully comfortable . One particular feature that was not described on the web page , nor in reviews , is the back closure . It was just what I wanted : four hooks ( vertical ) , in three separate sets ( that means there are 12 separate hooks ) for providing about one inch play in the width . Again , this type of closure is difficult to find . The only thing that I would have liked was some elastic on the straps ; however , they do adjust in front to somewhat avoid cutting into the shoulder . As of today , they are still at this ridiculous price , so I ordered three more.Next day note : I wore the bra for over 10 hours yesterday , and it 's the closest thing I 've found to not wearing one at all . To address concern in other reviews regarding the shaping , i.e. , looking `` pointy '' , yes , there is a bit of that . For those who prefer form fitting clothing , this could be a problem . This is not a minimizer bra ; those will flatten you out if you prefer that look , but the price you pay is in comfort . At my age , 62 , I can tolerate the peaked look because it totally beats the saggy look . I tend to wear my blouses and sweater tops very loose , so that this issue is not a problem for me . At the very least , this bra is perfect for working in the garden , when I 'm typically wearing an oversized T-shirt . Another note regarding itching ... mine do not , and I have pretty sensitive skin . However , a suggestion would be to wash the bra first before wearing it the first time.May 28 , 2014 update : These bras wear and wash well . To keep them in good shape , they are washed in a garment bag with the hooks clasped to prevent bending .	1
Have been buying this style for years , never disappointed . Good support at a fair price .	1
I BUY ANOTHER HAD ONE BEFORE , I LOVE THESE BRA THE BONES WAS NOT TOO TIGHT . IT FEELS GREAT SUPREME COVERAGE .	1
First got this bra when my daughter was doing a performance with a lot of jumping around . Her bra was n't making it , and we looked for one better . Found this , perfect . Due to the non elastic straps , and the fine support , this bra holds things in place all day long , better than any other bra I have ever owned . My daughter and I are both well developed . Most bras are challenged when it comes to supporting us , except this one . It is also very comfortable . You know it 's on , but it never hurts . It also puts your chest in a good position , not spread out but forward . Looks very flattering . Truly great support , and pretty .	1
I wear a 38 DDD and finding a well fitting pretty bra was hard . Found the Bali Flower over 30 years ago and it has been a very good bra for me .	1
This has been my favorite bra for Years ! Every once in a while I do try a different style but I always go back to this one . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the strap on my right shoulder slides off my shoulder so I do have to wear a rubber thing I found in a bra shop made just for that problem , it kinda bothers my skin , reason I try others . But I 've never wornout any of the others before I 'm buying another one of these ... .. they just work better for me . These I wearout & have to buy new ones .	1
This fit great . Great support . It fit the bill for a bra to wear with vintage dresses . And my husband approves !	1
bra is super cheap when it comes to material to have the bali name ... supports as well as can be , but would not waste my money on buying this style again . should be on clearance rack or featured at much lower price	1
I have been wearing the Flower Bali for more than 30 years . I Would not even consider wearing another bra .	1
Good fit and flattering bra . I like that it does n't have the padded shell as so many bras have today .	1
Though the cup is a bit large I 'm still giving it 4 stars . I 'm broad around but have a smaller bust . The overall fit is very good & quite comfortable . Overall , I 'm pleased with my choice .	1
Since I had a need for one , my bras have always come from a certain popular lingerie chain . Mesmerized by their bust boosting miracle bras and fabulous looking models , I really never thought of straying . Problem was , their bras did n't fit me well , and definitely did n't provide me with the shape I desired . Their molded bras made me look saggy and lumpy , albeit bigger , but certainly not flattering . Plus , I was paying $ 40 to look this way , so I began to look for other options.Enter the Bali Flower Bra ... .. excellent support for my small bust and a more natural and feminine shape . No longer do I have one single rounded lump for a bust line , but two shapely , lifted and separated breasts ! Best & # 34 ; perk & # 34 ; of this bra , a slimmer looking figure . Turns out proper support really smooths things out and emphasizes the waist line ... ca n't argue with that ! ! Now , at that other bra place , I generally wear a 34A but since that was not an option , I opted for a 32B and I 'm glad I did . The tighter band is actually very comfortable and the cup is absolutely perfect ( for once , with a little manipulation , I actually fully fill the cups ! ) .Now , if you 're a fan of the rounded molded cups , stretchy straps and a seamless appearance , this might not be the bra for you . But if you 're looking for a classic , slightly more conical look , and solid support , this bra is perfect . For those who , like me , enjoy wearing vintage clothing , look no further this is the 40s or ( less severe ) 50s silhouette you are looking for.Finally , the lace . It 's pretty , this is a pretty bra , but should you try it on straight out of the package and determine that it 's a good fit but far too itchy , wash it once or twice -- - you might change your mind.Very happy to find this bra , I certainly will be buying more .	1
Purchased for my aunt who declared : it 's been a while she got a bra that fitted so perfectlysoft and & # 34 ; barely there & # 34 ; in terms of feeling itdurable	1
Bras 's are hard to find in the size that I need and this one came in the perfect size . I am glad I found it on amazon . It gives excellent support .	1
I am very pleased with this bra . It gives me a shape and is so comfortable , I forget I 'm wearing it . I bought one somewhere else a while back and was delighted to find them on Amazon so I ordered several more . I just hope they never stop making them !	1
After literally years of searching for a bra that fits , I finally found it ! The Bali Flower fits perfectly . It is comfortable for hours at a time and looks pretty , too ! Thanks , Bali . Now ... please do n't discontinue it !	1
I was disappointed when I could no longer find them at my local stores . Thank goodness I found them here . The price was quite reasonable too .	1
Unlike other bra manufacturers , Bali always fits me . Tried a lot of manufacturers and a lot of sizes but Bali is consistent in sizing for me .	1
Being a very busty woman , I 'm constantly looking for a bra that will smooth and minimize my proportions . Bali is a trusted name in intimate apparel , so I tried out this bra . I love the way it feels and how it makes me look when I wear tee shirts and sweaters . It runs true to size , so I did n't need to return it for a larger size . I recommend this bra to women who have the same problem as I do with finding a bra that will fit and look good !	1
I find this bra the first time I wear it is excellent , but then I wash it in the machine in a bag ... and it seems to shrink in the cup ! I do n't get that at all . I ] I 'm a 38DD right now and losing weight , so for a cheap bra I can wear till I get down to a 36C this one will do.As the title says , not the worst , not the best ... just ok. And the 38DDD cup is just too big ... I tried it .	1
Comfortable great bra . I 'm not one to like wearing bras but this one is nice . I will be ordering it in more colors .	1
I love the way these cups cover me . I do n't care for the cleavage most bras are designed to show these days . Hurray for this simple cover the goods bra with underwire for support ! !	1
Best minimizer	1
This bra has no padding . It is stiff and a wee bit scratchy until washed with Woolite or similar cold water soap.It is a minimizer . And it works . For those tops that are tight . This works ! MY BALI INDULGENCE 34 DD AND 36 DD . I CAN SLEEP IN . This is not sleeping comfort . This is for minimizing.The price is super . My other Bali , and Olga bras cost $ 55.00 to $ 60.00 dollars .	1
This bra does provide support & lift , but it is not 'seamless ' . This bra is part of the Bali & # 34 ; Classics & # 34 ; collection , so it 's been around for a long time.The cup is n't a stretchy type of fabric , so you can see a little of the cup material through my tops . And , you can see a little of the cup seam ( slightly ) .I just bought Bali Passion For Comfort Minimizer Underwire Bra , and that one is seamless- that one is a stretchy type of material . It smooths out over the breast . So , you wo n't see the cups through your tops with that one- although that bra fits a bit more snug .	1
This bra offers all the support in the world for a full figured woman . It is very comfortable as an all day at work bra . The only reason i & # 34 ; m not giving it five stars it that it does give a little pointy look to the boobs but not the cone look so its still very flattering .	1
this is the second round with purchasing these bras . Amazon has the best prices , and easy to find the size needed . Would recommend this product to everyone .	1
I chose this 5 -star rating because I 'm accustomed to this bra , have been wearing this brand for years . Tthe bra fit as it should and was received in the time specified . I bought three of them this time around and as usual i 'm quite satisfied .	1
This is my all time favorite and over the years I have owned many . Of course they do n't last forever . Elastic has not progressed since it was first used in undergarments . Of course this is what sells more bras ? The wide straps can be unsightly if they show	1
I LOVE THE FIT AND THE LOOK . THE TEXTURE ALSO FEEL VERY NICE TO MY BODY SO I WILL PLACE ANOTHER ORDER REAL SOON .	1
Its a great minimizer bra , works well on reducing the gap between the buttons . Two problems , it will show through thinner cloths and very low neck blouses . But great for work shirts !	1
This is a good fitting bra and the brand is a long standing and trusted brand . I would recommend it for its flattering fit .	1
Had to size up to 38 band as it was too tight . The quality of bra is excellent . The color is a nice neutral .	1
Purchased this bra for my grandaughter who has extremely large breasts . She was pleased and so was I . Will purchase more !	1
Since Vanity Fair stopped making my minimizer bra of choice years ago and then Lane Bryant stopped making their minimizer I have had a hard time finding a minimizer bra . This is the best one I have found . Wish they made all the colors in all sizes ! ! !	1
Bali makes such excellent bras . This is very great at minimizing . There could be a tiny more in the lengthening ability of the straps , but really looks and feels great !	1
I have purchased this bra for years and will keep doing so . Very good quality , fits me very well . There is no digging into shoulders or the wires digging into you .	1
I love Bali bras . I am very full chested and only Bali seems to fit and support me so comfortably . The minimizer offers a little help with the size of my breast ( so I do n't look like I have 2 great pyramids tied to my chest . ) The price here was a great bargain and I get the bras I love ! Thank you , Amazon !	1
Great fit . This is my favorite style . It is comfortable on the shoulders and fits better than any other bra I have tried .	1
I love the bra , the cup size is perfect . The bra just fits around me too tight even in the last loop .	1
The bra is strong , sturdy , comfortable , the straps are delightful no pinching or squeezing . The lift is amazing and the 3/4 & # 34 ; reduction makes the clothing look and feel much better . Will be ordering another soon .	1
I 'm 56 yrs old . Size 34DD . There are only two bras that I can wear . This is one of them . Amazon is a great place to purchase it as the price is less expensive than stores ( Kohls rarely has my size in stock ) and it seems to always be in stock . I hope Bali keeps on making this bra . Within the last year I did have an issue with a bra ( a piece broke ) but I called Bali and they replaced it for free ... ..UPDATE..this has happened twice ... .the adjustment pieces on the straps are made of thin plastic . Thin plastic to hold up DDs ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Cheap .	1
Bali bras are the best ... ... especially if you 're full figured . Wonderful price . These bras were half price compared to department store prices .	1
My daughter has a great deal of trouble finding a good fitting bra . This one was fabulous . We will definitely purchase again .	1
This underwire bra is the best I 've ever worn and one of the longest lasting . I have it in three colors so far . The minimizing effect is an additional bonus .	1
These bras area great ! Good quality and fit well . They are not the typical minimizer - this bra does not just squish you and move things to other places . I have a problem with straps digging into my shoulders . This bra takes all the pressure off my shoulders - no more digging in ! They wear forever and the support lasts . The price is great too . I do n't wear any other style .	1
FULL SUPPORT I HAD ONE BEFORE HAD TO BUY ANOTHER.GREAT BRA GIVES YOUR BUST FULL SUPPORT . MY WHOLE FAMILY WANTS I=ONE LIKE THIS .	1
This bra is very comfortable and a very good fit . I like the straps and the way the cups fit . It is just about perfect for me .	1
I found this bra at Macy 's for $ 36 . I found a cheaper 36G in another brand in store but only by a few dollars , and it fit like a DD ! This bra fit perfect and I ordered it off here for a grand total of $ 18 and something , so about half price . It 's very comfortable and looks great under shirts !	1
The bra fits a bit tight , was not quite the right size for me . I really like it though , its comfortable and looks good too .	1
You are gon na love this bra ! I bend over they do n't fall out ! I do n't have the uni-boob makes me look slim . My clothes look better ! Going to order two more.LOVE IT HAPPY HAPPY from hot mama . Well I look like it now lol	1
this is another good bra I will just continue to keep ordering from amazon for my bras love them . I already got my sister to buy some also .	1
Great fit	1
first off i 'm 4'9 , 34 dd , an its hard to find a great bra that actually fit.now because i 'm heavy on top , i have the bras that have skinny straps that dig into my shoulder leaving me sore and a mark . this bra is heaven , it fits like the picture.now it does n't give much lift if that 's what you , want but it supports an do n't poke you ( wire ) or cutting into your shoulder.now far as making me size look smaller ... yes ! and when i wear shirts it do n't leave those lines.i will buy more ! ! !	1
soft , attractive , and I will purchase again .	1
it fits a little tight and i am not sure if it will fit better once it stretches a little	1
This was the very first bra I 've ever owned where I did not have that extra row of boobs . Very comfortable and form fitting and non-cutting . Sometimes bras that are for larger breasts cut along the sides , but not this one . Money well spent .	1
I 've worn this bra for years and ordered my usual size -- 38 DDD . Like many others who wrote reviews , it was way too small . I had to size up to get the fit I had before with the smaller size.Overall , I find the bra comfortable and it provides great support . Just size up .	1
I like this bra . But it does squeeze me on the sides . The boning digs into my skin . I think this will be alleviated after a few washings .	1
I have been wearing this brand of Minimizer bra for over 15 years and I wo n't buy anything else . The fit is great and it lasts . I wash mine by hand and hang to dry and it fits fit like it just came out of the package . It does a good job of minimizing and this helps with finding tops that fit better . Not only does this bra have great support , it is very comfortable .	1
I 've worn Bali for years and usually wear the snowflake style . This time I ordered this bra and I like it even better . The fit could n't be better and it is so comfortable .	1
I have been wearing this particular style for many years , and was happy to find a great deal on Amazon . Much better and more dependable than other internet sources I have tried , and so convenient to use . This bra covers quite a lot and is very comfortable to wear .	1
I love AMAZON . My sister in law is an AMAZOn lover too thanks to the beautiful Bali bras I purchased for her . She loved the fit , quality , and the great value I got .	1
This is the only minimizer bra I have found that supports me well . I tried another , more expensive brand at one time , but came back to the Bali . I discovered with the other bra , my breasts were always sagging and spilling over . I wear a 34DDD . If I do n't have a good bra my back suffers , not to mention the fit of the clothes . The Bali provides both .	1
These are the only nightgowns I have . They fit well , pack well , wash and dry well . They are comfortable to wear in all seasons . I just bought several more and the robe to go with them .	1
For the person who is hoping for a dark blue or dark green gown , I have the dark blue gown , it was the very first one I bought about 10 years ago and also I have the dark green . Those are two of my favorites and since it is an old color , they are not likely to be reissued . I just thought I would let you know . Sorry .	1
Lovely fit , stayed on my shoulders , soft cool material and went through the washer-dryer without a problem . What is not to like about this night gown ? The length is perfect for me , although I 'm 5'8 & # 34 ; and it comes a bit below my knees . The flowers are very feminine . Choose purple and save some money !	1
I liked the gown , very pretty , however , I was purchasing for my Mother and she wanted the long gown.. So I returned and found the long gown elsewhere . She was very pleased .	1
Buy to gift to my grandmother . She love it , and want to wear everyday ! ! Perfect to use in home really comfy .	1
This night gown is very pretty and very comfortable . I will order more in many different colors . The detail on the yoke is very nice .	1
I must say that I do love Shadowline products which are so very comfortable and fun to wear to bed .	1
The sapphire color was the only option in my size 1X . Not crazy about the color in person . The fabric and construction is good quality . Neckline is a little higher than I expected ( compared to Vanity Fair or Miss Elaine ) .	1
This is a beautiful nightgown . The fabric is a nice weight , and not at all see-through . I usually order nightgowns one size larger , so I have room to move when I sleep , but this nightgown is very roomy . I had ordered one size larger than normal , but had to return the gown , and get my normal size .	1
Like the gown very muchLike the quality of the materialFits nicely and comfortableWill purchase this brand again	1
I like this gown . I admit it looked a little old-ladyish when i ordered it but it 's really quite cute . It 's modest enough if you have to pick up the paper in the driveway .	1
The perfect quality of Shadowline tricot is tops in the business . There is no other that compares . I 'm replacing 20 year old Shadowline gowns just because after 20 years they 're a bit discolored - that 's it - the fabric stays as perfect 20 years later as it was day one . Excellent product & here an excellent price .	1
I have worn these gowns for close to 20 years . I like how they are made without any itchy lace or scratchy seams , how they make rolling around in bed easy , and that the fabric is a better quality than any other nylon nightgown I ever owned . I also like the & # 34 ; flutter & # 34 ; sleeve especially now that my upper arms are not what they used to be , it is nice to have them covered but not constricted by a traditional sleeve.I knew that the Shadowline brand had been sold in recent years , so I was a little concerned about the quality having changed . I just bought 2 in the magenta color since it was new ( for me anyway ) and was delighted to find that the quality remains . I have always gone for the darker colors since they seem to afford just a little more modesty than the pastels .	1
I have loved these gowns for years - they never disappointment me . They hold up extremely well . I will purchase this brand many more times .	1
My mother in law wanted a new night gown and she likes the light weight one 's . She really like this one.She said it is comfortable and fits her well . She is very small and petite and the length was good for her .	1
This is an awesome gown . Have been wearing these for years . The gown is not flimsy nylon but a high quality material . You ca n't go wrong .	1
This Shadowline Nightgown is very well made , and very comfortable to wear . The fit is perfect and the softness of the material makes for a wonderful experience . This nightgown is perfect for lounging and sleeping as it is as luxurious as it is comfortable . Oh , the price was excellent for the quality of the nightgown ! I definitely recommend them and will purchase them again in the future !	1
I have very narrow shoulders so my bra straps constantly need hiking up . Many years ago , I finally found a Wacoal that stays put but it no longer fits and is being discontinued . I have tried every single other brand on the planet and they all slip off so I got this to hold them in place . It works perfect . I wish I did n't have the extra bump across my back but it 's better than constantly reaching in my shirt to pull up slipping straps . I like that it is adjustable , too .	1
This works and stays in place . I wear Soma allura bras and body by VS and I 'm bigger busted . It 's pretty comfortable for what it is but I am shopping around for a bra that wo n't need this .	1
I 've always had a problem with my bra straps slipping off my shoulders . This has solved that problem . The only thing that you need to do is make sure your bra is hooked and step into it pulling it up from the bottom . Once up the straps will straighten out . It 's so nice not having to spend the day pulling up my bra straps .	1
At first , I could & # 34 ; feel & # 34 ; them on my back , but after a little while , as I wore them , I not only forgot about them , but I forgot about the bra straps that I used to pull back up on my shoulders every few minutes .	1
Too damn cute ! I love these shoes ! Now , the only problem is we 're not so sure yet when my sister 's baby is going to be able to wear this . It 's too cute ! ! ! If they 're having a girl , I 'm getting her a pink one . : )	1
I loved these shoes as soon as I saw them . My son has n't been able to wear them yet ( I purposely bought them bigger ) , but I ca n't to show them off !	1
great product , very stylish for baby , i made a mistake on choose the rigth size , when the shoes arrive to my home my babu has growing up and the shoes cant fit on them .	1
These shoes are very cute . I ca n't wait to see my friends baby in them ( right now she is still a bit too small for the shoes ) . The shoes also came in a nice box with a clear cover to display them .	1
I have ordered pairs of these infant converse for both my son and my daughter when they were infants . I got so many compliments on them when I took the babies out wearing these shoes . They really made an outfit seem so stylish.The shoes are a very soft material that will be pleasing to your baby . The soles are soft material , as well . I found that these shoes are really best for pre walkers or indoor use while walking , otherwise they get really filthy because the material of the soles is white canvas type material that really shows dirt . I have thrown them in the washing machine but they do n't get all of the stains out from walking and can look really dirty , which detracts from the look of the shoe . So , I liked them best when I just used them on the babies before they hit the walking stage . I also do n't think that the bottom of these shoes grips well enough for a walker . If you want a pair of converse for a walker then I recommend getting the hard rubber soled converse which will not show dirt as much , and which grip the ground well . You can find them here CONVERSE Kids ' All Star Core Ox TodI also feel that these shoes run a bit small so I recommend going the next size up , which will also help you get more use out of them . All in all , they are adorable shoes and the height of baby fashion , and they are comfortable as well . Get a pair and get ready for lots of compliments when your baby wears them !	1
I bought these for my grandson who is n't here yet but ca n't to see them on him . They look just like the adult shoes .	1
I ordered these for my son that is due in Septmeber . Since Daddy always wears Chuck Taylors I wanted them to match . They are just adorable and I ca n't wait to see what they look like on him . We are using them as a prompt in our maternity shoot which will be fun : D	1
Shipping was a little slow compared to how things usually come . But shoes are perfect for my baby girl and I ca n't wait til her foot is big enough yo wear them !	1
These pantyhose provide terrific tummy support and do a lot to highlight my legs . The & # 34 ; reflections & # 34 ; look great as I walk .	1
I keep coming back to this product . Hanes feels very nice and silky on your legs and they look good as well . I would recommend .	1
These tights are extremely soft and very flattering . They fit perfectly and looked very sleek and of high quality . The only thing is , I purchased the barely there color and it is a little darker than the picture . In fact , it is more of a tan color and would go perfectly with people who have a tan complexion like I do . You really ca n't tell I 'm wearing tights until you come closer and even then , it is such a nice , sophisticated look . These tights would go great with formal evening wear and dresses .	1
I have been wearing Hanes Silk Reflections for over 15 years now and I still love the sheer look and silky feel of them on my legs . I have many pairs of Hanes Pantyhose for daily wear in different colors as well as Silk Reflections Thigh Highs and Stockings . I have tried other brands but always come back to Hanes Silk Reflections . I have tried other brands of pantyhose that are as sheer but not as durable , I have found some that are as durable but not as sheer , Hanes has it all for me . The fit is perfect they do not bag or sag at the knees or ankles even after a long day.I am an Amazon Prime member and that has been wonderful the shipping is always fast and on time . Whenever I can find my Hanes hose with Amazon Prime available I purchase them . It is so much easier to buy these online and have them delivered at no cost I am so happy with my Amazon Prime membership .	1
my legs are mostly in no nonsense pantyhose but a co worker said to try the hanes sheer nylon pantyhose , i really like how sheer my control top sheer toe silk reflections pantyhose are , these pantyhose are very soft and sheer nylons , like all of my pantyhose when i pull up very sheer pantyhose i take my time so i dont run my nylons and pantyhose , once on i love how these pantyhose make me feel , i prefer reinforced toe pantyhose but sheer toes are nice also . i wear pantyhose and nylons everyday and now have several pairs of hanes pantyhose .	1
I always feel hose of any kind not quite as long as I would like . I am 5'7 & # 34 ; and weight 129 yet they always seem to be & # 34 ; not quite & # 34 ; as long as I would like for an easier fit .	1
Not only do these hose fit , but they really do exert control comfortably . They are also strong ( have used for years ) but have a silky quality . Can not speak highly enough about this purchase .	1
My wife is 5'4 and finding these in many brands was easy but that is not the case anymore and this is easy again .	1
The stockings are great . The color itself is n't really `` barely there , '' though . It 's more of a sheer dark tan versus a natural color . Just fyi . I 'll order another color to get what I 'm actually looking for .	1
I 've tried a lot of expensive pantyhose and these hose compare with the best of them .They look and feel fantastic and fit like a dream , feels like my legs are dipped in nylon ... very luxurious and sexy.These pantyhose say more than feminine , these pantyhose say female . ..	1
Had not thought about buying hose online but this great ! Using prime it was free shipping ! I do n't live around any stores that sell hanes and it would be a 75 minute drive to find them ! Thanks Amazon ! ... .oh and the hose ! Hanes Silk Reflections are very very sheer and are a great step in-between tights and tan legs !	1
Normally I 'm a bit leary of combination sizes , but these fit great and the quality of these panty hose is excellent !	1
Nice standard pant hose by a good company , has a nice shade , would be nicer if they were cheaper but will work .	1
Have been using the same size and color for years and really like this style . Amazon is the only place to consistently get this product since my local market always runs out of them .	1
nice material pattern and design , can wear it under things or alone , good for work , dress or lounging . washes well , great color	1
I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose . I have been wearing them for over 15 years , I have tried others but keep coming back to Hanes . I love the feel and looks of them they fit me perfectly and still look good after a long day . They feel wonderful on my legs and feel great under my clothes whether I am wearing slacks or a skirt . They are also very durable for such a sheer pair of pantyhose.As an Amazon Prime member I used the 2 day free shipping and received the package on time and in good shape .	1
This classic hosery is still one of the best out there . It looked great all day , and the color is no natural .	1
Hanes always gets it right - size , comfort , good make and quality . These are true to size and feel great , smoothing out the contours of the legs .	1
These hold up and are a great value . They are also very pretty and flatter my not-the-best legs . I do n't like wearing pantyhose but in a professional job they are still needed . That 's my opinion , anyway . I have some great dresses and suits with skirts for work ( yes , I am the consummate professional ) and these are a necessary accessory . Is 'necessary accessory ' an oxymoron ? Thanks , Hanes . You make me thinner and more impressive . How many products can honestly boast that ? Marcianne Waters	1
I went ahead and purchased it , thinking i 'd be getting tanned color . For some reason , i have this way of thinking buff= dark/tan color ... Turns out it was not even close . I normally wear barely there , and this one was very creamy . Although this isnt something i would wear on a normal basis , it did go really well with my black skirt w/ white feathery sweater top . I would n't dare wearing it with any other though , just not my color ; Too bright . It was a nice try though .	1
Got this for my wedding , im darker in colour but just because im wearing white all through , i want everything to compliment.. Nice Hose .	1
I love this panty hose . It 's so sheer and silky and looks so luxurious . If this rating is lacking in words and not enough then I am sorry that 's all I got to say . I get to the point	1
These pantyhose are really terrific ! The legs are very silky to the touch and the control top lets you shed a couple of those unwanted pounds without a diet !	1
Great job from Hanes . As promised , this pantyhose is silky but well-made . Hanes is quickly becoming my go-to brand for beautiful stockings . Needless to say , I highly recommend Hanes for all your hosiery needs !	1
Hanes offers the best quality panty hose on the market compared to similar products . The hose is durable which I like most , nothing worse than for them to rip or run right out of the package . Wash and wear and it still goes strong compared to others . Consider me a fan of Hanes products ! !	1
Fit , slick , good feel . I did get a runner though at the wedding . When will there be a hose product that does n't run yet look sleek ?	1
Ok ladies , pantyhose , in general , are getting difficult to find anymore . Many women hate them . But , for those of us that do n't have a problem with them , it seems as though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from , and no more 'pantyhose ' . Let alone NAVY . This is the real deal . I plan on buying more for my 'stash ' . These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year . You get what you pay for , and these are a bargain for the quality . Love them ! Thanks for carrying , Amazon . Now , I can save gas money from running all over the place looking for navy hose .	1
These tights are high quality and have held up wear through many wears and washes . The fit was as expected .	1
Good price and shipping nice color goes with most outfits heavy enough on colder days great size comfortable Thanks a lot	1
I go through a lot of tights and these ones have lasted the longest ! They fit great and the color I got ( lagoon ) is awesome ! I get a lot of compliments on the color . I have a dog and she likes to jump on me so I get a lot of runs in my tights and I have to throw them out ! These tights have stood up to my dog 's claws numerous times and they still look good !	1
I have purchased opaque tights at local department stores and they did not fit orprovide the opaque look I wanted . These are perfect in every way.Highly recommend !	1
I am a true 32DD and this bra is very beautiful and true to size ! It is delicate , while still being supportive . Great buy !	1
I 'm accustomed to push up bras because of my lack of endowment , so this was definitely something different . Straps are nice and thick . Back band is wide . Front portion lays flat underneath bra instead of tilting up . Cups themselves are two layers of lace that support nicely but do not form the breast as a padded bra might . Will not hide *ahem* signs of 'cold weather ' . Middle portion does tend to press into the chest . My boyfriend will love it when he gets back from the holidays .	1
A little stiffer than I would have liked . But because the waist does run slightly smaller it fit a bit snug in the underbust and under the arms . I am sure that also the stiffness contributed to that . But if you order a size up on the waist size and are looking for something sexy and not something to wear for support all day it is a super cute and sexy bra ...	1
Finding a 32D in a retail store is impossible . Ordered online and the cup fit is a little off . The underwire is a little small and the cup itself is a little large . I guess I 'm just the wrong shape . The 32C underwire seemed to fit the same and the cup was a little small . So I guess I 'm inbetween .	1
In the interest of helping others ... I 'm 5'6 '' and 134 lbs ( yeah , I know ... working on it ! ) . I 'm a true 32DD in most brands . My ribcage actually measures at 31.5 '' .First things first : this bra is beautiful , sexy , not the least bit trashy and I have been waiting for it to get marked down ( THANKS AMAZON ! ! ! ) . I purchased it in the black and its lovely . It has a lovely lace overlay and the cups are unlined . The seam you see in the pix is comfortable and does n't telegraph through to a t-shirt/tank top . The cups give a nice rounded shape and come up high enough to not have any quad-boob or spillage after I bend over to pick up a wiggly toddler . The straps seem to do a nice job of supporting my 'girls ' without cutting into my shoulders . The back has three hooks . The band is soft/not itchy and seems slightly small . I LOVE that the underwire does n't come up too high . It hits at a very comfortable spot on the sides . For some reason , where the underwire meets in the front REALLY pinches . I really want this bra to work so I 'm exchanging it for a 34D in hopes that its sister size will be a GO . Fingers crossed ! UPDATE : Ordered the 34D . THe band was more comfortable ( perhaps slightly loose ? ) but the cups gapped on the top . I must be fuller on the bottom . It made the girls point down and out . Very sad , indeed . Sending it back . It is beautiful ... though . Maybe for someone else with a different shape .	1
I have 40dd breasts and it so hard to find a pretty bra that looks sexy , but still holds the girls in.This is perfect as it is a mixture of balconette and demi so you get some cleavage without everything falling out like most of the plunge bras.. I went back and bought in it ivory as well ! I a hooked .	1
Fits as expected , with a nice thick band .	1
Felina products fit very well and are very confortable to wear for the whole day . Do watch for new styles to come out from them .	1
If only they had them in my size ! I am a 34 G , but decided to try the 34 DDD since they do n't make this bra in my size . It is just incredibly beautiful- but , alas , it was too small , and I did n't want to have to go to a 36 inch band in order to make the DDD work for me .	1
I got this in both the black and the ivory , and I love them both . When I first went to wear them , they were a little scratchy in the beginning , but they became more comfortable and now are my favorite sexy bras . The part I enjoy most is the straps with the ribbon detailing ... if the straps peek out , they look so pretty !	1
This bra fits , looks sexy , feels good and was just an all round wonderful find and good purchase . Get one if you can .	1
I love this bra so much . It does n't give a strange shape to my chest like some unlined bras with underwire do . It 's super comfortable and fit perfectly . I got it in City Rose , and it 's more of a bright pink but I still love it . Planning on getting more in different colors .	1
Not to sheer can wear under semi sheer tees without anything showing nice color against skin just the right amount of uplift would order again !	1
seller shipped it pretty fast & i was pleased to get this brassiere . it perked up my asset nicely . in fact , i bought another pair for me for a great price . i wished the alabaster color was on sale & had my size . unfortunately , it was out of stock . hopefully , i 'll get it for a great price ( again ) in the future .	1
As a sissy it 's so important to feel feminine when cross dressing . My breast inserts fit quite nicely into the cup . I love the pink color which is my favorite color ! ! ! I love prancing around and feeling dainty in this bra ! ! !	1
I bought this to match a pair of panties to make a sexy set , not for comfort . Boy was I surprised when this bra made it 's way into my & # 34 ; comfy bra & # 34 ; drawer . I think I 'll end up with four more of these . They made your girls look great , you feel sexy and it is surprisingly comfortable .	1
Fit perfect and it was a good price for the size . It 's hard to find bras the exact size I need so I was pleased when this bra fit as expected ...	1
The bra is very nice and good value for money . It fits perfectly , is very comfortable and rather sexy . But I would n't recommend it for everyday use for those who like more relaxed style of life .	1
This bra is amazing , it 's supportive and super comfortable . I 'm a 36DDD ( sometimes a 34 ) and this fits like a dream . Also , it looks fantastic on , I will be ordering in more colors ! !	1
Nice looking bra . Super sexy , not itchy , boobs look amazing ! I will be ordering more because it is so hard to find sexy bras in the larger sizes	1
I love these bras . I 've bought them in all different colors . The only thing that I can complain about is the fact that the underwire tears through the fabric . I 've had to sew all of them . They 're thin and comfortable . I 'm quite busty with a small rib cage and it 's hard for me to find bras that fit but these are my favorite .	1
So , why am I happy with this ? It is a 36 B , and I pretty much fill it out . As others have mentioned , sheer bras are normally way too large in the cup , usually because they 're stretchy . This is not stretchy through the cup , and I could n't be happier . I 'm built lanky : long arms and legs , broad shoulders , small boobs . This does not dig into me , and I do n't find it to be itchy . This is working for me . I am so freaking glad it does n't push my breasts together ! ! ! All that does is make them look smaller , and , well ... .squished together . How that is supposed to help , I have no idea . Who ever thought that up ? This allows them to sit a lot closer to where they want to sit ( they tend to point outwards just a bit ) , however , it DOES GIVE SUPPORT . This is a small miracle . Hats off to Felina . And , thanks to all the previous reviewers whose comments clued me in as to how this would fit !	1
This fits wonderfully and is very flattering , definitely a great deal ! I will be ordering more soon , hopefully in different colors !	1
but i liked it . it makes her chest looklike one of those marie antoinette women . we had to exchange for a larger size though .	1
Great usual Felina fit no surprises here . Has a nude colored lining under the lace , looks very nice . Good support , too .	1
this bra is very supportive , and finally I feel sexy in it . it fits like a balconette , however keeps the girls up and in place	1
This is a good looking bra . When Felina state it is for a full bust I get one cup size smaller than I would on other bras . I recommend this product .	1
Could n't find this brand in my size in the Mall where I live . I was first introduced to this brand years ago at a large department store . Glad I found some Felina styles here . Fits well , though the straps could be a bit wider for the larger sizes .	1
This stunning bra is every girl 's dream bra . It has the right perks for any bra to have , from being comfortable to the adjustability . It can match the likes of the Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Brasas this bra is like nothing else .	1
This bra is beautifully made and quite supportive . I 'm large-busted ( anywhere between a 32DDD and H , depending on brand/maker ) and chose to try a 34DDD for this bra since cups run small on most brands that are n't specifically for large chests , and this item does n't come larger than DDD . It turns out to be a little large in the cup , which almost never happens to me ! But the support seems good and the bra is both delicate and sexy while still providing coverage . I 'll be returning for a smaller size .	1
As soon as I put this bra on I never wanted to take it off ! I wear a 36DD and its hard to find a bra that makes me feel this hot & sexy and still be supportive and comfortable ! ! I want it in every color now ! ! Love love love ! ! !	1
This bra is really pretty and holds the big puppies firmly in place.Great quality and looks very sexy . I will be buying again	1
There are many kind of bra out there , such as the Coobie Strappy V-Neck Lace Trim Bras ; but then there is this item from Felina Women . This bra has both style and fabrics going for it . You will disappointed from this item . I assure you .	1
one of my clients always finds it hard to find the right bra ... so this was a good find the material she says is a bit thin ... so it does n't offer much support .. bare that in mind ! ! !	1
These are comfortable , wash and dry like a breeze and move with you . Comfortable under slacks no matter how tight .	1
I have been wearing these for years and really like the brand and fit . I used to buy them on-line from Hanes , but then I discovered they were available from Amazon cheaper . This time however I needed to purchase them individually , rather than getting a cheaper price by ordering 6 . I would like Amazon to bring back that option .	1
Like wearing a piece of silk with a little elastic throughout for support . No snags of binding against the skin and slack , etc . slide on and stay in place . These also have a cotton crotch to allow health there . I had 6 and just bout 4 more of these panties .	1
I L-O-V-E ( LOVE ) these briefs . I sometimes have a hard time finding them in department stores so was very glad to be able to buy them on the Internet . They are comfortable . They allow a little forgiveness when you gain a bit here and there without stretching out if you lose a bit ( I wish more often ) . They also wash and wear very easily and simply . I can even throw them in the dryer . What 's not to love ? : )	1
Bali Skimp Scamp Briefs are THE MOST COMFORTABLE UNDERWEAR I have ever worn in my 64 YRS . of life ! ! They are very Soft and Silky with a back seam instead of side seams . These briefs NEVER , EVER Ride up or get stuck ( you know where ) , they ALWAYS Stay in Place , my clothes glide over them very easily and there 's No visible Panty line either ! ! I would rather go without than wear any other under garment ! ! Try 'em , You 'll LOVE 'em too ! ! You 'll Never be Sorry with this purchase .	1
I was n't so sure about order these panties online , but it worked great . They are the same as I 've seen in the store except I thought I was buying cotton instead of nylon . Nevertheless , they work just fine .	1
These briefs have been my favorite briefs for over 25 years now . I am very long waisted and rather curvy and these are the ONLY briefs that I found that DO NOT RIDE UP ! ... I hope Bali never stops making them .	1
I have worn these for years and love them . They fit and feel great and hold up very well . I highly recommend them .	1
I like the panties , because they do not ride up they stay put where they suppose to be ... .love them ... thanks , I will buy them again..	1
As my title indicates these fit very well , are comfortable and pretty . They seem to hold up well in the wash , although I usually take mine out and air dry to help the fabric and elastic last longer.I have bought more and will do so again .	1
I bought my first pair at a department store ... then went to Amazon and bought 3 more pairs ... liked them so well that I bought 3 more ! I love the fit ! !	1
These Skimp Skamp Briefs are the most comfortable undies I 've ever worn , and I 've been buying them for a long , long time . They 're perfect for anyone who does n't like bikini or high-rise panties . After three babies , I ca n't wear those things anymore . The fabric moves with you , and they 're practically invisible under clothing . I add Oxi-Clean to the detergent when I wash them , as chlorine bleach does a number on them . Plus I use a hanger with clips to air-dry them on the shower rod , as they last longer that way .	1
I have owned Bali skimp skamp panties for years because they fit nice and with proper care last a long time.The Apple Blossom color is nice , I love it .	1
Size 5 is not always easy to find , so I will keep them even though I 'd like a little snugger fit . The quality is very good .	1
I was looking for panties that fit well , with comfortable coverage and that did n't show under pants or jeans . Skimp Skamps are all that ! I 've worn them in the past and started buying another brand for some reason I ca n't remember , but they never fit well or washed well . I 'm so glad I have found Skimp Skamps again . I 'm sticking with them this time . Great price for a great product !	1
Bali Skimp Skamp briefs are the ultimate in comfort . I recently purchase a pair to give them a try and I am know hooked . I wore them on a long airplane ride and never a tug or pull , no riding up . Wonderful . Give them a try .	1
What a find ! This brief has one seam going up the back . Other than that it is seamlessly smooth and comfortable with just enough stretch to make it so . Pretty much the perfect pantie .	1
These are the best . When you get them out of the bag , you might think you ordered panties that were 2 or 3 sizes too small , but that 's just the way they look until you try them on . They fit great . They hold in your stomach quite a bit and the leg opening does n't ride up in the back . Stays put . These also come in a lace waist band that rests lower ( on your hip ) . I have that style too and it is nice but I like these better .	1
These are very comfortable and pretty , too . I like them a lot better than I expected to ! If you are considering them - go for it .	1
I now have over 40 pair of these fantastic womens panties . I have found after wearing and washing these for several years , that they always fit the same , and are very comfortable . The lower gusset seam helps keep a males equipment in place . They will also stretch in the front to accomodate mens excitement . The rear has a soft seam that keeps them were they belong . The more they are washed , the softer the feel . Move over ladies , these are meant for men also .	1
It is nice that skimp skamp briefs are now in lacy or flowery patterns . I have been wearing skimp skamps for years and love them since they do n't ride up at the back .	1
Looks nice , Feels good but a little high waisted . Other then that I like them on . Yes , I do recomend them .	1
Unlike some other women 's briefs made by Jockey , they are designed in the traditional style - no thick waistband here , and it 's even covered in cotton to make it soft and comfortable . Brief does come up high on leg but still backside of panty stays in place . Cotton is soft and breathable .	1
great product from jockey . very comfy and good fit . would get these again without a doubt . no regrets this time !	1
I was relieved to find that Amazon offered these jockey briefs . This was the first time I had to buy them online . For me it is easier to shop online , but I tried the local stores and they no longer stock this size . I will have to start my shopping with Amazon in the future .	1
I 've gotten this brand several times for a gift and the recipient always loves them . She said they fit so comfortably , do n't shrink , and do n't ride up where she does n't want them to if you catch my drift .	1
Excellent product . Give me a discount or a rebate and I 'll write more about this product . I 'm Jack Benny 's cousin.Jesus is Lord .	1
I have been wearing Jockey Elance bikini 's for over 25 years . I decided to buy some of the briefs after an abdominal surgery to avoid the scar being irritated . The Elance briefs were very nice . As always , these wash up well and can last for several years without a hitch . I trust the Jockey name and as I mentioned , have worn their Elance products for over 25 years . Not disappointed at all . I highly recommend these .	1
Jockey makes the best underpants ever . The fit me perfectly . Soft cotton and the waistband is soft covered cotton also .	1
Well sewn , comfortable , really good fit , great fabric , waist and leg openings are very comfortable and stay where they belong without binding .	1
I find this brand extremely comfortable & durable . As I 've lost weight over the past couple of years , these have been great .	1
As my title indicates these fit very well , are comfortable and pretty . They seem to hold up well in the wash , although I usually take mine out and air dry to help the fabric and elastic last longer .	1
As expected cotton briefs .	1
I have ordered this product before and have been very happy . They fit well and are comfortable and last a long time . Happy with this purchase	1
I have bought this style in the past so I knew they would fit . So I bought more in size 9 . They are comfortable but seem to run a little small . But not so small that they are uncomfortable or that I want to buy a bigger size . Just more snug . My previous purchase said they were made in Costa Rica and these say Honduras . I do n't know how that makes a difference , but these are definitely a little tighter.Even so , I prefer them to most other underwear and I really like the comfortable waistband . They do shrink a little in the wash , but I find they really hold up in general . I took these underwear ( my previous purchase ) abroad for 6 months where I had to hand wash them and hang them in the sun ... this will destroy clothes pretty quick . But these held up great.Jockey is n't what it used to be ... the material feels thiner now . But I still prefer them over other underwear for comfort .	1
They are n't exciting , but they 're comfortable and practical . The cotton is soft and a bit heavier than the cheap underwear you get at Target or similar store . The whites ones are just a teeny smidge smaller than the pastels of the same size . I do n't know why that would be , but it is . They feel supportive ( even though there 's no spandex ) and minimize jiggles . Good quality underwear for a decent price .	1
They fit great . Needed all cotton with covered elastic , and this is what I go . Good value at a good price .	1
These are the most comfortable and best fit I 've found anywhere . I 'm glad I got them , will get more , and definitely recommend them .	1
These are just what you would expect . Nice quality and the size is correct . If you want good cotton old lady panties these are what you need . : )	1
The fit is good . The elastic around the waist is very snug , though . I am a small woman and I like high-waisted panties for a smooth line under skirts and dresses . These cut in just enough ( waist size = 25 inches ) that I do n't get a nice smooth line , so I keep these for under pajamas or sweats or lounge-y clothes -- stuff where a smooth silhouette does n't matter .	1
I am glad that I read the reviews . The briefs came and the fit perfectly-very comfortable and I would purchases this style and brand again .	1
i love the variety of colors they come in ; they fit great and there is minimal shrinkage ; definitely will keep buying .	1
I really like Jockey underwear , and I can count on the size being what I need . Jockey underwear 's quality has somewhat declined since the time I first bought them decades ago , but the quality is still better than ALOT of other brands . They are all cotton , very comfortable , and last a fair amount of time-not as long as they did originally , but again , better than other brands .	1
The quality is good . The fabric is soft , and this is a very very nice cut.Definitely will buy them again.bought this from amazon at a way better price than a retail store .	1
I have been buying these undies for YEARS and my Mom buys them for me too . Super comfortable and long lasting ! ! ! I like the color variations as well..	1
After trying Hanes underwear , I immediately returned to the one and only Jockey French Cut . I have been wearing this brand and style of underwear for nearly 25 years , as my body has gone through all shapes and sizes -- and they are the best . They are cut for a full size rear end , which I have always had and still do ! Non-binding , comfortable , fit well . I love these underwear .	1
I 've worn this underwear for years and gave up finding more ( should have thought of Amazon earlier ) The fit is perfect for me , high enough they do n't slide off my hips , low enough they do n't slide up the cheeks of my fanny , leg cut large enough to not cut off the circulation in my legs , more ? oh yeah , they 're all cotton	1
This underwear is made with great quality material . The fit is perfect , no problems with this product . Would recommend over Victoria Secrets any day .	1
These are the only underwear I 'll wear . They are always comfortable , last forever and wash and wear great . They do n't leave a panty line and never roll , or move up your butt . I highly recommend especially for plus size women .	1
I love Jockeys Women 's Underware . These underware fit well , and definitely last . They are comfortable , and will be buying more .	1
Even ordered some of these for my mother in law and she loved them too . I think they are a little over priced but the quality is good .	1
I have worn these kind for awhile now . They fit good , feel good and not a bad price . What is there not to love . White cotton is my favorite , however , the colored ones are just as nice . Very comfortable . Love Jockey !	1
I love simple white underwear . Easy to wash , easy to bleach to get that nice clean look . Cotton is breathable and comfortable . This design has the nice french cut , which means they go higher up on your thigh . I buy a new 3 pack about once a quarter . I use the more worn pairs when I go on vacation or on a business trip , and then just throw them away instead of having to come home and wash them ... : ) These are not the most longest lasting underwear ever , but I sure like them right out of the package . Which is important . If you have to wash them for weeks before you like them , what a waste ! Nothing fancy or sexy about these , but they are quality and comfortable .	1
I was waiting to have a bad odor from these panties because other people 's reviews spoke about a fragrance . I did n't detect a bad odor and they were exactly what I ordered	1
I have worn these for years , but was concerned about recent reviews reporting an odor . They do have a smell , like you might have from your detergent . It is not strong enough to concern me , but I would just as soon it not be there . I have washed them once before wearing and will see what happens as I do more washings . The fit is as usual and I like the colors and pattern .	1
Have been wearing these for years , but was hesitant to purchase a new pack after reading reviews from folks who noticed a never ending smell . Thankfully , I was one of the lucky ones . Purchased two packs and had no problems .	1
The Jockey Elance Bikini is closer to a low-waisted brief than what I think of when I hear the word `` bikini '' . The leg openings are low and the back has full coverage . I think they 're a nice compromise between a brief and a skimpy bikini.These panties are cool , comfortable , and long-wearing . They hold up well to machine washing . I should note the Elance line runs large on me . You may need to order one size smaller than you would for other brands .	1
Fit . Comfortable . Prime . Who could ask for more ? It would only be nicer if more patterns were Prime . I had to buy three sets of these to get Prime and now I have a lot of blue in my drawer .	1
100 % cotton , fit well , do n't look to dowdy , I will buy more ! These are good quality and can not seem to find them anywhere except on line .	1
These fit better than any panties I 've ever worn . The price on Amazon is lower than any department store and the shipping was free . I 'm very happy with this product as is my daughter . We 've been fans of Jockey panties for many years .	1
There are n't many options for inexpensive cotton bikinis that let you pick the color range you want . So I decided to take a chance on these despite some of the complaints about the smell , since some of those reviews were older . These bikinis did arrive with a very strong baby powder smell . I could n't stand to wear them until they had been washed 6-7 times . However , after repeated washings , the scent is nearly gone . Now they are very practical and comfortable .	1
My 11-year old daughter is 5 ' 2 & # 34 ; and weighs 103 lbs . She 's straight as a board and does n't have much of a butt . However , these size 4 fit her very well . I was concerned , since I ordered online and could n't hold them up to put my eyes on them before I bought them . She really likes the prints and when she tried them on she said they felt more like a bathing suit bottom . That 's good , since bathing suits need to fit your body kind of tight . They 're Jockey , so they 're made of great quality !	1
These are my go-to undies for everyday wear . A friend suggested them years ago and I 've worn them ever since . They stay put without the sticky bands that some other brands use . Comfy , flattering .	1
Great fit , just as I had hoped . Good quality , feel very sexy on . My partner likes them too , loves the look and feel .	1
I wanted to go to all cotton underwear as part of a move to more natural products . Bought these in size 4 ( my pants size ) to try them . I was unsure what size to buy . I have washed them , and they shrunk a little i think , but not much . They fit very well , do not ride up , and are very comfortable . As for the reviewer who thought they come up too high and show over her pants , I suggest her pants are waaaay too low : - ) . if these show , she may have bought them too big , or her pants are so low , she is at risk of exposing her doo da ! I am here to buy more today.Update : Liked so much , I bought 2 more packages . I bought a size 5 in black and a 4 in white . Do n't see much difference . Jockey sends a coupon with the first order . Coupon code is BBFTTYYSH . Try it for 20 % off . May have to order on Jockey website , but can pay on Amazon site .	1
I am a bigger hipped person and find that I have a hard time finding cuter , sexier underwear that fit right . These work perfect .	1
These are perfect for a 58 year old woman like me who does n't want to wear granny panties . Fabric and cut are great .	1
I really like these . They are very comfortable , no matter what I 'm doing ( sleeping , exercising , sitting around ) . And they last a long time . They were my favorite underwear colors to , especially the dark grey . I wish they were still available .	1
As always , a good , sturdy product . You can wash these many times , and they last a long time . I 'll always buy from Jockey .	1
Love these . First time purchasing , fit well and comfortably . They seem well made much better than multipack undies from a box store . Flattering and wash and dry well . Pefect everyday functional underwear .	1
Comfortable , basic and just what I needed . Completely lacks annoying frills , lace and other irritating materials . Cool , breathable cotton . Wears and washeswell . Highly recommended !	1
I ca n't find these in stores anymore but I 'm used to them , so its nice to know I can get them online .	1
I love these . The fit is great and you need to make sure you get your size . The fit is pretty accurate so it 's not a time to order too big or small to get the best fit . These also do n't ride up on you like some and they wear very well after several washes as well .	1
These are a very comfortable product . I can hardly tell when I have them on , and the design is great for avoiding pantylines . The fabric is breathable , but not so thin that it will lose it 's shape or support . They wash well . It 's always hard to find packages of JUST black panties , so I was very excited to see Jockey offered this at a reasonable cost . Highly recommend !	1
I just ordered more ! I bought some at Kohls and loved them . I am tired of lacey underwear falling apart . When I found these on amazon , I ordered more and was just as pleased . They have full coverage and a little bit of style . If you are wondering about sizing , they are slightly more generous than Victoria secret 's sizing . I would n't say 1 whole size larger , but maybe 1/2 a size larger .	1
Love the fit of these underwear , you will not regret , perfect fit and fast and easy transaction . Hope this helps and good luck ... ..	1
These bikinis are comfortable and attractive . The best of both worlds for me . I 'll definitely be ordering more in the future .	1
I have been using this string bikini for over 30 years ... .then , department stores stopped carrying them because they `` do n't sell as well '' . Now , I found them online and I am back wearing them . They are ALL cotton-therefore breathable and comfortable besides looking good on you as they are nicely-styled ( read `` sexy '' , the picture with model 's tummy facing the right does them more justice ) . My dermatologist recommends all-cotton panties . And these are that and look great..NO granny panties ! The cotton-encased elasting band is VERY comfortable , keeps its elasticity even when the product wears out finally and protects skins afflicted with latex intolerance ( my problem ) or allergy . The bikni over all is sturdy and lasts and lasts . I highly recommend them . I thank Jockey for still making them .	1
These fit very nice and all 100 % cotton . Got a lil string up front for the string bikini and it could pass as men 's underwear . Got plenty of room up front for my twigs and berries ( average size ) . Best cotton panties I had so far .	1
This bikini underwear fits so nice and does not ride up . It is very comfortable and I will order more .	1
I have n't been able to buy undies that fit for over a decade . With the 'fattening ' of America , new clothes are cut larger . Pant legs swim on me , yet they fit at the waist . These undies fit at the waist and in the buttocks but like all of them I buy , the leg openings are too large & with these , the leg opening elastic is too stretchy . That makes them ride up . I have now bought approximately a dozen different brands & styles . I am going to keep at it until I find ones that fit 'teenage ' legs . I have an APPLE SHAPE BODY , meaning same size legs & butt I had in my 20 's , but all the weight I 've gained over the years going to my middle . Ugh ! That 's why I still wear bikini undies . They fit below the belly fat role . But I still need to cover privates . These do not work on my body type . I suspect they 'd be great on pear shape beautiful women . So far the ONLY undies I 've found that fit ( some work when you put them on but stretch out during the day ) , are 'Barely There Women 's Flex To Fit Bikini Panty ' ( you may want to buy one size larger than your size if you are on the upper side of your size ) . I hope this helps others . Extra note , I loved the fabric & feel on my body . If the elastic had been tighter , I 'd have kept them .	1
I could go on and on about this bra all day long . So so so so so comfortable and makes my boobs look just delicious . This bra has a way of pushing up your boobs and making them look larger without having a bunch of overstuffed padding that makes you feel like you 're wearing some sort of costume . I will for sure be replacing the rest of my bras with more of these . I 'm actually a little pissed I went so long not having this in my life .	1
OK , this is my new favorite bra ! It 's soft and comfy like a t-shirt bra , but with underwire and a little push up . Underwire does n't pinch or cut at all . Perfect . It gives a little oomph without you feeling like you 're going to fall out if you bend over .	1
This has to be my new favorite bra ! It is so comfortable . Great support and I am a 38G ! You will not be able to wear this with a low cut shirt but it will look great under tshirts and sweaters .	1
I 've been having trouble finding a bra that fits me properly . I did order two different sizes in one order , so that I would be able to know which one fit better . Glad I did . NIce bra at a decent price .	1
great bra , runs big in the cups ... .I am small in the back , but , this , the cups not for me anywayHad to return mine , even though I did try it on in a hurry , purchased the bra , and had to return both ... I am a 36 DD , very nice , cups run big . I am a 36 DD in all bras , this one , not to good ... ..Fav bras , Bali new `` comfort bra '' awesome , Bali `` t back bra '' , Gap , '' full coverage lace '' , and my very fav . `` Champion everday bra '' , wonderful , perfect fitting in each styleSo beware ... .	1
I wanted a black bra that would still provide lift but made it possible to wear button downs . This bra fits the bill . I will say that it does not look as good with looser ( re : no delineation of form ) , sleeveless tops that have a high neckline because while this bra provides separation and lift , it my breasts are positioned farther apart than I normally prefer . It still keeps them within the frame of my body , which is what you want in a bra , but I do feel wider up top if I wear the above-mentioned tops . I could be having this issue because I decided to try a 30G instead of my normal 32F since whenever I check a calculator , it recommends the former size . The band feels good at a 30 , but the cup might not be quite right . This is probably good evidence that you should always try on bras or their brands in-store before ordering online with a vendor that does n't have the best return policy . If I had ordered this bra strictly through Amazon with Prime shipping , I might have returned it for a different size just to check if it was the bra itself or the fit . Overall though , great bra , well-made , and attractive . I will buy Fantasie bras in the future .	1
I have shopped at many bra shops in the US and Europe . If you are a 38G and short-waisted this bra is the one for you . I have paid over a hundred dollars in Houston for this bra , so to find it between forty and fifty dollars on Amazon is great . The bras are from England and the quality is excellent . The material the bra is made from never breaks down , it is the wire poking thru that signals that the bra is dead . When this happens I get out my sewing machine , fix the area and use it for another year or so . Even at one hundred dollars Fantasie bras are worth the price !	1
I wish they had more colors ! ! ! ! ! ! . I am a 36DD and this bra actually makes me look smaller with better posture . I have been wearing Victoria secret bras for many years , but never get the support I need . The full size is very comfortable and the material is thin , which is what I wanted . I dont want to look larger .	1
These are a very nice pair of stockings . They are thick , have nice shimmer , and will go great with my dress that I am wearing for the wedding . A very good bargain !	1
I bought these in gray , black and brown , and I love every pair . They fit well and stay up ! They wash well too ( delicate/gentle cycle , drip dry ) . They provide a bit of tummy control . They are soft and sleek . I am a 1X . I recommend this hosiery !	1
I 'm really impressed with these shimmers pantyhose tights . They 're warm and durable like tights but have a really sexy semi sheer , shimmery look to them like luxury pantyhose . .Great to wear with a mini and heels to really show off your legs and they 'll still keep you warm.They fit fantastic and are very comfortable to wear for long days.They also give your legs support , feels like you wearing leggs sheer energy pantyhose . I 've tried a lot of tights and these are one of the best and the price is reasonable.Love them !	1
These are the most comfortable tights ever . They 're soft , silky and I have n't fussed with them once . I 've made these the new standard . : )	1
I bought my first pair about four years ago and was quite pleased with them . They are like a heavy duty control top panyhose but they really lift and tuck the goopy stuff.Recently while trying on some new skirts I turned around and was dismayed at what appeared in the mirror ! Horrors ! My butt has gone south , but not to worry , I tried the said skirts on with my Spanx and that solved my problem . Now the twins back there look nice and perky ... well , not like when I was 16 , but maybe when I was a 33 year old dance teacher.The waist and thighs stay in place , no rolling there . Even though I 'm a size 2 it does take a little more `` work '' to get these babies on . But once they are in place , wow !	1
They lift and hold in all the right places . Love them ! Every girl needs a pare to have on hand .	1
Purchased this for a wedding I attended . It worked very well and made me look good in my little black dress . Very comfortable to wear .	1
They fit perfectly and really sucks in my tummy ! Kind of hard to wear with jeans , but other materials work great .	1
Just got my new pair , and for ME the secret was to go two sizes up . I am 5'4 '' and weigh 145 ... according to the chart I 'm a B ... but the C was even too small for me . Just got the D , and bingo ! Perfect ! Does n't seem to roll , and I might actually be able to breathe in the thing . Those who have n't been happy before , try going two sizes up ... worked for me~ five stars now ! My previous review : I am completely torn about my rating on this one . On the positive side , this product shaves ten pounds off my appearance , easily . So five stars for that . Two negatives though ... First , I ordered a size up ( from what is recommended at Spanx.com ) , as everyone seems to suggest . They are still VERY tight , and still roll down . Secondly , I have not even worn them yet ... I only tried them on twice with my Maid of Honor gown ... maybe had them on for a total of fifteen minutes each time ... and all of the stitching on the waistband started to come out in a big , long unravel . It happened in two different places on the waistband . If I had n't bought them so long ago ( well in advance of the wedding ) , I would have returned them and requested a new pair . Now , I 'm here to order another pair , and I think that this time I 'll try ordering two sizes up , and see if that stops the rolling problem . I will save the second , damaged pair as a backup for the wedding day . Those two issues caused me to take away two of the five stars that these could potentially be ( for me , anyway ) . One more thing ... as it stands now , I could n't imagine wearing these every day ... it really is a GIRDLE ! But for a special occasion , or a night out on the town , yessiree ! ! They do really suck you in and give you that figure you wish you had ! ( Maybe not recommended for going out to dinner , if you plan to eat more than a salad LOL ! )	1
This product works exactly as stated on-line or in magazines . It does not roll at the edges and helps keep you together .	1
These are terrific . I looked at the price and bought only one for testing and it blew me out of the water . Read the directions to get them on but they 're worth every penny . I have bought more since due to their durability and delivering what they promised . I never feel compressed or pinched and they give a great silhouette !	1
After several purchases , I 'm beginning to feel that the extra $ $ $ for Spanx is not worth it . I think I 'll stick to Flexees .	1
I 've been wearing these for about 8 years . Through all my weight fluctuations they help my jeans , skirts and shorts look better . Initially they are a bit awkward to get on , but read and follow the directions patiently and you 'll get them on . It gets easier each time . One reason they get easier to put on is because your butt leaves it 's impression so it 's always easy too know where the back side is .	1
to any wardrobe ! The thing about these panties are : you HAVE to size up . If you are not sizing up , they are NOT going to fit right , or control what you need them to control . I bought one pair - according to the manufacturer 's sizing - and quickly found out that they were too small . Tried the next size up , and got the rolling effect . Tried two sizes up and I was in the zone . They squoze in tight though , so I went three sizes up and found the pair for me . Now , I 'm not saying that YOU have to go three sizes up to find the right pair for you , but it is doubtful that the right size will be your normal size . I would start two sizes up to be safe . This seems to be the general consensus from everyone that I know that owns a pair of these . Besides , who wants to feel like a stuffed sausage under your clothes ? ? Final word : buy the right size . Once you find it , you will see that these are a must . Let 's face it , this designer found a niche in the market and now everyone is trying to capatilize on her initiative . Most of them do the trick , but how comfortable are you ? The feel of these power panties are fabulous , and once you find the perfect size for you , you can be stylish , smooth , AND comfortable in your clothes . I do n't leave home without mine !	1
These goofy looking things are my favorite undergarments for just about everything . Great under snug clothing , they also create a great , smooth line under most everything else . Surprisingly , these are also really comfortable during warmer months .	1
These do run small , when in doubt always go a size up . These are like very strong very tight pantyhose , I use them whenever I wear a dress because I like to walk and run around with my kids but do n't want my legs to get irritated rubbing together and I like haveing something underneath for modesty .	1
I ordered this item for my wife after her pregnancy . She had reviewed the item online and decided to purchase it . The item was just as seen online and she is happy that it can be worn without anyone even noticing .	1
I love spanx , I 've tried other brands includins VS and they are as good as these . Spanx manages to tuck everything in it 's right place without being terribly uncomfortable , they 're terrific !	1
was bummed i did n't have these before i bought my dress . could have gone down a whole dress size . wow ! what a difference they made . however , after wearing them for about four hours , i was eager to get them off . but no where near as bad as i expected .	1
These are great to provide a little help and you can barely feel them . I just do n't like any control garment that is n't a thong , personally - do n't want anything that squashes my bottom since I do n't need the compression help there .	1
I like this product because it hides my fat belly . I can wear tight dresses without my belly showing off .	1
I am 5'8 & # 34 ; , about 135 pounds , and the size B is basically what I expected . I wish they had a little more of a smooth finish so that fabrics glide over them a little more easily but I think these will do their purpose underneath a bridesmaids dress . There is not giant indentation for the waist or legbands though , which is nice . But I will not say they are comfortable ... they do suck it all in .	1
I ordered the right size.. and while I do like the spanx I just feel like they are a bit too tight . Over all thought does what it is suppose to do with out any lines .	1
The item was exactly as described and is great to wear under maxi dresses . I would order in every color .	1
ordered a number of these for bridesmaids because their dresses were a bit clingy and they really liked them ! Great buy !	1
My husband only wears Jockey and we can not find these local anywhere . He was shocked and pleased that I found these for him . They 're the same quality he 's used to and the shipping was very fast .	1
Have not been able to find in stores for a few years . Husband loves these . Most undies are to baggie in the butt for him . These provide the support he likes and are not baggie .	1
He has been wearing these for years and is satisfied . The fabric wears very well . Happy husband = happy wife .	1
Excellent product , have been using this brand and style for as long as I can remember . I was able to get it at an incredible price on Amazon . So I bought several units .	1
These are really sexy underwear i like to wear on a daily basis . I have a slim sexy body , and hate bulky under wears , so this fits me real nice . The price is great..also like the fact the advertising is at a minimal , just a tiny tag on the left side . my bf loves seeing me in these because it shows off my body which is a turn on for him ; ) ya so go order these , or do n't , more for me : )	1
What can I say about Jockey underwear ? They last a long time , come in some great colors , fit well and are inexpensive . I have tried other brands of underwear but it seems like I always come back to Jockey for one reason or another . They work for me and I would definitely recommend them .	1
We 've bought these before and he still likes them . So we give them a five star rating and will buy them again when these wear out .	1
These bikini 's are very difficult to find in department stores , i.e. , Wal-Mart , Ross , T.J. Max , etc . Buying the Jockey brand thru Amazon makes it very simple and gas-savings for my car . Thanks Amazon !	1
i bought these to replace the ones I had for nearly 5 years which had simply worn out . Normally I 'd complain about thin material but these hold up and remain comfortable without binding . I wear them to workout and they take a beating pretty well . They also stretch a bit and with my , uh , size that 's a plus .	1
Bought this through amazon . Love this shoe . bought a taupe and a black pair . They have good arch support and can wear with dress or slacks..	1
I have worn these off and on all summer . They are comfortable . They keep their shape and color well . Nice purchase .	1
I bought these shoes for my mom , and she is the pickiest shoe shopper ever ! She absolutely loves the comfort of these shoes and hadnt been able to find them for years ! Good thing there is amazon ! She has n't been able to find shoes as comfortable ! She says size are true to size , and she wants me to buy another two pairs ! Good to know I 've made my mom happy !	1
I like the shoes and over all they are pretty comfortable . They are easy and nice but a little narrow	1
I love these shoes for work but they are a bit pricey . I bought a pair in black and navy - bye-bye $ 135 plus tax.I wish they came in a brown but the nearest they have is taupe or bronze and they are rarely available in my size ... 9W . The `` bronze '' has been unavailable in my size almost a year.They are fairly true to size but still take a bit of wear before they are comfortable.They tend to pinch on the toes and I 've had to treat several painful blisters as a result.I like the arch support and the small heel.The only drawback apart from the price is that the lining comes loose very quickly and then slides around inside the shoe which is uncomfortable and annoying .	1
I have been looking for a shoe that I could be comfortable in . I have a wide foot , a bunion , and a ugly hammertoe , . I could never find a shoe that did n't bother one or the other until now . I love softspots anyway , but this shoe is perfect for me .	1
These shoes are smart looking and can take you anywhere ! I had to get a double wide to accommodate my `` flip-flops all my life '' wide feet , but they are like walking on pillows ! Comfort at a decent price !	1
The panties fit exactly as I want them to do . They also appear to be extremely well made . I will definitely be ordering more when necessary .	1
I just love having no tags.. I wish more items would have no tags . Panties are cotton making them cool and they breath .	1
IT WAS REALLY NICE FOR THE PRICE , IT WAS A REALLY NICE COSTUME FOR MY BABY , IT 'S NOT EXPENSIVE AND I LIKE COLORS	1
In fact , we still put the head piece on the kids sometimes , just for s**** and giggles . : ) This was roomy on my the 16 month old , which was good since it allowed us to put a layer of clothing underneath .	1
My one year old wore this for Halloween and he looked adorable in it . He even wore the hat without too much hassle .	1
This is absolutely adorable . I have the fussiest baby in the world . No really , he has won the Sleep-Fighting Championship of the World . When he 's mad , he 's mad . I bought this for him to wear at Halloween this year . For fun , we tried it on this weekend and it 's awesome ! Definitely worth the money .	1
At least they are tight on me . I have a 38 & # 34 ; waist , so ordered the 36-38 & # 34 ; Large size . They fit , but are very tight . Next time I 'll order XL . Other than that , I love the Kangaroo pouch style . For years I 've worn Munsingwear 's Kangaroo pouch briefs , but reviews on their latest product have not been good now that they 're made in China , so I was happy to find Jockey making this style brief . I 'm very happy with the quality ... just should have ordered the larger size ... .	1
Comfortable fit , size is perfect . the material washes beautlfully . Will stay with this brand . THe other brands will be discarded	1
much better then any of the local stores had . I am going to get some more of these.. for cotton thee best ones yet .	1
Comfortable , stout , quality underwear . The pocket seems to let heat rise which is handy . They nearly reach your belly button -- which makes them great choices when you do n't want to tuck in your shirt ( they protect your waist from rough jeans ) .After a month and four wash/wear cycles ( hot water wash and high heat dry for `` super-sterilization-ish-ness '' ) they are still going strong . : ) Munslingers , my old brand , have gone down in quality ( i 've thrown out brand new ones -- I ca n't in good conscience return worn underwear ) ; stretched out elastic , no support , too loose or too tight elastic ( one leg hole might be tight , the other leg hole too loose -- really horrible situations that make 'em unwearable ) .I expect to buy only these Jockeys for many many years .	1
Best briefs on the market . I have worn Jockey Pouch Briefs for many years and they last and are very comfortable and move with you . Love them .	1
I 've been wearing Jockey underwear for years and you ca n't beat this brand.They are constructed well and wear like iron.I do like the choice of many colors.Amazon , as usual , has the best prices around .	1
These briefs are the only style my husband will wear . They fit very comfortably , and they wash and last very well . they can be ordered in all black , which is what he likes .	1
Great price . Even cheaper then at Jockey outlet stores . My husband has worn these type for 40 years and will not wear any other kind . Loves them..	1
When I ordered this product there were 2 colors offered - white and black . Should be clear as black and white , right ? But the color picture of the `` black '' shorts showed as grey which was my preference . I figured the pictured color was considered black . Drat , wrong again . The shorts arrived and are a very black black , not a grey black . Not a big complaint for me but still a little annoying . Everything else appears OK .	1
I do n't think this costume has changed any since one of my older boys wore one years ago . Fun costume that has held up well even after Halloween for regular play time.One word of caution , buy a size larger than you think you need . My boy wears a 5/6 normally , and the 7/8 costume just fit . With a layer of warm clothes underneath he was stuffed tight .	1
This is a simple , fun costume . We purchased this for our Spiderman obsessed son for dress-up fun , and it has stood up to a year 's worth of friends and many hours of play . I would recommend .	1
I bought big and I am glad I did . My son wear a four and I bought a 7 , there is a little growing room , but since this was bought for dress up play it works perfect .	1
I used Domke bags several years ago when I worked as a news photographer . The design was/is one of the best around for a bag to work out of rather than just to carry equipment . I liked the bag for its `` floppiness '' and its ability to mold itself to your body when carried . The biggest problem with the bags -- and I saw this in virtually every Domke bag being carried by news photographers at the time -- was that they wore through due to friction . Carrying it every day meant it rubbed against your side and mine eventually wore a big hole in the back . The only other problem I had with the bag was the lack of weather proofing . Being cotton , when they got wet they stayed wet for a long time.I switched to a waterproofed nylon bag but it had its own problems . Zippers wore out and the rough nylon rubbed against and wore spots on my jackets.Bottom line is -- there is no perfect camera bag . The best I 've found has been the Billingham brand ( those are 5-star bags ) . They are dense-weave cotton with a waterproofing applied . They do n't wear as easily and they do n't absorb water . They 're as easy to work out of as a Domke . They cost a LOT more , however.I like the Domke bags as a less expensive alternative to the Billinghams . I still like to transport equipment in heavily padded , waterproof nylon bags but , more often than not , I 'll carry a Domke or Billingham canvas bag when I 'm actually shooting photos .	1
Beautiful bag . Holds my Nikon D5200 and four lenses and also my Panasonic video camera . Lots of handy little pockets to hold manuals or filters or battery chargers . Perfect to keep everything together in one place .	1
I 've never seen a modestly sized bag hold so much stuff , comfortably . I have a couple larger bags that -technically- hold more , but in some weird configuration so that I 'm always packing and unpacking . Domke bags are designed by a photographer for photographers , and it shows . I started filling this bag , and just 'knew ' where to put everything - and I do n't have to remove more than one item to get to whatever I need . Comes out of the box looking a bit 'lived in ' , and not obviously a camera bag , which is a plus when traveling . The metal clips that back up the velcro top closure could be easier to manipulate , but -- great bag !	1
I like the style . it 's water repellant and it is a no-frills bag . I do n't need all of that extra foam . I may need to whop somebody with my bag full of lenses someday and I want it to count , should the opportunity dictate such a defensive action.It holds everything I need for specific assignments.It 's made in the USA too !	1
I used a Domke F 2 bag back when I was photojournalist . I stopped using it about 20 years ago and went with other brands . I 'm trying to get back in the business again , and feel the F 2 is the way to go . It gives me plenty of room for camera and lenses plus my flash . I dig the look of the sand bag , and the straps work great . I really like Domke products , and will never switch again .	1
I 've got this bag 2 months back . It currently fits a Nikon d300 , 17-55 , 70-200 , Sigma 10-20 , Nikon 50mm f1.8 , sb400 , extra battery , couple lens filters.Pros : -construction . This bag is built very well . Material used seems of high quality , and the stitching is excellent . I really like the straps mechanism , as they feel very secure . The main strap also has some kind of rubbery strips on them , which helps keep the strap from sliding off your shoulder ( and have your thousands of dollars come crashing on the ground ) There is also a smaller hand strap , as opposed to the main sling strap , which is very convenient for helping you precisely lift the bag and place it , which I really like ) -discreetness . This bag does n't look like a typical photography bag , but rather just a standard sling bag . Makes me more comfortable when carrying it though airports , or places that I am not familiar with.-comfort . This bag is very comfortable to carry , even fully loaded , for hours . Because of the canvas nature of the bag , it molds to your body ( assuming you pick it right ) , which makes it feel more secure at your side.Cons.-padding . This bag does not have too much padding , ( it comes with a 4 compartment padding sleeve , which i have converted to a 2+1+1 padding sleeve , to fit my 70-200 lying at an angle ) , and no padding at all on the top . I think the padding is adequate , but probably could be improved.-price . Compared to other equivalent photo bags , this bag seems a little pricey.-weather proofing . This bag does not come with a waterproof cover , though , from what I read from other review , it is pretty waterproof , however , in pouring rain , I 'm pretty sure that it will drench through . ( not quire sure what you would be doing in pouring rain with your equipment ) . This can be fixed by packing a large garbage bag with you all the time , tacky but works.All in all , this is a very nice photographer 's bag . Highly recommended .	1
I know these are sold for boys , but I wear a 8 ( sometimes 8.5 ) in women 's and these are great . I bought a size 6.5 and they fit with plenty of room . They are also extremely comfortable for boots . I can not wait to wear these through the Michigan winter and see how they hold up !	1
When I first put these shoes on they screamed quality and sturdiness . I knew that they were going to last me for quite a long time . The price was also a plus since the adult sizes are a good 30 dollars more expensive . I am a women 's 7.5 and got a kids 6 and it fit perfectly with a little bit of wiggle room.Timberland boots are making a comeback in the style trend . Numerous celebrities are pairing them up with skinny jeans or tights and they just add a nice touch to any wardrobe . They are very attractive and you ca n't go wrong with them for casual wear.Something I must not is that your must wear thick socks with these . I tend to get blisters on my feet if I do n't . I must also not that these boots will wear down your feet . After wearing them for 8 hours walking a good bit , my feet felt like they were about to fall off from the rest of my body . If you are doing a lot of walking around you might need to reconsider your desire to buy these.In the end , I am highly satisfied with these shoes . They are just great and durable !	1
Exactly what I ordered and fit great . Im not sure if they are really waterproof , but i bought them to walk on rocks in Afghanistan and they work great for that .	1
My 10yr old Daughter has hard to fit feet , to say the least ! We have always gotten her good shoes usually fitted at Jamiel 's or other high end stores . 99 % of the time , we get her shoes , sneakers or boots , she wears them 1-2x 's & complains about the fit ! I 'd about had it & was thinking it would cost less to move to a tropical climate & let her run barefoot ! ! ! ! So far AMAZON has been a lifesaver ( hers anyway ! ) I bought NB wide $ 40 sneakers & she LOVES them , wearing them consistently 3-4 times a week . Snow came & we had problems ... ... Uggs are her fav pair yet they are n't for snow & rain : ( so the hunt was on ! Cheap ones , wide , xtra wide , expensive ones , ones we 'd never heard of- ALL did n't fit ... then , looking thru the WIDE width section of girls shoes on here- I found THESE . Now I had tried a different brand of work boots & they fit terrible & were made even worse , so I worried . I waited days , looked again , 1left in her size 5.5 wide ! I grabbed em ' , I was desperate ! They came today- I was shaking , she was scared yet another would n't fit ... Well Dear Lord she put them on & ran around the house smiling & yelling & # 34 ; I LOVE EM ' & # 34 ; ! ! She has a EE width , yet these in just wide fit perfect ! I am now looking to buy stock in the company , as I will be buying soooo many pairs in various sizes ! THANK YOU Timberland & Amazon ! Made well , soft leather & the sole is flexible . A great boot-	1
Love these boots . Have this style in about 7 colors . These are my favorite for work as the grey is a beautiful color and goes with my black work cargo pants . I brush them clean when they get dusty and they still look good as new . Very comfortable for all day on my feet and I have a high arch . Good support .	1
Really happy with the quality of these sturdy kids work-boots with soft uppers and sturdy build , my son just loves them , and I was really pleased too , fast ship too !	1
love love love these fits good got them for a good price great for this time of weather thanks amazon	1
I absolutely idolize Kylie Jenner 's sense of style , so I had to purchase a pair of Timberlands . They were delivered super fast and I got a really good deal on them since I bought them in children 's size . I am a size 7 ( sometimes a 6.5 ) in women 's and I got these shoes in a children 's size 5.5 . They fit great ! They 're kind of heavy , so it takes a while to get used to walking in them but they look amazing . These shoes are very durable and great quality , so you can tell that they 'll last for a long time .	1
I usually have an extra wide width with shoes . I bought this same shoe in a different color way back when in a MEDIUM width . To my surprise , it fit perfect . I ordered this shoe on amazon in medium width and it still fit perfect . They are very comfortable , easy on and off , nice shoe to wear with shorts	1
Very pleased with these shoes really are very c ' & ntilde ; omodos both so they buy another pair but different color . Highly recommended .	1
We love these shoes . They have a perfect fit and are very comfortable . They are very durable . Very good product .	1
I know how long they lasted because my Amazon purchase history shows when I bought the last pair , on 11/27/10 . I know they lasted more than 2,000 miles because I always wore these shoes when I walked my dog and that was twice a day , one mile each time . I wore them on other occasions as well and figured I would go with the most conservative values which to me are still pretty impressive.After all this the soles started to wear , I figured it was time to get a replacement & # 34 ; dog walking shoe & # 34 ; and ordered the same shoe again . The size , 12W , was dead on and the shoes are as comfortable as before . They are still light , and have an effective tread without looking clunky .	1
My dad has bad knees and asks me to get these for him . He really likes the comfort of them , the style and the ease of putting them on . He has had several pair and they all seem to be great	1
These shoes are probably the most comfortable I own . I 'd been thinking about getting a pair for years because of all the positive reviews so I finally pulled the trigger . Good call , because they are super comfy and easy to slip on and off . On the downside though they are black seude shoes . I must not have looked closely enough because I thought they were just black leather . I suppose I just do n't see myself as the type of guy that wears seude shoes . I power through it though because these things are so comfortable . They 'll work great for casual wear in the winter/fall , but come summer spring I do n't see myself sporting these shoes with shorts . They really only work with jeans.Fit was as expected , unlike Keens that usually need a 1/2 size bigger .	1
Fit good , put them on and spent the day in them . Easy slide on and would recommend them to any one .	1
These are the best fitting , best wearing shoes I 've come across . I have a pair for dress , and when they get weathered I wear them for casual . Then I wear them for yard work and then they get tossed . I keep three pair in rotation.I would recommend these shoes to anyone , family or friend .	1
Pro : Comfortable fit , good looking shoes , great traction on dry surface.Con : slippery on certain wet concrete surface or certain wet tiles . Wet roads or paths are alright.Overall : Good shoes that I will buy again as I am using it mostly on dry surface at work .	1
I am on my second pair of these shoes . I wore the first pair out after about 3 years of wearing them nearly every day even in the winter . Even then I kept them for work shoes since they were still functional but looked really beat up . I 'm still wearing my second pair but do n't wear them very often once the snow hits . This pair is on around year 3 also and the soles are completely flat in some spots now . The elastic is stretched permanently and the adhesive is coming undone around the toes . Some of the rubber is starting to deteriorate along the sides but he leather has no holes or tears . The built in plastic support around the ankle area has cracked on both shoes . Nevertheless , they are still functional and extremely comfortable . They keep my feet warm enough in the winter for casual wear but I would not dare use them for winter hiking or other winter sports for fear of frostbite . Their dry traction seems to be pretty good and wet traction is decent . Overall , these are a very good shoe . My measured shoe size is between 9.5 and 10 ( closer to 10 ) but this shoe in 9.5 fits perfect . If I had to approximate my exact size I 'd be probably a 9.9 .	1
Great slip-on shoe . I have been wearing these shoes for a couple of years and they are very comfortable . Only shortcoming is the non-replaceable sole , so when the sole wears out you have to buy a new pair ( which I have done ) .	1
These are the most comfortable shoes I 've ever worn . I 've been wearing Merrill shoes for years and refuse to put my feet in anything else .	1
The first time I saw Mocs , I thought they were ugly shoes . But wearing them is a different story- they are SO comfortable . It 's the only shoe I 've worn for about 15 years now . I used to buy them from REI , but REI only carries standard widths ( at least the store I go to does ) and Amazon had them in wide , which is what I prefer .	1
If you are looking for a supportive , comfortable slip-on for work or for casual wear , you may want to consider `` Merrell Jungle Moc '' slip-ons . These shoes are not light in weight ; the pair ( size 10 1/2D ) weighs approximately 1 lb . 12 5/8 oz . The suede is a good quality and finish on these slip-ons is clean and well done . Interior seams are clean and the lining is soft and cushioned . The soles are rubber and , if wearing these on wet surfaces , help prevent slipping.Because `` Merrell Jungle Moc '' are not flexible but are somewhat wide , you may find it necessary to order a smaller size than you normally wear . My spouse wears an 11 D in Brooks running shoes and an 11D in most conventional shoes . The `` Merrell Jungle Moc '' slip-ons that fit comfortably and did not gap or slide were a size 10 1/2D . From the middle of the front to the center of the heel , the interior measurement on a 10 1/2D is approximately 11 `` . At the ball of the foot , the interior width is approximately 3 `` ; at the heel , approximately the interior width is approximately 2 '' .Individuals having more sensitive feet may find the point at which the sole joins to the shoe , near the ball of the foot , somewhat irritating . It was for this reason that my spouse purchased `` Skechers GoWalk2 '' shoes and returned the `` Merrell Jungle Moc '' slip-ons . Overall had his right foot not been so sensitive , he would have kept them as he did like these shoes .	1
I 've owned a bunch of Merrells , mostly of the & # 34 ; moc & # 34 ; variety . Nothing negative on this particular model , though I ca n't yet comment on durability . However , past Merrells have held up nicely ; the outsoles always wear down smooth long before the uppers are ready to pack it in . The one thing I notice with this model is that the sizing seems to run a tad larger than my other Merrell mocs -- I ordered the same size I always have , but this pair fit a smidge looser than I expected . Without a comparison , I ca n't say if a 1/2 size smaller would fit better .	1
The shoe looks as described at Amazon . I really wanted the 12 1/2 size but it would not have been eligible for the free shipping and two day delivery because Amazon does not stock that size but can get it from another store . The shoe is tight but is not uncomfortable even after long periods of standing and walking around . I think I will like this shoe unless it has traction problems on wet surfaces . Other reviews do n't seem to indicate that .	1
Bought them for my husband . He loves them , very comfortable and easy to put on and my take off . And he 's very picky	1
I have had some of the cheaper versions of these and the Merrells are definetely a cut above . Better arch support and so on . I expect they will wear a lot better as well . Sizing is true to size . It would be nice if they made them in narrow sizes for guys like me though .	1
These were a Christmas gift for my husband . He LOVES them . They fit well , are very comfortable and have great traction . I 'm sure he will get a lot of use out of these shoes and will be back to buy more .	1
These seem to be great overall quality , and fit just like expected . Just thought I 'd add that the & # 34 ; slip on/off & # 34 ; factor in these comes together really well . Some lace-less shoes end up getting a bit weird when you actually try to just kick them on , these do n't roll or jam up on your foot , the elastic lets them slide on nicely .	1
I bought these for my 92 yr old father in law and he loves them , they are comfortable and easy for him to put on . So when he goes to bingo he is styling	1
These shoes are the most comfortable and durable that I have found . My feet are big and wide , and I am greatly satisfied . The sizes do vary a little depending on the color ( I have found that Charcoal runs smaller than Gunsmoke ) .	1
Love Merrell ever since I bought my first pair and they lasted me 5 years . Very durable and comfortable . Just wish they were available locally . Not overly fond of having to buy shoes online .	1
My husband had a pair of Merrell 's similar to these that we purchased in 2007 . He loved them and they 're still in really good shape , but they do n't look as nice for dressing up anymore . So , we ordered these and he loves them ! Great support , looks great , and comfortable ... what more is there to say ?	1
My husband loves these shoes and wears them all the time .	1
I just received my order , & with the help of a shoehorn ( normal procedure for me ) got them on just fine . So far they seem to fit well , I find them comfortable to walk in , & the traction is good -- especially needful as I have balance problems.I 'll seriously think of getting another pair when I need new ones !	1
These are my everyday shoes , I have been wearing Merrells for about six years . As soon as a pair gets a little tired , I buy another pair .	1
I bought this based on the brand and good reviews . My husband loved it . Very comfortable and good fit ! Will buy again in the future .	1
Ten years ago , my husband bought a pair of these Merrell shoes locally . They were the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn . Now ( 10 years later ) , after wearing these shoes on a daily basis , they have finally bit the dust . We bought the same version from Amazon to replace his old Jungle Slip-on 's , and the new ones are just as comfortable . Out of the box , there 's no break-in period needed -- he can wear them all day , with nary a blister .	1
I 've tired imitation Merrell mocs in the past . They fit just fine and lasted forever , but the comfort was n't even close.While an imitation is n't uncomfortable it does n't have the arch support or contoured sole that the Jungle Mocs have.I normally wear a D-E width shoe and these . I did buy the D as I though the EE would be too wide . The D does run narrow . If you are on the wider side I 'd suggest going to the EE . Other than the slightly narrow fit , great shoe .	1
I have been wearing Merrells for a while and highly suggest them for anyone that has trouble finding comfortable shoes . I must say that I prefer the Jungle Moc Nubuck , Brown Nubuck but it seems that the Brown Nubuck are being discontinued for the present time and it 's hard to find the Brown Nubuck . I decided to try Men 's Merrell Jungle Moc Leather , Mahogany Brown and was very satisfied with every thing but the color . The Merrell Jungle Moc Leather , Mahogany Brown is not mahogany at all , not even close but rather a tan looking color . Beware that the Mahogany Brown as shown in the picture is not the correct color . It is a very light brown or tan colored shoe . I almost sent them back but the return time frame closed on me . If you like a lighter colored shoe this is a great and comfortable shoe . I do like the new sole on this shoe . It has a better grip support sole that the older Merrells . It is made of all smooth leather and not suede like most other Merrells .	1
My `` old '' pair sole finally wore down and I realize that this is my third pair . I 'm a 10.5-11 and the 11 's fit me well , so plan accordingly .	1
If you are not playing sports why wear sneakers . These Merrell 's are great comfort and look good too . No breaking in even . Wear well , and clean up well too .	1
I have been buying Jungle Mocs for my wife for years and finally said , what the hey , I should try them myself and so I bought them and now understand why my wife and everyone loves them , . Give your tired feet a present of a snuggly yet supportive shoe you can wear anywhere .	1
I got these shhoes for my father who loves going hiking and he really loves them , he now wears them everyday for the morning walk .	1
These shoes shipped fast and fit perfect . I needed work shoes to wear during 12 hour shifts in an ER . These are awesome for that . They support my feet and they do not rub my toes raw . They are also easy to put on and pull off . They are not the best looking shoes though . My wife makes fun of them all the time on me but I do n't care . They feel amazing . Perfect shoes for work but I would not wear them out in town or on date night .	1
My wife and I both buy Merrell 's and love them . It is all about being comfortable , and getting great wear out of this shoe . When I have purchased a product less expensive in the past , I got exactly that ... an uncomfortable shoe , or one that did not last long . No problem with Merrell 's ... I purchased them with confidence .	1
This shoe is extremely comfortable , looks good and is convenient . Slips on and slips off . No laces to tie or untie . Really great for traveling and going thru those irritating TSA checkpoints at the airports . The seller however I can not recommend . When I orderd my Merrells , the seller had them listed as in stock , yet it took two emails ... the second one threatening cancellation to finally get them shipped two weeks later . BTW ... this is my second pair . The first pair were bought for me at a Merrell Store in Birmingham , Alabama and they are still going strong . Just wanted another color .	1
Bought these for my husband who has bad feet and he loves them . He does n't need to wear his orthotics !	1
Merrell makes extremely comfortable slip ons with good durability . The W offers some more room for wider feet than the M. Shoe offers good grip for traction as well .	1
These are the nicest shoes a guy could ask for . Fit like a sneaker and look really nice for casual wear . I really like them a lot .	1
These shoes are comfortable , but the are a little bigger than normal.That does n't bother me because they are slip ons anyway .	1
Great shoes and really well made . The only area that has issues is the glue on the elastic at they top of the shoe , but that has n't been a big deal yet .	1
My husband wears nothing but this shoe and of course Merrel sandels in the summer time . He says the support in these shoes is the best he has every had . These were purchased to wear on his daily morning walk with our dogs .	1
I just got these this morning and have n't taken them off yet . I may sleep in them ! They fit true to size , easy on/easy off and very comfortable . Even better , I live at a ski resort and the soles on these shoes are incredible on snow and ice . I had the Merrell Shivers , which were warmer , but very slippery on ice.Merrell makes a lot of different soles . The ones I got look like they have octopus suckers on the sides and little square nubs in the center . Very bizarre looking but very sticky . These soles come on the standard Jungle Mocs.Edited 11/30/12 : I just got my second pair . What a difference . As great as these shoes are they do n't last forever , so treat yourself to a new pair when the soles wear down . They feel awesome again !	1
Wow , these are just SO comfortable to wear . I 've worn so many different kinds of shoes over the years . A $ 400 pair of dress shoes may have some comfort when on your feet for ten hours , but these are just like walking on air . I 've put on a few pounds and my feet are not as forgiving as in my youth , but these are some of the most comfortable footwear I 've ever worn ! In a weeks time I 've had three strangers stop me and ask about them , and another two have said , they own 'em and yes , it is n't just me , these Merrell Jungle Mocs are truly comfortable . I 've never recommended shoes before , but I 'd recommend considering these for real comfort .	1
They are my son 's 5th pair . He only wears Merrell jungle moc since he was 8 years old . He loves them .	1
Seems lately the shoes you get are getting shorter or narrower or just do n't fit . Had a few pairs of Romeos and all pairs hurt my feet . Was skeptical about these Merrell Jungle Mocs but the 100s of reviews were outstanding so I tried them.wow , glad I did ! Told my wife I will need a nw pair soon because these will be worn out from constant wear . Now she wants a pair . Oh , did I forget to say , they are good looking , too !	1
I have been purchasing the Men 's Merrell Jungle Moc for about six years now . I have deteriorating Cartilage my knees . This is complicated by the fact that I am teacher who has to be on his feet most of the day . The cushioning of the Jungle Moc actually takes pressure of my knees . It is a great product , and the vendor delivered them in no time at all .	1
my husband has parkinsonism - these shoes are great -- forming stability in his walk-they are also wonderful for a man with a long wide foot .	1
I 've been a Merrell fan for a long time . These shoes are not only stylish but extremely comfortable . I highly recommend these shoes .	1
I 've worn these shoes for years . Thy 've been VERY kind to my feet . The medium width is a good B size . I bought my husband a pair of white ones last summer , which -- miracles never cease -- he 's still wearing . They 're the only ones I 've seen that are wide enough for him ( He wears the XW . ) These shoes are good for walking and playing tennis . I also wear an old pair to workout in the gym .	1
I purchased a similar shoe a couple years ago . This particular pair of shoes is a shiny leather that looks the same in every other way . I 'm not sure if this is the same as what I bought previously , but it seemed like it would be from the pictures . Anyway , the shiny leather squeaks a little while I walk . The sound seems to be going away over time , but it is a little annoying at first	1
KSwiss Classic Luxury sneakers are one of the most comfortable sneakers there are , especially for being as simple , less bulky as they are.On the inside , they are very cushiony , especially the sole . My husband wanted a simple , comfortable , black sneaker to wear when he does security work now and then & # 34 ; on the side. & # 34 ; He needed something that would be good for standing/walking long 12 hr nights and did not want something too expensive as he only does this a few times a year , for certain events . These sneakers fit the bill perfectly and were our first choice since they fit every aspect we were looking for.They are simple , but look great with anything . I have been wearing them myself for decades , but this was my husband 's first pair . He was very happy with them .	1
Just what my husband was looking for . He only likes solid white casual shoes besides his track shoes for work outs in the NG . They fit true to size .	1
I would recomend these shoes to anyone.A little more narrow in the toes that the other pair I have.But look great ! I really like K-Swiss shoes !	1
It is just what I wanted to replace the old pairs . Goes well with everything and great price . True to size .	1
For me this is a perfect fit and oh so easy on the old feet . It was sized correctly and looks exactly as I wanted it . To go on would be redundant .	1
Cant really go wrong with K Swiss , have worn them before and love them . Dont typically buy black shoes but had to have them for work . Only thing I would suggest if you have not worn K Swiss before is to maybe try on at a store before ordering online . They run small- you will probably need 1 to 1 1/2 size larger than you normally wear .	1
After laughing the whole way home from the mall after seeing what looked like clown shoes for $ 150 or more I was glad to find these on Amazon . Ok , I admit I 'm in my mid forties but I 'm sorry the multicolored goofball shoes I saw did n't impress me much , they just look ridiculous . These however have a simple clean look and are some of the best fitting athletic shoes I 've ever owned . I like a snug fit and these fit like a glove . You might not be the gym peacock but your workout wo n't suffer .	1
I always look at construction , fit , appearance and price when I buy athletic shoes.I am not of the new school when it comes to this type of shoe.The persons name on it makes zero difference to me , plus it only adds to the cost in order to pay the endorsee.This shoe is the best in my view.I currently own 2 pair.They are comfortable and well constructed.I will keep buying them as long as K-Swiss keeps making them	1
My husband loves these hard to find tennis ! Thanks amazon for having them so I can easily shop ! They are the most comfortable shoes .	1
Have not had a pair of K-Swiss since the 80 's . These look and feel great . Plus it 's not the everybody is wearing it shoe like a Nike or Adidas well at least around here I have not seen anyone wearing them but I get compliments on them . A forgotten brand ? I will look to them in the future when I make my next purchase .	1
wow ! K-Swiss men 's ST329 Lace-Up sneaker all White , I love and fit well and are comfortable and I will also get the Brown ones to wear and glad I did get them and I would recommend these sneaker to anyone . 100 % please	1
I really like this shoes and the moment I saw this I had to own it , K-Swiss makes a great shoes	1
Essentially as expected . I have used them now about half-dozen times , and find them comfortable for court play , and at this time , appear that they will hold-up well , and will not wear-out prematurely .	1
K-Swiss is a must have for one of my sons . He reports great fit , perfect for running as well as working out at the gym.These are stylish enough to wear most anywhere not just for fitness training .	1
The shoes came fast . that why I like this company . everything was just right and my baby girl love them ... ... ... ...	1
My husband is a fan of these and so am I . Since my son has been able to wear hard-bottom tennis shoes , we have purchased several pair and have never been disappointed .	1
YEP LOVE THESE ! Look small but are true to size when put them on the childs foot . LOVE THEM . These are perfecto !	1
I bought these in a size 6 1/2 when my daughter was wearing size 6 . I find that Reebok , Nike , & K-Swiss run a half size smaller or tend to be a little narrower than other tennis shoes . If a 6W was available , I would 've ordered those instead . Also , they are nice shoes but the shoes strings are to get out and clean .	1
My son needed shoes for his first soccer class and tennis shoes were suggested as an alternative to cleats . These seem comfortable and very durable .	1
Love the shoe and love K-Swiss but the shoe was too small so we had to order a larger size and rush it so he could have it in time .	1
The quality is still the same as I remember it . Unfortunately the sneaker does not run narrow andd the medium is just to wide . Disappointed skinny feet .	1
Love these shoes . My son has a wide foot and they fit great ! Dad has a pair and the two dress alike . Great shoe for a great price . So glad I caught them at $ 20.99 . I see that they have gone up in price !	1
My tot loves supers . I bought this big on purpose so I really ca n't testify to the size but its been peed in and washed a few times and is still going strong .	1
I bought this for my 5 year old grandson and he could n't have been happier ! I picked this one because it is n't padded in the chest . I wanted the costume to be comfortable since my grandson likes to wear his costume day and night . I actually ordered both the medium and the small . The sizing on the package of the small said ages 3-4 . That made me uncertain if it would fit since my grandson is tall for his age . Just to be safe I ordered the medium too . It turned out the small was a perfect fit with room to grow so I returned the medium which was too big . If your child loves to dress up , I 'm sure this will be a hit !	1
As with some other reviewers , the belt and cape were separate . Maybe different styles of the same costume and the one you get depends on which year 's model Amazon grabs out of the bin ? Either way - grandson loves it ! I bought a small and was surprised to find it fits both the 3.5 and the 5.5 year olds - one loose and one tight ! Seems to be good quality - especially for a kids halloween costume .	1
We wanted the costume that did n't have all the bulk in it . This was perfect . My son is 4 and it was a little big , but I just think- hey , he can wear it to play in for a good year or so . He 'll get lots of wear out of this . It would be nice if the boot covers fit tighter , but they were good enough ! Easy on and off ... we actually had a whole outfit on under it to keep warm , so there 's your muscle bulk , if that 's what you want .	1
This product is perfect for a little guy who wants to be a super hero . The description was right on . And the price was good .	1
Takes about one week to break it in , I ordered the XXL for my hubby who normally wears an 11 , he likes his flip flops to have some room at the ends , he loves these after they broke in	1
Only reason I bought another pair is because my OG 's fell off a boat . Simple , and quality sandal . Not the cheapest but I will stick with them until they dissapoint .	1
My first pair of Rainbows lasted me 4 years of very heavy wear . I could have worn them for another 2 . These are great , and I love them . The heel is the only part that wears down at all , but it takes a really long time . I probably wore my first pair of these for 14 months daily ( over 4 years ) .	1
Easily my favorite sandals I 've ever owned . I 've had them for almost three years now , and I still wear them and they have n't worn out yet . I would definitely buy them again . The only thing you need to know is that those run a little smaller than usual . My shoes size usually is a 10.5-11 depending on the brand and the 9.5-10.5 fits perfectly . It was a little hard to get used to it in the beginning since it molds to one 's feet , but as soon as that happened , it was the most comfortable pair of sandals I 've ever owned !	1
He used my account to buy this , I think he is liking his new sandals . It seems to me well fitting to my brother .	1
Since this is a christmas present I wo n't be able to give a review of the product . I have been wearing this brand of shoe for 20 years and love it .	1
I wear these with jeans . Cute shoes !	1
I 've worn Reebok Women 's Freestyle Hi Tops for years , when I needed new ones recently , I went to several local stores at the mall only to find they did n't haven any and & # 34 ; had n't seen them in a while & # 34 ; . So , went to trusty Amazon.com and found them with ease . These are the only shoes I can wear that do n't hurt my feet and that have good ankle support . The fit is great , they do n't wear out . Good quality workmanship .	1
Just like FloRida says & # 34 ; Reeboks with the straps. & # 34 ; Ca n't beat them for comfort and support when on your feet all day . So far so good .	1
I have a friend who feet kill her she wanted these so order them for her so far they have work like a dream..	1
These are very comfortable for zumba . The low tread works on all floors and the hightop is good for no rolling your ankle .	1
I had a pair of Reebok Hi-Top sneakers years ago and wore them to threads . I had n't seen any locally and had basically given up , until stumbling upon them on Amazon . I was delighted to get another pair.I remembered , and I 'm glad I did , that these shoes run on the small and narrow side . I normally wear a size 9 , but went up a half size to 9.5 . And , they fit perfectly , with room for a light , gel type orthopedic insert , which I think is necessary because the footbed is not very cushioned . There is moderate arch support.I know many younger folks like Hi-Tops as a fashion statement . I really like them for the ankle support , particularly with this shoe because the double velcro straps provide for necessary adjustments for perfect comfort.These shoes are a blast from the past . I may have to spring for a pair in black for the upcoming fall/winter .	1
I use to love these in the '80 's but hi-tops became obsolete . Glad I could find some because in the hot summer I hate wearing my ankle braces as they make my feet sweat too much and constrict my blood flow making my feet and ankles swell . Anyway , although I have n't worn these out of the house yet , I 'm sure they will work well for me provided I still use my cane . I will admit in reading the other reviews , they do run narrow which was fine with me and the length was perfect . Nicely made too .	1
First time I had this model was in 1983 . Bought them in Miami , saw them on top athletes . I loved them then and I love them now . Thank you .	1
Warm and Sturdy . I have only had this coat for a couple of weeks , but it appears to be living up to all the good reviews . Very warm and very well made ( in Mexico ) . I fully expect to use this jacket all the time because it is warm and fashionable enough and should be able to handle anything I can put it through . I am looking forward to breaking this coat in over the next few months but am very confident I made the right choice . For sizing : I am almost 5'8 & # 34 ; and the medium came about 2 inches below my waiste aind is plenty big to wear clothing underneath . However , again , the coat is so warm , I am wearing T-shirts in sub 40 degree weather with the coat on - even on windy days .	1
I got this for the boyfriend because he needed a good work coat , and he loves it . It seems to be very well made and very warm .	1
this coat can be worn in the field or to a meeting at the office ... . it 's good for the top floor of an open structure or the conference room or the shop ... . keeps me VERY warm yet when unzipped is fine indoors ... . GREAT BUY ! ... . the attachable hood stinks tho ... . WAYYYYY TO SMALL ! ( see separate review )	1
The Sandstone Traditional Arctic quilt coat is made of high quality-durable fabric . It is water resistant and extremely warm against harsh winter weather . I like how Carhartt sticks to their line of more casual style of clothing and not creating something shiny , fancy and bold . This coat will keep you warm enough , so that you will not have to dress in too many layers . Carhartt makes clothing for the hard-working man . This coat is what we call `` A Man 's Coat '' .	1
I grew up on a farm ( and am now 38 ) , and still consider myself a farm kid . But back then , I grew up on a small farm and we did n't have enough money to buy good stuff like Carhartt jackets for us kids who grew out of them every year ! I 've kind of always wanted one , and finally got sick of Columbia jackets with fleece lining that fills me with static or other jackets that just do n't last . So I researched and bought this one.Many of the reviews claim that it 's warm enough to wear outside as your sole jacket during winter . This winter ( 2013 ) in Fargo has been nasty cold so far , with multiple days with 0 degrees F or lower as a daily high ! Most of these cold days , I am wearing a sweater under this , and it does the trick for me going from vehicle to building and back , while keeping me comfortable while driving . I 've also worn it for longer periods of time outside when it 's cold and windy , with a sweatshirt under it , and it has performed very well . It cuts the wind better than I expected , so as long as you have a warmer layer under it , it really is warm enough.I am 6'3 '' tall , and about 190 pounds . I also have trouble finding jackets with long enough sleeves . I bought the Medium , Long , and it fits me perfectly ! ! This is the part I 'm happiest about . Even with a sweatshirt under it , it 's still big enough.It has lots of pockets . Another important thing for me is enough pockets to carry my wallet , cell phone , and sunglasses . It has 2 large inner chest pockets ( one with a velcro top , another with a zipper ) , and I keep my wallet in the velcro one . It also has 2 outer chest pockets , and I keep my smart phone in one of those , easily accessible , easy to hear if it rings.I am very happy with this jacket , and am looking forward to having it last me multiple Fargo winters ! Edited 12/30/13 : Just spent an hour and a half tailgating for a football game , at -5 degrees F. I wore a long sleeved dry-fit shirt , a sweatshirt , a jersey , and this jacket , and felt perfectly dressed . I was concerned about spending this much time outside at that temperature with this jacket , but again , with the right layers , it cut the wind nicely , and did the job as expected !	1
My wife is pretty damned picky , but she sure as hell LOVED these socks I bought her ... Because she walks around the house in SOX , I thought I 'd take a risk.Like I said , she loves 'em ! I bought some of the OTHER colors , too !	1
item is exactly as ordered and advertised ; this is very heartening because lately I have returned many items ordered through amazon	1
I started wearing these Thorlo Thick Cushion Hiking Socks a few years ago based on reviews and I am delighted . Since their sizing is more specific , the socks fit perfectly , not too big like most . There 's no extra material bunching in my shoes . These are now the only socks I buy and wear them year round . They are not cheap but they last an amazingly long time . Worth the price ! ( But I did stock up during a sale ! )	1
I was discussing survival techniques with an Army officer who recommended Thorlo socks for warmth . I bought some for that purpose , for power outages , cold Winter weather , etc. , and never have wanted any other kind since . They last for years and I wear them every day , Winter and Summer , usually without shoes since I work from home , sometimes with shoes on 3-mile walks . These are everything I want in a sock . I highly recommend them.Be careful to choose the right color .	1
I bought these for boots that are large on me . These thick socks do the job of filling out the footbed and keeping my toes warm .	1
I bought two pairs of these to wear with my newly purchased Golden Retriever safety toed hiking boots . They are very soft & fit well . I got the medium in black and I wear I size 7 . It has been cold and wet out here , so these are great to have right now . Very happy with my purchase and would buy again .	1
I wear a 7.5-8 womens shoe and loved this while hiking . The heel reinforcements reach up to your ankle so that if you are wearing hiking boots with good ankle support , the sock will be stronger there , too . Great , and actually pretty cute.I shopped around a lot on Amazon and found the other stuff way too expensive . This was the best womens one I could find .	1
I have been buying Thorlo socks for decades . I just bought several pairs of these in black and the Thorlo quality is every bit as good as they used to be . These socks are so comfortable , great in summer as well as winter and not just for hiking . These are wonderful for walking the city pavements but you have to have shoes that are roomy enough to fit these wonderfully plush padded absorbent socks . These are a treat for your feet !	1
I 've worn these about 4 times on hikes and walks . They are wonderful ! I 've always used smart wool and these are comparable . I have the regular green smartwools so these are much thicker . But nice in the cold !	1
I bought this sock to wear with my rain boots in the winter . It has lots of cushion and I have had no blisters after wearing them long hours . This sock fits my foot well , but is not as binding as other Experian type Thorlos I have worn . The extra cushion on the bottom is really nice , and I have been wearing them around my house as a slipper sock . Only buy them if you have extra room in your shoe .	1
I could n't be happier with this sock . It is just so comfortable and the quality is just so high . Never say no to this until you actually try it . It worths the full retail price . Now I know how socks should be made . I would highly recommend this .	1
I wear these socks for every day , versus hiking , and they are perfect . They are not too thick for regular wear , but enough cushioning in the right places to feel good.I ordered the socks in Women 's Small . According to the cardboard packaging , this should fit shoe size : US ( W ) .. 5.0 - 6.5UK ... . 3.5 - 5.0EU ... . 36.0 - 38.0My shoe size is 6 Wide and these socks just fit nicely .	1
I bought these to go snowshoeing in and they worked very well . At the end of the day my feet were warm , dry and comfortable . They just feel really nice to put on .	1
This sock is very thick and was a close fit into my hiking shoes . This brand has good support for the foot and ankle and feels really cozy on .	1
These socks are great . They 're are very comfortable . I know these are advertised for hiking , but I have worn them with 2 inch heeled boots before and they 're great . My feet would normally start hurting after walking for a long time in those boots , but with these socks on , my feet do n't hurt at all . It 's amazing . These socks really do what they say they do . I would order another pair .	1
The wife went for an Mt Everest Base Camp trek , from Lukla to EBC and back to Lukla- 11 days . The problem was the weight allowed was only 8KG ( about 17 lbs ) for the porters carry , therefore even extra pairs of socks were a bad item to haul . She carried 4 pairs of these socks and they did an amazing job of keeping her feet clear of all the sweat and ensured that she suffered no blisters doing about 8-9 hours of walking at that altitude.She wears shoes- Timberlands 7.5M and Reeboks US 9.5- probably due to the differences in widths . These socks fit upto US 9.5 for men perfect , and if you are 10+ then these may not be for you.All in all , she recommends this for any prolonged wear and for closed shoes , unlike track/sports shoes , where ventilation could be in issue . Absolute recommended buy .	1
If you are on the higher end of the size range , id go up . Otherwise , they are so comfortable ! ! ! ! I really like them so far except they are snug in my toe area . hoping a stretch and line dry will fix that	1
thorlo socks are wonderful , I own a lot of them . they last for yearsif taken care of , so I wash on permapress and hang to dry , just takes a night . BEST ADVICE , BUY AT LEAST TWO PAIRS AT TIME .	1
I 've had these for 2 years and have worn them hiking and walking all over the city again and again and again - they keep me warm and are still as good as new . I 'll definitely keep buying them .	1
Women 's size 11 shoe size here ( Men 's 9 1/2 ) and I ordered the large . Could not be happier ! I love the padding , and the comfort in terms of temperature and moisture . I have a foot injury , and I need support and cushioning for my toes and the ball of my foot- these socks are perfect . They are very thick- so make sure your shoes can accommodate them- but aside from that caveat , these should not give you any trouble , and at least for my shoe size , the fit was perfection .	1
I thought this product would be softer under foot , but it feels a bit rough . The color is good as it is impossible to find thicker blue socks . All in all this product is okay for me - might be better for you .	1
I wear a size 8 women 's shoe and the socks fit perfect . The cushioning of the sole are perfect and help make walking comfortable . They are also quite warm and great for cold weather . I highly recommend them .	1
Perfect fit , true to size , very comfortable and good for hiking . Also do not sweat too much work perfectly with my hiking shoes .	1
I have no complaints . This sock has been fine for hiking . I did lots of backpacking during the summer . Works well .	1
great for someone on your feet . if you work on your feet these are great . fit well . nice thick cushions good for a day of strong movement .	1
I usually just wear running socks , but decided to get these socks because we were going to be hiking in the mountains . I opted for Thorlo 's because I have had great luck with them in the past - these did not disappoint . They work great and feel great . Keep in mind that these are thicker socks , so if your shoes run on the smaller size , these may not work .	1
These cushion my feet and they stay up . They also keep my fit warm . The sock is thick and wo n't fit into snug shoes which was to be expected . The work great in my regular shoes and hiking shoes .	1
They feel very well made and they fit well . Loose but not baggy . Have worn thermals underneath and they do n't feel tight . I pick up the black in 36x32 . I am now looking to pick up another pair in the brown . Highly recommend .	1
Pretty much every construction worker seems to own a pair of these , in classic Carhartt brown . Every semi-feral hobo kid seems to have these , or the overalls , or the double-fronted ones in black ( to hide the dirt . ) I wear them because they 're the hardest-wearing , most comfortable work pants for the money , very close to the gold standard ( Duluth Trading Company edges them out on quality by half a notch , but their stuff costs more . ) Not only do the pants last longer than the GAP and Dockers pants , they also meet most peoples ' contemporary standards of casual attire , and do n't look out of place with a polo or Oxford shirt . Once broken-in , they 're quite comfortable , with a loose but not baggy cut that can fit over a pair of long johns without chafing in cold weather . They 've made jeans obsolete in my wardrobe , being tougher and much better-looking street clothes . Good stuff -- buy a pair if you have n't already .	1
Great pants to wear while working in the yard or to stay warm on snowy days . Nice heavy thick material .	1
We 've bought these time and time again because they 're such a great buy . They last a very long time due to the type of fabric and they fit great . My brother has asked for a new pair every Christmas for the past few years because he loves them so much !	1
These pants fit just great . Not too tight as to restrict movement , but not overly baggy or anything . They seem very durable .	1
These pants come so close to being perfect ! The fit and color were accurate and true to amazon 's descriptions . They are stiff at first , almost like wearing a new burlap bag . A few washes later and they 're getting much better . If you leave them in the dryer they will dry pretty wrinkled and in the wrinkle 's creases it leaves faint white marks . I have no idea what these are , but they are unsightly . They also come with a slight boot cut which makes them fit perfectly until it gets to the knee , they it looks baggy . My biggest complaint is lack of security in the pockets . Are n't these suppose to be for rugged carpenters and outdoorsmens ? None of the pockets have any buttons or even velcro . I spend a nervous day in downtown New York City constantly feeling my pockets to make sure my wallet and phone had n't slipped out . Other than that , I love them . They are constructed like Fort Knox . The crotch definitely is n't going to split anytime soon . I can see these lasting for years .	1
my husband works construction and the double knee + heavy weight prevents me from having to mend pants all weekend long	1
good pants , just a bit over priced in my opinion . if they last for a while then I suppose that warrants the price	1
These pants are well made , are comfortable but smart , and have that feel of quality which makes you feel good .	1
I work at an Auto Parts store , and these are perfect for that type of environment ... . as I am always on the move , and constantly have to either squat down , or move up a ladder . These are not only comfortable , they put up to the strain of a fast-paced work environment	1
I got these for my husband who is a general contractor . He usually rips the regular pants in 2 or 3 wearings . I will see how long he keeps these . He likes the fit and it appears to be durable . The fabric looks really strong . I have since ordered 2 more pairs in different colors . Thank you .	1
Like all Carhartt products , these pants are extremely well made , they fit well , are comfortable and look great . High quality at a reasonable price !	1
Light weight , durable , true to size , and they look great on my husband . Men can not go wrong with Carhartt brand clothing .	1
These are the most comfortable pieces of clothing I wear . After the third or fourth time I wore them , unreal fit . Just amazing .	1
Great pants . I own 3 pair . Good fit , comfortable , and tough . Just what you 'd expect from Carhartt . Spend the money	1
I 'm a Cabinetmaker with 35 years of experience . I 've been wearing this type of Carhartt pants for years . They are very comfortable , have plenty of pockets for various tools and pencils , etc . They get excellent wear and run tru to size .	1
I bought Carhartt work dungarees since I wanted durable pants I could use for snow blowing , cutting the grass , and doing other work around the house . I also am a teacher , so I need pants that will look good for me in school . These pants sure are just right for outdoor work and school . What I like is the back pockets are nice and large . My over-sized wallet fits perfectly . The front pockets are big enough and sturdy enough to hold everything you want to put inside . The other benefit is that since they are work dungarees , the pockets are designed to carry all sorts of items in them without getting holes in them.I am a physically larger person and these pants actually make me look good . They fit really well . The best part is that when you bend , stretch , or pick up something you are n't going to have a blow out on the side of the pants or in the crotch area . I just wish I had purchased these about ten years ago . There are also added side pockets for tools or whatever you want . The material is great and also the pants fit a bit loose , which I like . The material does n't chafe you , but you can tell it can stand up to wear and tear . If you are a hard-on-clothing sort of person , then buy these pants . You wo n't regret it .	1
When you look at the picture you think that they might be a distressed type of fabric but actually the colors are rock solid and the material is n't wrinkled . I wear these for work with a button down shirt and tie . While they are probably designed as work pants , they do very well for a contemporary dressy look . I 'm on the heavy side and find these are very roomy . The tailor actually charged me extra for these pants , she said that the seams were triple sewn ( or something like that ) .I 've had these for around 6 months and they 've held up very well . I send them to the dry-cleaner and so far minimal fading .	1
kinda long for the size I ordered could be the bottom was a bit baggy on me and made the pants hang low . But other then the legs being too long for that reason there great pants . I wear a 50 32 must be the ass end was to baggy	1
Carhartt pants are always very good , these pants are very heavy duty , do n't see them wearing through any time soon .	1
Size runs true , great fit , durable fabric , I have several pairs-will last a very long time ! Pretty decent deal , would cost you at least $ 10 more in a local store .	1
We purchases the product because they were 100 % cotton . My husband likes the way they fit and how they wash . They are heavy so there will be a concern wearing them in the summer .	1
On the one hand you get triple sewn seams but on the other hand , the duck cloth is pretty standard and not thick enough for daily hard wear and tear . A typical blue jean fabric is thicker than what you get here . I love these pants for general use but for construction work ? I would give them 6 months max .	1
They are a high quality product . I have older ones and knew what to expect and they did n't disappoint . Very comfortable	1
This is a top end product and worth the money . They arrived on time and were neatly packed . The sizing was accurate along with the color . Good seller , good product .	1
These pants are awesome but they run small and that 's why I rated them with 4 stars instead of 5 . If you are a big guy ( I 'm 6'4 275lbs ) that likes to have room YOU MUST ORDER 2 SIZES BIGGER ! ! Trust me , save time by doing so but in the other hand if you are skinny w/ no behind then order your regular size or maybe 1 size bigger just to be comfortable . Overall I 'm very happy with my pants after 2 returns .	1
the fabric is a little dry and not super soft . But it 's stylish and comfortable . No complaints . A nice shirt that comes in perfect plus/tall sizes .	1
A great shirt , cut for a full size man , wished they made bigger ( when I was bigger ) glad I fit in this , in fact it is a little big , or am I a little small , hope it 's the latter	1
If you order..make sure you order your exact size . It fits perfectly . Mediums some times run small . But it was a true medium . Great quality .	1
This is a nice looking shirt I got for my husband ! He says its comfy and he 's tall and regular size fit perfect ! !	1
No BS long sleeve . Fits like it should . Soft and great color . 6'3 & # 34 ; , 175 and I love the way it hangs .	1
Carhartt makes products that last , this is durable , materials and workmanship went into the product . It is excellent for work .	1
It 's like the old saying `` if you buy cheap , you buy twice '' Carhart is quality no other way to put it . Just last night I ordered 2 more pairs of work pants and I know I will not be disappointed . I have this same shirt purchased 7 years ago and even though they show some wear are still doing the job each time I put them on .	1
I love these shirts . Carhartts run about a 1/2 size larger than most shirts . Well built and comfortable . I love the three button collar , because I dont feel like I 'm being chocked . They also look great for work or play . I plan on buying more .	1
Nicely made and looks very durable ... ... I am happy with all the Carhartt purchases I have made ... .the prices are really not that out of line considering the quality .	1
I like this shirt a lot . Fits great , made well . Good quality and is wearing nicely . I 'll update in some months to share how it 's holding up , but so far I love it.Carhartt ! If you have any in my size laying around , feel free to send them on ! I love this shirt .	1
Comfortably light weight , yet warm enough for chilly days . The pocket allows for note cards and a pen . I use it when driving a student van . Easily layered with a T-shirt or a vest .	1
I love my Carhartt 's shirts ! These long sleeve T 's are made of a durable material the is still soft and comfortable . I wear Carhartt 's T 's every day , whether long sleeve of short , they are great-fitting , high quality and long-lasting !	1
Well made , nice material -- more like a sweater . Got the & # 34 ; tall & # 34 ; so would n't pull out of pants if tucked in . Has a chest pocket because every shirt should have one for sunglasses etc . Arm length is great due to & # 34 ; tall & # 34 ; designation w/ribbed cuffs . Nice !	1
I really enjoy the long sleeve pocket tee . The XLT size has a long enough tail that I do n't worry about it coming out of my pants and it 's heavy enough to act as a lower layer over my flannel on colder days . I also think it will work well for a summer shirt to protect my arms from overexposure .	1
Do n't let the & # 34 ; Somewhat Large & # 34 ; fit bother you ... I have not washed it yet , so I 'm certain there will be a little shrinkage after that . What I love is that although this is not a & # 34 ; Tall & # 34 ; , the sleeves are a perfect length for my 38 & # 34 ; arms . Besides ... I 'm found that if I buy my clothes a little bit bigger than I need them to be ... people are always complimenting me on my weight loss LOL !	1
My husband loves these shirts . They fit great and are very good quality . It is about the only brand I buy for him any more .	1
Ca n't beat a Carhartt shirt ! They fit well , wear well and last a long time . Do n't hesitate , buy some now !	1
Not my first Carhartt Work shirt , but first Henley with 3 button front . You can find work shirts for less , but this is a much better shirt , strong fabric double stitched - spend a few more $ and get the real deal with a Carhartt.Size ; I 'm just under 6 ' tall , 170 lbs 34 & # 34 ; waist and sleeve length - athletic build ; usually wear a large but a Medium Regular fits me best . I wear a basic cotton T-shirt under these.If you have a beer belly or chest measures larger than a 42 & # 34 ; regular suit a Large will probably be a better fit , also if you are going to wear over thermal shirt or sweater underneath go with the Large.I 'm Carhartt brand loyal , I try to buy on sale , Henley was just over $ 20 so not much discount but Carhartt sells out - here on Amazon and in western wear stores - even if you pay full price you wo n't regret it . If the shirt fits buy it in every color !	1
Thanks to the many other reviewers I ordered 1 SIZE SMALLER and it fits well . Well made of THICK 100 % cotton.The material feels SCRATCHY until it 's been washed many times even then it 's a bit rough . If this is an outer shirt , no problem .	1
Okay , I am 6'2 210 lbs and when I bought my last shirt like this a decade ago I purchased it at a local army / navy surplus store . It has lasted great and is getting thread bare : ) . I read the reviews before buying this one , I normally get XL in every shirt I buy but went with the Large after reading the reviews . I also will buy Longs when available but also opted out of that decision . This shirt fits perfect in the shoulders , the sleeves are plently long and so is the length . If it helps or matters mine was made in Honduras , I would have given this product a 5 star rating but is does not seem to be made with the same weighted material as my original that was made in the USA so long ago . Hope this helps ya all ... ...	1
This is a very nice shirt . I have reordered it in the XL and will return this one because it is made much larger than the typical 2XL I buy .	1
I bought this a gift . and it is just what I thought it would be . I love it . it is just right	1
We are always pleased with the quality workmanship of carhartt clothing . I know that we will receive the same consistent quality product . I purchased these recently for my husband to take on a Outland hunting trip to South Dakota , he was warm and comfortable .	1
this shirt runs larger than its size states which when working hard makes this a very comfortable shirt to wear	1
The work shirt is made well , it 's durable and it washes well . It was very true to size , and fit him well .	1
My husband loves these shirts . Short sleeved in warm weather and the long sleeved ones in the winter . Threy wear well and are very comfortable	1
liked the fir and look	1
He 's not a tiny guy so this was perfect ! Very heavy and is wearing well . Would definitely buy more in other colors .	1
My husband is very satisfied with this shirt . He already had some he loved , they are warm and comfortable , wash really nicely and he wears them on weekends .	1
Hubby wears these for cool fall days and for layering in the winter . He loves them and has one in every color.After washing and drying , the size medium is 22 & # 34 ; across the chest , measured from armpit to armpit . They do fade a little but not too bad , just something to be aware of .	1
its a night gown , for me , if my husbands not wearing it . does n't shrink , easy in /out of laundry , can iron and its a dressy casdual shirt	1
I work on a farm and this is a great shirt to wear under my other clothes , in layers . The shirt is long so it tucks in great . Keeps me very warm .	1
Made to Carharttstandards , very comfortable.Product is made well and expect it to last . Highly recommend product to others . Great	1
My husband really liked the shirt but was disappointed that it was too big . He wears an XL and is just too big for him . The blue is not as bright as it is in the picture .	1
Fits good , feels good , looks good . What more can I say , except to fill up words required on this review . Oh , yeah , sorry I did not buy two .	1
These socks are lightweight , yet very cushiony . They make my feet feel great inside my hiking boots . I think they 're especially good for older feet that are getting more sensitive in the heel area .	1
These socks are absolutely amazing , and I can not believe how much better my feet feel after long walks or workouts with wearing them . They make all of the difference in the world.I learned about the Cool Max sox from reading Leslie Sansone 's book , and decided I should use all of the research that the US Army put into finding which socks held up well for soldiers in the field . These are for walking workouts , and have excellent cushioning just where you need it , plus they wick away moisture.Your feet will love you for getting these !	1
These are the best fitting and most comfortable socks that I have ever worn . They cushion the feet where needed and do not shift or fall down . They launder very well . Well worth the price . I still have some socks from this company that are almost 20 years old !	1
Have had a pair of these for 5 years , great for summer /office wear.I love thorlo , love smart wool , love great socks , work on my feet all day.BUT WATCH THE SIZING , 9 IS A 6 ! ! ! ! ordered two pairs , now on my sisters feet ! ! ! GET THE SIZING CHART.ADORE THESE SOCKS ! ! ! !	1
I tried buying tee shirts from the big makers , and they all arrived with thin fabric , even the ones that said thick fabric . Carhartt , on the other hand , makes tee shirts like they did 40 years ago , with nice thick fabric that you know will last for years . It 's a relief to get a product that is made of really good material . Highly recommended .	1
Nice shirt , as expected . Thicker than most t-shirts . I probably could have used a large but it may shrink a bit . I think it does run a little on the big side . Other than that great shirt .	1
Nothing much to add to other positive reviews . These are good quality T-shirts of nice thick cotton knit . I usually buy oversize to allow for shrinkage of cotton knit fabric but it is not necessary with these shirts . They come oversize . It 's best to wash them before wearing since they will fit huge until they shrink down in length and girth . It 's also recommended that you wash the darker colors separately -- at least at first . I hand washed all the T-shirts I ordered before wearing and the Port colored one turned the water in the sink red . Be careful until the excess color has washed out . I have noted overall fading with the older black Carhartt T-shirt I have . This is after several months of wear and washing.I 've bought several of these shirts in various colors . They are head and shoulders better than the cheap T-shirts you can find at Target or Walmart although they are more expensive . They are comfortable for work wear and look nice under an unbuttoned sport shirt for casual get-togethers . I really like them , except for the fading issue I 've noted with the darker colors .	1
A T-shirt may be `` only a T-shirt '' to some , but when you want a roomy shirt with generous proportions and substantial materials -- the all-cotton shirt is a bit heftier than run-of-the-mill T 's -- this Carhartt shirt does the job . The armholes allow easy motion , and the body of the tall-sized shirt is longer than the norm of tall sizes from other manufacturers . Both features ensure all-day comfort for the active wearer . This holds for work and play duties alike . The only quibble : There 's a small , cheesy ( cheap-looking ) manufacturer label on the front of the breast pocket . There are a lot of other ways and places to put a brand 's name on a garment .	1
I ordered a few of these shirts for my husband . I ordered a large based off his other pocket tees by other brands ( Hanes , etc ) but it was too big . There was a 3 inch difference in width and about the same in length . Once I exchanged them for a Medium we were both very happy with the quality !	1
It fits good , a little large which is what I wanted . A little inferior quality compared to shirts I bought about 4 years ago .	1
My husband loves these Carhartt work shirts . They are long and hold up to the wear and tear . We bought these in 3 different colors . Definitely would recommend !	1
This is a great tee for the money , fabric is heavy and the shirt is well constructed . For me the shirt is a bit long , sizing seemed a bit smaller than I would prefer .	1
Very nice and well made shirts ! I bought several for my husband and he loves them ! They wash nice and do n't fade fast !	1
These shirts do run big . I ordered an XL at first and it is WAY big on me , so I ordered a few more in a Large and they are great .	1
My bf loves carhartt and t-shirts with pockets in the front so he loved this shirt we bought the bluestone color which he loves he will probably come back and buy a couple more of this same shirt in different colors I really liked the olive color also but he didnt buy it	1
There are the heaviest and best work and all around pocket t shirts . I like I can get tall sizes that never show a plumbers crack and tuck in well keeping in warmth . The long sleeves ones are great to layer in winter . The material is almost as heavy as tent canvas but soft as it is cotton . They are generous to size but do order your regular one because air pockets are good insulators as well as aid in wicking moisture and drying . They shrink a tad . Carhartt 's are absolutely the best but you do have to pay up for them . They are worth it . If a thinner material will do I will try other quality brands like Key 's or St Johns Bay if their on sale but truth be told the Carhartt 's are best . They stain less and the same goes for other wear and tear . I have found it is better to not use bleach when washing these .Good luck	1
I love Carhartt T-shirts . They are oversized , usually with a longer tail to prevent `` Plumbers Crack '' for a man with a heavy belt on . They are very thick cotton , and will keep you warm in the cold , and reasonably protected from sparks . Just a good quality , sturdy shirt that will last a long time . I own many of them .	1
These are a very well made T , There pre-shrunk so do n't plan on any shrinkage with these T 's , If your a XL consider a LG they 'll fit fine , unless you like the neck opening to be a little large , well made T though .	1
Very good quality.These fit very well , a size large does n't shrink to a size medimum afer washing . Heavyweight and comfortable .	1
well built of heavy fabric and a nice product anything with carhartt on it can be trusted to last a	1
My Husband loves these I by a tall so they do not pull out of pants and he loves the pocket . They are a thicker materiel and last a long time .	1
Simple and perfect . Carhartt is the best . The color is very nice as well . The tall shirts are really tall . Perfect fit	1
I bought this shirt for my Husband . It 's a good quality shirt . It 's NOT a flimsy tee shirt . He likes it too .	1
This T-Shirt is well made and it looks good . The price was very nice at the time of purchase . Definitely 4 Stars !	1
This t shirt is roomy . Itis a heavier material than most t shirts that I have found lately . My husband likes it and that is all that counts .	1
When Dockers discontinued my favorite pocketed T 's five years ago , I started my quest for replacements . I 've been disappointed until two weeks ago when I came back to Carhartt Men 's Workwear Pocket T-Shirts . For starters , I bought one Large and one XL.I 'm 6'2 '' and 200 pounds . While the XL hides my recently acquired larger waist , it 's also so large that it could accommodate shoulder pads . Further , the length covers a good part of my pockets in my jeans or shorts . The Large is close to a perfect fit , and just a little big in the shoulders.THEY DID NOT SHRINK when just thrown into the washer and dryer , and came out remarkably almost wrinkle free.I do n't know why it 's called `` workwear . '' It 's very comfortable , a little heavier than the better pocket T 's , and will be my daily wear when I hike , am on a photo shoot , `` working '' around the house , or just lazing around . I 'd consider it `` casual wear . `` I just bought 6 more , all in Large.ew	1
Just out of the pkg . it is slightly large , which is a good sign . Once it goes in the dryer , it will fit perfectly . Dry on medium temp . only to avoid further shrinkage . It is a looser fit , so for the guys working outside , it is not uncomfortable or clingy and wo n't make you look like a sausage . It is 100 percent cotton , and is plenty long enough for our guys who need to do a lot of bending while working . Even while bending , this t-shirt delivers and covers what it needs to cover in the backside area . I wish there were more color choices in the 3XT other than the tan and green . Both are great colors though . This is a medium-weight or even a little better quality than medium-weight t-shirt . Not a heavy-weight t-shirt , which can be too hot in the summer while working outside . You wo n't be disappointed with the quality . And the price point ( $ 13+ ) was very good for a brand-name product . Very nice t-shirt .	1
Heavier than regular T shirts , they wear well . Nice for cooler temps . I do n't see any other companies making a shirt like this.UPDATE-Compared to shirts I bought last year , the fabric Carthartt uses is lighter weight . Not a lot , but noticeable . I 've been noticing this with other Carthartt products ( Jeans and Lined Shirts ) . I know that you have to compete , but making a less durable/lower quality product is going to drive longtime customers away .	1
These shirts seem to be of excellent quality if you like heavy T-shirts . I deducted one star only because they are extremely long for a T-shirt . I will have to tuck it in or it will hang down almost to my knees . Someone that is tall wo n't have this problem but i am short .	1
As usual , Carhardt made a good shirt . Seems are well made and the fabric is thicker than most other brands of this class .	1
These run big but nice to have shirts that do n't keep shrinking . Wash dozens of times and they keep their shape and color . Very good quality . The navy blue is a true navy blue . The tall is a nice length to keep in pants .	1
These are the best T-shirts I have ever owned ! They are made a heavy cotton fabric that is comfortable and absorbent . High quality fabric and stitching , and generously sized .	1
These shirts appear to be a good quality and were delivered in a short time . I needed the largest they had for my son and these appear to fit the bill .	1
Shirt is OK. Not like the old heavy cotton ones , though . Carhartt used to mean quality ; now it means 'China ' .	1
First , the shirts fit well . They are very durable . What I do n't get is the neck-hole can vary a lot . I own about 10 of these shirts and 3 of them have really large neck-holes . When I receive them , I try them on then wash them . All 3 of those shirts had really big neck holes .	1
I have been a fan of carhartt pocket t-shirts forever , long sleeve and short . They are extremely durable and can weather the grind I put them through in exttreme temperatures here in Phoenix , Az . what is really special is the relaxed fit they have when you order your size , Comfortablity is a big factor for me and these allow a comforable fit without armpit tightness . So do n't hesitate and buy these , you wo n't regret it .	1
You just ca n't go wrong with Carhartt ... well , at least I ca n't . The fit , durability , and appearance has me hooked . And the & # 34 ; chicks & # 34 ; seem to appreciate the way it makes a man look like he knows what he 's doing ! Seriously though ... these are great Tee Shirts that you should be very pleased with .	1
I have a muscular XL frame and this brand shirt is my favorite due to loose , comfortable fit , fron pocket , thick yet cool cotton manufacture . Its a great casual shirt , about as classy as a t shirt can get .	1
These work shorts are high quality and very durable . The pocket is a huge help , too . I would definitely recommend these work shorts .	1
Nice quality , thick and durable , and nice colors . I wear a 42 and the large is perfection . Ca n't beat Carhartt quality .	1
great thick cotton t-shirt seems like it will stand up to a lot more abuse than a standard t-shirt . It seems like it might have been just a tad large out of the package but i 'm guessing it 'll shrink a little after the wash . Either way i love this t-shirt and will be asking for more in different colors	1
My husband prefers these shirts to any others in his closet . They are very durable and long lasting , regardless of how many times they are washed .	1
If your guy is tough on clothes ... You know , he has one token clean shirt on a marginally clean pair of jean without caulk , grease , etc all over them for & # 34 ; date nite & # 34 ; then these shirts are for those guys.Fit great ! Look great when they are clean . Can withstand lots of abuse . Last time I bought a cathartic shirt for hubby was a good 5 years ago . He has about 6-8 tees that all look something that are not even fit for the rag bag , that he wears regularly . Those shirts are thread bare with various rips . The carhart still has good material density after 5 years but the neck and shirt tail are definitely worn . It seems stains come out a little easier too ... That 's not right , the stains do n't set as fast on a carhart tee as they do like on a hanes . Do n't know if it the tighter fabric weave or special finish.We love them .	1
My husband initially asked for XL . We returned them because they were way too long . The large fits nicely , but is still longer than a regular large t-shirt , which is good . We reordered in the smaller size . He loves them and the brand is notoriously sturdy .	1
I like the colors , heavy cotton , and the years of wear I get out of these T-Shirts . Price has been always just right . I do recommend these T-Shirts to any person for working , resting at home with a pair of sweats , or just dressing down with your favorite jeans .	1
These shirts are great for the tall/bigger guy . My son is 6 4 and about 250 and these work great but they do run a bit large so an XXL somewhere else is an XL here	1
Love CarharttOrdered 2 for my husband hand he loves them.He has been wearing this brand for years.No shrinkageGreat quality , washes well .	1
Carhartt quality through and through . No need to look any farther for a quality tee . Great selection of colors as well .	1
These shirts are real nice , quality shirts . I had read they come too large and to order a smaller size , my husband wears a Large normally , so I ordered medium . They fit him , but after a few washings I think they might shrink a bit . I will order more though , in a Large .	1
they are great work shirts for the winter and cold months/mornings , but for warm/hot days , they keep you too warm and do n't let out alot of heat . they do take on alot of water though and even when it is raining out , you do n't get really cold , they also dry fast .	1
It 's a good t shirt . I almost feel like I should wear only carhartt because their stuff is comfortable , fits well , and lasts longer .	1
I love the Carhartt pocket tshirts . They are durable and look great even after numerous washes . They keep their shape , do n't wrinkle up or shrink .	1
perfect fit , good quality , good look , i always buy carhartt without problem . totally recommendedvery comfortable , good for indoor and outdoor	1
Great fit , the length is especially appreciated . Sturdy fabric which should hold up well . I just ordered three more and expect the same dependable quality .	1
Wears like iron . Fits good . Feels good . What else do you need to know ? It 's Carhartt . That 's all you need to know .	1
I really like the fell and comfort	1
All the carhartt T-shirts I 've bought have fit well and held up better then any other shirt I have ever bought . I buy them because I 'm cheap . They wear like iron , hold there shape , the pockets are in the right position , ( unlike other well known brands ) . I wear these or the long sleeve Carhartt t-shirts , every day . I have n't found anything better for less money that holds up as long as these shirts do . I buy the ones that are discounted the most , so colors might not be the fancy pants style most would want to have in there work wardrobe . I also need a pocket for pens and markers and stuff . Lotta shirts do n't do that anymore . If they sold these ( at the right price ) and only in stripes or polka dots , even pink ! I 'd still be wearing them . They are that well made and COMFORTABLE to be in .	1
Above average quality , for sure . Nice shirt , in spite of the unnecessary label on the pocket . Size runs about right on the medium I bought .	1
great t shirt quality is great material is soft and very confortable does n't shrink after so many washing holds it shape perfect every time	1
Purchased this for my boyfriend 's birthday ; usually he complains that t-shirts are too short , yet this one in tall is too long ! Next time I will purchase a large . Overall , he loves the shirt and we will be purchasing more in different colors for himself and other men in our family !	1
came in nicely packaged . correct color and size..and it fit accordingly . nice pocket and label . should wear and no color fade	1
I have 4 of these t-shirts , 2 henleys and 1 lightweight t-shirt . Love them all . They look great , wear well and are as comfortable as any shirt you will own . The quality of the shirt is much higher than the 4-7 dollar t-shirts you will get at Wally World ... .these cost more but will last for years even with regular use and washing. -- Beware of sizing , as many have already said , they run bigger ... .I wear an XL in EVERY other shirt I have but for these I wear a large . I am 6 ft tall , 225 lbs with broad shoulders and a 46 inch chest.Overall I LOVE these shirts !	1
These fit very well ... ..no slim fit / skinny jeans type BS . They are thick and well made . I love 'em .	1
I buy a lot of black pocket tee shirts because I travel a lot and I can always count on them . For casual wear or under a sport coat with a pocket square ... .you will always pass . When you drip your latte down the front ... a simple rinse gets it out and you are good to go for dinner . I like these a lot .	1
Some of the nicest T 's for the money . Period . These are becoming my standard for everyday wear . They hold their shape . They are tough . They clean up well . In addition , where I live you are judged by clothes or car and not character . I feel much better with the Carhart logo than the little Polo horsey one.Robs ratingGet three of them at least !	1
Perfect fit , does n't shrink much . Fabric a little too heavy for really hot days , but overall still a great t-shirt .	1
Had purchased the long sleeve T 's for Christmas gifts and the recipients liked them very much . These will be for warmer weather gifts for the same men .	1
I love the tee , but as another reviewer said , order a size smaller ... .actually I ordered a size bigger because it was a 100 per cent cotton and I was sure it would shrink , but it did n't that much ! It 's a bargain for the price , so I 'm going to order another one .	1
The material is really thick and nice , but i ordered a 2x and it looks like it could be a 3x or 4x . I would just order a size smaller .	1
My husbands favorite tee shirt . The pocket is large enough to be useful . The shirt launders well and holds its color through many washes . It comes out of the dryer wrinkke free .	1
THESE SHIRTS FIT WELL AND WEAR WELL . COLORS HOLD UP AND ARE VIRTUALLY WRINKLE-FREE FROM THE DRYER . AND ... THEY ARE LONG ENOUGH TO TUCK IN IF YOU WANT AND LONG ENUF TO KEEP YOU COVERED IF YOU DO N'T	1
I wear carhart because of the durability and long life I can get from them . I 'm an iron worker and spend all day welding , cutting , and grinding ; I can go through clothes fast .	1
My husband only wears Crahartt T-shirts because they are thicker and wear nice and neat right out of the dryer . They do n't get holes in them as fast .	1
I ordered a large ... it fits ! The material is comfortable ... waiting to see if it 's as durable as my other Carhartt t-shirts . Some of my other t-shirts are extra large and they fit just as wells as this large shirt ... ... .I have plenty of carhart shirts and t-shirts ... .sizing continues to be hit or miss .	1
I purchased this shirt for my husband to use as work shirts . The feel good , made of good material , and I think it is going to be a great work shirt for him .	1
well made	1
He likes this T shirt , it goes very well with his cargo mens shorts , The color shirt was hard to find until we found it here , Thanks..Thelma	1
The neck is a little tight on my husband ( football player ) , but otherwise it fits - he likes it and wanted me to order more . The material seems to wick the moisture out after a workout , and does not stick to your skin .	1
The shirts were made of good quality nice heavy cotton was very happy with them you ca n't beat for the money they will last you a long time	1
these are the only shirts I wear . they hold up like iron and feel nice . great price here too . they do not shrink too much at all which helps choosing the correct size .	1
I got this and several others for my husband to wear to work . All are made of a heavy fabric that washes up great . They do shrink a bit from first wash .	1
I JUST ORDERED 5 OF THESE FOR WORK AND THEYRE REALLY NICE ... ONE NOTE..GET THE NEXT SIZE SMALLER ! ! ! ! IM A BIG GUY AND NORMALLY WEAR A 2X FOR COMFORT AND FREEDOM , BUT A XL IS THE PERFECT SIZE FOR ME.I BOUGHT 1 XL AND 1 2XL BEFORE DECIDING WHAT SIZE TO GET AND THE 2XL WAS WAYYYY BIG.THE XL IS PERFECT AND ITS LONG SO YOU WONT GET THAT `` PLUMBERS CRACK '' WHEN WORKING.ACCORDING TO A TON OF REVIEWS THESE WONT SHRINK EITHER SO IT LOOKS LIKE I HAVE WORK SHIRTS FOR A LONG TIME ... ALTHOUGH I WISH THESE WERE MADE IN U.S.A , THEYRE MADE IN HONDURAS WHICH IS BETTER THAN CHINA ANYDAY****UPDATE 3/23/13**** AFTER OWNING THESE SHIRTS FOR 2 WEEKS I DEFINATELY LOVE THEM , BUT MY ADVICE TO GET A SMALLER SIZE WAS A BIT TOO EARLY..I WASHED THESE AND DRIED THEM IN THE DRYER AND THEY DEFINATELY SHRUNK.OTHER REVIEWS CLAIMED THEY `` WOULD NOT SHRINK '' , BUT MINE ALL HAVE..THE 2 XL THAT WAS WAYYY TOO BIG BEFORE IS NOW THE PERFECT SIZE AND THE XL STILL FIT , BUT ARENT AS ROOMY ... I APPOLOGISE TO ANYONE WHO BOUGHT THESE BASED ON MY REVIEW , BUT THEYRE STILL GREAT SHIRTS	1
Very heavy duty material . Quite long and actually is a little too big . Next time I will get a 3x .	1
This is a nice HEAVY all cotton tshirt . They run a bit large so beware . I previously ordered XL and they were more like 2xl . No biggie I gave them to my large friend . It 's imported but the quality of workmanship seems good .	1
The shirt is made from a thick cotton like the rest of Carhartt 's line of products . I noticed that unlike some of my other shirts though that this particular shirt is a little oversized . It 's a bit more designed for big and tall wearers , which maybe some will look for when they buy this shirt .	1
I wear these sock with my running shoes in the winter . Running shoes are n't very warm so adding a wool sock makes them wearable in winter . They 're nice and springy but not too bulky so they fit nicely with my shoes .	1
I normally would n't pay $ 15 or more for a pair of socks and I did n't in this case . These were on sale for around $ 10 a pair , and I bought three pair in gray and they have been well worth it.These socks offer superior cushioning in the areas that most typically take the greatest abuse . They do n't slip or shift as you wear them and they prevent chaffing and rubbing . The keep my feet warm and dry as they have superior wicking quality . I go for long walks in the woods near my house and my feet feel good afterward which I can only attribute to my hiking boots and these socks . I even poke around the house in these socks because they are comfortable and provide decent traction on hard wood floorsFor what it 's worth , I 've been wearing these for quite awhile now and they seem to be wearing better than my other socks . No piling or signs of thinning in spots such as the heels which usually go first . They wash up nicely and while not specifically listed as antimicrobial , these keep my feet dry and fresh smelling .	1
I 've worn ThorLos for years . They are my favorite sock for hiking , walking , working out or just wearing at home with fitness shoes . The elastic on top grips the instep and the arch . The ball of the foot and the heel are padded , the toe is sturdy . I 've actually never had a pair wear into holes . I love these .	1
I buy a bunch at a time , they last a year of hard wear . it helps not to throw them in the dryer .	1
I do n't know wear to begin . Thorlo socks fit great , are warm and provide support . They last forever probably because they are Made in the USA ! I 've never owned better socks and I own all the different weights these come in . By the way , I do n't hike much anymore but go out of my way to buy these for work around the house and ranch . Even been known to wear them to bed on colder night !	1
I was very pleased when I received the socks . The fit perfectly ( I am size 9 ) and feel so good . The quality is excellent . Ca n't wait to take them for a hike .	1
So far so good . Got this jacket for my bf for xmas , it fits well , he says it 's comfy & warm & I believe it 's durable enough to hold up to him in everyday use so ... SCORE !	1
4 stars because it is a nice , comfortable jacket . I removed 1 star because I do not feel that the price reflects the quality of the jacket .	1
I got the Sandstone Active Jacket in & # 34 ; mushroom & # 34 ; color , which is exactly as shown in the picture -- it 's a tan color but more brown than beige . This jacket - above all - was a great value . I 'm not sure if I got an off season discount or what , but when I saw it I jumped on it . The jacket itself is great . I have owned three of these in my lifetime and they 're pretty hard to destroy . Mine just got to looking kind of ratty after many years , and need replacement . The quilted flannel lining is warm enough for sub-freezing temps with layers underneath . This is the original work wear jacket . I have seen a bunch of knock offs , but Carhartt is still the king . It 's not about the label , it 's about the quality .	1
Jacket is a little stiff but I 'm sure it will ease up in time , really like the fit . I wear a large and I 'm 5'10 and 180 # and I could n't ask for a better fit .	1
im 6'1 250ish and ordered a reg XL and it fits great with room to wear a hoodie under if needed	1
We got this to replace an older coat that he accidently left out of town during a trip . Quality is still great and fit is as described by others . Great coat that holds up well over the years . It washes up great and is warm but not too bulky .	1
Just what I wanted . Everything you expect from a Carhartt . I am a small lady , ( 5'5 120 ) but I wanted the sleeves to be long enough so I got the men 's small , and they are . I also like the longer fit over my hips a little , so you can do work without the jacket ending up above you waist all the time . The ladies have shorter sleeves and ride up on me .	1
Yes this jacket is quality and you know it ! I bought for my nephew almost a year ago , he loves it while at work on the ski slopes . He says he is warm and sometimes if he is real busy start sweating cause it keeps him so warm .	1
I was originally looking at the Sandstone Sierra Jacket but after trying on the Sandstone Active Jacket at a local store , I realized that the active jacket is more suited to getting in and out of a car ... less `` jacket '' in the arms and waist . Both are very comfortable and warm . The hood serves as a scarf and as a hat when I get caught in the rain , sleet or snow . I am 6'1 '' and approx 200lbs , the large fits me well , comfortable with some room for layering when needed . Frontier brown is a good shade - not brassy but not flat . I really like this jacket .	1
I think i found my new favorite jacket.Im always looking for Carhartt jackets or coats and i had the J140 which is basically the same but the outer shell is not as soft.This model is sandstone and is much softer and has a weathered look.The liner is quilted which is much thicker than blanket or thermal lined types.Quilt ( and Sherpa ) liners are much more comfortable when wearing short sleeve shirts.Its not as heavy as my other coats and yet keeps me nice and toasty even if its 30 deg outside.I can even wear this in colder climate if i layer it with a long sleeve thermal shirt which i prefer than a big bulky jacket.In my experience Carhartt will last you a long time even if you abuse it and this one is no exception.I have a barn coat that i use at work for 11 years and still going strong.You pay a little bit more for this jacket but if it last you a lifetime so what.EditWent up to the mountains today ... snow,30 deg . and 50 mph gust.It was cold as hell but this jacket blocked the wind and kept me warm.All i had was a long sleeve t shirt underneath and i was comfortable.Definitely recommended to anybody looking for a warm jacket that is not too bulky.I really want another one with a different color coz i liked it so much.Just be aware that Carhartt makes another jacket exactly like this but its not sandstone.Its just as good but this kind is a much softer outer shell .	1
This is your basic Men 's hooded Carhartt , so if thats what your looking for then this is it . However , I had originally purchased it for myself , but it 's just too big for a lady . The color sandstone brown , is really just a dark brown . Not much if any & # 34 ; sandstone & # 34 ; or washed out effects on it .	1
I bought a bigger size because I have really long arms , and it fits great and super warm ! ! The green color is perfect not too dark not too light .	1
Love this jacket . Looks and fits great . Only thing is that when working the sleeves seem to pull a little short . Not working they look and fit fine . maybe I need to get use to the elastic cuffs . Overall it 's great . Thought of returning and getting a & # 34 ; long & # 34 ; size instead of regular because of the sleeves but the price was more and did n't want the rest of the jacket to look and fit too long .	1
I 'm so glad I read the reviews about going with a size that is SEVERAL sizes larger then you normally wear . My husband normally wears a 32/34 and I got this in a 38 . They are just right . There is no way a 32 would have fit . Also , these were approx $ 40 cheaper then at my local farm store .	1
Ca n't go wrong with Carhartt 's ! My husband works outside and these keep him warm . he goes through a pair every two years . We tried them on in a store to make sure we knew what size to get to go over his regular work clothes . We do not wash them daily . They last longer that way . Pay attention to the little things , there are 2 styles in these . The pockets are different !	1
I ordered a 40x32 . I should 've ordered a 40x30 , but that was my error . Subzero temps are comfortable with these on . I wear a pair of jeans under them . I 'm 5'10 '' and weigh 170 lbs . I washed them twice and the length did shrink about an inch but I have to wear boots with them or they will drag onto the ground at the bottom/back of the legs . These are well worth the price . Being my first Bibs , I expect to buy a new one yearly , but in a size 40x30.Update : Now that spring is here , these bibs are great and worked perfectly ! They are must have in Colorado . When washing them , follow the instructions ! I recommend going to your local Carhartt store ( Sears ? ) and trying a pair on to get your sizing perfect . Even if they do n't have the lined bibs , they will have the unlined and it 's so important you get the length of your bibs right or you will ruin them as they rub on the ground.Next Fall I will buy the unlined version in a different color and may get a size of 38x28 . The reasoning for the 38 instead of the 40 is that the lined pair are thick and at times with jeans on underneath , it did get toasty.I 've been to my local Sears and have tried on the unlined version which are $ 30 cheaper , but I could see that as long as I had jeans on underneath and maybe thermals under the jeans , the unlined will be just as comfortable . Obviously you want to buy them on Amazon ! The length in the next pair will definitely be a 30 '' length ( instead of the 32 I bought ) or maybe even a 28 '' length , because they adjust in length at the suspenders.So UNDERSTAND this fact : When they say they are a 30 '' in length , keep in mind that 's the shortest length they adjust to . So my 32 '' in length bibs I bought are 32 '' at the shortest length possible and they will actually adjust ( at the suspenders ) 3-4 '' longer than the length stated ! ! ! !	1
I have these for occasional electrical work with my brother-in-law and for general use during the winter . I have used it several times now in cold weather and kneeling in the snow . So far they have been exceptional ! They are very warm when wearing a pair of pants under these and then a coat with it as well . I have not felt the cold on my legs or core when wearing these bibs so far . They fit very comfortably . Other users have mentioned how to determine the sizing so I will not go into great detail over that , but I normally wear a 32 & # 34 ; waist and got a 34 & # 34 ; in waist for the bibs and they fit well/almost snug when wearing a normal pair of pants under them . Also I have the 32 & # 34 ; length as that is my normal length in pants and they fit just fine without dragging on the ground at all . Overall they are warm ( as I have used with a windchill in the single digits already ) , they are comfortable & flexible while still being very sturdy and should be very durable for years to come ! Great purchase for outside winter workers and those of us who want a good warm pair of bibs that we may never have to replace !	1
The item was in great condition , as described . It fits great ( I ordered two sizes larger than my actual pant size , fyi ) , and it appears rugged as they come . Definitely looking forward to using these for the years to come .	1
thought I bought too large . but they are perfect . phew . they are what they say they are no worries about your purchase .	1
Bought these for my son . He absolutely loves them . They keep him warm at his job working in a warehouse .	1
My husband goes through a couple pairs of these every year . We keep an eye out for a good price and I ca n't believe I did n't check Amazon sooner ! What can you say about Carhartt bibs ? They are great , extremely durable ( my husband is unbelieveably tough on his work gear . ) We will most definitely be looking to Amazon for our future Carhartt purchases .	1
Make sure you order about 10 sizes larger than what you need . These are meant to be warn over other layers of clothing so you need to take in account for that . I wear a size 36 waist so I got a 46 and it fits great over jeans with thermals underneath . Fits great also over just jeans . Like all Carhartt products its warm and durable . I highly recommend it for anyone working out in cold conditions . It keeps you warm in sub zero windy conditions	1
3/23/11 We 've been having enough snow here in South New Jersey these last several years that we are getting out our snow blowers and doing our share of shoveling . Having said that , what we get here is nothing compared to other areas on the USA , but for here , a 1/2 '' shuts the schools down . We 've had a number of snows producing several feet and on our 360 ' driveway thats allot of shoveling . I got the Carhartt Men 's Quilt Lined Duck Bib Overall for my fiance and they were fabulous . While running the snow blower he was comfortable , warm and not soaking wet . Actually , he had to take his jacket off . He wore them over jeans , but they were warm enough that you really would only need long underwear under them.Although , this is not really the place for this review I will say that I also bought him a pair of Carhartt Men 's Insulated Waterproof Breathable Gloves ASIN : B002VWJWYU which he loved and at Amazon you will see 18 reviews and almost stars.You can not go wrong with Carhartt .	1
These arrived quickly . I ordered them bigger as some of the reviews suggested . My husband said they were too big , had to exchange . The exchange was done very quickly . The smaller pair fit good . I first ordered a 40 x 34 , had to exchange for a 38 x 32 . Husband says they will keep him dry and warm in the Minneasota winter while working .	1
I get so many compliments on a daily basis on these and they are still super comfortable even though they may not be AS comfortable as the originals .	1
This was a second purchase of this product as my mother liked my sneaker so much she asked for this shoe for herself . Comfortable fit and great for walking .	1
Very comfortable.Classic.Good looking.Do n't be jealous , just get your own pair . Seriously , get them . ( Do yourself a favor and buy some shoe cleaner too ... you are buying white shoes , afterall . )	1
Perfect size for my average height , slim built three year old . Bought these to hold up his pants for t-ball games , and it does just that ! Nothing to look at , really , but does the job .	1
Does it 's job as a baseball pants belt . Color was accurate to the description . I have a 34 waiste and this worked perfect .	1
The belt fit my son great . Good quality for a good price . Can be wash ( be white ) but needs to hang dry .	1
We have at least 20 baseball belts in different sizes and colors , from our two sons ' many seasons of baseball . But , we did n't have a black one in an adult size , which our older son needs now that he 's bigger . I ordered this one from Amazon because I did n't have time to drive to Walmart ( which usually does n't have what we need ) or Dick 's ( an hour away ) .The belt is perfect - long enough and adjustable for adult sized waists , wider than youth belts , and made of stretchy elastic . Our son 's baseball team did n't give them belts with the uniform , and his first game is in three days , so I was happy to receive this one so quickly and have `` belt '' checked off my list .	1
Not the best belt but ok for the kids . it was cheap and you get what you pay for . I 'd give it a 3.5 and not a 4 but it is better than a three	1
This is better than the Champion baseball belt . The color is off though . I ordered maroon and it looks brown . The buckle is also smaller than Champion 's . And the overall length is longer . I do n't need it that long . But what 's nice is where the metal sizing clip ends up due to how long it is overall .	1
Great belt . Fits well and is very high quality . I loved the assortment of color choices available and how well the product wears and lasts .	1
I got these for my husband ( A very picky man ) . They are sturdy denim and sized right . When my man tried them on , he liked them so much he did n't take them off . These are a good weight denim , not too light and not too stiff . There is room in the crotch which makes them more comfortable for the men . Well sewn and seem long-lasting .	1
Finally , a pair of jeans with the right length . These jeans are comfortable and not as expensive as some other brands .	1
Delivered quickly . Jean 's are very good quality , although a little tight in the waist . I either have to lose a few pounds or gain a few and buy the 36 's . Definitely worth buying at & # 60 ; $ 30 .	1
The jeans are very comfortable and appear to be very well put together . I think they will last a very long time .	1
These have been my favorite jeans for a long time.They fit great , the advertised size is what it says it is.Fit is perfect for boots.Fit is great in the crotch , where many others sag these do not .	1
Good quality product . The waist is true to size . Fits well . The legs however are quite loose . Loosest relaxed fit I have ever seen . Depends on what you are looking for . Great to work in if you squat or bend your legs . Lots of room . They feel really great . Almost like you are not wearing any pants . Very comfortable . I feel they look a bit funny for like wearing out . I have refered to them as my clown pants.LOL.. However I do like them . I would rather have them too loose opposed to being too tight . If you are looking for a work pant I recomend them .	1
Too often pants today are low-risers - even male pants and/or pants designed for & # 34 ; adults & # 34 ; . I was tired of even my normal Levi 's brand shifting to this style where I feel like either my shirt is coming untucked or I 'm about to get a draft down my butt . Fed up , I ran across of pair of Carhartt jeans . These pants fit exactly like my old style USED TO and looks great . The denim is also soft - unlike my memory of Carhartt jeans from my youth being the pants of choice for outdoor work ( hard and durable and scratchy ) .Very happy with my now two pairs of Carhartts - plan to stay with this brand for now on !	1
Good Fit Jean . Nice color . wears well . Lossing wt . So wont be in to long . But Ill be back . Thanks	1
I have worn Levi 501 jeans for years but were always annoyed by the waist height aspect of the fit , and weakness in certain seams . Ditto on most brands of khakis , the office rat 's jeans . After purchasing a couple pairs of Carhartt 's excellent khakis , I decided to try their jeans . I have never before had a better fit in a pair of jeans , or a more correct sizing of the waist and inseam . They are so comfortable my wife has to steal them away to wash them , so I got more of them . I have several Carhartt products and I can assure you they are made for maximum durabilty , value and comfort for the working man . The relaxed fit version is especially comfortable on horseback because it allows your legs to move without pulling down the waist . Best ever jeans ! ! And the best source I found for price and prompt delivery was Amazon . If they say they have it , you get it quick and well packed .	1
These jeans are the best on the market for the money . Compared to wrangler and levi the fit and finish is miles above . I usually rip out belt loops in the first week of owning jeans and these carhartts are holding up better than any before . I love carhartt shirts and now their jeans . Wont buy anything else.Side note , these jeans fit very tight . If you are looking for a wrangler type regular fit , get the relaxed fit carhartt jeans . **EDIT** these jeans fit really oddly . super tight in the hips and butt but loose in the thigh and knees . They taper down really tightly onto boots . Also , I can see through the fabric in the seat of the jeans . They have no ripped but i am keeping an eye on them . Belt loops are holding strong .	1
I bought Carhartt jeans for me and my son at the same time . I like the fact that Carhartt has a very broad selection of both styles and sizes to choose from . I am at the weird end of the spectrum body type wise , and am very skinny , but long legged . A 30 '' waist but a 34 '' inseam ... yeah , I am all leg ! My son is better proportioned and has a 32 '' waist and 30 '' inseam . Finding jeans that fit me is difficult . But , thankfully , Carhartt has pants that fit me . I really enjoy the jeans I got , except for the fact that they only have 5 belt loops instead of the 7 I am used to . My son 's relaxed fit jeans are great . He wears them frequently . He is into body building and needs a jean that does't fit too tightly to his thighs ( which are understandably quite large now ) . So these relaxed fit jeans fill the bill nicely . He does n't feel pinched or bound up in them and finds them to be all-day comfortable . Construction is rugged and quality is excellent . They fit well and wash/dry well . These are really high quality jeans and worth the price . Oh , and the price was very NICE .	1
These jeans are both comfortable , and fashionable . They look and feel great , while standing up to the elements the same way you would expect any Carhartt product to . Just be warned : not all of the 1889 series are cut the same , so take precautions when ordering .	1
These jeans are the real deal . They are my favorite casual/work jeans . The extra cost over cheap jeans is worth it .	1
Good quality and construction , held up well to work environment and abuse , was shipped quickly , plan to order more in future .	1
Well I 've been wearing these jeans for a few years now . Levi 's and others seem to have lost their quality and fit goal and so a number of years ago I stopped buying levis . The particular jeans fit well ... I 'm not the smallest guy around at 6 foot tall and 285lbs . These jeans fit well and are comfortable to me , they fit like jeans should on a man ... ( certainly not skin tight ) . Good product and well made ( the product line pics do n't really do it justice ) . I will continue to buy these jeans as long as Carhartt keeps the product on course . Well made quality product that fits right .	1
True to size as listed . The stonewash is a little darker than I expected but hopefully fades in a few washes .	1
Never really a fan of jeans as I prefer the more standard khaki pants which I wear on regularly for work . These jeans however changed my perception and definitely feels as though they are made to last a lifetime as the materials used are quality to the touch and even the stitches used are of a high quality . Would definitely recommend these to people who appreciate a good quality jean .	1
sturdy jeans with a comfortable fit and the extra belt loops are well placed . a good price does n't hurt either . definitely something i would recommend and would buy again .	1
They are well made and a good fit for a reasonable price . The relaxed fit is a tad baggy but I woukd buy them again and recomnend them . I like them better than Levi 's .	1
Love this pants always have . I feel you would feel comfortable wearing these pants . Very heavy duty for work , and wearable right out of the drier if you get them out before they cool down . I totally recommend them .	1
These jeans where meant to be worn by anyone especially middle aged men and older . They are well constructed and come in a variety of colors . They are baggynor too tight . I would highly recommend them to anyone . A great deal at a great price . You can not find a better pair of jeams .	1
These jeans fit exactly as they should and they are very nice . Carhartt is a great brand and these jeans seems very durable . I would definitely buy them again .	1
I know all brands are different , so that may be the problem . This is my first pair of Carhartt pants/jeans . But , before ordering I tried on two pairs of my current jeans to make sure I liked the size they were . I did , so I ordered that size , but these are much tighter than my other jeans of the same size from other manufacturers . They are tighter in the legs and waist . I think part of the problem with the waist may be because if you look at the picture you will see the waist band is higher than many other types of jeans . So , the higher waist band rides higher up closer to my belly button compared to my other jeans . And , ummm lets say my six pack of abs bulges out a bit more by my belly button than it does down on my actual waist . I 've never had jeans that ride this high in the waist , so that probably explains some of my sizing issues.But over all these are constructed well , and I have quit doing situps in hopes that my rock hard bulging belly muscles will get smaller so the waist will fit better . If I do n't put these through the dryer I think I can get by with them .	1
First time to buy Carhart item . Great quality and craftsmanship . Wish for a 27 & # 34 ; length in a jean to avoid having to shorten for the wearer .	1
My husband likes long wearing jeans and these are well made and reasonably priced . I got him these for a Christmas gift though I used to buy at our local farm store for more money .	1
My husband is extremely picky and hard to please . He needed new jeans but has been disapointed with the quality of Levi 's brand . I knew Carhartt makes tough work clothes and outerwear that lasts , so I asked him to try these . I bought 2 pair and awaited delivery . My husband loves them . They fit perfectly in the waist and length . I have washed them since purchase and they have not shrunk or faded . I plan to buy more when I need to from Carhartt since he is happy .	1
bought these for my carhartt loving son in law . these jeans are very nice , but the sizing was a little off to the standards i usually buy him . he could stand to lose a few pounds though..	1
I am very satisfied with my purchase of these jeans . They fit well and appear to be very well made . Highly Recommend .	1
I have only worn Levi's.. well , no more . These Carhartt Jeans are just the best `` fit '' , `` color '' , and `` feel '' ! What a great price and in my size ( both `` waist '' and `` length '' ) .. No need to go to the store any-more.No need to buy Levi 's any-more !	1
They fit well and look good , as expected . I was expeciall pleased that they could be ordered with a 28 inch length , to eleminate alterations . Totally satisfied . Thanks	1
I ordered these for my son who always wears Wranglers . Well , these just did n't have the same sizing and were quite a bit tighter than what he is used to . Otherwise , they seemed to be a good quality and well cut . Just a little on the small side .	1
These are great jeans for casual wear . I am a Carhartt fan and will continue to buy this brand . I would recommend them to a friend .	1
Love how it fits , material feels good and strong , only beef i have with it is that all the pockets are a wee bit small	1
While these jeans werent even close to their advertised length ( I ordered a 28 length , it was closer to 32 ... ) , the quality was above the recent Wranglers I had gotten . Very heavy denim instills some confidence in their ability to last , and the colors are true to the pics here . I 'll report back if they give me any trouble , but till then I will use and abuse them to the best of my ability ( they are my work jeans ) .	1
Carhartt jeans are the best in my book . Been wearing this cut for years and probably will for many more . reasonably priced jeans that wear well . I 'm a cheapskate at heart ... these are right up my alley !	1
I bought these jeans for my husband . He likes the jeans and feels like they are well made and durable . They wash well and fit well too . they seem a little longer than the 32 inch length I thought I ordered but other than that , they are the best . I will buy more of this brand in the future ! The pockets are good and made with a dark and sturdy material . I would highly recommend these jeans to others who are looking for durability .	1
I receieved my carhartt relaxed fit jeans , in 38x28 & # 34 ; and all I can say is they are great ! ! made like the levis of old , Only better for me because of the 28 & # 34 ; length . they fit perfect . levis never did make a 28 & # 34 ; , and I hate rolling up the cuffs , so that allways left about 1,1/2 dragging behide me . But no more smile.I will be ordering more . thanks carhartt and amazon , Pitbullman & # 34 ;	1
These are great jeans ... .my husband is really appreciating them in this cold ! Nice heavy denim . Fit seems to be pretty true . They 're a tad long , but I 'd imagine a few times through the washer/dryer and they 'll be spot on . Very much worth the $ ! !	1
We tried the traditional fit of these jeans first , and ended up going with the Relaxed Fit as he found that more comfortable . Good quality denim and stitching as well as a good color that is n't too dark , but does n't look too washed out either . He is very picky about his jeans and he is very happy with these - That is the best endorsement I can think of !	1
I bought these jeans because I just got tired of the high price of Levis . These things are so good , that I just donated my used Levis . These fit nice . look good and seem substantial . Since my first two pairs , I bought two more , and will soon order another two pairs . Got to have plenty on hand . I recommend them if you 're a blue jean wearer , and want a better fit , that does n't seem to shrink as much as some of the competition .	1
Speeds delivery and came ready to wear . No wrinkles and looked fresh ironed . Material durable and fit was just fine . I got the stonewash and it looks exactly as pictured . I liked them and can tell they are sturdy enough to last and last . Looks like the picture and I am happy with my purchase .	1
I bought one pair to use for office attire and they are such a comfortable fit that I bought 4 more pairs . Great even color and do n't fade easily .	1
Great fit , thick denim , my husband wanted them for work , and he is very pleased with thi fit of them	1
So I bought a pair because I remember having a pair years back that looked really nice and were quite comfortable . This style has back pockets spaced wider apart than I remember - somewhat similar to Wrangler 13MWZ & # 34 ; cowboy pants & # 34 ; .Contrary to popular opinion , Wrangler butts do n't always drive them nuts . My girlfriend does n't like the look so much . I had ditched two pairs of 13MWZ for the same reason.I will keep them because , well , I am too lazy to send them back and they are very comfortable .	1
What 's not to like about Carhartt ? They 're wonderful . Just what he needed for weekends , evenings , and occasionally at work . thanks .	1
My husband is a little more mature in fit than he was 10 years ago . But he has had a hard time finding jeans that fit and look good . The Carhartt fit him well and I Have to say , they look great . They have only been washed 3 times since we got them , but they hold up well . Carhartt are known for their lasting and being a working man 's jeans . They are nice . I just bought two more pair. ! ! !	1
My son works hard so Carhartt jeans are great for him ! He can also wear them for casual wear ! They hold up well !	1
Carhartt pants are man thing , good looking , durable and comfortable . Put heavy starch on them and you will look like a million dollar .	1
I have always worn Levi 's - but sick of their lack of quality and high price , so I purchased these Carhartt Jeans to see if they were any good , Yes they are VERY Good ! Comfortable Tough you name it - I will continue to Purchase Carhartt Jeans !	1
I like the jeans except for the front pockets ... they are so narrow I ca n't get my hand into them .	1
These jeans are to size , no give , but comfortable . I wanted a darker blue color in jeans and these jeans are good . Washed them a few times and no color change or shrinkage . Well worth the price .	1
Levi 550s are NOT as well made as they used to be . Carhartt B17 's are an excellent replacement . This are almost exactly Levi 550 's from 15 years ago in CUT and Quality . VERY well made .	1
Ca n't go wrong with these work jeans ; I also love the Duluth trading , however , the price for the Carhartt is lower .	1
Rockport makes a strong shoe which has consistent sizing . The shoe is comfortable , easy care , and lasts . Some shoes are cheaper in price , but to get the quality that is representative of this shoe , the price is understandable . My husband , for whom these shoes were purchased , wears them many hours a day to work and needs a shoe which looks good and supports his foot . ABS	1
I have bought 3 pairs of these shoes for work and walking around NYC ! They last for a very long time and the support is vital in this concrete city ! My personal fave ! !	1
Tried the rest and buying again the best.My previous pair of World Tour Classic was 14 XW , but Rockport stopped making extra wide in size 14.So , I risked and ordered 14 W. It 's the winner ! Still not tight and good support from the bottom.Rockport World Tour Classic makes the most comfortable and durable shoes I 've ever owned.My previous pair of the same lasted for almost 7 years . Still looks good . The bottom is getting worn out though , but what do you want from a 7 year old shoes.Tried a few pairs of Dunham because they make size 14 4E , but they were completely uncomfortable ( the platform is almost not bendable ) . Those went back.Thinking of buying a different color of the same shoes now.Wear them to work and whenever else have to wear the pants .	1
Good fit , good-looking , good support . My husband loves them . He wears them several times a week and they still look like new	1
rockports mens walking shoe is a very comfotable shoe . it looks great with jeans . good quality and color .	1
i normally order a size 11.5 . Other reviews warned this shoe runs a bit small so I ordered a 12 which fits fine but could be a bit wider . i have never ordered a wide shoe before so was hesitant to try it without having the chance to compare in store . Other than the size , these compare favorably to my RockSports which are still my favorite and cost less to boot ( pun intended ) .	1
I actually take an E width in a shoe but decided to try these in the 9.5D . They are a little tight across the top of foot which was expected as even EE boots are tight there . I will use a form stretcher at the spot and they will feel fine . I found these on a closeout at a fantastic price via Wholesale Deals so could not pass them up . GREAT SHOE at a GREAT PRICE ! On top of this they were received within three days . & # 34 ; THANKS AGAIN AMAZON & # 34 ; for a great deal .	1
I bought these as I like the Rockport line of shoes . They are comfortable and go with a lot of my casual trousers . They are also okay where you dress up , like a wedding , but still good to go dancing in later on .	1
Great shoe , well made , nice looking and comfortable . My feet are wide and I ordered a 11 3E . I got 11 XW . Fit was good .	1
I ordered these because of the quality of the Rockport shoe . I have a wide foot with a sliding arch . This means that in a nike I can be anywhere from a 15-16 shoe . The Rockports provide a perfect fit for my foot which is a wide 14 . This is a very comfortable shoe and really gives the support that I have come to expect from a Rockport .	1
My husbands travels all over the world so needed a decent walking shoe . He loves Rockport and when his favoritie shoes were discontinued I found these and they were a great replacement . They 're wearing well and very comfortable he says .	1
My criteria was that I expect to be doing some traveling soon so wanted a shoe that had many sneaker-like features , but worked in more social and business situations , especially in countries that frown upon sneakers in non-athletic situations.I 've been wearing them for about a week . Shoes pretty good overall . Good feel and fit , works well with my stride.Couple of minor dings:1 . Color of actual shoe closer to a brown , rather than the greyish khaki of the picture2 . Collar of the shoe has a shallower angle compared to my other shoes , so it rubs against my ankle bone . It 's a padded collar so it 's not too bad , but could get irritating over a long day.3 . Stock insoles were pretty thin.Modifications : A . Replaced insoles with Dr. Scholl gel inserts , although may have to find a thicker insole or double up to avoid ding # 2 aboveB . Sprayed the shoes with a Camp Dry equivalent.If I remember , I 'll post an after-action report when I return from my trip .	1
These Rockports fit great .They are very comfortable and look good . I am on my feet alot during the day and I have no issues when wearing these shoes . I have several pairs and I will continue to buy them as long as they keep the quality up .	1
I looked at many shoes that had the traditional office type look but I needed them to be something I could stand in all day and even do a lot of walking on hard surfaces . I purchased a pair of Rockport walking shoes in 2002 and after having ground through that 1,000 steps Dakota Trail in the Dandenong ranges I was convinced Rockport are the king . I read all the reviews from people who also stand a lot and have problematic feet and was convinced these were right . Good decision . I wore them for two days and sometimes I dont know I am wearing them . So light and good heel and sole grip . I like the style as they can be worn for two purposes , walking and going out in the evening . Thanks to all the good folk who contributed to my decision to buy them.July 2012 - My feet never felt sore or tired and I did not have to wear my orthotic insoles at any time ( in fact I left them home on the basis of the reviews I read prior to purchase . Waterproofing never failed for those days when it did rain . I would recommend wearing thicker socks than normal though because the thin cotton or polyester socks then to chaffe on your skin . That was not a problem for me as I did a trial wear.I now wear these rockports to work all the time . Best shoes I have ever purchased .	1
I love my Rockport walkers ! This purchase was to replace my old pairs ( brown and black ) that had lasted me for years . I walk 3.25 miles to work , five days a week ( and have been walking to work for almost 20 years now ... what can I say , I love to walk ) so a good pair of walking shoes make a lot of difference . These Rockports are the best walking shoes I have ever owned . ( My last ones lasted for years . ) They are tough and are n't affected by rain or bad weather . ( I just brush them off when I get home and let them air out overnight . ) They are light and comfortable and the fit is great . There is no `` breaking in '' period like with most shoes ( no blisters , pinching or tight spots ) , and they feel as comfortable as running shoes . The style for these pairs is more casual office , but that fits my office . They are a little higher in price than what I would have like to have paid ... but they are worth the price . I would recommend these to anyone who walks alot .	1
ROckport Men 's World Tour walking shoes just fit . Requires virtually no break in period , and its look is timeless . This is n't a shoe for formal wear , but it does well for dressed down business or walking about . The sole is balanced , giving good lateral stability as well as great support . There is ample toe room with the gradually rounded toe . The one complaint if there is one is that Rockport could do well to invest more in laces that do n't come undone easily.Otherwise , it is the most comfortable shoe and a good value.And the sole of the shoe wo n't break apart in two year as does the Ecco brand .	1
I bought these for work . They are a bit heavy but dont seem to tire me in any way . Slip resistant and clean up with a wet towel . I will probably but antother pair before long .	1
Package arrived on time and shoes came in a rockport shoe box . I ordered some insoles for these shoes , the ones that came were average and slim . These are great working shoes and the materials used are put well together .	1
Great casual shoe . Great to wear with khaki 's or a pair of jeans . You will not be disappointed with the quality and comfort that Rockport always delivers . I also own a couple of pairs of dress shoes by Rockport .	1
They Looked GREAT , but had to be returned because they were too big.Exchanged for a smaller size Rockport Eureka which is also a great looking shoe.Thus , I would say this world tour shoe is a generous fit .	1
ROCKPORT IS THE GREATEST WALKING SHOES EVER WILL ALWAYS KEEP ON HAND FOR COMFORT AND SUPPORT AS WELL AS SUPPORT	1
Show fits as advertised . I am an installer and I am on my fee a lot , but the firm support and comfort make for a great feel all day . I have worn this brand for years and recommend them because of their great fit , very long life and fantastic comfort , all day and night .	1
I ordered these for my soon-to-be husband in a 10WWW . They fit perfectly and were comfortable from the get-go . He plans to wear them on our honeymoon in England . Rockport can be counted on for good quality at reasonable prices .	1
The brown tumbled have been my standard wear-to-work shoe for over 20 years . The chocolate nubuck version is my weekend shoe . These are the most naturally comfortable shoes I have ever found , and they look great.They 're produced in Vietnam and China . Though not scientific , my feet say the Vietnam production feels better . The only problem I ever had was with one pair produced in China . I could n't put my finger on it but something about the fit was n't right.I ca n't describe with words how much I have enjoyed wearing Rockport 's World Tour Classics all these years . They 're perfect in every way and the price is reasonable.I greatly appreciate Rockport for staying on course with these shoes . No changes , same great fit and appearance , with solid durability for a reasonable price.A key reason for the World Tour 's high comfort level is the insole design . Hopefully Rockport will hold the quality level and not go cheap like so many show makers have with low-end insoles that only perform for 6 months.For as long as Rockport continues to sell these shoes , I will be buying them . Hopefully , that will be for a long time to come .	1
I ordered these for my husband to replace a pair of the same shoes . He says they are comfortable , have good support and walk well . They seem to be true to size . He hopes to get at much wear from this pair as the last ones . These look good with jeans or casual pants , could probably pull off with a suit as well . They seem to be good quality , I guess time will tell though .	1
Rated four stars because the black is ugly . Rockport use to offer an off white shoe that was nice looking and went with everthing . Still buy because the shoe fits well and is comfortable .	1
We have been buying these for my husband for about 10 years . They are very comfortable for him to walk in and they wear for a LONG time .	1
These Rockports are very much like well-made , socially-acceptable versions of athletic shoes . They are very flexible , take no time to break in , provide good traction , and look almost like a pair of dress oxfords . Because they are nicely padded -- which adds to the comfort -- they tend to look a little blocky , so that they 're probably not your cup of tea if you 're looking for stylish dress shoes . But for going on a cruise -- where you want to wear a single pair of your size 13 shoes and not have to pack extras , and will be walking a lot -- these are wonderful .	1
This is a replacement pair for one that I have been wearing for years ! These shoes are comfortable right out of the box - no break-in period . The nubuck finish is a bit suede like , but not as fussy , I like the look and the color . I notice an inconsistency in the inner-sole of one of the shoes . The foot feels a very slight but annoying change in sole thickness just in back of the toes . When I ordered an additional pair in black , that same inconsistency was even more evident in one of the shoes - so I returned that pair . Be aware of the error - you may need to return them as well if the feel is apparent to you.Based on my last pair , I expect these will last beyond my interest period . At some point you just want a new pair of shoes and these things refuse to die ! I use them for everyday use for all but dressy occasions .	1
The last pair of Rockport shoes I owned have lasted me for over four years ( ! ) . They have been the most comfortable shoe I have ever owned and have held up under sometimes very punishing conditions due to the nature of my work . I have really liked their cushioned Vibram soles . Alas , all good things come to an end and it finally got to the point where my poor Rockports were looking pretty grungy and worn at the heels . I paid several visits to various Houston stores that carry Rockports , but none of them carried the Classic Walking Shoe type , which is exactly what I wanted . I then decided to give Amazon a try.This is the first time I 've ever taken the chance of purchasing shoes on line . I 'm usually VERY picky about my shoes because I have to spend so much time on my feet in my job , which also includes having to stand for many hours at a time at conventions , etc . Too often , shoes just do n't fit properly on my narrow feet . When my Rockports arrived from Amazon , I was only a little disappointed that they felt just a touch smaller than I would have liked . I told myself , however , that my old Rockports have been well worn in and have probably stretched out over time to arrive at that perfect feeling that they now have , so I 've decided to hang on to these and give them a chance to break in as well.If this works out for me , I will probably consider making my future shoe purchases online with Amazon as well . Their prices seem to be competitive and the shoes were delivered to me in a matter of a few days . I highly recommend these shoes as a kind of casual dress shoe for those who spend a lot of time on their feet but need something more than sneakers or other less dressy type shoes .	1
These Rockports have a straight last , which I personally much prefer over a curved last because of the type of arch support I find to be the most comfortable when wearing a pair of shoes for a long stretch ( like when going to the Fair and walking all day ) . They tend toward sizing a tad small , so if you 're in between , go for a 1/2 size up , and being able to get an 11-N is a luxury for me . I broke them in ( yes , they 're not wear-ready right of the box ) by wearing them around the house for a few days . Since they 've softened up , they have been my choice of foot wear over my old white tennies and my NB walking shoes . I have other Rocs and my feet love 'em . I 'm not worried about the nice clean look -- they 'll get spills and dirt with time . I could use any of several products to keep them pristine looking ( Scotchguard is good ) , but I 'd rather they aged naturally . Great shoes . Great price at Amazon ( I put them on my Wish List and then just waited for the price to plummet ) .	1
My size is between 9~9.5 long . This pair shows a little bit somehow large but it 's acceptable . I can wear thick socks and wearing it in cold days . It is a good choice for heavy guys .	1
We bought a pair for an older child who wore out lesser , cheaper brands in a few months . With one brand we had trouble with the rubber sole separating from the rest of the sandal . Sometimes you could fix it with Shoe Goo , sometimes not . I recognized Columbia as a good brand and bought a pair on the large side , since he is still growing . So far we 're doing fine . One can tell by inspection it is a much better sandal than sandals selling for half the price . So , though it is more expensive than some other brands at department stores , I think this is a good value in the long run . Comfortable and attractive , too .	1
Nice for the beach or around the pool . For the price , I thought they would be a little better for walking . I used them on a long walk down the boardwalk and regretted wearing them on the way back , and even went barefoot for the last few blocks . Would be better if that back strap was adjustable to tighten things up if needed . Even my cheap old OP sandals have that .	1
These are quality sandals . I originally ordered size 10s , but they were too big . Returned those without a hitch , and ordered 9s . These fit much better . The velcro straps make for easy adjustment . Nice thick soles and solid construction . I 've taken up hiking/backpacking and got these for camp shoes ; I suspect these 'll serve for a good long time .	1
I was able to fit my 120lb ex in this bag ( Just so we are clear it was when we were dating , I did n't kill her or anything ) . I use it to store a memroy foam mattress for transport to my college apt . This is a big and durable bag I have loaded lots into before and dragged to my car ( Again ... it was not a body ) . The zipper and bag seem pretty stout and have held up for me so far . A strap would be a nice addition if I had anything to gripe about it .	1
Solid , but the size 50X30 is soooo big , it 's almost useless . I thought I would almost fit in there myself.Definitely not for the airports . Had it been 50X15 or 50X20 would be more appropriate .	1
This bag far exceeded my expectations given the price , it was massive , fit in everything but the kitchen sink and did n't even get a scrape even after I dragged it across sidewalks , airports and on and off trains . If you need a bag this size , seriously do n't even look at another bag . Buy it .	1
This is very large and designed well . I will have lots of room for hunting equipment and will trust the tough design .	1
When the bag for my tent started falling apart I bought this to replace it and this bag is nice . The seams are sewn well and you can tell it is very good quality . Would recommend .	1
well made durable green bag . folds up small for storage and opens up big to use . if you are wanting a traditional canvass duffel bag then this is it .	1
I bought this Texsport bag to store myGuide Gear Double Wigwam Tent . This bag is huge and is big enough for my 8-man tent with room to spare . The only thing I do n't like is it does n't come with a strap . There are plastic loops where we can attach a strap , but we must supply our own straps . It does come with carry handles and a zipper down the middle , which I like more than the ones that open on the end.This is one tough bag . Great for camping . I 'm glad I found it .	1
I have been looking for some lined , warm jeans for several years . These are exactly right . We have had a horrible winter . Not so bad now .	1
I wear these in the yard and when working in the cold and snow and I love them . They really do help keep me warm in the wind.I wear a 38 x 30 or 32 depending on the cut and style of jean . In work boots these are the perfect length for a person who normally wears a 30 length . The same is true of the width , I am usually a perfect 38 and these fit really well.When I need a pair of jeans for wearing after work I will be looking at Wrangler . Very impressed .	1
Heavy fabric . Looks and feels like they will wear well . Warm without too much bulk . Fits like regular jeans . Plenty of room for bending and sitting while working . My winter favorites after just one day outside in them .	1
I have a couple of Scrushes at my house . The one with the base is at the entrance that has stone steps , and the one without the base at the entrance that has wood steps . The Scrusher with a base allows you to put one foot on the base to hold it down , while you are cleaning the other shoe . The Scrusher without the base has to screwed down to the deck to stay in place while you are using it . You can not use this Schrusher ( without the base ) without attaching it to something because as you clean your boot it will move around with with boot.The Scrusher has brushes on the bottom and the sides so it scrapes the boot from the sides as well as from the bottom . It works well on scraping off garden dirt during the summer as well as snow during the winter . The stiff brushes do a good job cleaning without damaging/scratching the shoe.I owned my Scrushes for 3 years , they stay outside all year round . The only down side is that metal parts began rusting on both of them , so I had to move the free standing Scrusher off the nice stone steps to avoid rusty stains . However the replacement steel base is sold separately so it can be replaced ( to find the base search for Scrusher Boot Cleaner Base ( Steel Base Only ! ) ) I am attaching several photos of my Scrusher , so you can evaluate its condition and the amount of rust yourself.Ali Julia review	1
This entry way shoe brush was delivered quickly and the quality is very sturdy and well built . It has to be mounted to a board or screwed to the floor/ground to hold it in place while you scrub your shoes .	1
I can use it , but my feet are small and I do n't get very much crap on my shoes . When the big guys try to use it , their boot does n't really fit . I will have to have it secured to something and have them try again this coming winter .	1
We had this bolted to our cement steps outside our back door for almost 10 years before we had to replace the bristles . That 's pretty good for a climate that gets high humidity , beaming sun , negative temperatures and snow . Very well made product . The bristle did n't seem to damage dress shoes either .	1
This is an excellent shoe scraper . However , to work effectively , it needs a base , which is not easy to attach . Apparently you can remove the bottom brushes and use the drill holes , which I did not figure out . I screwed a piece of scrap board into the bottom brushes from below ( through the drill holes ) , which works fine , but requires fairly exact measurement . The board extends @ 9 inches to each side of the brush . I stand on the board with my off foot so that it is firmly anchored when I brush each shoe.The fit is very tight , which is necessary for the brush to remove debris thoroughly . I suspect that reviewers who complain of the tight fit for large shoes have not attached an anchoring board.The product would be improved by the inclusion of instructions for attaching an anchor board.Because I have a small back porch , I have to keep the apparatus a few feet away on a paved surface .	1
This is a heavy duty boot brush that wo n't slide around when you 're trying to get mud off your feet . Size and appearance are true to the picture .	1
I was very pleased with these earrings . I was n't too sure about the size from the description and they are a bit smaller than I would have liked.The stones are a good quality and I enjoy wearing them .	1
I am thrilled with the quality of these earrings and so glad that with 14k gold , they are still quite affordable.The stones are excellently matched in color and just the perfect shade of brown that goes with anything . They stand out on the lobe and I was worried they 'd be really small , but they are not . In spite of the decent size of the stones , these are really lightweight and you ca n't tell you 're wearing them , at all.I think these would make an excellent gift and I 'm considering buying an additional pair , just for that purpose !	1
Very comfortable to wear ; nice size ; good stone color . Would buy again .	1
These earrings are smaller than I expected them to be and do not show at all in my ears . Maybe it 's because my hair is brown plus their size ... ? The gold in them is substantial and the stones are a reasonable quality for the price . If you purchase these and prefer earrings that are femnine and delicate , you 'll enjoy owning these and they are worth the price of $ 39	1
These are very nice stud earrings . I got them at a great sale price . They are small , not flashy , but with a good medium purple amethyst gemstone . They sit well on the ear and are comfortable . Adequate gold setting .	1
These are much smaller than I thought they would be , however I like the shape and the quality seems good .	1
I 'm very pleased with this purchase , especially having bought them during an Amazon sale . The blue is clear and bright , the setting is secure , and they fit well on the ears . The post is a little higher than center so I often find myself turning them to be sure they are falling correctly , but it really does n't make a difference . The white gold really complements the blue and I much prefer these set in white rather than yellow gold because of the very cool color of the stones . For those who have light colored eyes , these are especially complementary . I have received numerous compliments when wearing these and I wear these very , very often , sometimes not removing them for weeks at a time .	1
Peridot is my birthstone . Twenty to 30 years ago , I purchased 6 mm round peridot earrings for around $ 110 from I. Magnin . The oval earrings from Amazon compare favorably in the amount of gold and stone size . From there , the color and cut of the perfectly matched peridots on the Amazon pair are clearly superior . The picture does n't do them justice . These earrings cost me less than $ 18 including super saver shipping . Anyone who loves peridots is going to love these earrings .	1
Bright , clear stone . These are small earrings , not too flashy . Lightweight , comfortable setting , easy to wear .	1
I bought these during a sale and got them for just under $ 50 . I plan to use them as a birthday gift . They are just the right size . I wish I could have them for myself ! I expected they would be flimsy , but they do n't seem to be at all . Highly recommend especially when on sale .	1
I am glad I looked up earrings on Amazon because I could n't find the right size for me anywhere . So I had to by different kinds until I could find the right one . I love my earrings , thank you . And I would recommend to anyone who likes hoop earrings then this is the one for you .	1
They are a great work earring . Small , yet wide enough to signal they 're there . Do n't brush out on a hurried morning . Exactly what I was looking for . Well made . Good quality .	1
These are smaller than they look on the website . A little smaller than a dime I think . I like them - easy to wear etc	1
This is a replacement pair for an identical set I had for over three years . Nice quality , the clasp to keep earring on is very solid , lost last pair on vacation .	1
These duragold 14K yellow gold half-round hoop earrings are the best on Amazon ! These are made high quality in nature and are made to last . These have a great clasp that wo n't ever let you down . These will not fall off-they are made well . These look classy , stylish and are a must-have for all . They do look bigger in the picture than they really are though but I did n't want them too big . They are by no means small just not as shown-so please keep that in mind when purchasing them . I absolutely love these earrings and will have them forever . A definite recommend to others on this one ! ! !	1
This is very spectactular , beauty at its best , gorgeous to look at and brings out any outfit . These are just beautiful .	1
I wear mine for weeks at a time and forget I have them on . They are high quality and very attractive hoop earrings , but much smaller than I had imagined . They are keepers and the price was right !	1
perfect size and light weight compared to the ones I had that were stolen But here again I wonder how long they will last . They used the least possible amount of gold but I like them .	1
Bought these for my mom for Xmas . She really likes them . They also seem to be hypoallergenic . She is sensitive to that , so it was important .	1
The earrings have a very good clasp that locks tight . They are so comfortable , I slept in them the first night because I did n't realize I was still wearing them . I always wear earrings but i like small ones for my casual life .	1
Secure latch and easy to open and close . Great for activity like golf because they are secure on your ears . Beautiful gold color ...	1
These are small hoops , with an outer diameter of just under 5/8 & # 34 ; . However , they are classics that will never go out of style .	1
My Wife love it.She looks beautiful , elegant and SexyWe are really happy with this product but they are a little tiny.We recommended to buy the product because to be totally honest , is beautiful ! ! ! !	1
Of all the earrings I received for Christmas these were my favorite . Maybe because I bought them for myself . Nice , simple and smallish gold hoops . They are not as big as you would expect judging by the picture shown . After doing a little research on duragold ( because really , what is it ? ) it appears to have a slightly lower percentage of gold in it and reportedly the strongest gold alloy ever . Whatever that is . Still , I love these except the post is a little long and gets caught on my clothes . I 'd buy them again and I would buy them as a gift .	1
I bought these originally expecting a rather inexpensive imitation of fine jewelry but am happy to report that my wife loved them and guessed that I had paid much more than I actually did spend .	1
I absolutely love these earrings . They are just what I wanted . I had some like them but had lost them so I was so pleased when I saw these on Amazon . I liked them so much I ordered some for Mom for Mother 's Day . She loves them too .	1
Love these earrings . comfortable classic . They are small which I wanted . Not sure how they will hold up yet . But highly recommend so far .	1
These 14K gold hoops are about the diameter of a dime 1/2 inch , and the width is about 1/4 inch . The hoops seem sturdy , the catch looks fragile . I did wear them for a week nonstop and they never came undone . But I imagine taking them on and off repeatedly might eventually be an issue with the fragile looking catch . These would be great for a child , and good for a women when she does n't want a large hoop . These have a post that sticks out a bit in the back , so they are not as comfortable as a hoop where the clasp goes inside the hoop . But it was n't nearly as uncomfortable as a butterfly back post because the post tends to hang downward rather than poking straight back . They have a polish finish , and are a good choice for a small unobtrusive but substantial looking earring .	1
I love these hoops ! They are so comfortable to wear and are a nice size if you want a hoop but do n't want the dangers of catching them on anything.They were a bit smaller than I thought they would be , but once I put them on , I was hooked . I have short hair so they are visible regardless . If you have longer hair , these earring might be hidden.I 'm glad I stumbled upon these - quite by accident . They are a replacement pair for ones my husband bought me that were almost 2 '' across and made me look like DUMBO.The earrings are packaged nicely too . They come in a nice pouch with a authenticity tag.I highly recommend these earrings . Buy with confidence .	1
I was happy that I found these earrings , they are the right size I was looking for and it 's easy to open and close . There are some hoops that make it hard to open/or close . But these are good and I would be willing to buy from this seller any time .	1
These hoops were perfect ! Good quality , sturdy and the size was exactly what I wanted . Not to small and not to big..a little smaller then a silver dime .	1
I wanted small gold earrings . I found small gold earrings . I like them . They 've held up well . No complaints .	1
I like the color and shape of the earring . They 're very light and you hardly notice you 're wearing them . I thought they 'd be slightly thicker , but they 're fine . The main gripe I have is that the clasp is a little flimsy . Be careful if you wear them daily ( as do I ) , for they can easily come off while changing clothes or taking off a scarf .	1
I wanted small earrings to wear for every day , that I could also sleep in . I need to wear white gold since I am can not wear silver or inexpensive fashion earrings due to a sensitivity to those metals.I have fair skin and dark hair , but you can still see these . You could also wear them in a second hole in your ear higher up if you piercings there.Someone else commented that they are about the size of a dime . I would agree . They are very well made , though , and lightweight . With the high cost of gold these days , they are worth the money .	1
Really like these small hoops . They are great basic earrings and and have super good quality . The latch closes easily and securely . No problems sleeping with them .	1
I was looking for gold hoops to be able to wear all the time . I found them ! The price is very affordable and the hoops are strong and well made . They are the size of a dine ( perfect size to wear even to bed ) . I love my hoops . Will buy Duragold from Amazon again for sure .	1
I found the earrings to be well made , shiny , and just right for everyday wear . Not at all uncomfortable if you happen to sleep with them on : )	1
just right for people who like small and classy earrings this will be just right , the gloss is awesome and the earrings are sturdy and look long lasting , I would recommend it any time	1
I just got these the other day , and they 're even more beautiful than I expected ! I like smaller hoops , and these were the exact right size for me . Very shiny , lovely yellow gold shade ( not brassy ) , and the closures are nice and secure . If you 're looking for a lovely pair of small hoops , these are the ones for you ! The price was very reasonable , and shipping was fast ... . I 'm very happy with this purchase !	1
I got these for my mom for Christmas , and she loved them . They were a little small , but they are very light . They are a really good everyday earring . The clasps seem very strong , and it seems they will hold up for a long while . I would definitely buy these again !	1
The small size of these beautiful gold hoops makes them one of the most versatile earrings I own : they can be simple ( for work ) , casual ( with jeans and a sweater ) , or elegant ( with a dress , if I want to keep the look low-key , or if I 'm wearing a `` statement '' necklace requiring other jewelry to be minimal . ) My one problem , resulting in the loss of one star , is that one of the clasps is so tight that it 's difficult open and close the earring . In hindsight , I should have returned them for another pair .	1
I like rose gold and have n't seen many smaller hoops offered in pink . I have metal allergies and must wear gold , platinum or surgical/implant grade steel . These hoops do not cause itching or redness . I can wear them around the clock and bathe in them . I do n't know if the price was a deal , but I 'm enjoying the earrings . Secure clasp keeps them on while sleeping .	1
I got these as a birthday gift ! They are dainty and feminine . They are just big enough to be beautiful and not over the top . GREAT BUY !	1
These are beautiful earrings . I feel like they are the perfect size , not at all child-like ( to me ) as some have posted . I do n't like super big hoops and feel like I look silly with anything very large in my ears , but these are absolutely perfect and understated . They are also quite substantial -- no flimsy wire-like feeling to these .	1
I just got these a couple days ago , they are the real deal , very pretty great price , fast shipping and it 's a look that can virtually work with any outfit casual or otherwise . I will post an update in a couple of months as to how they are holding up , till then I am happy with this purchase . Happy shopping .	1
Very small but great for a small child . Beautiful color . Bought this as a gift and it was really loved by the receiver .	1
I bought these for my mother in law as a gift . She loves them ( I think she 's just being polite ) because my wife told me that she prefers gold hoops that are a little larger and thicker . Oh , well . She has already lost a few pairs of gold hoops and I 'm sure these will suffer the same fate . Anyways , these would be better suited for someone who likes wearing small earrings . The picture of the dummy wearing the earrings does n't give you an accurate idea of the size . Definitely pull out a ruler and measure it for yourself if you 're unsure about the size .	1
These earrings are just what I was looking for . I am allergic to some gold , especially white gold , but I have been wearing these almost every day , and I have had no problem . They are small , just the size I was looking for . They are also sturdy . The clasp is strong , and I do n't worry about losing them when I wear them . Thanks for the great product !	1
My husband purchased these for me to match a white gold necklace . I wear them 95 % of the time . I sleep in them . They are very small , but that 's what I like about them . They 're dainty . The latch is still working well , even though I shower in them and sleep in them . I change them rarely , as they match the necklace which is sentimental to me . I had meant to get some more white gold earrings and just have n't . These have stood the test of time ... even though I did n't mean to challenge them that way .	1
I ordered these when they had the 30 % off deal . I got all three colors . They are small ; they hug the ear lobe . I do n't like large earrings , so these are just the right size for me . I can wear them casually when I want to dress up just a little . For other people who may have more than one pierced hole , these would be great to match with the ball studs . I have those in 5mm .	1
Thea 're really beautiful and comfortable . The only thing is they look bigger at the picture than they 're in real , but even if I knew it I would have ordered them as they 're really great .	1
These ear rings are the perfect size . They are a good quality and are shiny and bright . I would recommend them .	1
I LOVE THIS ITEM , A LITTLE SMALL THAN I THOUGHT , BUT OKAY , I WILL GIVE THEM TO MY GRANDDAUGHTER NO PROBLEM THOUGH , I 'LL KNOW THE NEXT TIME .	1
Simple and well made . They look elegant . Easy to put in and the perfect size to replace a pair I had lost .	1
This earrings are great . Wanted to slip trollbeads , etc . over them . I get alot of compliments . People think I have alot of earrings ( which I do ) but not as many as they think . These are just narrow enough to slip different things over them .	1
If you 're looking for hoops that are not too big these earrings are for you . I like that they go with everything .	1
These earrings are exactly as described and are very good quality at a reasonable price . The catch is firm ( only had them a week - hope that 's still true a year from now ! ) , which is important because I 've been known to lose hoops .	1
I LOVE MY NEW EARRINGS ! I THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE A LITTLE TO BIG ON ME , BUT THE ARE TERRIFIC . I FEELLIKE A NEW LADY IN THEN . I WILL BE LOOKING FOR MY 14KT . GOLD FROM AMAZON . THEY HAVE SO MANY CHOICESIT MAKES YOU KEEP GOING BACK . THANK YOU & # 34 ; AMAZON & # 34 ; FOR QUALITY PRODUCTS TO WEAR AND USE !	1
UPDATE I 've owned these earrings for 7 years . I wear them often and they look as good as the day they arrived from Amazon in 2007 . Perfect 14K yellow gold color , not brassy-looking at all like some gold is , they are the perfect size - 1 '' in diameter . Well made , yet light in gram weight , the post snaps shut with a nice click and does n't feel like they will easily come unsnapped . The hinge seems to be high-quality and strong too . They are the perfect earring for me .	1
I 'm a typical guy that is basically clueless about jewelry , but I can certainly appreciate the ease of buying something on Amazon as opposed to going to a jewelry store and dealing with salespeople trying to push expensive products . My favorite move is when they take out their calculator and magically apply some unknown discount to what may or may not be a sticker price . My wife absolutely loved these earings - I do n't know exactly why - but if your loved one is asking for gold hoop earrings these are the real deal .	1
These are shiny and made very well.Very haute couture and more soif you wear them in graduated sizes , at thesame time .	1
At least for me , these are the perfect size . The color is great . They 're just as pictured . Light and comfortable to wear , you can see them well and they have enuogh size to have some style , but still not oversized .	1
My husband purchased these for my birthday in December , and I really love them . They are light weight , thin , they stay closed and they are not too big . If you are in the market for a lovely pair of hoop earrings . These are absolutely perfect .	1
The reviews on these earrings were so mixed that I was n't sure I was going to be happy when I received them . I 'm pleased to say I was not unpleasantly surprised.They are flimsy , they 're very light , they do n't seem overly trustworthy , but they 're very pretty AND under $ 150 . If you 're looking for solid heavy gold hoops that will last a lifetime , you need to visit your jeweler and be prepared to invest . If you want a delicate pair of chic hoops that will fill a hole in your jewelry box for less than the cost of a nice dinner out , these are for you .	1
These are very simple but very cute , I was pretty surprised , how good they look on an adult regardless of their size .	1
Perfect earrings , perfect price ! Very shiny and not too big or too small for my ears .	1
they are simple an elegant . very pretty , i lo ve it ve ry much . i love it very much it is a very good product i love it very much it is a very good product	1
I used to buy Duragold years ago , and was surprised and pleased to see it available here . I bought both the 4 mm and the 5 mm yellow gold ball studs . Please note the posts are shorter than normal , which I love because I can sleep in them without them poking the back of my head . The butterfly clasp is small , so I replaced them with a locking type of clasp from a different pair of earrings . I have worn the 4 mm ones in my second hole continuously for well over a month with no problem . One thing great about Duragold is that they 're hypoallergenic , which is important for those who can have reactions to different alloys in gold . I really like this brand .	1
Love the shine , and the price . The 5mm ball is not too small or too large . I prefer the simple style and the color is really a golden rose color .	1
I got these for $ 9 on the Friday Sale . They are well made and the perfect size . You absolutely will not find a better pair for the price . Wait for the Friday Sale if you can .	1
Got these for my granddaughter , they are perfect , the price is much much better here at amazon . Most stores were selling similar for over a hundred	1
Great earrings , bought a set for my girlfriend.She loves them ! Style glow and style they have are second to none ! People compliment her all the time .	1
I bought two pair of these earrings in April 2005 for $ 10 each , one for me and one for a granddaughter . Now Amazon is running them for $ 9 on the Friday sale . It 's not too soon to be thinking about Christmas stocking stuffers . These would be perfect . These are real gold , quality earrings . I love mine and have worn them now for almost two years with no problems , having to be careful about metal allergies . What are you waiting for ?	1
I like these . I wanted something that was n't too flashy to wear on a regular basis , and I 'm allergic to most of the earrings I currently have . I can wear these all day comfortably . They 're subtle but not tiny ; any bigger and I 'd feel a little uncomfortable with them . The back is a little flimsy , and I do worry about losing them . Overall , I 'm very pleased with the purchase .	1
I bought these , along with the 14K 7mm gold earrings , for my wife and she liked them both very much . 5mm is petite and they really look nice on her . I got them on sale for $ 9.00 , what a bargin for 14K white gold .	1
These gold earrings come in a lovely box adn will make an excellent stocking stuffer for my daughter ! I wish I had ordered another pair for myself !	1
These earrings are very darling - shiny and a nice hue of gold . The quality looks fine and the backs on mine do click , but the backs are pretty small too , so have to be careful handling them . I think these earrings would look best on a petite person or young teen . They might appear a bit small on someone with med to large sized ears .	1
Love these earrings , they are the perfect size and I am very pleased with the product quality . All around a great product .	1
I previously ordered the 7mm studs when they were a gold box deal . They seemed too large for me , so I ordered this size . Now these seem way too small . I would n't have believed there was such a difference in 2mm . They are beautiful and the lustre is nice .	1
These too went to my daughter . She is apparently happy with them . There were no complaints when I spoke with her .	1
These ball earrings are great for my second set of ear piercings . They are just the right side and they are not obnoxious to wear to the office .	1
I love that these earrings can go with anything . I wear them to workout , go to the store , or even with certain outfits for an evening out . Very simple and elegant .	1
I am very pleased with these earrings . They are pretty and the right size for a second earring in the ear , or for when you do n't want a big earring in the main piercing . They are exactly what I was looking for when I bought them .	1
I love the stud earrings . I bought them for my daughter and she love wearing stud earring . I know she will be happy with them .	1
Very happy with the earrings . Price was great and I love getting shipping free .	1
I am into Rose Gold , and these earrings are gorgeous . I wear them daily and would highly recommend them as a day to day earring , or a more dressy get up	1
For a relatively small stud these really show up on the ear . I fumble a bit to get them on , but not more than for any similarly sized stud . They appear to be sturdy . I am glad I got them ( I am allergic to silver but am able to wear white gold . ) .	1
The balls are brilliant and shiny and just the size I wanted . Unfortunately the backs to the earrings as well as the stem connected to the balls are VERY thin . One of the backs arrived wrapped around some random rubber piece of fabric that was shoved into the pouch the earrings came in . When I tried to untangle the back from the stretchy , rubbery material the back lost all of its integrity , uncurled and flattened . I was able to & # 34 ; mold & # 34 ; it back into a normal shape ( the backs are tiny ... this was no small feat ) , but it would not stay on the stem to the earing any longer . Thank goodness I have a tons of extra backs in my jewelry box ... although it took me a few minutes to find a pair of backs that would fit the ultra-thin stems on the earrings . Pretty , but be careful with them . Shipping was SUPER fast !	1
These were a great earring for the price . If backing is loose change for another . Great Shine and Polish to them .	1
Wear them 24/7 several weeks in a row and am very happy with the quality , the 7mm size , and of course-Amazon 's bargains ! Try the 7mm Yellow Gold Ball Earrings ... you will love them too !	1
They are perfect . The are a wonderful gold color . They are large enough to go with any outfit and small enough to be ladylike .	1
These earrings just arrived , and for $ 10 ( Friday sale ) , you can not beat this value . Luckily I bought two pair , one as a gift , and one for me , on the off chance I liked them . Otherwise , I thought , I could hold the second pair for one of my granddaughters . No way ; the second pair is mine .	1
When I first received these I was not sure if I was going to like them . But after wearing them a few time I do like the color and while the size is a little bigger than I would normally wear , they are still very pretty .	1
I bought these for my wife and she liked them very much . 7mm is not as small as you may think . I certainly would n't buy anything larger in this style . I got them on sale for $ 15.00 , ca n't go wrong with that price for 14K gold .	1
A very good buy . The price is very reasonable . I recommend this product to anyone who wants a casual or even dress earring .	1
Excellent quality - the post is smooth and does not abrade the ear as some inexpensive earrings do . The ball is smooth and shiny with no ripples , pits or other defects . I am very happy with this purchase !	1
I like my jewelry to be understated and , at first , I thought these would be too big . If they were , I 'd give them to my sisters as a birthday present . They are just fine at this size . Sorry , sis ! My backs are firm and the studs are long enough . I got all three colors at a lightning deal offer . I was sorry I was only allowed to buy one of each .	1
A great pair of earrings . What can I say ? They look great..arrived as new and I like them really well . The did not take forever to arrive either and I did n't have to pay a fortune for the shipment .	1
The shine will want you to get another pair or more of the Duragold ear rings . I love them and plan to buy more of thisgold .	1
Just a short note - I am very please with this purchase . Others said the back clip needs to be replace because they are loose . I had no problems with mine .	1
They look beautiful . They are a present for the holidays . I hope the person enjoys them , coloring is very pretty .	1
Well made earrings . The color is shiny . The ear nuts are small , but I have n't had a problem with them . I also have the Duragold 14K Gold earrings in 8mm and that is what led me to buy them in white gold as well .	1
These earrings are really pretty . They look exactly like the picture on Amazon . I got these on a Lightning Deal for $ 40 , which I thought was a good price for gold earrings . Unlike some reviewers , I like the 8mm size . It is big enough to be seen clearly , without being too big to overpower the look . I bought these earrings to match/coordinate with the Duragold 14k yellow gold beaded ball necklace . They match perfectly . So glad I got these . If you are looking for a simple and classic look , then I would definitely recommend these earrings .	1
The 8 mm size is large and stunning . The quality is very good . I would consider buying another pair with a smaller diameter ,	1
I have bought 3 pairs of fold ball studs . The 2 prior were very fragile and dented easily . I wear these just about everyday and they have kept their shape and color .	1
These are such a great size , are nice and shiny , and have a good weight to them . I 'm super happy with this purchase . However , the backs are completely useless . They just slide on and off , up and down the post -- there is no catch whatsoever . So I 'm disappointed that I 'm going to have to spend the time , money and effort to pick up replacement backs , but I expected this based on some of the other reviews . So do n't hesitate to buy these since they are great quality and a good value , but do plan to replace the backs before you wear them .	1
I like these earrings and have enjoyed wearing them . The size is just a bit larger than I thought they would be , but not so much that I ca n't wear them . I would recommend these .	1
They are beautiful , just a little smaller than I wanted . But I recommend them as a quality and elegant set of earrings .	1
I love these studs . They look great with gold hoops or just alone . They were actually a bit bigger than I anticipated , which was even better .	1
I got these as a gift for myself , great quality , sturdy , comfortable to wear , I do n't even feel they 're there ! They 're a bit bigger than I expected , maybe next time I 'll go for the smaller thicker ones on offer here at Amazon ( if they go on sale ! hint hint ! ) Even with my long curly hair they show . I 'm very satisfied.Update : More than a year later and these earrings are perfect , I even sleep with them . They get mega abuse and they 're still going strong .	1
Goes to my buccanears . We are having an event that requires a pirate costume . This is going to help me become more authentic . I 've been collecting pieces of my costume a little at a time . These lovely earrings were one of the first items bought and I love them .	1
Wanted a light-weight earring , w/out the separate back slip-on.I can actually sleep in these , w/out any pain ! Bad me , I had worn a cheapie pair of earrings to a family function , and paid for it w/puffy lobes.Great buy !	1
Beautiful packaging , velvet box inside another box and more than I expected . These are sturdy earrings with a beautiful finish . A note - the post for these is a bit larger than average .	1
This was a pity gift to myself because it was my anniversary , and I 've just had nose surgery . Like other reviewers , I was also surprised at the quality of these earrings . I try to look for bargains on Amazon to make my shopping dollars go as far as possible , and these seemed to be a good deal at $ 24.99 when regular price was $ 75 . Just since March 16 , though , both retail and selling prices have changed on Amazon to be $ 34.99 and $ 70 . It 's very true that the posts are a little thicker than normal , but not onerously so ; the result is that the hoop is not going to slide around on your ear , and the post clicks securely into the catch on the other side . The earrings are larger than I expected for the price , which is good , but they are not too big . Nickel size is about right , and they feel as if they have some weight to them .	1
Very impressed with the price and quality of these earrings . Very secure clasp and good weight . Would highly recommendthese and I plan to purchase other sizes .	1
Beautiful , shiny , sturdy and well constructed , and are thicker and look more solid than I expected . I 'm very pleased .	1
I bought these for my wife and it 's the first time I bought jewelry over the Internet . I took a chance because I trust Amazon . I was extremely pleased with what I got and , more importantly , my wife loved them and hardly ever takes them off .	1
The size is perfect and as I like to mix gold and silver they are just right for me . Very attractive . Would recommend	1
Two tone is easy to dress up and down , price point was spot on with the daily deal rate . Would recommend for anyone that likes two tone gold jewelry .	1
Very attracive and casual enough to be worn at all times . I like having both shades of gold to compliment whatever other jewelry I might be wearing .	1
Pros : Very sturdy and well designedCons : I got the yellow and white gold combination for my GF , but the color does n't quite look like the picture . The white gold and yellow gold contrasts are barely visible and can only be seen from real close .	1
Just saw these one day and thought I 'd give them a try . They 've become my 'go to ' earrings for everyday wear . Just the right size . Not too chunky , but substantial .	1
Beautiful pair that I 'd searched for a long time . They are the perfect size that speaks elegance.Only concern is the clasp . I would think a high end pair of earring like this would have more of a safety clasp . That 's a major concern and I may just send back for this reason .	1
Here is a great gift idea and a great value as well . For the price of just under $ 200 , these are 14k yellow and white gold pieces that are stunning in style with a mirror-like finish that is a real eye-catcher . They are of a fair size and look heavier than they are . They are well made and nicely presented in a gift box and a velvet pouch . They are stylish enough to be featured in a 5th Avenue window where they would probably sell for 2 - 3 times the price of admission here . Running out of time for your sweethearts holiday gift ? Just pay a few more bucks for next day delivery and you are all set ! I just do n't see how you can go wrong with this fine set of earrings .	1
These earrings are just beautiful ! I bought these for myself and was pleasantly surprised on the quality of these earrings . Very delicate looking but sturdier than I originally thought . I like classic pieces and this out matched my expectation . They match everything and can be worn to about any event from day to evening . I love my new earrings !	1
I really wanted an ALL Rose Gold look . And this company makes them in all gold and all silver with one side glossy and the other a satin look which would be my first choice , but so far they do not have it in all Rose Gold . I have shoulder length hair and they barely show . I might switch to a dangle shape instead . However they are truly beautiful and rich looking . If I had gobs of money I would definitely keep them ! I have to decide ... .it 's hard to know what to do . I have a ring wth rose gold and would like earrings of same color to match .	1
I bought these earrings as a lightning deal special last November . I 've been very satisfied with them . Size-wise , the external diameter of the earring is pretty much identical to that of a US nickel ( $ .05 ) coin . I laid one of the earrings on top of a nickel coin , and when I lined up the bottom of the earring with the edge of the coin , the fastener wire at the top extended just a bit beyond the edge of the coin - at the open end , not the hinge end.I like the feel of these earrings ; they are n't too heavy to be comfortable to wear , but they are substantial . They present a nice profile from the front.I 've worn them a few times a week for three or four months now , with no problems at all . The fasteners seem to be a little hard to snap shut , but I like that because it means they are not likely to come unfastened accidentally . And they have n't come undone by accident , unlike other hoops with similar closures , which have sometimes been slipped open by contact with a scarf or coat collar.UPDATED on June 30 , 2012 : These earrings are still one of my go-to wardrobe mainstays . I wear them at least three days a week , and they are usually the only earrings I take when traveling . I have no idea if the quality of the earrings being sold now , is different from this pair that I bought two and a half years ago . However , my earrings ( the 14k yellow and white gold version ) are still going strong . The wire fasteners are still working well and the finish is clear and bright . I have n't abused these earrings but I have n't babied them , either . The price of precious metals has gone up since late 2009 when I bought these , and my budget 's rather tight right now . If not for those two facts I 'd be buying the all-yellow-gold version of these earrings in a heartbeat . For now , they are on my wish list .	1
I 've always just stuffed my prescription goggles into whatever plastic case they arrived in but this case is so much better . Definitely adds to the lifespan of my goggles and I do n't have to worry about the goggles getting jostled out of the case in my bag .	1
but totally does what I need it to do . It protects my son 's goggles when he 's not swimming and it protects his regular glasses when he is . It 's a soft case , so sitting on it while it 's loaded is not recommended !	1
Nice case . Well built . I am very happy with it and recommend them it strongly . They provide a great protection and now I always know where my goggles are .	1
They are very comfortable and true to size . I was afraid they would be small fitting and sized up , but this was unnecessary . They was better than other navy leggings I bought at a much higher price .	1
They are the most comfortable . I buy many of these in black . I wear to the gym and under dresses and tops . They are luxurious . AND they last through many many washings and come out like brand new . I could not live without them in my wardrobe .	1
A perfect black , perfect fit , and as comfortable as you could want . I highlhy recomment these pants . I am 5'8 a nd they come down to my mid calf . Cheryl	1
I had ordered these a few years ago , but in xs for the compression fit . They were still extremely comfortable , even though I generally wear a small . I ordered them again but this time in medium , and the fit is a bit loose for me , not a compression fit , but that is as I expected . I wanted these leggings to be loose enough around the waist so I wo n't get a muffin top under tight shirts , and this fit the bill.The color is a deep , pure black . But my other pair faded a bit with much wearing and repeated washings . The fabric looks like cotton , but my favorite part about supplex is that cat hair does n't adhere to it like it does to cotton , so I do n't have to lint roll my legs five times a day ... generally I can just brush them off with my hands and I am good to go.It 's also a breathable fabric that is very comfortable to wear in hot summer months.I also bought the Capizeo black supplex tights , and I far prefer the Danskin . The Danskin have a much better stretch , much better feel , and hold up much better than the Capizeo tights did .	1
I love the fact that I can wear them under clothing and head to the gym in warmth . They help firm my waist and are very comfortable .	1
Great fit , very comfortable . Have ordered an exta pair to travel with . Love danskin and wish it was available in other colors	1
Out of all of my leggings , I seem to like the Danskin the best as they are generous with the material which is good quality and I love them . Great seller and Amazon has the merchandise I want and/or need always !	1
I always buy these and I hope they continue making them . They are just excellent in every way . wash well and I even put them in the dryer	1
This is my second pair , they fit great for sports . They stay in ace when I work out . The material is nice n thick but breathable . They last a really long time too , had my first ones for over five years now n they still look new .	1
These are absolutely wonderful leggings ! I have tried MANY brands and styles of leggings in the past and have never had any as great as these . They are extremely comfortable , have just the right amount of stretch/support ratio , and can be worn by themselves or as undergarments if it is cold . They tend to run a little small ... so order a size larger than you normally would.A+++ Product !	1
For fashion or for dance , working out , etc. , these leggings are hard to beat . Great fit , true to size , comfortable , too . They 're made well and the Supplex fabric is firm enough for a great fit but not overly constricting . They wash well and are worth the additional money compared to the flimsy , lower priced leggings in bargain stores .	1
I 'm a size 12 and these were perfect . Soft thick material holds its shape , yet conforms to your curves . A quality look that goes with a variety of outfits , from casual/athletic to stylish . Length was perfect for my 31 & # 34 ; inseams .	1
These are thin without feeling like they will rip or tear . I really love them . My only complaint is that if you own a PET ? The pet hair is going to stick like CRAZY ! I do n't think that I own pants that collect this much hair ... It is really annoying . Other than that ? Great leggings ... Yep	1
These are n't fashion leggings . The crotch droops down a little low and , while they fit snug on the legs and butt , they are a little loose around the waist and crotch area.They are , however , great for exercise and workout . I wear them when I dance and I have a great range of flexibility . They are also very comfortable and warm ( lycra ) .	1
These are very cute and very comfortable . They fit true to size . They add a few inches to your height . The arch in the middle keeps your feet from getting achy . I think they even help my back when I have to stand for long periods of time . I would highly recommend these !	1
I love these shoes . This is my 3rd pair of these . I have worn 2 pair out . they are so comfortable but also have a great deal of arch support for my high arches	1
I like these . I have a narrow foot and they fit me well . Also I have Plantar Fasciitis so the arch is high enough that they are comfortable to walk in . That was the main reason I bought them . But they are a nice looking shoe also .	1
I like the shoes , a lot . The only issue I have is the top , instep is very snug . It is making my foot sore . I think it will loosen up a little , so for now I am only wearing the shoes part time . I needed these to wear in the house , for some support while I am doing my normal house chores , so I just take them off for a bit , then go back to them later . I hope they loosen up , I really like New Balance shoes , have been purchasing this brand for years .	1
I started wearing this type New Balance slide-on about 10 years ago during a bout of plantar fasciitis . I was advised to a ) wear only New Balance shoes and b ) do n't take even a single step barefoot . For months I wore New Balance running shoes to work and I used these slip-ons as bedroom slippers . Well , eventually my feet felt better and I could wear normal shoes to the office , but I have continued to wear these shoes as my slippers and house shoes and go-get-the-newspaper shoes . Sometimes I also run errands in them . They are versatile , comfortable , and supportive . Because of the little lip at the heel your foot is held in the shoe so they do n't slide off like a lot of clogs . I love these shoes and would n't be without a pair .	1
These are very nice shoes . They are comfortable , look great , and are a great price . I would buy them again .	1
had my first pair of 801 's for about seven years and hope these will last as long as those did . these are my cooking shoes , which i do a lot . hated to get new ones but it had become necessary ! love them so far . i highly recommend the more expensive 801 's over the 400 's that they sell - a world of difference in the support and fabrics used .	1
I have n't decided whether to keep these or exchange them . I ordered wide but these are very snug on my feet . They do n't feel like they are wide , more like medium . If I order the next size up I 'm afraid they will be too long because the length is fine on these . I just wonder if these will stretch some because if they do then they will be ok .	1
I love these sneakers . I need a shoe fast these are great to just slip on in a hurry.They are great .	1
New Balance is one of my favorite walking and workout shoes . I have owned several pairs over the years . This style was equally comfortable . I do n't know if it was only the brown/tan color I ordered or all colors ... but these were very unattractive on the foot . They looked huge ( long ) and clunky . Looked like my foot was about 6 sizes larger than is real . I returned them for that reason .	1
I bought these New Balance mules for around-the-house wear because they slip off easily when I need to go outside to work in the garden , however , they are so comfortable I find myself wearing them for shopping and other social activities as well.They are attractive -- look great with jeans and cutoffs -- and most important , my heel stays in the shoe . They run true to size . I wear a 9 medium and these in that size fit perfectly . I wish I had them in several colors . I may never go back to lace-up shoes again .	1
strap looks durable for kids needs . easy to setup . clear display . Timex - good warranty . ! Timex has a kids loss protection plan for 1 year and offers an extended 4 year warranty too . All in a kids watch !	1
Its has a nice design for boys.. but I do n't know why , this watch will late about 1 or 2 minutes a day.. but the indiglo light is working properly ( compare the lights with other timex watch ) .. or maybe I should change the battery.. I do n't know..	1
I am an adult woman who chose this watch to wear . It has several features that I wanted . The elastic band is far more comfortable than a metal expansion band and is the most comfortable type of band I 've ever worn . The watch is light weight , has numbers big enough for me to read without my putting on my glasses , and the dial lights up with a push of the button . The only thing I do n't like is that the second hands are lizards and do not allow from exact tracking . They seem to be mainly for cuteness .	1
I bought this for my 4-year-old son because he became interested in reading the time . It fits him well with the elastic strap . I like that it 's waterproof so I do n't have to worry about it ending up in the bath somehow . The lizard them on the strap and watch face is very cute ( moving lizards ! ) .	1
when I first bought it I was afraid he would n't like it , since it was n't Iron man , or anything of that sort . But he was so excited that he made me write down the table chart for multiples of fives for the living room so he can reference it and find the time . The watch also is glow in the dark ! which i did n't know . and its waterproof ... .he still has n't taken it off . He said & # 34 ; my daddy has a watch , and now I have a watch . Mine is better though because I have lizards. & # 34 ;	1
This was a great tool for teaching my children how to tell time . Too many kids can only read digital numbers ; you give them an analog watch or clock and they 're lost . I bought this for my five year old son . He learned very quickly how to tell time on it . He wore it 24 hours a day in the pool , sledding , running and playing . The lens got pretty scratched up and the wrist band stretched some , but it was a great watch ... until he lost it . I would strongly recommend this watch for young children .	1
it 's a nice watch for boys around the school age . the two hands with lizards look so funny , just animating.My son likes it so much	1
My son received this for Christmas and we are happy with it so far . I 'm not sure about the long time durability though .	1
I was happy to find an analog watch for my child who is learning to read the clock . This one is holding up well to a young boys wear and tear . He is proud of his watch and tries to be responsible with it .	1
So , yes , I suppose I 'm going through my second childhood ... but , really , I had good reason to order this watch for kids ! ( I 'm 68 ) First of all I like lizards . But beside that fetish , I needed a watch that is COMFORTABLE to wear , easy to get on , wo n't overpower my skinny old wrist and that is inexpensive enough so that if I smash the thing doing barn chores , I wo n't feel any great loss . This little cutie absolutely rates top notch on all counts . I ca n't tell you how many people have complemented my choice ... perhaps they 're also waiting for me to wear my underwear on the outside of my clothes , too ... .but hey ... .if you ca n't be & # 34 ; different & # 34 ; you 're just another old lady who rides horseback . And it keeps perfect time , too !	1
My four year old had just gotten a watch and then my three year old decided he needed to wear a watch also . He loves animals ! This was the best one I saw . It is a fabric wrist band so it was easy to size to his very small wrist . Band is too long for him but I tuck it under and it stays fine that way . Does n't poke or itch him and now he wears it to school like his brother and shows his friends . Of course he ca n't tell time but oh well he feels like a big boy . It lights up when you push in the button , which is the second thing he shows people after he announcing it has lizards on it . Arrived quickly from seller : )	1
My son loves this watch . The band is soft and easily adjustable and the light up feature is really cool !	1
This is the perfect watch ! ! I have been searching for a watch for my 4 year old son and this turned out to be the best we 've found . I saw some other timex watches but I guess they were a junior size , this size is perfect for my son 's tiny wrist , it adjusts perfect and has a lot of length on the wrist so it can fit when he grows up . The first thing we did with this watch was to go to the pool , my son wore it during a whole day of swimming and playing at the pool and it worked perfectly , it even has a light that he loves , the little geckos are cute , I would definitely recomend this watch ... we really love it , and the price is perfect ! !	1
My grandson loved this watch . He loves that it lights up . He wears it to bed and keeps checking the time .	1
I looked at a bunch of teaching watches and this one was more logical to read than most . However the minutes are very difficult to see . They are tiny , and I have pretty good vision . We just opened the gift this weekend and have not used it yet .	1
Bought this for my three year old grandson 's birthday . It is a great teaching watch for children to learn to tell time . The strap fits his little wrist . My grandson is a little young still but it will be a great learning tool for him . Bought another pink one for my niece for her birthday next month .	1
My daughter 's wanted watches and we wanted them to be able to tell time on an analog clock ... .something that most teens and many adults we know do not know how to do . We love these and so do our girls ! ! I bought one for both my daughters for Christmas ( age 6 and 9 ) . Both can tell time with it like champs and I only had to explain how it worked once ! The bands are comfortable and fully adjustable so they fit even my youngest securely ! It is also soft enough that it does n't bother my youngest daughter 's eczema that is always an issue at her wrists : ) My girls are excited still ( 5 months later ) every time they get to tell somebody what time it is : ) Everyone is very happy !	1
I buy two of these every summer because the cloth ( elastic ) straps are way more comfortable than the metal watch I wear in winter . Plus , they are great conversation pieces , and when one of them happens to match my outfit , people are amazed and comment on it .	1
We purchased this watch to help our son learn to tell time . He loves the lizards that double for second hands . The small numbers around the outside are great for helping kids learn minutes , though he is still learning . Great watch for kids !	1
The quality of the jean material was exactly as one expects from Levis . The stonewash is very stonewashed , so if you want a darker jean that will last , order the darker color .	1
This is the 3rd pair of Levi 501 jeans I have purchased from Amazon in the past few months and I absolutely love them . Good fit , good looking , and most of all , Great price . I WILL buy more of them in the future	1
Cool midweight denim jeans good for hot summer days . Fits true to size . Good quality craftmanship . It 's a Levis , baby : )	1
the pants are of excellent quality , very comfortable , I love it . I recommend it and has a good price , good !	1
I have always been a fan of the 501 fit , I wore them exclusively through high school . Funny that does n't even really date me , they are a classic.I was very pleased to see that the styling was slightly updated and this turned out to be an even better pair of jeans than I expected.The one downside I found was the button fly . This did n't bother me soo much when I was younger but now I would much prefer a zipper to dealing with buttons . Perhaps it is because I generally wear a belt now and it is very difficult to do the buttons up without undoing the belt and top button .	1
I used to weigh 230 LBS , so when I was looking to replace my fat pants with something nicer , This was it asnd you ca n't get the 501 's anywhere near the price from the factory .	1
My opinion is that Levi 's is the only jeans that I know how its gon na fit before I buy it . I love it	1
because it is a good one and i like it very much and i will tell everyone about it in here .	1
I have ordered new metal color as I like how it looks and got different jeans , made with black threats instead of orange as it was shown on picture , disappointed , but overall product is great - Levi 's style	1
I am a Levis fan for my whole life . 50 years . these were exactly the style and quality that I expected and will be ordering a whole bunch of other colors . Definitely very pleased . And the price is right .	1
I purchased , what was labeled exactly the same , pair of jeans from another store . Found them $ 20 less here on Amazon so returned to the store and ordered these . My husband said these fit how 501s should fit , the first pair were too wide in the legs . I 'm happy with the lower price , he 's happy with a perfect fit . I will be purchasing one or two more pair in other washes .	1
If you look on the tag on the back of a pair of Levi 's you will see that they started on May 20th 1873 . Luck will keep you going for a few years , but Quality and consistency is what keeps you up and running for over 100 years . Levi 's have been a staple of my wardrobe for almost 40 years and I do n't see that changing any time soon . They fit , feel good , and last for years .	1
These 501 's were exactly what I was seeking for my son , though they can be purchased in W.A . the different washes are not available . I really wanted the 'Rigids ' and they are not here . To find I could buy them on 'Amazon ' but shipping outside of 'US ' was not available , was really OFF ! So many things in the last 4 months are not available for shipping outside the 'US ' . It sometimes takes a long time to find everything and it 's not until one checks out to discover the item-s are not available for shipping.What can I say .	1
My wardrobe is 501 's . I fashion all my accoutrements around them . When I have to dress up I can use black 501 's for the opera or kaki with a white shirt for the office . However I have always chosen my work environment for its fashion taste in stone washed 501 's . Do not tell anyone but I take mine to the cleaners and have them dry-cleaned and pressed ( no starch ) , just crisp and casual at the same time ; it is an old habit from my military days . Come to think of it the military used button fly 's also.I can see the problem of purchasing online vs. store bought is that they use obscure words as `` rigid '' in place of gage ( or oz . ) Not one did they mention the tab color which is Levi 's way of sorting the Mercedes quality version from their Yugo ( lighter weight but still from Levi ) version . And yes they are subject to globalization which in this day and age is a `` no no '' ; and there is no way to tell without looking at the label . Well enough of this negative stuff.An advantage of on line is getting those obscure colors and exact size ( saving a tad in tailoring ) . Also saving gasoline ( sort of an expensive commodity now days ) and time . Not to mention there is some sort of psychological thrill in placing and receiving the order . It is sort of a mini-Christmas .	1
This pants like me . The fabric is very good quality , sturdy , with a cut that fits your body . The product is accurately described by the seller . Very good price-quality ratio . I love it and I recommend it	1
Levi 's 501 Jeans are the best looking and best fitting jeans that can be bought . This particular pair is made of soft material that makes the jeans completely comfortable the first wearing . These jeans are fun to wear and are one of my very favorite jeans . They give me the look I desire . I am completely satisfied like I have been with other Levi 's purchased over the years .	1
My husband love the fit	1
Good	1
excelente la compra de este articulo lo recomiendo para futuras compras llego tal y cual como se esperaba muy responsable	1
Been wearing these jeans for many years . Not my first pair and they perform well . Fit is comfortable and hold up well .	1
Just like my first pair and fits even better . I luv these jeans . They fit just right . Not too tight , not too slim . They have they own sex appeal . They are my new Saturday night hang out pants .	1
How can anyone go wrong with Levi 's 501 's ? They look good on every man and fit all the right places .	1
I have being wearing 501s since I can remember . They are sturdy , last forever and will always be fashionable , well at least thats what I think .	1
I have been a fan of the 501 style since they were in vogue during the 80 's . I say that good taste never goes out of style . For guys this is the equivalent . Of & # 34 ; the little black dress & # 34 ; . Th eseller provided in record time & of course brand new	1
There is just nothing like a Lives Jeans . The color is nice and dark , it has not washed out yet .	1
Just like always , if your from the west coast you know what I mean . Perfect fit as always but , the days of taking them home to wash and shrink them after purchase ( shrink to fit ) is still available But . the thick LEVI denim is a thing of the past . I remember back in late 60 's , early 70 's these pants would stand on there own when you would get them out of the washer they would chaff the hair off your legs all for $ 14.99 , those days are gone . But with Global warming happening there a great pant and there priced right for the times .	1
I 've always had trouble finding my size at any store I 've been to . I ordered these and they fit exactly as expected and were the same color as advertised . I was a bit reluctant to order jeans online but from now on I 'll shop Amazon .	1
What more can be said ... ... .Their Levi 's . You may pay a bit more for them but the quality is excellent ! ! ! You wo n't be sorry when you purchase these pants .	1
Been wearing these jeans for many years . Nice that one thing does n't change . As the old saying goes , better is the enemy of good .	1
I wear Levi 's pretty much everywhere , and have been using the 501 's 34x32 for a while ( now that I 'm a grown up and all ) - Maybe I have to wait until these ones stretch a little , Overall a very good product .	1
Of course Levi is popular in Thailand . This style is very popular as well . The seller had all the sizes and colors .	1
We needed 30-34 Levis for my grandson in Paris . They are NEVER available in stock at stores , and certainly not it the style and color we want . I count on Amazon.com for everything	1
excelente compra excelente jeens muy bien confeccionado original me ahorre mucho a la hora de elegir ropa me vengo directamente por este medio ya que es seguro rapido y economico	1
All my life I ve been a levis user . They fit as they are meant to do and the quality is very good also . Never had any problems	1
got for gift for my god son . hopefully he will enjoy the Levis . he has been bugging me to get him a pair	1
For my and all my friends this it 's the perfect jeans , always bought this brand and this model love it	1
it is a classic jean ! i buy the black color for work , the color is nice for 3 month , it means after 15 washes you notice it starting to fade . but can not complain for that ... nothing is forever ! anyway , the jean is true to size , the canvas is a little rough .	1
Typical of Levi Jeans , these are a bit stiff but after you break them in they will become a favorite piece of your wardrobe . They fit perfectly . Not too big ... not too small . The only thing is that when you use the bathroom , a bit of work needs to be done before relieving yourself . Great purchase . Fair price .	1
These are the only jeans my boyfriend wears . The wash and fit are great and I love the convenience of not having to try to find his size in the store . Great quality jeans at an affordable price .	1
Same problem , different type of stone wash ! The main problem is hip and thigh room . I 'm wondering if they save money by using less mat'l -- making Levi 's tighter , or ... is it today 's fashion trends dictating their behavior ? Dunno ! What I know is that my legs used to feel good in 501 's now ... they feel cramped ! Had to go to 550 's ( relaxed fit ) -- w/only drawback is zipper fly v buttons . But they now feel good w/same waist & length ! Dunno	1
While much of the negative commentary concerned Levi Strauss 's move away from domestic manufacturing has focused on the button-fly 501s , the bigger problem I have seen is with the old 1970 's standby , the 505 , which has a zipper as opposed to button fly . The variability on sizing and sew quality with the 505s is an issue if you are going to buy them online or mail order . You really have to try them on to see how they fit . The 501 are much easier to buy online or by mail order because the sizing is much less critical on the waist , which is the so-called `` anti-fit '' waist , meaning there is no curve to the rise ( the distance between the crotch and the top of the waist ) , because the original 501s were merely cut down bib overalls which were made to hang , rather than be fitted to the waist . The biggest problem I have noted on the 505 's is the variability in size in the thigh area , meaning that some fit baggy and some seem rather tight , even though they are theoretically the same size of a label . Since the 501s are more forgiving as far as sizing , if you are buying online you might consider them instead of 505s , unless you do n't want the button fly .	1
This is the second pair of 501s i bought over amazon . The sizing is consistent and I am highly satisfied with the jeans .	1
I ordered these in Tidal Blue and they are great . The awesome 501 fit and a nice rich blue color that wo n't fade too quickly . **update**Washed , these shrunk up a little shorter than the light denim 501 's my husband has . I will probably order him another pair in a longer length , but with the same waist size . ( ie . I ordered a 32x30 and for this item he will need a 32x32 ) .	1
My husband loves these pants . He says that unlike other jeans , including even other Levi 's he has purchased before , these pants fit is perfect . He has always liked the fit of Levi 's jeans better than any other brand . In my particular opinion , Levi 's jeans always look very nice on him , and better than any other brand of jeans do .	1
These are hard to wear mostly because they have that moose knuckle effect that gets unwanted attention when Im shopping at Walmart .	1
These jeans are the basic cut from Levis : they are strong , a tad stiff for a few days , but durable and a great combo of style and comfort .	1
Bought them for my husband and ge 's very satisfied with the fit . That 's good enough for me ! If he likes them that 's what counts .	1
Love the quality of levis jeans and its very comfortable ! They are also of great value compared to the retail stores .	1
I have always used 501s as my go to jeans.ITs not excessively priced and fits right and has awesome quality.will buy again in a few months of a different color	1
Love the jeans . The brown has hues of green . Will match with blues and greens on top of browns . Great jeans .	1
These jeans work for my teenage son . He wears them often and walks with an extra pep in his step when he 's rockin them .	1
My husband could not find Levi 's in his size and length anywhere . These fit him perfectly . I ordered the dark blue denim and they are great . We will never drive to 5 stores looking for sizes that only exist online again .	1
This jean levis has a very particular cut , making it very nice , very comfortable , cool , and the brand is one of the most sought after in the market.excellent article , I have just what I expected , thanks	1
When I was a teen , Levi 's 501s were my go-to jeans . It took me 25 years to realize the wisdom of my youth.A lot of niche brands have come and gone , but they are more expensive , lower quality , and fad-based . Skinny jeans ? Ornate pocket designs ? Bell-bottoms ? Have at it . These 501s never go out of style and they last a long time.The waist runs a little big , but fits to size after the first wash .	1
I love the classic Levi 's style and 5 pocket design . The jeans fit as expected and are always comfortable and in style .	1
gracias muchas gracias por el servicio de primera calidad estoy muy agradecido por todo es excelente los recomiendo y una vez mas gracias	1
Amazon always delivered for me . Product as describes , quality as detailed and delivery on time . What else can you want ?	1
These jeans are quite comfortable and well made . Not quite as substantial as my old 501 's from the days of old , but that seems to be the way of denim these days . I 've only washed them three times so far but , so far , they did not shrink nearly as much as I thought they would , especially in the length .	1
Well , these are definitely better than the 505 's I bought a few months ago , but they 're still not the Levi 's jeans of a few years ago . Compared to the 505 's , these actually sit at the waist and are sized correctly . The 501 's also use a heavier denim than the 505 's , 550 's , etc . The button fly was not my first choice , but this way I do n't have to deal with the cheap zipper used in the current 505 's . Did I mention that Levi 's are not the same quality product they were just a few short years ago ? The biggest difference between these 501 's and the legacy 501 's ( and all other styles of Levi 's jeans ) is the missing belt loops . There used to be 2 additional loops in the back , between the center loop and the 2 side loops . Somehow they just do n't feel right without those other 2 loops .	1
I bought these for my husband , who is a 31-year-old with an athletic build . They fit well , look modern and are versatile - can dress them up or down . The color is nice . My only warning is that you must wash these jeans before sitting anywhere in them - they left quite a stain on one of our suede chairs - I still have to try to get that out . We bought another pair because he liked them so much . The really great price sold us .	1
I liked the color of the jeans and they fit great . I bought several pair and the fit was generally consistent .	1
They are really nice Levis my grandson loves them he was so sharp when he wore these jeans that night to a party they looked very nice on him nice fit I have to get him some more in a different color	1
In the late 60 's and early 70 's all I wore were Levi's.I quit buying Levi 's jeans for over thirty years due to their unreliable fit and construction . I chose to try them again recently and found they had addressed the issue 's that caused me to leave them as a brand . All of my jeans are once again Levi 's products .	1
probably the coolest pair of jeans I have bought . i love the color the fit and the style and as always Levi 's delivers	1
The materials and workmanship is top notch . The button fly is very comfortable . The fit is perfect . It 's a Levi 's , you can expect only the best .	1
Very nice jeans , i could not ask more from Levi 's , they fit as expected , I never had any problems with quality and size , so I recommend to all who wants good jeans ...	1
These jeans are not what they used to be however if you get the Levi 's made in Mexico , then they are fine . These jeans arrived in an acceptable amount of time and were well packaged . The color is kinda of light blue and match well with darker color shirts . I recommend them	1
These jeans fit well , launder well and just continue to be a favorite . What more could you want or expect !	1
The traditional 501 has always been a favorite of mine.The jeans I received are identical to previous 501 's except for one thing : The & # 34 ; rise & # 34 ; , the distance betwen the crotch and the upper edge of the pants , is smaller than it has always been , by about 1/2 inch . It may seem as a small difference , but I noticed it right away , and then confirmed by taking a tape measure to my old 501 's and this one.This may not matter to some people , but it makes a difference to me .	1
Not much to say . I 've been using this kind of jeans since i was a teenager and i am never going to change them . Comfy , nice and good quality .	1
levis original el mejor de todos los pantalones , comodo , duras & iexcl ; dero y lo mejor viste muy bien no los cambio por nada	1
These jeans are just right . They have never changed over the years . These are very comfortable as well as durable for hard work .	1
My understanding is that sizing is more reliable in the 501 style jeans than the 505 or other zipflys so with that I ordered a pair of these . I have muscular 24 '' round thighs and my normal waist size is a 31 , but ordering up to the 34 was helpful in giving me a bit more thigh room . The fabric feels durable and the material the patch is made out of does seem to be like cardboard , but that 's okay in my book .	1
These jeans fit verywell and are tight In all the right places and give just enough to not rub anywhere or ever be uncomfortable . Need a pair of nice white Jeans for an event these are priced right and fit very well .	1
My son finds it hard to find size 29 jeans , so these worked great . But , they are slightly tight in the leg - especially at the knee area .	1
bought these for my son who is tall & thin . They fit him perfect . He is one that is difficult to buy pants for so I thank you for having something . These are PERFECT for him	1
Love them ! He looks great and is very pleased -and he 's a tough crowd ! What else , they 're 501 's right ? Of course they rock .	1
I buy Levi 's for a reason . The fit , the quality and how they look on my husband . When you can wear a pair of jeans for 10 years and they are still quality enough to donate to a charity , that says a lot for the brand .	1
They fit well and they look good , but the fabric is not as substantial or durable as it was when I bought my first few pairs of 501s back in the 70s & # 8212 ; and I know because I still have my favorite old pair of jeans from back then and they 're denser and heavier than the current version . Still , Levi 's makes a decent pair of jeans . But the price is high and I do n't think the quality supports it .	1
I expect the same as what I bought 30 years back , and it is real close , other than a bit more costly than during my college years . I have tried other brands ( Wrangler , LLBean ) , and have not been happy .	1
My husband is a Levi fan , and these are great fitting for a guy with muscley . Definitely not Dad jeans ! These black jeans can be dressed up or down , and the legs are wide enough to wear with boots .	1
Saludos amigos , Aun no me a llego en producto , en lo que lo tenga en mis manos los califico correctamente .	1
I 've been using Levi 's since the 70s my youth years , and even today they still my favorite jean 's , many kinds of jeans on the market today , and a few trying to imitate the famous Levi 's jeans , ! ! ! my opinion if is not a Levi 's jean i do not want it in my closet that simple , love them all not only the 501..	1
I bought a pair of 501 's from Amazon and they feel a little lighter than my last two pairs I bought right off the shelf at SEARS almost a year ago . That 's about it . I 'm happy with my purchase . But ! I usually buy 505 's , but with the great variables in sizing I wont buy that style without trying them on first . Consistency is lost more or less , except with the 501 's . The 501 style at least is going to fit the same way each time , no matter if they are made in Egypt or Mexico , Brazil or wherever they originate from . I always bought my jeans at Sears , but when you buy Levi 501 's and see Egypt on the tags , well there 's outsourcing and then there is outsourcing . Unbelievable , but get used to it . Its here to stay . Homemade will never be homemade ever again , at least for some products that is .	1
I 've been wearing Levi , 501 shrink to fit for 40 years , . I like the way they fit and the way they wear . I 've always brought the regular blue color so I thought I 'd like to try all the many other colors they offer . I think that once I get them hemmed I will really enjoy wearing them .	1
Most everything I buy from Amazon is very good . The jeans fit very well . They are a good buy .	1
Quality product and well stitched . also the Jeans arrived on time . highly recommend this purchase . price is comparably good and reasonable .	1
Although I have n't really put these jeans through the & # 34 ; Ringer & # 34 ; yet , they fit great . I 'm between a 34 & 35 Waist and it 's just nice to be able to have a comfortable pair of jeans . I know it would n't hurt if I lost 10Lbs either but until I do these are very nice . Wish some of the other colors had this size in stock .	1
It is perfect . It fits me great .	1
perfect !	1
Of course it 's nice when things change for the better and just as sweet when the small close to perfect things in life remain unchanged by time . This is the case with these Levi 's 501 jeans.For decades my favorite jeans of all time . Countless designers and brands have tried to tap into the 501 's iconic popularity but at the end of the day have always failed to do so.These are exactly how I remember them : * Heavy Denim* Re-enforced flawless stitching on all pockets , hems , waist line and inner leg . * Solid brass rivets on pockets* The classic brass rivet button flyOrdered in white these arrived quickly , wrapped in plastic with tags of authenticity . The fit and feel is marvelous and the price is sensational . Macy 's and other stores sell 501 's for twice this amount . The slim fit is n't constrictive nor are they pre-washed so expect a few washings before they feel like a second skin.Highest Recommendation !	1
These are a classic pair of button-fly jeans , with deep blue coloring that fads just at the right time in the right places . What can you say more about a tried-and-true classic like Levi 's 501 ?	1
its a classic , it fits great , and looks amazing ... . cant really complain about any thing levi is always is one of the best jeans out there	1
There are actually two ways jeans fit , below the waist ( by that I mean about an inch below your belly button ) known as low rise and regular fit . The low rise are good if you are thin with a narrow behind . Levi 's 501 are regular fit and straight leg . They tend to run about an inch too long , so if you inseam is 34 get 32 to 33 . The main reason I like button fly is due to the fact nothing gets got in the zipper ! I paid about $ 10.00 less than at local department stores . Good job , excellent jeans .	1
AS MOST OF LEVIS JEANS THIS IS ONE WITH A NICE COLOUR AND HAS A VERY GOOD APPEARANCE . IT FITS ME VERY NICE .	1
I have been wearing 501 's since the '60 's ; same size , same exact fit . They last forever , are always pretty much stain proof and wear proof ! Wash them once a week and wear them for three or four days and they stay fresh , cool , comfortable and stylish .	1
No complains from my father-in-law . Fits him as expected . Easy to order . Delivered on time .	1
Product came to my door , quickly and in great shape . Since I live in Europe , most of the time , the price was exceptional , and the fact that I never have shop for them , makes Amazon the place to go .	1
I wear a 36 in all my other jeans , but these are a little big . Other than that they look and feel great .	1
I mostly wear Levi 's 501 Shrink-to-Fit jeans nowadays and have for years , but I purchased a pair of pre-shrunk 501 's because I liked the wash . The color/wash I purchased was called `` Aged Perfect '' , which looked like an indigo jean worn for about a year in the pictures . The actual color/wash was close this time , but it looked more contrived then in the pictures . This is fairly typical and it was n't that far off , this time , but it would have been better if it did n't look like someone had accidentally left a belt sander on them.Another reason I purchased them was because this particular color/wash offered a heavy fabric weight of 12.5 ounces , which does n't compare to Levi 's of the past , but is heavier then many offered today . This is the same fabric weight offered for most shrink-to-fit models , but even though I knew it would seem less heavy due to all the distressing and washing , I 'm still amazed by how much lighter they seem compared to my STF 's , even after my STF 's are well worn and have no starch left in them . And yet , they 're still heavier then most colors/washes of pre-washed 501 's , and better too , in my opinion.The fit is quite good , although they seem a little roomier then in the past . Unfortunately , I 'm so used to buying my STF size that I forgot the sizing is different with pre-washed 501 's . This is n't a problem for the waist , but unlike washed STF 's , the inseam is about 2 '' too long . This is n't a huge deal , because I like the idea of having them tailored to fit better , anyway.Overall , I 'm mostly pleased with them , but I still prefer STF 's and probably wo n't be buying another pair of these anytime soon .	1
Purchased as a gift . The pant size was perfect ( thanks to the sizing chart ) . The color did not display well on the computer . Graphite was neither black nor gray , more of a washed/faded black . Had I known this , I would have chosen a different color .	1
Hm ... I just wrote a review , but I 'm being prompted to write another . Oh well , my headline says it all . My only disappointment is that these jeans jumped $ 10 since I ordered them previously ( a few months ago ) . I do n't know who to blame for that , but I 'm still very happy with my jeans . I recommend them highly .	1
For some reason these jeans ran smaller than my other 501 's . I could barely button these jeans.I was n't a fan of the wash either , it 's a lighter blue than I expected . It was the blue color of the jeans you see the cowboys wear . I ended up returning them .	1
They are Levi 501 's , there 's no reason to have or want other jeans . Perfect fit and a perfect look .	1
I bought these as a Xmas gift for my husband . He 's happy with the fit and I 'm happy with the look . My only complaint is that I think they are over priced .	1
I have tried all types of jeans throughout my years but always go back to 501 's . I like the fit , the button fly ca n't break like a zipper and they have a classic look . One of the things that is different from the ones I wore 30 years ago is all of the colors available now and what seems to me like different types of cotton for each color . Some seem more like a woven cotton and some like a knit . And the more like a knit that they are the more they stretch out when you wear them . You can wash and dry them and they fit fine but after an hour of wear , ( sit down stand up bend and kneel ) the butt is all baggy and stretched out and the legs as well but I guess this is the case with most jeans . When you wear a belt with them , the belt seems to ride up and cause a weird situation where it is above the waistline of the jeans and into your boxers . This is made worse with thin belts . I think a couple of more belt loops would help with this.. I never liked the big brown & # 34 ; leather ? & # 34 ; size tag on the back either . It always looked like something that should be ripped off after purchase but of course it is not meant to be and is stitched on tight . I can live with that and as for the stretching out , I will by a size smaller next time .	1
Ca n't go wrong with any Jeans which has the Levi 's brand on them.Fair price , and perfect fit . I like these 501 's .	1
My husband has worn Levi 's 501 jeans for many years . His measurements have n't changed and neither has the size he has always worn . They still fit perfectly .	1
I get smiled at , winked at , flowers thrown at , phone numbers handed to me , cookies baked for me ... ..etc . These jeans are the original true and classic pimp jeans .	1
Levi 's 501s , how can you go wrong ? These are great : fit , color , quality , etc . My favorites . And I really like ordering online . What a convenience . Also online there are many more color and size options to choose from .	1
High quality , good fit , no loose seams or lint . The color allows it to be used both in everyday life as well as working with a shirt and dockers .	1
Levi 501s have the best cut for my body type and rarely do I have an issue . These are great jeans and the color is neutral enough to go with most shirts . Hope they wear a long time !	1
levi 's 501 , great jean fit as expected nice color , good quality , looks great . The fabric is soft , but thick and strong , should last a long time . Fits great . i like this jean : ) )	1
Got these for my husband . They look great on him . He really likes that they do not have that destressed look but they look stylish .	1
I love 501 jeans , they fit just right in all the right places and I prefer button fly to zipper . Note that the polished black is a bit different than the usual black jean ( there is a plain black 501 as well ) . The polished finish produces a shiny , more finished jean look which means that wrinkles are sharper and more noticeable -- the fabric is stiffer than the plain black jean . If that happens , the tried and true technique of spraying the jeans lightly with water , wearing them or giving them a quick press will help.The stiffness of the fabric is part of the clean and neat appearance but unlike other 501s this also seems to reduce the & # 34 ; give & # 34 ; in the fabric and makes the fit tighter and slightly uncomfortable at first -- hoping this will work itself out after a few washes .	1
I 've worn 501s for a very long time and they seem to be getting harder to find . Especially in my size . It seems I 'm shrinking back to my old waist size ( yay ! ) so I ordered a couple pair at that size and a couple pair 2 inches fatter . The fatter ones do n't fit and it was easy to return them to amazon . - NOTE : I made sure that amazon was the seller ! -To sum it up , these were some new pants to replace some worn out ones . Nothing exciting there other than it was really easy to click some buttons and get exactly what I was expecting . Perfect .	1
These jeans fit perfect . The color , stitching , denim , and fit of these jeans is really nice . They do n't come with a zipper but a button .	1
which were very good , excellent size and quality , it is hard for me to buy pants for my size , I measure 6.1. but this marks the size is correct . the only thing I did not like was the hem of the pants , it was a little different than I usually see .	1
I have been buying these jean for years . Excellent Pant I love It Jean Levis 33 x 32 very nice	1
Perfects	1
I 'm not going to educate anyone about the genuine and authentic timeless classic that is the Levi 501 Jean.Nor do I want to listen to the whining about them not being the same quality as they were 20 years ago . Maybe they are n't or maybe they are , but these are what 's available today and they remain a stone cold classic blue jean.What I really like about ordering them on Amazon is the many choices of colors in the sizes I need at a more then fair price . Ca n't be beat .	1
And my expectations in line , it 's a pity that the pants on the right side have obvious flaws , seems to be the cause of the fabric , I do n't know why	1
I think so much money this thing value & # 65281 ; The right size ! Reliable quality ! It 's very important that we find the right size & # 12290 ;	1
I 've tried 501 before in Levi 's store so I knew my size,33x30 fits me perfectly except the legs are a little too long.However , the pants I bought in AMAZON is really suitable , and the legs ' lenghth is right , it 's surprise me ! I 'm 5'6 161lb , and 33x30 is my right size , I wish this will be helpful for you too choose your size : )	1
I was delighted with this watch when it came . The black dial is very good looking and easy to read . Adjusting the wrist band was more complicated than I had hoped for but I was able to do so with some help . I would have given this watch a 5-star review but it stopped working after two days . I hope it only needs a battery because I love the watch and do n't want to return it . 2/15 A new battery worked for a few days than stopped . I reluctantly returned for a refund .	1
I needed an inexpensive watch to wear when in business attire and I normally have terrible issues with watches because my wrists are so small . However , this watch is absolutely wonderful . The band has an adjusting clasp that moves smoothly down the band . There are little grooves for the clasp to grasp ( did n't mean to rhyme ) so it does n't slide if too much pressure is put on it . The actual clasps are intertwined so double the protect . You do not need to worry about catching it on something and the watch falling off without noticing . In general , the design is simple but elegant . THe black face with the small white cystals make it very sytlish . I 'm extremely please with this product .	1
This was supposed to be my everyday watch , but i wear it when i go out . it is a just beautiful and the band does not pull my hair . it is a very good buy . This was the first time that i buy a Skagen product and I do n't regret it .	1
Very nice watch . I get complements on it all the time . I paid about ~69 with prime shipping and am very pleased . ( Fulfilled by Amazon at the time . ) The band is smooth , no hair pulling . Very sturdy . Titanium is a wonder metal . If you break this watch your arm is probably gone too . I 'm pretty rough on watches and this one is holding up well.The band system is the best . Fully adjustable across the whole length and any excess stays put hidden beneath the other half and is not noticed by look or feel . Very secure latch that took me a bit to get used to but was mainly caused by tight tolerance in manufacture . Looser now from use and perfect.Slim sharp and tough . Very nice watch .	1
This is one of the best watches that I have ever bought . Here are some of the reasons why I could give 100 stars to this watch:1 ) Very durable and stylish looking2 ) Got tons of complements from both girls and guys . Girls say they loved it.3 ) I have a hairy arm , so I was very glad that it does not pull on my hair.4 ) The blue plate inside the watch looks very shiny and new for a long time.5 ) The glass does not scratch at all . I had this watch for over a year and it still seems to not have a single scratch on it6 ) Very comfortable and light as a feather . I am a guy who hates big , clunky watches that seem to weight don on my wrist . Not going to happen with this watch.7 ) The time hands , as well as intervals glow in dark.8 ) It is very accurate . I never had any problems with it being late.9 ) The metal mesh band is very subtle and good looking . After a year , the color ( black ) fades a bit , but not to the point where it is noticeable by people around you . If you look at it closely , you will see the difference.10 ) It is affordable and I promise you that if you are giving it as a gift , the person will LOVE it and love you for getting it : ) I could go on forever , but I think that was enough reason that will prove to you that this is a watch worth getting .	1
I have seen these watches for years and loved how skinny they were . I bought because I love blue and love the thinness of the watch . It works great . The clasp takes a little work setting up , but once you do it is very easy to use as you do n't have to adjust it every time you use it .	1
Title says it all . ( This is the third Skagen I 've purchased . I like the small , light design . ) Also , some reviews of these watches say that the clasp tends to undo itself too easily , but I think that the current version of the watch has corrected that problem.Good : Keeps time well , comfortable , looks great as a dress watch *** BUT I SUGGEST THAT YOU ONLY WEAR IT WITH A DARK SUIT ***Bad : I 've had it for a while , and mainly use it as a dress watch , and I have had nothing to complain about so far . In terms of color coordinating , its dark band and face means that is not as versatile a dress watch as the silver Skagen , so if you are have one watch , then stick with silver .	1
The watch itself is great . It 's very nice looking , the band is very cool and the whole thing is super light and thin . There are only two issues I have with it : First , the clasp is not very easy to use . Second , the hands do n't glow in the dark.There is also no second hand , which makes it kind of hard to tell if it 's working , but I do n't really mind not having one.All in all , I would recommend this watch for someone that needs a basic but classy watch that does n't get in the way of clothing or gloves .	1
I have had other Skagen watches and really like them . Over the years I have tried other brands , but keep coming back to Skagen . These are the thinnest and lightest weight watches I have ever seen or owned . Plus , with so many styles there is a large selection . These watches are not costly , so you could pick up a couple . Try one of these watches and you may be glad you did .	1
The watch is very attractive . I do like the fact that it is so thin . However , after receiving it I have found that I prefere a solid blue face as compared to this more modern style of the blue appearing differently depending on how the light happens to be hitting it . This is personal taste , I just found that for me I do n't particularly care for it . It is a very beautiful watch and extremely light on the wrist , so even though I found I do n't personally care for the style after receiving it I still gave it five stars . I will be giving it to a friend for a holiday gift .	1
I like to buy watches for gifts , they are a great gift.This watch , is great , easy to read , keeps great time.No complaints from anyone that I bought themfor presents.They love this watch !	1
The watch is very beautiful and shiny . I love it so much . Never regret buying it.Love Skagen my favorite new brand .	1
The watch is really stylish . I wear it for casual-dressy ocassions and get compliments on it often.At the beginning I could not adjust the band ( one size fits many ) to fit my wrist and have it lock into place properly . Therefore I could not close the clasp when I put it on my wrist . I took it to a local jeweler to adjust properly ( only charged $ 5 ) . If you have difficulty also do n't force it . Take it to a jeweler - you 'll be happy you did.And then , the clasp mechanism itself is a bit complex - putting the watch on and taking it off is a bit tricky - it takes patience and some getting used to . After wearing it a dozen times I have n't quite mastered it .	1
I 've bought several for myself , the wife and the kids over the years . None have ever failed . Lots of styles to choose from . The watches are thin and the titanium bands are light , making for a comfortable fit and wear all around . Prices are very reasonable for what you get .	1
First of all , this is my first skagen purchase . I came across this watch at my local macy 's and looking at the $ 135 price tag I was hesitant and thankfully I was . I came on amazon and found one for 68 dollars , it was such a steal . Now just to get it out of the way , if you are wondering wether to buy this watch or not , you should absolutely . You will not be dissapointed . The price of this watch seems to fluctuate a lot on amazon so never be imaptient and buy it if it 's over 80 dollars , just wait it out and check regularly because I am pretty sure you will find one within 68-79 dollars.Now on to the watch . I 'll break it down so it 's easy for you guys to understand everythingDial - The dial is a dark blue but , when it 's exposed to light , it 's reflection looks gorgeous and will capture people 's attention without a doubt.Glass - The glass of the watch is very thick and scratch resistant . It also reflects off light and is very shiny and clear . When you see smudges just take a nice piece of cloth and wipe it once or twice and for sure it will look brand new again.Strap - Most buyers of this product complain about how hard is it to make the strap the right size for them . Honestly , it took me 1 minute to figure out how to do it . The instruction manual shows it very clearly , all you have to do is take a screwdiver or any other object that fits in the hole . Just enter the object and push it backwards and the clasp will open . Once it opens just move it back or forward depending on what size you need and just press it down tightly and that 's it your done.Strap ( look ) - The look of the strap is my favorite thing about the watch . The material is very thick and metallic . It is very shiny and reflects off light like the rest of the watch . The reflection of the light on the strap gives the watch the elegant look and people for sure will know right away that it 's an expensive watch.Comfort - The watch is very light . When left on sometimes you might forget that you even have a watch on , however since it is summer now I did come across one thing that irritated me . I like wearing the watch a little tight and when your in a warm environment your arm will sweat and make the strap feel a little sticky and make it itchy , but then again 90 % of all watch straps will make you feel the same way so it 's not a huge deal . Overall , it is very comfortable , light and great for everyday use.Overall GradesPerformance - 10Durability - 10Looks - 10Comfort - 9	1
I have had a Skagen 800 series watch that I liked very much . The only way to replace the band when the black starts to turn silver is to send it back to Skagen in Texas for replacement . That costs $ 32 and includes anything else you want done , like changing the battery . I really love the watch and felt is was worth it . However , I felt so naked without it , and they said it takes 2-3 weeks to return , that I bought another one.The diameter of this watch is smaller , it is very thin and perfect for slender wrists like mine . I love the band . You adjust it once and it stays that size forever , looks great and does n't absorb perspiration like leather . The color is rich and reflective and goes with everything . If you like a thin watch , rather than the big bulky ones that are so popular now , this is for you .	1
It is so thinny ! I love it because I can wear it with my formal clothes , and it looks so fancy . This is a MUST !	1
This is the thinnest watch I have seen . The face and styling are beautiful . I have had a problem with the outer clasp staying shut . It opens several times a day . That is the only reason for 4 stars .	1
You wo n't find a better watch for the money . I do n't think there IS a better watch . This is the most comfortable , reliable , long-wearing , easily adjustable watch I have ever owned . I have a $ 900 Movado that I never wear because the clasp always comes loose . Besides , I 'm so happy with my Titanium Skagen I never want to wear anything else . The Skagen mesh bands are the most comfortable thing in the world against your skin.My only negative remark is do n't buy the black . I had that one before and the black coloring wore off where the band meets the watchface , and it looked shabby . This watch I have now is all Titanium , nothing to rub off .	1
The Skagen 233LTTN men 's watch is good-looking and so thin that you barely notice it under a dress shirt cuff . The band is easy to adjust and of course it keeps great time . I bought one of the & # 34 ; in & # 34 ; big , clunky watches and had to give it up because it was just too uncomfortable to wear under a shirt and suit jacket . The Skagen is a dream - as comfortable as the old Universal-Geneve I used to own and just as handsome . This is a great watch !	1
The Skagen Mens 233LTTN is the watch I have been looking for , for almost 6 months . Until it arrived two days ago , I still did n't know if the reviews were spot on , they were ! . I had read all the reviews about how light , thin , and sharp the watch was . I also read about the closing latch , which did n't mean to much to me for I have used this kind of latch before.When the watch arrived , it was exactly what I had been looking for , absolutely thrilled . The watch is as sharp and stylish as any I 've seen , it 's clean , sleek design , which fits neatly under your shirt , along with the beautiful blue dial is nothing less than stunning to say the least . For those of you who have been contemplating this watch , if you can still find one , get it asap . The closing latch is nothing to concern yourself with at all . It 's something you get used to very quickly , and believe me it 's well worth it . This was everything I had been looking for and then some , very pleased .	1
I am so hard on watches and this watch has made it through it all . I LOVE my Skagen and probably will never buy another brand of watch.My particular one is fairly water resistant , I 've splashed water in and near it , and even put my hand into the turtle tank once when I had to get the turtle out when the lightbulb got wet , exploding sharp glass all over . I did n't have a moment to take off the watch , so in it went . It came out fine . I do not usually immerse this watch although I do n't take it off to wash my hands or scrub dishes before they go into the dishwasher . I would n't immerse it often though.In 5 years of ownership , I wore this watch almost every day for the first 4 . Then I bought 2 more Skagen watches to expand my `` wardrobe . '' That should tell you something right there . Here 's my analysis : Pros : *Many Skagens have this mesh bracelet . It is WONDERFUL and I ca n't say enough about it . Hypoallergenic , breathable like no other band . I 'm allergic to everything , my skin is so acidic it will literally eat the chrome finish off of things . Not so with this watch , since it 's surgical stainless steel . *In 4 years , I have had to replace the battery once . Great battery life . *Attractive , gets comments . *Flashy flat glass gets attention and if you ca n't read , just tilt to angle and it works great . *Love the sparkly little crystals . *Matching brushed silver face . *Easily adjustable band . Takes a small screwdriver to pry up the clamping clasp . Easy . *Good locking safety clasp . If the catch gets loose , just give it a little pressure from pliers and it becomes tight again . *Super low profile . Sits close to your wrist which helps out on the first `` con '' Cons : *All Skagens have low-quality glass . It does chip , scratch , etc . I 'm very hard on watches so it 's definitely taken some abuse . It still looks good though -- that was the only thing that made it lose a star . I wish Skagen had a more expensive line with real sapphire crystals , I 'd be willing to pay more . They are WORTH IT . *No second-hand .	1
I have some very expensive watches but they just are not comfortable to wear or they are too small and hard to see . This watch is every bit as nice as my $ 300 watches and looks nearly as nice as some of my way more expensive watches . It 's not the thinnest watch I have , but it is quite thin and very comfortable to wear . It 's easy to adjust and to put on , all by yourself . It 's nice enough to wear as a dressy watch , but being stainless , it should be sturdy enough to wear every day . Mine is new so I do n't have any long term experience with it , though I 've read a lot of good things about this manufacture . I 'm very please with my purchase , even though it did take a long while to get it , nearly a month because of backorder.UPDATE : I 've been wearing this watch 24/7 for weeks now . It is in perfect condition , not a scratch on it . I wear it in the shower , bathing the baby , sleeping , dressing ; it 's comfortable , does n't catch on everything , keeps good time and is really nice looking . I get a lot of nice comments on the watch . It was a good buy.UPUPDATE : It 's now nearly a year that I 've been wearing this watch 24/7 and not a nic or scratch . I ca n't believe the price now . I 'm tempted to buy a bunch for gifts . People think this watch costs me hundreds of dollars . It is a GREAT buy .	1
Great Watch . Easy to read . Comfortable band . Keeps perfect time . Great looking . Love it . Very glad I bought this watch .	1
I saw it for twice the price in an upscale store . Beautiful face with crystals . Very comfortable and does not catch tiny hairs . Very thin and stylish . Great quality and look .	1
Beautiful watch : band , face with its crystals , shape of face -- easy to read.A bit hard to figure out the clasp . I had to go to a watch shop because the instruction manual that comes with the watch was written in tiny print , readable only by a mouse.Once I figured it out , it 's easy .	1
Pros : It 's gorgeous . Silver face and silver mesh band goes with anything . Looks much more expensive than it is . Beautiful , sparkly round diamond-like chips for the numbers . Lays flat against the wrist - not bulky and very comfortable . Easily adjustable band . Keeps good time.Cons : No deal-breakers here , just things you might want to know ~ Not waterproof so you ca n't wear it in the shower . I have long hair and every once in a while it will catch in the mesh band . And no date display , if that 's important to you .	1
This is n't my everyday watch , but it is the watch that I wear when I meet friends for lunch or go out for a day of shopping . I 've owned it for over 3 years and like it a lot . The features I love is its low profile , silver tone mesh band , the relatively large numbers on its face , and the fact that I still have the original battery in it and it keeps good time . My only complaint is the latch that fastens it took a little time to get used to , but I got used to it quickly.This watch goes with everything because it is both sporty but also works in a more formal environment . I own a similar one in a gold finish that is used with gold jewelry.I 've received a lot of compliments on this watch . People seem to like the fact that it is thin and compact looking .	1
I 'll break this product review into bullet points : Pros : classic timepeice , water proof- seriously water proof , keeps accurate time , beautiful swarovski crystals , high grade stainless steel , inexpensive , made in Europe ! ! Cons : None to report as of yet- I have been wearing this watch for a solid 6 months- all is well !	1
Bought this for my mom . It 's smaller then I expected but it very classy . Comes in a nice package . Overall , solid watch for the money .	1
This is a beautiful , elegant watch and I paid a low price for it . I 've had it for over 2 years and still have n't needed to replace the battery . It has a very slim design and it 's very light . I get compliments on it all the time .	1
Just received the watch recently and it 's just gorgeous . Really very beautiful . I do wish it had a second hand but I knew it did n't when I bought it . Another reviewer mentioned that the closed clasp when you wear it does n't form a circle around your wrist . It 's true , it 's kind of square-ish where the clasp is and at first it bothered me but it does n't anymore . I ca n't see it unless I turn my wrist over and it does n't feel weird or anything . Just a minor thing anyway . The watch is not too small , not too big and is thin and sleek . I get compliments on it . I love it !	1
I purchased this watch about 3 weeks ago at a major chain membership store ( for about forty bucks under retail ) . I LOVE it . The watch is very thin and does not get caught on sleeves or other clothing . I have received about ten compliments on it in the short time I have owned it . The face of the watch is a `` brushed stainless '' look and the band is both brushed and polished steel . The dial markers are tiny tiny crystals ( but do not look tacky in the slightest ) . This is a very simple design for people who like the basics . The watch has a very nice quality and I think will hold up for a long time . The only thing I wish it had was a date indicator-but overall , this watch is a beautiful piece .	1
I love this watch ! ! It is so sharp and elegant . The slim design is great , as is the price ! You will not be disappointed .	1
These socks are so comfy , great quality soft and they fit as expected , I wear them to work a lot .	1
These knee-high hose are quite comfortable . They are quite silky and a bit longer than other brands , which is nice . If one had a large calf , the & # 34 ; one size & # 34 ; might too snug , however .	1
I loved the color and fit . It 's perfect for wearing to work when I do n't want to wear full on panty hose .	1
I do not wear knee highs very often but when I do I wear Hanes Silk Reflections Knee Highs . They are very durable and feel silky on my legs which I love . They look good and stay in place all day long . Hanes Silk Reflections Hosiery are my favorite and I have been wearing them for 15 years , so when I do buy knee highs I did not have to think of which brand I would buy .	1
I 've been wearing this brand since the late sixties , so they were perfect as usual . I especially love this brand because they do n't run .	1
These had a great color that matched skin tone and fit as expected . I would recommend this product . Exactly as expected	1
I bought them for work pants , the look and fit well , as I expected . Comfortable too , right height and stretch material good too .	1
Nice color and reinforced toes makes them more durable . They are not to strong in the heel area . I do have callous free heels and I was surprised they did not wear as nicely as the rest of the hose .	1
I love wearing dress shoes , but hate the foot funk that comes with wearing them barefoot , and the ugly that comes with wearing them with trouser socks . These are the perfect alternative .	1
Most torsolettes do not hold me up properly , this one did wonderfully . I am a 34F and it gave me great lift and shape . Nice bonus of smoothing out your waist as well . It is a bit tight fitting and digs in a little at the top of the back however because it holds me so well I do n't mind . I will just need to tone up me back more .	1
It 's ok for the price , but I found the cups to be a bit big . Otherwise , it is nice and long so you do n't get a weird line where it ends .	1
I am really happy with this purchase . I bought this to wear with my wedding dress that is strapless and want to feel supported and sucked in for my big day.I normally wear a size 34DD bra so that is what I ordered here.The 34DD fits me perfectly.ADVICE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE ISSUES WITH FITTING : I used to work in lingerie and know that about 80 % of women wear their bras in the wrong size . If you feel like you fluctuate in sizes you really dont , you are just wearing the wrong size ! I suggest that you go to your local department store and have a lady trained in lingerie just measure you so that you know and you beat the issue . Some brands run a bit different but in that case its the brand , not your measurements . I wear a solid 34DD but can wear a 36D ( in some bras ) or a 32DDD ( in some bras ) However the only bras that work for me are my correct size . Take the guess work out if you plan to order online.-The fit is tight like it is supposed to be . It flattens and smooths my stomach and gives me that perfect hour glass shape I wanted and needed.- It is sexy and stylish with removable garters I will tack on later and hook up to some thigh highs when I take my wedding dress off ... it is hot enough that I can wear it like lingerie . form , function , and sexy- cant beat it ! -the back is low which is nice for dresses that plunge.. fits under my dress discreetly-good support and I know Im not going to pop outThe things I didnt like were the price , which is a bit steep I believe but I wont dock it because I could have opted for something cheaper and more crappily made ! I have no regrets ! The other thing is I wish that the front came down just a bit farther . I have a short torso but still found that I wanted it a tad longer so I wasnt worried about any stomach getting smashed out the bottom.I am 5'6 & # 34 ; and weigh 140lbs 34DD bra.There are also two settings for hooks and mine was attached on the looser of the two ( I am hoping that by my wedding in 5 months I can cinch it to the tighter clasps- fingers crossed ! ) I was really worried that it wasnt going to be as tight as I wanted but it truly does the trick ! Very happy !	1
This is adorable and fits perfectly ! I can not wait until I wear it on my wedding day . Sucks me in pretty well too .	1
This is pretty and fit ok except for the bust area . I followed advice from others about ordering down a size . I am usually a 34c . I ordered a 32b . I should have ordered a 32c . The cups were too small . I returned it and I am thinking about reordering in a different size . Fast shipping .	1
Here 's what I wanted and got : Slimming torsoEasy to put onFlatters in every dress I tried on with itAppropriate push up for my boobsI normally wear a 34E but I got tired of the cups covering my entire boob which made them look like C 's . I wanted a slimmimg push up effect but not too much because I am already endowed . This does it ! Cons : There is a tiny bit of boob that drops under the underwire . Not at all a big deal for me because it 's not uncomfortable and it 's unnoticeable when Iwear tighter fitting dresses .	1
This fits really well , definitely puts the girls out front ! Well made and to size except order one cup smaller .	1
For years I have used an old shaving kit to carry my toiletries when I travel . I finally broke down and bought this hanging bag -- - what a difference ! Now I can see everything I brought and no more searching for what I want . This bag seems to be well made -- - especially for the price .	1
It 's a bit leg for a small or overly packed suit case , but WoW sure holds everything needed ... plenty of compartments -- hold lots of things & in place !	1
I purchased this to use as extra storage for our small bathroom . It hangs on the back of the door and is used for my cosmetics . The zippers are a bit stiff , but other than that , it seems fine for my needs .	1
this hanging travel bag for cosmetics and other stuff is very useful . I ca n't believe I have never thought of buying this before . It keeps everything organized and in one place for easy access . It is sturdy and the pockets are good sizes for products . it is also waterproof which is great .	1
I bought this for my honey moon cruise . This is perfect to store all of your toiletries for a couple of days so that you dont have to fumble through your suitcase everyday !	1
This is a great product . There is room for all your overnight items and plenty of sections to organize them in . It saved so much room on my last trip and it was so easy to hang up on the door while on vacation and find what I needed without digging through a bag .	1
The plastic compartments are more sturdy than I expected with thicker see thru plastic . The compartment sizes are perfecto ! ! ! This bag has big , medium , and small compartments and hold any travel sized or regular sized toilettres . Meaning its not a rip off ! Alot of these bags marketing 87 pockets or 100 pockets have tiny little compartments that barely hold a finger nail polish or lip stick . This bag suits the needs of a real traveler and you dont have but you can buy travel sized tolilettres . Its zippered on each compartment row , so you dont have to worry about things falling out or becoming disarray . It also has a velcro snap so that you can fold the bag and keep it closed . It also has a hanger . Perfecto ! ! I will actually buy another one of these while they are available and at this price .	1
I got this for vacation and it served me very well . I pack as lightly as possible , but there are things you ca n't do without.I like that you can hang it in the closet .	1
Love , love , love this cosmetic bag ! I ca n't say enough positive things about this bag . It works perfect for my needs . I have always found it frustrating digging through bags trying to find the bottle I need . This solves that problem being able to where everything is at a glance . The smaller pockets at the top fit things like band-aids , chap stick , and nail clippers while the middle sized ones are the perfect size for travel sized sample bottles . The larger pockets at the bottom are perfect for several larger 12 oz bottles such as sunblock and hairspray . The bag then folds in half to lay flat fitting perfect in a carry on .	1
Love this travel bag ! It keeps me organized and hangs perfectly on a hotel room bathroom door . Folds up and keeps my make up safe when I travel .	1
Wanted something compact that would hold all of my toiletries in one place without having to unpack them at my destination . This holds everything compactly and easy to hang and use daily	1
my daughter love this hanging cosmetic grooming travel bag she rec it in time for a vacation trip . it was good for all her makeup	1
This is a huge help in our small RV bathroom . Everything organized and at our fingertips ! It hangs nice and flat on the bathroom door ! Love it , worth every penny and so reasonable .	1
This cosmetic bag is much bigger than I expected , with lots and lots of pockets and compartments . More than enough room for all your travel items ! Love it !	1
It has compartments for everything I need to take on a vacation . The spaces are of different sizes covered by plastic .	1
I recently used this for a week 's stay in Waikiki and it turned out to be very useful . So far it is holding up really well . The only thing that bugs me is that when & # 34 ; closed & # 34 ; it seems flimsy . Other than that , it 's great !	1
I bought this for an upcoming trip thinking it will save me the hassle of bringing lots of little bags . Seems like it will do the trick . Ordered using prime and came in 2 days . Well packaged .	1
This organizer works well for us . We traveled frequently in the last year and we enjoy all of the many pockets . Small items fit in the upper 4 pockets . Slightly larger items in the next three . We put our toothbrushes and toothpaste in the next compartment ; and the larger items in the bottom two pockets ( his and hers ) . Upon arrival at our hotel , we just hang it in the bathroom and have access to all our toiletries .	1
I ordered these for my fiancee and he took to these immediately and has worn the heck out of them since they arrived .	1
Bought these for my son and he loves them . True to size . Would highly recommend . Great price for Sperry Topsider .	1
These fit perfectly and were just as described . Sperrys are such a classic shoe and no problems with shipment . Would recommend for future purchases .	1
My husband has wide feet and while these are a lighter color than I would normally buy for him , the style was great and they did n't make his feet look wide . He wore them yesterday for the first time and reported back to me that they were pretty comfortable for the first day .	1
Not much to say , fit great and great looking casual boat shoe . Have know done a bit of sailing in them and they work great either on deck or around town .	1
I bought these shoes for a friend and he loves them . They are very good quality and have held up well . This color choice is very nice also .	1
They are very comfortable & I am sure I will enjoy them . This website is one of a very few where I can find two extra wide shoes .	1
My husband has a wide foot so I ordered him a wide in this shoe but the regulars must run a little wide because the wide was a little too wide . He cinched them up tight with the laces and they work fine . They 're very comfortable , match with anything and look really nice . He wears them everywhere and they still look brand new . Will definitely be buying another pair when these wear out .	1
Beautiful mens shoe . I ordered these for my husband as an everyday I love you gift and they went over very well ! He loves them and has pretty much worn them daily since . They are a beautiful rich brown color that go great with everything . He says they are comfortable and likes the style . I like the three hole lace for him better that the other styles that only have two because he wears a size 11 it really helps break up the long look of the shoe . Some of them just look silly in the front and make a mens foot look like a long bill . These are much younger looking than the original style , but are still classy ! Great purchase and I know he will have them for a very long time .	1
Sperry produces a quality shoe in the Billfish . Husband has ordered them for years and is always satisfied with the fit , quality , and comfort .	1
I wear these boat shoes in place of sneakers . They are comfortable , easy to slip on , and look good . Very satisfied .	1
Got these for my boyfriend and he loves them . He said they fit well and he loves the style and color . They look just like they are shown in the picture . I am definitely happy with this purchase .	1
Just what he wanted and fit as expected . Very nice shoe , with top quality and what you would expect from Sperry	1
This is my 5th pair of Billfish . They remain simply the best boat shoes you can buy . Fit is perfect , the look is good , traction on wet surfaces exactly what you want .	1
The shoes looked good . And they are a little heavier than I thought . The shoes are same as the picture showed .	1
This is not a heavy duty suspender like the description says . They 're a good light weight suspender that stretches good which makes them comfortable . I like these for small , light wight jobs that do n't need a heavy tool belt or just for your pants if you do n't wear a belt .	1
These are neat looking suspenders . I bought them for my husband , and he had not worn them very much . Today , the snaps came apart , and they are no good any more . Hope you have better luck with yours . First pair of suspenders I 've ever seen do that.Update : I wrote the above because I was unhappy when they broke . However , they replaced them immediately and the new pair seem to be fine . I love the design ! ! ! !	1
I bought these because a landscaper working for me has a crack issue . These things work great ! are heavy duty and look and feel substantial . Well worth the money .	1
Purchased these for my husband and he is still using these suspenders a year later . They are very sturdy however they will tear into your t shirts .	1
They fit great ( except for the fact that my husband has funny pinky toes , and they almost stick out at the sides . ) They are great for the river ! They are wonderful summer hiking shoes ! And over all , I think they will last forever !	1
Hiked and swam all over Maui with these on . A little clunky in the water , but better than kicking a rock . Had some issues with pebbles getting into them at certain beaches , but not anything that was too much of an issue . I LOVE them and bought my Dad a pair for Father 's day .	1
I convinced my husband to replace some old leather Keen sandals that he had worn for years with these Newport style Keens . He seems to like them very much .	1
All other sandals will be obsolete once you own Keens Newports . Fits like a shoe , as comfortable as it gets . Extremely toughand durable . Keen products are simply outstanding .	1
I 've tried other Keen sandals but I 've gone back to the tried and true original Newports in leather . Pure comfort from the moment you put them on your feet . Great for walking and hiking ... .in or out of water . I can wear them all day and my feet stay happy . I prefer the men 's size 8 to the women 's 9.5 for the wider and deeper toe box . A great sandal that lasts , making it worth the money .	1
These are very comfortable and the leather makes them a bit more dressy than my standard seat belt material Keen sandals .	1
Once I got over the ugliness of these sandals ( I had a pair of Keen Bike shoes so I knew how good they were ) and let myself wear them , I was very happy I did.I have been entrusting my back and knees to MBT 's for the past 4 years or so ( MBT Women 's Kisumu Sandal , I realized that over time these were causing more pain to the sacral pain and sacral dysfunction I have . I have had several pair of MBT shoes and at $ 200+ a pair , it has been difficult to give up on them and realize that they cause more pain for me these days in my lower back . I needed a change of pace.I have to say that some of the arch and insole features that other people mention ( like the ridge that hits behind the toes ) have been no problem for me and have actually helped . In order to avoid the potential `` smell '' that some people have complained of , I bought2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz.to use beforehand to try to avoid any bacterial build-up that might contribute to any unwanted odors.After researching and researching some more , I discovered that people with back or foot problems like me ( Morton 's Neuroma ) and lumbar/sacral and knee problems just need solid shoes with a good arch and a wide enough toebox . Odd as they look at first , I found myself quickly amenable to them when I realized that they were actually supporting my knees and back and I could climb multiple steps of stairs and make my way around without a lot of pain ... that was pretty fantastic to me . Just one thing about me , I have MS , so the walking I do is usually a little stiffer and more prone to pain . If I can discover and adjunct shoe like Keen to make it a bit easier , I am a happy camper.5 Stars for Keen.Also , since I 've read they can get a little ripe and smelly , I decided to pick up a bottle of Tom's2 Toms Stink-Free Deodorizer Spray - 8 oz..I worn them for about a week , comfy right out the box . Recommend them !	1
This is a very comfortable sandal . Perfect for the summer . It 's a little pricey but I can understand why . If you have to go through the airport , it 's easy to take off and put back on when you go through the security checkpoint .	1
I got a pair of Neport sandals this spring and have been using them for 2-3 months now . I could n't make up my mind if I should buy these or the `` Newport H2 '' model . The difference seems to be that the H2 is using some `` water friendlier '' material than leather for the outer layer and the H2 have 100 % rubber sole while the Newport have some leather upper layer on the sole that makes it more comfortable.I chose the Newport because I thought I was going to use them occasionally for 'street use ' but if I could make the choice again I would probably select the H2 because apparently I see to use them only for hiking . The leather layer does not even come in contact with your feel anyway so I 'm not really sure what 's the point.These sandals are great ! Here 's what I like about them : \* super comfortable . You can wear them all day and never feel the need to take them off . * Hold your feet very well . I have n't tried super difficult trails but I have tried dry trails , creeks , boulders , you name it . They just wo n't quit . * Sole has very good grip . They do not slip and slide even when wet . * toe protection is great* nice reflective stripes on front and back* it takes a second to wear them or take them offThey are not perfect though : * they take a longer to dry when they get soaking wet then I would have expected* they are a bit on the heavy side . I was surprised when I first lifted them out of the box . But you get used to this* the price you pay for the good hold and grip is I guess some less air . When it 's really hot outside , your feet will get a bit warm . These are no flip flops ... Note that I had to pick up size 9 . I normally wear 8 or 8.5 max .	1
These shoes were an excellent fit so true to sizing chart . These shoes are $ 249 dollars in NZ and i managed to purchase for $ 148.00 . My husband was pleased with my choice . Thankyou	1
These were the original Keen sandals and the first pair of Keens I ever bought . I think the Keen line has surpassed this sandal now.1 ) Looks . Copied by a dozen other copy cats now , but they were the originals ! They had this funky look to them , which was basically a shoe with a lot of holes cut into it and gave it a very tough look , a very macho sandal . Quite stylish and still very striking , only time will tell if this look has legs.2 ) Design . A very good design and a very good idea : leather sandals with a very thick and strong sole . Nice drawstrings instead of laces or velcro.3 ) Comfort and function . This is where I think the new Keens surpass this one most . I wore this casually for the longest time and I was the first to be surprised when I found them tiring for long hikes . A supportive hiking shoe was what they were advertised for , right ? But I found the sole to be unforgiving ( not enough support ) and the leather sandal too heavy . I 've never worn them for hikes since then . Other complaints I 've heard around the web include : hard to dry out when wet , should not really be used as an aquasock ; and things like sand , cone needles and other things get in them when walking in the woods and beaches.So to summarize , this was a great new design , but I think best to be worn casually . Looks > > function for this first Keen , but I still like them very much . My Newports are over 2 years old now ( or more ) , but they are still in very good shape .	1
Holding up well , and very comfortable on the feet . This is my second pair of these , the last ones held up for two years and considering the abuse they get I think that 's pretty good .	1
Got them for a friend and he loves them . These are are replacement pair ... .he loved the first pair so much , he wore them out in two years of nearly daily use .	1
Got this as a gift for my husband and we both love them.he does n't usually wear sandals , but he 's been wearing these every chance he get .	1
This is one of the most comfortable shoes or sandal I have ever owned . I first saw these on some ultralight backpackers I met in 2005 , and they swore by them for comfort and strong enough to climb rough terrain . For a sandal , that just blew me away . I confess I have not used them to backpack , but I have used them on rough terrain and they are outstanding and amazingly `` grippy '' . It has little nubs on the carbon outer sole that dig into or grip everything.SIZING : I have read that most people find that they need to buy a half size larger than they do with other shoes , and that was my experience as well.COMFORT : Tremendous arch support . The sandal has a wide toebox so that your toes are not cramped together , and the protective toe guard is great . I never stub a toe or catch a toe on anything with these , plus I can hide my ugly toes . It also has a little rise on the rear heel that cups your heel comfortably , but helps protect you against those people that step on the back of your foot in line . The sandal feels very secure once it is on and does not slip . There are no straps to fool with or Velcro to adjust , it has an inner lining that looks like the neoprene on a scuba suit , it stretches to fit . The rear strap does not hurt your foot . It has a no lace closure and you set it once , from then on it slips on easy . The footbed cradles my foot like no shoe I have ever seen . There is a little ridge on the inner sole that runs behind the toes and then in between your big toe and other toes , it turns out to add to the comfort of the shoe immensely . That ridge forms in a short time to your foot , giving you your own custom fit . With these shoes I find i can stand longer and walk longer.GRIP AND TRACTION : It has an anatomical outer sole that is very grippy , with a nice athletic shape , it gives good traction on sand , rock , mud , you name it . It is not slippery on wet surfaces like the dock , and the sole does not leave any marks on floors . The tread does not hold dirt in any grooves to track indoors . It is great for water use , and can be completely submerged with no damage . If it gets wet , the material that wicks the water away fast.ODOR : It has an anti-microbial treatment that takes away any germs , I do not know how long that treatment lasts though . They do not get sweaty or smelly like my Crocs do.DURABILITY : I got my money 's worth out of them for sure . When my H2 's get dirty , I throw them in the sink , under the hose , or even in the washer and they come out like new . I wore these almost daily for 4 months straight with no evidence of wear . It has now been 4 years and I still use them more than any other shoe in the summer . I hope they are still made as durable as they were when I bought mine . This includes vacation , in which I am standing in line all day at theme parks and scrambling at the beach . These come in many colors . For a dressier sandal I also like the brown Dunham Moose Fisherman ( actually designed by New Balance ) . These sandals were good enough to get me to buy two tennis shoes from the same company in the last 4 years , an in-town shoe called Austin and an ugly hiker called the Targhee II . In the end , I just ca n't say enough about these shoes , I highly recommend .	1
I highly recommend these . When I bought mine ( 2009 ) I was working around houses , climbing onto roofs , and wanted exactly what these looked like : durable , sturdy , secure hold/fit on the foot , toe-cap for ladders , roofing , bushes , etc . Yet , they 're surprising light-weight material . I 've had other shoes come apart on me , but not these . These are work horses and have protected my feet extremely well . They look comfy , and feel even better . Very good foot support , immediately comfortable with no break-in required , and have not given out or lost the shape or supporting quality ; I weigh 260-ish lbs and am on my feet all day with no problems , and the sole has not compressed that I can tell . They are still like-new although looking a wee-bit worn and faded.I wear this pair 90 % of the time unless I want a dressier sandal . They wash easily and you can let them dry or not , whatever : they dry on your feet in summer . I love them so much for fit and comfort that I bought the closed-shoe style they make for office & winter use , and just ordered my second pair of sandals in another color . I ordered another pair to be dressier , but I have no reason to replace the first pair . They are ingeniously designed and made , and I love them .	1
My husband has purchased these same sandals probably about 4 or 5 times . Obviously he likes them ! Like a lot of sandals they do get stinky after a while and he probably buys a new pair every 2-3 seasons .	1
well i got one about ten years ago a 9.5m so i got that again and it seems toosmall i have exchanges for a 10 and now i am fat and happyalso i tried this color combo and i am not gay enough to make it shinei think in ten years or so i will go back to basic blackall in all great shoe	1
Let me preface this by saying that I 've had my pair of these Keens for ten years . Ten . I bought them in the Navy in 2004 and I 've been everywhere with them . Islands in Italy . Germany . Boating . Hiking . Biking . Painting . Kicking . You get the drift.They are still in my closet ready for another summer of abuse . I absolutely LOVE them . If you buy any pair of sandals , you 're wasting your money . These are the real deal . I wish I could show you them , but they 're shy . : - ) Still comfortable . Still durable . Still awesome . Buy and you 'll rack up the experiences.Peace and good journeys .	1
Everyone loves Keens , got these for my hubby for fathers day , unfortunately these seem to run a bit narrow so we had to return them . He wears normal sizes ( not wide ) .	1
perfect sandal , my second pair would purchase again , another color would be nice , I love the compfort of this sandal.Keen is the best	1
These fit well ; are comfortable and look great . My husband is wearing them around the house for major projects ! Not the exact intent for a pair of sandals . He just built a fenced in chain link fence in the back yard wearing these ! He is also doing concrete work with these on ! Silly , I know but that is him : he grabs whatever pair of shoes and cares not what they are when he is working So they have dust and dirt on them but the soles are so heavy duty that he is wearing them for these tasks ! Got a great deal on them . I am sure they will clean up well . He is very hard on shoes ; apparently you can use these for remodeling projects they are so heavy duty ! Would buy him these again !	1
I have worn Keen sandals in the past and the first pair I owned was for hiking and kayaking in the Western States . They are very durable and comfortable in most every situation . I purchased this pair to have a `` dress '' pair of sandals that could be worn to outdoor get togethers in the heat of the summer . The lining for your foot is very comfortable and the leather and construction seem to be top notch . You spend more for these on the front end but will have years of enjoyment in wearing them .	1
These are the original high quality Keen Sandals . Heavy gauge sole , strong construction , compressible foot bed for comfort . After being to the store yesterday where they have a display of new Keen sandals I was appalled at how poorly constructed the new version is ... the plastic is akin to the stuff they use on flip flops , the upper construction enters the shoe a full 1/4 from the edge , overall a cheap shadow of these shoes . Hopefully Keen will not go the way of so many other shoe companies and cheapen their shoes to the point of undesirability . You may want to consider an extra pair if you hope to find them again in the future .	1
Excellent product . I bought these socks for me and my boyfriend and we have only good things to say about them . Keep our feet really warm . They are quite thick and fit well in our wellies or trekking shoes . We will buy some more .	1
So , I bought these for women 's for me and the men 's for my husband . We both have noticed that they shrink . If are like me and do n't like tight socks around the toes tips then go up one size because these do string alittle .	1
Roast beef was getting waaayyyyy too cold in the winter time , so I had to upgrade to a higher caliber sock . These are comfy and do n't get too stinky after a long day in my boots .	1
My son wanted these warm socks to wear while shoveling snow . They came in the mail very quickly , are just as described and he loved them .	1
The smart wool socks are very easy to wash and dry , they have a great fit and are so easy on the feet . We all wear them and enjoy the quality the most .	1
My husband and I only buy this brand of sock . They last , stay up , wick , do n't shrink , and are super comfy . The medium hiker is my husband 's all-time favorite for any shoe -- - not just hiking .	1
I 've had dozens of these . They are great for hiking ( as the name implies ) , but I also wear them for X-C skiing , walking the dogs , and around the house . They are very comfortable and decently warm . If it 's a harsh winter , I 'll throw on a polypropelyne sock liner underneath . I find that after about a year , they start to wear a bit and the fabric starts to get weaker , which can lead to holes.This led me to experiment with Darn Tough socks , which have a lifetime guarantee . I came to the conclusion that Darn Tough makes better low cut athletic socks ( similar to the Smartwool Phd running/cycling socks ) , but that Smartwool still wins in the crew length/hiking sock category . They 're just the best out there as far as comfort is concerned .	1
These socks fit nicely and feel great on the foot . They also are warm and as far as I can tell thus far do a decent job of moisture wicking , making for a good hiking/running experience .	1
A warm sock , but not so heavy that you can not wear it indoors as well . I love wearing these in cold weather with boots because it keeps my feet warmer when outside , but not too heavy so that they are sweating when I head indoors . It also makes the shoe or boot you are wearing more comfortable . Lounging around in just socks inside is also more comfortable , almost like wearing a slipper .	1
Nice wool socks , I bought a pair for both my sons who like sports in the winter , and they insist on wool for socks . Good seller , I received it promptly .	1
I have a pair of SmartWool hiking socks that are over ten years old and they are still one of the best pairs of socks in the drawer . I 'm going on a trip to Europe and Colorado and will be doing a LOT of walking so I bought five more pairs . When you think of how well these socks are made and how long they can last the price is worth it . You ca n't go wrong with these socks .	1
I learned about SmartWool socks at least 10 years ago , and have been pleased by their fit , cushioning and especially wicking qualities ever since . They also wear well , and I may even have some of the first ones I bought , I wear them all year , in hiking boots and sneakers , except when I wear sandals in warm weather .	1
Smart wool hiking socks are awesome best socks I 've ever bought they were so comfortable I love them and yes I will buy more and I would recommend this family or friends .	1
These feel like walking on pillows . I really love these socks . If you are getting excited about socks , you know you made a good purchase .	1
These socks are amazing , the medium weight is perfect for shoes and boots , my feet are finally warm in these Minnesota winters .	1
Good top quality mid weight wool hiking sock . I love the weight of these socks for winter wear as well as a hiking sock . Not itchy or hot . Highly recommend .	1
These Smartwool trekking socks are great for everyday winter wear in the cold weather . I wear them around the house and they keep my feet warm and if I need to throw on some boots and take my dog for a walk or run out , they keep my feet warm in the outdoor weather . They are cushioned but not so much that you ca n't wear them with regular sneakers . Smartwool socks are the best I have found for winter socks to keep my feet warm . My only recommendation is to make sure you get the right sized socks because if they are too tight , even a little too tight , it will reduce circulation which creates cold feet . I would recommend these to anyone looking for a warm winter sock .	1
I have very poor circulation in my feet , so they are cold all the time ( really bad in the winter ) . I got some of these to wear around the house to keep my toes from going numb . They are really comfy , and they keep my feet warm : ) I also use them when I hunt , and they work great . They do n't make my feet feel wet if I sweat in them , and they are comfy all day.They are holding up really well too , I have had them over a year ( 3 pairs ) , and they still look/feel like new socks	1
Every type of Smartwool sock that I have purchased has been great . They are true to size and do not shrink . They last and last too !	1
Smartwool is the best there is . great quality , a little pricy but worth every penny , delivered quick .	1
There 's nothing like wool socks to keep your dogs warm . Many 's been a time in my youth that my dogs 'd be whimpering from the cold on extended hikes and camping trips because I thought my cotton tube socks would be enough . Even when I had wool socks , I would n't wear them because they would be about as flexible and easy to put on as a wooden box and I would n't walk 50 yards before the # $ $ % ! things would be working themselves into a wad down by my toes . Boy am I glad things have changed , because these Smartwool socks have fixed all that.Toasty but flexy , designed and knit to hug your foot , cushion-y as all get out , and with the ability to resist stink and odor that 's almost disturbing , these things rock . It is indeed a strange place I 've come to when I feel enthusiastic about a twenty-buck pair of socks , but here I am . If they were any cheaper , I 'd buy a dozen . Strike that - I 'd buy thirty . Yea , I 've become an avowed partisan and I 'm wearing them as I speak . These are great socks.They are a wool blend , allowing for flexibility and a design that hugs your feet . The trade off from substituting some wool for stretchiness and longevity is well worth it , and Smartwool seems to have nailed the proper ratio of synthetic-to-wool fibers . The length is good which , on mine , allow them to travel well nigh half way up my calf . Which is where they stay , stubbornly , whether I am climbing up a trail or tramping down . They have stretchy , rather thin , panels that run along the side of the foot . At first I thought this would make my foot cold there , but it serves to better fit the sock to the foot . While very well cushioned on the sole , they are not terribly bulky overall . In fact , they are very un-bulky for this kind of sock , in my opinion , for they put the material where it counts : on the sole and heel , around the toes , and around the leg . The top of the foot gets some , and sides get the least . This design works surprisingly well and if you like the way they keep your feet warm , you will LOVE the way they feel on your feet once you start walking , for mile after mile after mile.It 's a small thing , but these also keep the odor away . I 've worn socks that I have wanted to burn after a day 's hike . ( My wife actually did throw them away after our return to civilization ) It 's not like you can wear these for a year without taking them off , but they do reek significantly less than any other socks I 've had . They are gifted.Oh , and there 's one last thing . On the inside of the sock at the very top band are the words 'FEELS GOOD ' weaved into the fabric . Like the sock is sending subliminal messages to your feet . When I saw it I felt the same way I did when I heard words while playing Beatles ' Abbey Road backwards . What a trip . Just adds to the appeal of the sock , really.Could they be any better ? I 'd always be a fan of putting a smidgen extra wool in there , as I like heavier socks . I can always double up , though , and these are the best I 've found . Very recommended if you walk , hike , or trek in the cold , whether in the city , country , or mountains .	1
I have decided that I would rather buy two pairs of fantastic socks for my up coming hiking trip . These Trekking socks are great . They are cushioned on the bottom and they are holding up to all the abuse I can throw at them . They even stay up while hiking , though I roll them down to my boots .	1
Very well made bag with strong seams and really robust zippers . Drains well . I have 40 pounds in it , and would be comfortable adding more .	1
I have n't really used this bag yet other than for storage of our OTS masks . Not a main dive bag , but good quality construction as you would expect from an Akona product , so I expect that it will stand up to wear and tear .	1
Excellent bag for your weights . The handles go all the way around the bag , making this a very strong and excellent quality bag . I have presently stored 30 pounds of soft weights in it without any problems . Great product ! !	1
I looked for a month to find a new carry-on sized , lightweight travel bag that has a 'back-slip ' to slip onto the handle of a roll-aboard . This bag fills the bill ... except for one thing . The zipper on the bag is not lockable . In fact , it 's zipper pulls/tabs are rather flimsy , so linking the two pulls with a small cable lock wo n't work very well to deter the casual thief . [ What I 'm looking for it not Fort Knox ... it 's a fabric bag . I 'd just like a little bit of deterrence to keep people 's hands off the contents of the bag.For me . the main competitor to this bag as a shoulder carry on is the heavier Eagle Creek Adventure duffel ( a new model ) ... the EC bag is also considerably more expensive . EC kind of screwed up the design ( and wasted valueable end-pocket and pouch potential ) with expansion zips on the bag 's ends . In other words , EC took a perfectly good bag and diminished its utility with its new 'expansion ' capability . ) EC 's heavier and clunkier expansion design and price were deal breakers compared to the lighter , nicely designed , and less expensive Akona duffel . But the EC bag has lockable zippers . Akona , please take note : Put a lockable zipper on this bag and square off with Eagle Creek for the world 's best shoulder , carry-on bag .	1
These are incredibly comfortable . I love weari g them out and about or around the house . The pockets are nice as well .	1
love the fit . it arrived quickly , well packaged , undamaged . material of very good quality . sits at waste for short waisted person which i am . will be ordering another . it is a stretchy knit which feels like woven . love it .	1
I like these shorts . They are perfect because they are n't too short and wash really well . My only complaint is that the pockets are super bulky . They made the pockets too big I think because they bunch up . Other that that , I like them .	1
Fits great , is comfortable for yoga , can be worn casually , is not too short , and has pockets ! What more can you ask for ?	1
Already have the long pair and loved so much that ordered the shorts for summer . Nice and soft material . The pockets are great for phone and keys . 5'3 & # 34 ; and 120 lbs , the medium fit great , not too big ( do not like tight fitting ) .	1
Wish they came in more colors . Fit great , wash up nicely and are very comfortable . Quality material and as expected from Danskin .	1
These fit perfectly , just the right length , good quality fabric ... just what I needed and wanted . Thankfully , Amazon come through again .	1
So comfortable , great fit , perfect pockets , and I plan to order more pairs . They are great for hanging out around the house , and I also wear them for light exercise - like a tap dancing class I 'm taking . Flattering , too .	1
I have been looking for knit shorts for awhile and am glad I found these . They fit beautifully and wash up well ( I do n't put them in the dryer ) . I definitely will buy more of these shorts .	1
Fits beautifully - I would like to have same in navy and tan but can not find , even at Danskin . Too bad ! I have had dozens of compliments on these shorts , and I feel so well dressed in them . Only navy I can find have front zipper , which is not flattering .	1
These shorts are super comfortable : not too thick or too thin . I wanted something a little more modest to exercise in . The length on me ( an average height woman ) is exactly as pictured , slightly above the knee . However , they still look like women 's shorts , which is what I was going for . Also , these do not ride up as I walk or hike like some shorts I 've had in the past . I 'm considering purchasing another pair for when these are in the wash .	1
After searching around and doing a little research , I found out when Camp Dry changed the packaging they made the new fabric protector with a Blue top . This is the same formula as my favorite of all time the RED Top ... It is the best ( I have tried them all ) waterproofer for anything that is fabric , it is also to my knowledge the only one approved for re waterproofing your Gore Tex jackets.Almost all waterproof fabrics will lose the coating through washing and getting wet , so you can do two things with this product : Waterproof something that is not very waterproof ( Flannel shirt , cotton , fleece hat , cotton gloves , ) OR add more Waterproof to something ( Jacket , Tent , Unbrella , Shoes , ) The OLD BLACK top cans are now Green they are best for Boots and heavier stuff like canvasKiwi Camp Dry , Heavy Duty Water Repellent , 12ozI hope you find this helpful , comment with any questions ...	1
Much better than the other Waterproof spray I bought.NO Odor ! , keeps garments dry.I use it on my Carthartt Jacket and it works perfectly. Got ta buy more .	1
I spray this in my gloves , hats , coats , jackets and suede boots . It works very well and I highly recommend you use this product on your clothing so that they do n't get soaking wet during rain / snow storms .	1
I use this product to protect my backpack and rain jacket on my short commute to work on my bicycle . Keeps me and my gear dry . And does n't discolored fabric like other products I have tried .	1
I bought this Thermasilk for backcountry camping . It is really nice on the skin and dries super fast . The only problem is that the velcro on my sleeping bag caused it to snag .	1
Very silky , fits well and is attractive . The knit is light but strong and I will enjoy wearing it . I am 5'9 & # 34 ; and the large fits well with plenty of length in the body and sleeves . I usually wear a medium but I did n't wnt to have to struggle into the pants and shirt so I bought larger and they are close fitting without being tight . I like the extra length on my long arms .	1
THis is light and warm , as advertised . However , be aware that the scoop neck is n't that low or wide , so you ca n't wear it with a shirt that 's more scoopy .	1
I use this product as a base layer and like to pile other layers on top . This shirt allows my skin to breathe which makes it in my opinion much better than the synthetic base layers.Silk is a very good insulating fabric very lightweight and great to wear under many layers.One thing I have noticed about the top and especially the pants that can be brought separately is that I feel it does not run true to size.I suggest buying one size smaller than the sizing chart implies .	1
If you want something to keep you warm that 's not going to show bulk under your tightest sweater , this is what you want . In fact it 's so sheer , I ca n't even find mine . I think it 's hiding somewhere in the inner reaches of my washing machine or maybe clinging to one of my bed sheets . Other than that , it 's fine ; easy to wash and it dries ( not in the dryer ) in a very short time . Now if I could just find it ... .	1
This set of silk thermals is the base of most of my wardrobe . I have a skin disorder that causes sores and the silk is not irritating at all . They are true to size and a must for layering . I can even wear them under tights ( ai n't easy : )	1
It does not feel like I am wearing anything . It is very warm and comfortable under any sweater or shirt .	1
This is a very lightweight top which is great to wear under clothing . It is very silkly feeling against the skin . Although when I washed it the first time using Ivory gentle detergent , cool water , and washed by hand , it lost some of the silkyness and shrank a tad . Next time I will use less detergent and very `` cold '' water . Just a heads-up to others .	1
This is delicate top , although I did wash it on the delicate cycle in the washer , and it was fine . It did keep me quite warm in 40 degree damp weather with just a sweater and scarf . Am looking forward to actually being warm this winter . Very effective top .	1
It is wonderful that they make thermal underwear in such soft silk , light weight and able to do the job . Great to have for the winter .	1
I love this undershirt . I bought one ( along with the leggins ) last winter to wear under my XC ski clothing . Next I took it on a 5wk walk across Spain this spring . Although I did n't need to wear it much on the walk I lent it to several of my friends who were walking with me and who needed a little extra warmth ! My sister was one and I promised her one for her birthday ! I found it quite roomy and could have probably bought a medium for myself ... .hence I bought the medium for my sister . It can be squished into a ziplock bag taking no space in your pack . It is warm and washes and dries quickly overnight . All in all a very useful item for travelling ! Jenn , BC	1
I love this thermasilk top ! Feels comfortable and keeps me warm without feeling & # 34 ; bundled up & # 34 ; . I would highly recommend this product !	1
Would recommend these to anyone , price was reasonable compared to other manufactures and they keep me warm , which is why I bought them .	1
I have been buying these silk `` pointelle '' long tops and bottoms for several years now . They suit my purposes perfectly , and there is nothing else like them . First of all : they are very thin and sheer , but that 's how they are meant to be . Silk will keep you warm , without overheating you , that 's the nature of the fabric . I love them to sleep in -- they are just right . It 's not often terribly cold in my area , but when it is , wearing these tops and bottoms is a good solution , to give that extra bit of insulation without bulk . In fact , you hardly know that you are wearing them.Because they are made of sheer silk , they are delicate and need to be handled accordingly . Hand wash ( I put mine in a mesh bag , and use the `` handwash '' cycle on my washing machine ) . Dry on low . And be careful that you do n't snag them when you wear them.The fit is snug , so I order a size up.Enjoy !	1
I really love these long johns . My boss insists on keeping the office freezing so I wear these under my clothes . They are so thin clothes glide over them and yet they really keep me warm . They have washed beautifully I put them in a lingerie bay so they do n't get snagged .	1
Form fitting ... I love silk and other natural fibers and love how clothing slips right over this silky material . Lightweight but certainly warmer than polyester or cotton base layers .	1
A little thinner than ones purchased for $ 20 more - but seem well made for the price - have not worn as yet - but will change rating if it does not wear or last well .	1
I like to wear these when mowing or working in garden during full sun days vs slathering on the pore blocking sun screen . If you think about what you spend on sun screen vs light weight clothing - clothing by far comes out ahead since I just sweat the sun screen off..I usaully get 3-4 seasons with tops and 1-3 seasons with bottoms .	1
True to size , very warm and light weight . I often did not need a coat when I was wearing these .	1
The pants fit well and are more substantial than I expected . I was surprised at how long the large is . I am 5 foot 9 and they are long on me but that 's good in case they shrink a little . Also they will fit low on the ankle and keep the cold out .	1
This product has made me very happy , although at first impressions , it looks too thin and sheer to be true . I replaced all my merino long johns with this as I developed an allergy from wearing too much merino too frequently , and now I ca n't touch them at all . Anyway , this brand is great , and I have also bought the equivalent tops as my base layer as well , they are warm and really light . My husband has heaps of these too and he really likes the range ( long johns , long sleeve and short sleeve silk base layers ) . As the fabric is delicate , a little care during washing would be good . Otherwise , it washes well and dries very quickly unlike wool products .	1
Great for wearing under jeans when the weather is cold . Keeps my legs warm and I will be ordering more in the future . Not scratchy or itchy to skin . Will recommend especially in cooler temperatures .	1
These are fabulous under any pants - jeans , slacks , etc . They are warm and do n't add any bulk ; most times I forget that I have them on . I wore them almost everyday on a trip to London & Paris , and they served me well . Highly recommended .	1
Ordered a large size and probably would be more comfortable with a medium . I am 5-3 and 135 lbs . But will keep them and tuck inside socks . No problems with snagging . Works well with jeans .	1
See the review for the top . If you get the top you must get the bottom . These are really soft .	1
These r amazing . I teach ice skating in outdoor rinks in the rain and snow and freezing weather and they absolutely keep me so much warmer then not wearing them . Need to buy some more ! ! Thank u	1
Price was right , product does what it 's supposed to -- keeps me warm , light weight so one can wear them under any clothing .	1
The pant is thicker than silk , but thin enough that it does n't show through my work slacks . It is tightly knit and warm , and I expect it will outlast a silk pair .	1
I put these through heavy use . They 're thin , but that 's nice sometimes -- Seattle winters can be really variable in temperature . They eventually developed a run , like a stocking , and I had to retire them . I 'd say I got my money 's worth , but my long johns from other brands held up better .	1
This product did keep me warm , even though I am from Florida and was in 22 F degrees in Canada . It was a little long since I am 5'5 & # 34 ; tall , which made it not fit snugly . It was comfortable and under warmer outerwear , kept me toasty warm . I would recommend it to others looking for an underlayer .	1
Living in Chicago I have worn these almost everyday this winter since I got them . They are nice and thin and even jeans slide over them and you do n't feel like the Michelin man . I do wash them in a lingerie bag to prevent snagging and have had no shrinkage . They really keep me warm , nothing like silk far better than the Cuddleduds .	1
I own these in white too and love both ( as well as the shirt too ! ) We had a very cold winter this year and these really helped keep me warm without feeling bulky at all ! Sometimes I even for got I had them on !	1
The pant is not ultra-heavy nor ultra-light . This dry-fit material is very nice for the gym , running outside or skiing . Size accurately . So I bought another one .	1
Great for sleeping or as extra layer for warmth without bulk . Fabric comfortable , look of lace . Recommend these very highly .	1
I am 5'7 & # 34 ; , long legged , these are 2 inches too long for me.I am keeping them , wear them to bed .	1
Good to wear these gardening or mowing or any other out door activity where you just ca n't do the sun screen and want an option . I keep a couple on hand . One goes in sail bag and other here for landscape/garden activity . Silk is pretty good , but you will get rips in crotch after a year or so , depending on how often worn and washed . I 'm bad about throwing in washer and dryer - when I hang dry they last longer .	1
I absolutely LOVE these shoes ! I wear them until you ca n't wear them any more . The only problem is that I wear them almost every single day and once they stink , they stink . I guess having & # 34 ; vegan & # 34 ; shoes is like wearing a dirty hippy on your foot . Oh well . I 'll continue buying these ! Hemp is great for products ! !	1
I love that there is a vegan option for this shoe . It 's very comfortable and lasts for a long time .	1
Bought these for my boyfriend . He loved them so much , on payday , he is ordering the same pair but in navy .	1
He will love these sneakers . Great quality , nice color ( I like the bottom platform too , looks like cork ) , fits as expected , vegan .	1
I 'm in vegan shoes heaven . I love all the different colors these come in . As for the fit , they are minimalist . I need a lot of arch support so I bought inserts for mine . These are very hip looking and when people notice them I get compliments . I wear them with jeans and causual clothes , not for working out . I would love for Saucony to come out with a line of vegan running shoes .	1
I love these shoes . I should have gotten a half size smaller but they are comfortable and look great . I tried to get these smaller in other colors but they were sold out . I am a vegetarian and only wear vegan and it is awesome how many great vegan options are available on amazon . It used to be so hard and way too expensive to find vegan shoes . I will buy more .	1
It is difficult to find a good , vegan walking shoe so I jumped on these when I saw them . I did n't have high hopes . I am very rough on shoes ( brisk two mile walk with the dogs every day ) and normally need a lot of padding and support ( torn meniscus ) . When these arrived I did n't expect there to be enough of either . Wrong . I ca n't say that I wear them every day but at least 4 times a week for walks and a few other times each week for general running around . After ten months , these look like new and are still very comfortable . My original pair is gray with orange ( very cute ) and I just ordered the navy.Update : The blue and white shoes are nothing like my original pair ! ! If you look closely at the pictures you will see the difference . Instead of shoe laces , they have sewn in elastic . And rather than sturdy construction , they are flimsy with no reinforced padding at the heel . They would not be at all comfortable . It appears that the beige/brown choice is the same . These should not be sold along side the others . Wish I could do a separate one star review on the blue . These are going back .	1
I bought these because I was looking for a workout shoe that I could wear with black pants , that would n't make my feet look like they were in a sci-fi movie . ( Although , I do love to watch the TV show Eureka ! ) I was happy that they were vegan , as well.I went to four different B & M ; stores , tried on dozens of pairs of shoes and was beginning to think that my feet had suddenly grown in some weird fashion ( no pun intended ) , as NONE of them fit properly . I tried on various sizes , from various brands , in various styles and nothing was right . It was soooo frustrating ! I ordered these in what I previously thought to be `` my size '' ( women 's 10 ) , based on others ' reviews and whew , was I happy when they arrived and fit PERFECTLY ! I wore them around the house for a bit to make sure , then to work for a full day of light duty stuff , yesterday to the gym for some precor and rowing machine work , and then , today , to the gym for a lo-impact workout . So far , so good ! They are SOOOO comfortable AND - BONUS : they make my feet look smaller ! This was confirmed by my mom , when she exclaimed this upon seeing them for the first time.Fit points ( in all shoes ) that matter to me : - toe room : these have a good amount of it , so toes can wiggle , but not so much that the foot is unstable or the toe box looks huge.- stitching in toe area : At first , I thought the bar of stitching that runs across the top of my foot , at the base of my toes , would irritate me , but I only noticed it the first hour or so and have n't noticed it since.- the area around the Achilles tendon : again , just the right amount of room ( shoes usually bend forward too much for me , not these ) - arch : i dunno if i have flat feet or not , but I do love a nice hefty arch . These have a good one , with a smooth transition from the rest of the surface.- sole width : some shoes seem narrower in the sole , even though the shoe might fit , thus causing my foot to look like it 's floating or hanging over the edge - ick ! These are just right in sole width.PROS : - sized right ( for me , anyway ! ) - comfy ! - nice style ( simple , but not boring ; old-skool , but not out of style ) - vegan ! Saucony 's site claims : `` This Vegan friendly Saucony shoe contains no animal products , by-products or derivatives . Canvas and hemp create the classic design . `` - TWO pairs of shoestrings ( mine came wearing a black pair , and with an oatmeal pair in the box ) - this helps to match your style & I find I get more use from an old pair of kicks , when I spruce them up with some new laces ! - women 's sizes 5-12 , with half-sizes from 5.5 to 9.5- the insole is removable ! - so many great colors ! ! ! CONS : - the frayed cotton look on the oatmeal parts does make it look a little scraggly . ( as mentioned by another reviewer ) but it 's not totally noticeable and , some may even think it gives the shoe a bit of `` granola '' charm . Mine seem a bit more frayed than the pic shows . I 'm on the fence and could take it or leave it . We 'll see in the coming months , if it deteriorates faster than expected.NOTE : there is a good bit of chunky traction on this shoe . This will certainly help on the trail , but causes a noticeable amount of grip on smooth floors . I find it tolerable ( even a bit soothing , as pressure on the various tread triangles gives my foot a bit of a `` massage '' while I move around ) , and the added grippiness is a minor concern for me , compared to my other preferences , but if this is an area of major concern for you , you might be bothered by it . This might decrease , as the tread wears a bit . If I notice , I 'll update.CONCLUSION : Active vegans have another reason to rejoice ! And , so do active non-vegans , or non-active vegans ! These shoes are super-cute , cool , comfy , and caring to animals , and indirectly , the planet ! They fit great ( true-to-size ) and can be worn confidently ! With so many great colors and the guarantee of a good fit and function , I will be back to buy more ! Thanks , Amazon ! I rely on reviews to help me make informed buying decisions . I hope this review helped you in the same manner ! : )	1
Great and comfortable for taking long walks with the dogs . I have wide feet and it was a perfect 6.5 fit for me	1
Best vegan tennis shoes I 've ever owned ! They are incredibly comfortable and well worth the price ! ! I was pleasantly surprised at the cushioning and how well constructed the materials fit my feet A++	1
Very nice , I was looking for something like this . It was affordable , the only thing is you have to have good hand and eye coordination it can be a little tricky , I am good at it so it works for me .	1
This earring holder is sturdy and easy to use . The two drawers at the bottom are great for keeping extra earring backs or whatever you like . It holds post earrings , as well as French wires .	1
This is a clean , sturdy and well-designed container for your earrings . If you 're like me , you dug around in boxes and drawers every day to decide what to wear and only wore a few pairs out of expediency . This container will allow you to find all your earrings easily so you can enjoy them .	1
I originally ordered a Large Tall . I 'm 6'4 & # 34 ; with a 42 & # 34 ; chest , 34 & # 34 ; waist , 190 lbs , and wear a 16/36 in dress shirts . The Large Tall was perfect for length of sleeves and waist , but I could easily have gained another 100 lbs to fill it out . I returned it and got the Medium Tall . It is MUCH better . Gives me enough room to wear a couple layers under and looks more like the guy in the picture with his hand in his pocket . The Large gave me enough room that I would n't be surprised if I could wear the Medium underneath it . This is a quality constructed jacket that should last for years .	1
This is the second Carhartt coat I 've purchased over the years and have not been sorry either time . Fits well and very warm . Carhartt customer for life .	1
I am 6'4 & # 34 ; with long arms . The sleeves could be about an inch longer to make this jacket perfect . Other than that , great jacket . It keeps me warm in temps below freezing and above 0F .	1
This is the second Carhartt jacket I have bought my husband . He loves them because they come in tall & they are nice and roomy ! He is a logger in Maine and he loves that they last for years even in harsh conditions .	1
This item was bought for our son and he loves it . When he got it for Christmas our weather was so warm was n't able to wear it but this is not his first Carhartt .	1
Nice , very warm and thick . It might even seem a little big on me . I barely fit into XL t-shirts ( usually xxl ) but the XL is quite large on me . I like it and plan to keep it .	1
I have this watch and the timex with the black band . I like this one better because the band is nicer and because it has the day and date function . The time is very easy to read , and the night light is outstanding . The gold face is nice but everything else is silver in color , which I found odd . But it keeps time well , looks professional , and yet is durable and practical . The watch is a good value .	1
I like this watch , no frills just a night light which I like for movie theaters , and day and date and for us seniors easy to read , I wear it more than my much more expensive watches .	1
Very thin and small on a large wrist . Super easy to read even with the date and time window looking like a hand in the dark.It lights up well with a push on the wind stem . The watch face numbered ring it self is about the size of 2 quarter coins stacked . I think they measured to the widest edges at the band pins . Great value and function for the price , I would recommend it to a thin wristed man or anyone knowing its small .	1
This watch has everything I was looking for . It is clear and concise , has day/date feature and Indaglo so I can see it in the dark . I travel a lot and do n't have to turn on the light at night . I have a collector watch I am retiring and have a band I wanted to transfer to the new one . Fine . I read a complaint from someone regarding setting the day . To do this you wind the watch backwards and the day will change correctly . Otherwise , you will mess everything up .	1
Easy to read dial , date box and a good leather band make this watch a good deal at the price .	1
I have n't seen an analog Timex Easy Reader priced this low for the past five years . It 's the perfect professor 's watch because:1 . Only professors wear them ( students have abandoned wrist watches in favor of cell phones , iPods and other digital devices ) .2 . Besides providing that dependable Timex time , it offers both the day of the week and the date ( I 'm just beginning to master the year and month without assistance ) .3 . If the watch is misplaced ( the difference between a professor and an elephant ) , the cost of replacement is not prohibitively high . ( The same goes for repairs which , once you 've factored in the drive to Walmart , are also not cost effective . ) Thank you , Amazon . Life is perfect .	1
Timex men 's T20011 is very cool , i like it.the leather is soft . I 'm very happy to be wearing it.thank you so much ,	1
Bought as gift for son . Timex makes a great watch and I know he will enjoy it for many years .	1
This is just what I needed . Bigger , easy to read numbers and looks classy too . Band 's a little tight but that can be replaced .	1
I was looking at watches with my friend and when she came across this one , I wanted it too . Little did I know she had bought it for me for Christmas ! ! ! : ) You ca n't beat a Timex ! It 's a Men 's watch and although I am a woman , it looks good on my dainty wrist . Large face watches are still in and this looks really classic , simple and stylish enough for everyday . I had to adjust the band but that was nominal in price . I love the date/day mode as well . The blue face is such a nice color and I think will look great in the summer too ! Ca n't say enough & # 8230 ; it just a great watch , fashionable and a great price ! Enjoy !	1
I purchased for my hubby and he loves it . This is a very becoming classy watch that works really great .	1
This watch is Retro Cool - you grandpa might have worn this in the 1970's.Got it today at WalMart for $ 28.92 . I like the blue face and spartanly simple dial.Planned to immediately put it on a green canvas strap , but found I actually like the silver expansion band ! I last wore an expansion band in 1970 . The watch and expansion band have slim profile and wo n't trip you up walking through a doorway like a lot of the trendy 42+ mm watches . This watch has a pleasingly classic appearance . Still might put it on the green canvas band later , though .	1
This is a gift for my husband . He NEVER wears a watch , but this year he decided he wanted one for Christmas . He picked this one out because it has an easy to read face and indiglo ... ..he likes it .	1
This watch was purchased for my husband . His old Timex was very similar and recently stopped working . He really liked this watch because it was n't digital and had the day/date . It looked just like his old watch but when he received it he realized the watch face was just a bit smaller than the old one and he really like that . He said his old one always felt too big on his wrist . All in all he was very happy with this purchse .	1
This is a beautiful watch , very easy to read . My brother lives in a nursing home and can put the watch on without asking for help .	1
I 've had this watch for almost 2 years and it 's been a great and dependable watch.When I first saw it online , the watch looked huge . I purchased it anyway because I wanted a second Timex watch to wear for work . This is my other Timex watch ( which I also love ) Timex Women 's Fashion Two-Tone Bracelet # T25771.I was so happy when it arrived ! While it is much larger than most women 's watches ( it 's advertised as a men 's watch ) it 's a beautiful watch . I love the colors of this watch ; blue face with the silver band.The large face makes it so easy for me to see what time it is . I 'm a little sneaky sometimes ... If I 'm in a meeting or speaking with someone and I need to know what time it is , I can very easily , just *slightly* tilt my hand towards me and without moving my face or eyes too much , I can see what time it is on this watch ! I do n't want to be rude to whoever I am talking with , and this watch allows me to see what time it is with out being overly obvious that I am checking the time ! I know , it does n't sound like a big deal , but I appreciate being able to do that.I get so many compliments on my watch . I 've been asked why I am wearing a men 's watch and I tell them it 's super comfortable to wear and I love the color and the features of the watch . Along with the time , the date is easy to read . Also if I 'm in a dark room , the indiglo light works great . Because the watch face is blue , the indiglo light tends to glow a light blue color . Once I show them how awesome the watch is , they want one too and they ask me where I got it ! One last thing , both the time and the date are so easy to set ! Just takes a few moments to do.I love this watch ! I 've been very happy with all my Timex watches and they last and last ...	1
This is a good watch but a little small for a big guy like me . Also the watch band is a little small and tight . If you are a big guy I would recommend a different watch .	1
This was a Christmas gift for my brother . Rarely have I found a gift that included all the featchers I was looking for , but this sure did . Easy read face , Idiglo light and date and day . And it 's a Timex .	1
This is a very nice watch that keeps good time . It 's an attractive easy to read watch that 's priced right . The Indiglo and date features are nice added bonuses . The band is almost perfect . At first it fit a little tighter than I liked , but I easily adjusted to the fit . I would buy again if I needed too , but I really hope this will serve me well for years to come .	1
Very nice Timex watch with comfortable expansion band which is a little tight for my small wrist ( 7 inch ) but not too tight and is easy to remove and put back on . The best thing I like is the easy to read dial and the indiglo light to read in dark . Just push stem button in and lights up nicely in dark.It looks like the band is gold plated though it does not mention . As for the day and month setting , I just can not get the stem in right position for that feature , I am not interested in the month and day setting , but would be nice if easier to use.I like the 10 year battery as the instructions state , I remember not too long ago having to get new battery about once a year.Another good watch at a good price that looks more expensive than it cost from Timex . I do recommend this Timex watch with the minor points I mentioned.A very readable timepiece to tell the time with and that 's what counts .	1
My husband is n't into expensive watches but he IS into watches that he can SEE . He loves the large numbers on this one and it looks as good as the more expensive brands .	1
My husband absolutely loves this watch . It has just what he wanted - time that can easily be read at a glance ; day of the week and date of the month ; and a comfortable fit . Less than a year ago I had bought him a more expensive watch which was very attractive , but difficult to read and he constantly complained about it . We both are very happy with this purchase and worth triple the price .	1
I aM VERY PLEASED WITH THE WATCH ... ..THE BAND IS NOT BIG ENOUGH FOR A GOOD SIZED WRIST BUT IT FITS MINE JUST RIGHT ... ..I WEAR MENS WATCHES BECAUSE OF MY BAD VISION ... .I ALWAYS BUY TIMEX ... ..	1
I was n't sure if I was going to like this as I was buying it online , but it is the perfect size and I love the big numbers and ... my husband keeps trying to steal it ! I have relatively small hands and a narrow wrist so was concerned about the size of the watch face because I know some of them are rather large ( for a man 's wrist ) ... this one is perfect ! TIP : I measured the top of my wrist to get an idea of what size watch face would work .	1
Got this for my husband and he is thrilled with it , he does not need his glasses to see this ( he hates wearing them ) ! ! ! Also likes the fact that it 's just a simple watch and the Indiglo is a bonus , all around a keeper !	1
I love timex watches . The last one I bought lasted about 15 years . It still works but I thought it was time for a new one . I am female but bought the mens watch because the face it bigger . I am truly happy with this purchase .	1
As advertised , this watch is very easy to read , and has a great backlight for night time use or when in dark places like the theater . The band has a nice style to it . The only thing I miss is a date feature , which is why I deducted 1 star . But I would highly recommend it !	1
I just recieved my new Timex watch . I have been an avid Timex product customer for many years so my reason to purchase a Timex was an easy one . This particular Timex is from their Easy Reader Collection . I am legally blind and needed a watch I could read without having to strain or use my magnifying glass with . This watch accomplishes this as well as looks very appealing as many more expensive brands . As far as purchasing from Amazon.com you just can not find a company more dedicated to quality and service . I always recieve my purchases ahead of projected dates and after more than 6 or 7 years of doing busines have never had to return anything from them . Great appreciation and high recommendations to Amazon.com .	1
This is a great watch with a large readable face . The price is reasonable , and it keeps time perfectly . I wish they would make this available with a Date Window .	1
the straps are genuine leather , the face is big enough for a man 's watch and when the press the button to the side it has a backlight . very nice piece . nice than in the pics and it comes in a neat little draw string jewelry bag	1
Big Bold Basic Beautyful , Very eazy to read , Reliabl , Durable Great style , you ca n't go wrong.This is my 2nd TIMEX from Amazon.With such a vast choice of styles to choose from I 've narrowed this one amongst my favorites .	1
even if you are not , buy this watch . I am a nurse , much like many of the other reviewers . In fact , I bought it due to their reviews . It is a fantastic watch . Easy to read , has an illumination option and a handy date feature . The only trouble I have is the size of the band ( too long ) . I will take it to a jeweler to take a few links out , however , the directions for doing this yourself make it looks easy ( it 's not ) . Do n't even bother looking for another watch , this one is a steal .	1
The watch itself is great . Very simple yet very pretty ! It will go with anything ( unless you wear gold , I guess ) . It 's comfortable and easy to read . A somewhat bigger face without actually being BIG . Nice and light . Seems durable , too . Indiglo feature looks nice and so far I 'm very pleased ! My only complaint is that it comes so BIG . If you have the right tools , you can remove links yourself . Or you can buy a link removal kit.. they 're cheap but why would I want one ? Just more stuff to clutter up my house.. Some people said they got theirs adjusted for free at a jeweler but every place near me said it was only free if you bought it there . I ended up going to a chain jewelry store and they charged me $ 20 . The cost of that plus the cost of this watch is still less than some other watches that I considered buying so I 'm okay with it , it 's just inconvenient . I would have given this 5 stars if it came a big smaller . I do n't have especially small wrists so I just do n't get why it came so large ! Also , just wanted to add that over time , it has started to bother me that the clasp will sometimes pop open when hit just right . Sometimes , I 'll just be getting out of my car and the clasp will somehow hit something just so it opens . Annoying ! I think it is just something that will happen with this kind of band but I did n't anticipate it being an issue originally .	1
Classic and simple watch . Looks great with anything , dress up or down . Lady like with understated elegance , especially when worn out , where everyone is in over sized `` cheap looking bling '' watches . Timex is always reliable . My daughter `` borrowed '' it for a job interview . She got the job , I think the watch helped !	1
Okay , the strap is black but the dial itself is brown . It 's very cute ! great for simple outfits and it even has the date . The light up mechanism itself , is a button on the side that you pressed . I thought it would be the numbers itself so when I 'm groggy in the middle of the night , I can just half-open my one eye , and I will be able to tell the time , but no , I have to push the button . Maybe I 'm spoiled by technologies , but it 's not hard to just make it glow , right ? ah , what do i know .	1
This watch is a top choice for the busy woman . Easy to read and black leather band gives it a goes-with-everything look . I have always had excellent luck with Timex . Indiglo is the nicest I have seen .	1
The watch is great but the strap was too long . I bought a different strap and now really enjoy wearing it . The watch face is n't really black but more of a dark brown color . I find the numbers on the watch and the date very easy to read . Overall I am very happy with my purchase .	1
The watch is very small . The face is about the size of a quarter , and the band is thinner than a half an inch . Some people say they ca n't see the date displayed on the watch , but I think those people might need to get their eyes checked . The date display is small , but plenty big enough to see if you have the right glasses prescription . Some people say the glowing was n't bright enough , but I think it 's great . I hate when it glows too bright to the point where it looks like you 're trying to take down an aircraft with your watch . You ca n't see it glowing if you 're in broad daylight .	1
I purchased this Timex watch as a gift for my wife she loves it she likes the black face with white numbers very classy looking plus it lights up with the push of a button to see the time when its dark.I highly recommend this watch .	1
I wear this tough inexpensive watch when I do yard or ranch work . I wear it to hunt . I wear it to fish in the Gulf . It is tough as nails and inexpensive to boot . The nylon band is n't hot like some leather bands . Highly recommend .	1
I am pleased with the Expedition watch . It fits very naturally and is easily adjustable . It is lightweight and easy to read day or night . It seems to keep good time , but now days most all watches do.The only complaints I have is that the `` crystal '' is too soft , and easily scatched , and that the band can be a little difficult to put on if you have to unloop it all the way . The second is not a big deal , but the first is kind of dissapointing . It is supposed to be an active outdoor accessory.Overall though , I am pleased with my purchase and recomend it to anyone wanting a watch for work or play.04/11/2010Still have watch . Still keeps great time . Still on original battery . I had to replace the strap . It was stretched out where the watch attaches . The strap aso get very smelly from sweat over time . A replacement was found at Target for $ 7.00 . I still stand by mt original 4 star . You should buy this watch . ( if it is still available )	1
Clear , readable dial and contrasting hands , breathable band . The only thing I do n't particularly like is the very large bright red & # 34 ; Timex & # 34 ; label on the band .	1
I bought this for my husband after his other velcro-banded watch stopped working . He loves it ! The wrist opening is a little small and he has to & # 34 ; squeeze & # 34 ; his hand through the opening , but other than that he has all praises for this watch . He mentioned that sometimes he has to check to see if he is still wearing it because it is so light and comfortable . Also , the date stamp on the face and the Indiglo light make it a perfect day to night watch . Highly recommended !	1
Timex makes a great watch for people that abuse them . The price is right and they really last quite a while .	1
Good watch ... My 7 year old boy needed a new watch and even though it is sold as a `` chick '' watch [ do n't tell my son ] it is masculine looking and fits a youth wrist well . So far durable for school/every day wear . We will see how long it lasts him . Best price here ... even better than Wally-Mart !	1
If you are looking for a great watch to wear that is casual and looks great with all casual clothes you will love this watch . It has a very easy to read face and is just the perfect size . Looks sporty yet can still look right with business casual clothing .	1
I love this watch . It 's easy to see and does n't have n't a bunch of alarms or crazy stuff on it that no one can figure out how to use or turn off . The reason I gave it four stars is that the band does n't seem as sturdy as it looks . It does n't feel like leather or suede.It 's a great watch though , I love it and I wear it to work everyday .	1
I ordered this watch because I had the same model watch for a couple of years and loved it . Then tragedy struck -- I dropped it on a tile floor and broke it.The watch his sturdy and attractive . The numbers are easy to read and the hands are very clear and glow in the dark . The Indiglo feature is a big part of what makes this watch great because you only need to push the button to see the time at night.The only thing I found disappointing was that the other watch had the date also and this one does not .	1
I love this watch -- it is the perfect face size for my wrist and thus far has been extremely durable and reliable . I 've had this watch and used it daily for several months now and it has surpassed my medium-low expectations . I 've dropped it and knocked it around a bit , and it has held up great . Keeps good time , and the band is still going strong despite daily use and abuse . Worn this swimming a few times as well with no problems . Great watch , and looks a bit more classy in reality than it does in the picture .	1
I wanted a watch to wear for `` everyday '' use . Nothing too expensive , given that I exercise outdoors a lot . The face is the perfect size . Not so big as to get in the way , but big enough to easily read the time without the need for reading glasses ( for those of us at a certain age ) .	1
The picture of the watch makes it look big with a very wide band . I was hesitant to order it because I thought it would n't look like a women 's watch.When it arrived I was pleased to see that the band is less than an inch wide at the largest end . The watch is a beauty in that the numbers have bright ( very small ) silver arrows that point to the numbers . I like this feature because it only takes a quick glance to read the time . The face is fairly easy to read but really shines when Indiglow button is pushed the face then becomes a pretty shade of aqua and is a fairly bright light.While this a & # 34 ; casual & # 34 ; wear watch I like the fact that the matte black surround does n't clash with rings and wrist jewelry.It light-weight and comfortable . I would buy this again .	1
This turned out to be such a good buy for our pre-teen . Durable , lights up , does n't show dirt , solid band , comfy . Very very cool watch for the price and not just a hunk of cheap clinky jewelry . This can be worn in PE and is reliable for getting to your next class on time .	1
Got this for my wife the nurse , could n't be happier ... Priced right we 've had them before , bet this lasts over 5 years..	1
This watch is attractive and rugged . I love that it has the button to light up the dial so i can check the time in pitch dark conditions . I wear this both in the back country and every day use .	1
I was ordering a wrist watch for my nephew and somehow , this product popped up . As it looked similar to the watch that I was about to place in my shopping cart , I placed this one in the shopping cart , and did not pay attention to what I was buying . When I received it , I contacted Amazon and received an immediate return authorization label . I sent it back on Monday December 16 , 2013 and have received my refund credit already on Tuesday December 17 , 2013 . Great product ... ..just clicked on the wrong one .	1
I just received this watch a few moments ago , I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my husband . When I opened the box , WOW ! .. Of course I fell in love with it online that 's why I ordered it but setting my eyes on it ... it is much nicer looking in reality than the picture . The picture does n't do justice to this watch , why..The outside beveled edge is so much prominent that once you set your eyes to it , that 's what gets your attention ! Then the watch face ( with the numbers ) is like sitting in the well of the beveled ring . The face color is very nice beige , the band is great ; not the smooth leather but the kind of calfskin that gives it its unique character . I love it , I love it and I 'm very sure the recipient will love it too ! Where the band is connected to the watch , it is kind of raised/curved some ; in other words those who like the watch to lay flat on a surface this may not be the case . It is also a little heavy if you are looking for light weight ! It was delivered just in time ! For those who share the same taste ... You will love it ! P.S . The recipient loved his gift . He took time to tinker around trying to set the date right , and finally got it . Next step is to set the alarm . He said he has n't got around to that but will . Nice watch , great buy ! Its for keeps !	1
This is my second watch like this . I love it . My last one still runs I just tore up the band due to using it at work . Highly recommend it .	1
Bought this watch approximately 5 years ago . Wear it daily to work in a toolshop where it gets soaked in nasty , oil and grease filled CNC Machine coolant . Destroyed the band a few years ago and got a replacement from timex . It just fell apart again . I 'm going to switch to a watch with a resin band but this thing is a beast . It worked through : 3 12hour days in 0-10*F days with a foot of snow falling on each day snowmobiling in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . 5 years of daily machine shop work . I stuck a piece of velcro on the back of it and used it as a clock on my motorcycle for a summer . Swimming , showering , sleeping . No problem.The only issue , besides the bands , is the outer rotating bezel is kind of loose . It has been this way since I bought the watch . It is bad enough that I can feel and hears gears skipping while I adjust the time/date or set an alarm . It still works and has been doing this for 5 years , so perhaps it is designed to have some play . Either way , love this watch and will be buying another new band to keep it tickin .	1
My collection would not be complete without this Timex Expedition with the Indiglo and the alarm . This has always been one of my favorite watches and it goes great with country boots , jeans and a tee shirt . Love it , love it , love it ! ! !	1
My husband has a Rolex and a Tag but wanted an inexpensive watch to knock around in ( literally as he 's breaking a few horses ) . this has a nice look and easy to read dial . Ca n't go wrong with a Timex .	1
I love these Timex Watches , the face is a bone colour and the numbers are black and easy to see.The minute and hour hand glow and the indiglo is the best for at night or in the dark . I really likethe red minute hand which on my watch , actually lines up with the minute increments on the face.I found this model to be very comfy to wear , I always prefer leather straps and this one isnice and soft.The watch is neither too large or too small on my wrist , a perfect fit.The Easy Set Alarm is just that , easy ! And loud enough too ! If you need a watch for reminding you of things throughout the day , thenthis is the one for you.I do n't care if this watch/battery only lasts for 12 months , because I buy a newwatch every year on my birthday , but I 'm sure it will take the knocks I dish outjust like my other Timex .	1
I 'm hard on a watch and the primary reason I still wear one , is that I love the alarm feature . It 's an old fashioned analog alarm that rings every hour or every 12-hours , depending on how you set the stem . Nice loud chime and it lights up at night , to boot . I 've had more sophisticated and much more expensive watches , but this one suits my simple needs . I can set the alarm using the outer ring or the setting stem . It 's easier to gauge time in 5 minute or even 20 minute intervals , unlike how a digital watch works . Water resistant and very durable , I usually end up buying a new one in 2-3 years , even before the battery wears out . I tend to scratch the crystal and I rub off most of the ring detail in that time . Then , I just buy a new one and change out the expandable wrist strap I prefer to the leather band that comes with it . I do n't go diving with this watch , but it gets wet a lot and I never worry about dropping it or losing it . No other watch works the same way - I like this one !	1
Great Watch ... I am on my 2nd one . My first watch is still working and keeping excellent time on my friends ATV handle bars . lol I replaced the Band twice and bought a new one simply cause it started to not look so nice . It took the licking and kept on ticking for years with the original battery . Just too banged up to be presentable . So before the 3rd band wore out , and the battery failed ... I decided to just buy a new one here . In a nutshell , Great watch ... Easy to use ... and a great price on Amazon.Mark from CANADA !	1
This is a terrific everyday watch at a reasonable price . The closest one I found in the stores was not as attractive and cost twice as much .	1
I 've already been through 3 Timex watches now , but I got this one for my girlfriend awhile back , and I liked it so much I decided to get one for myself.The first watch had the Indiglo feature , which made it perfect for wearing to the movies . The second watch had both a chronograph and Indiglo and an alarm , so I thought that was pretty cool for the price . First the Indiglo went out , and the replacement I got lasted a few months before the alarm went out . So , I 'm hoping for better with this watch.This watch is the best looking one of them all , with a very handsome band that would look good at the beach , on a date or in the boardroom . It 's a lot easier to set than most alarm watches , and easier to set than most other Timex watches , as you can turn the outer dial instead of the crown to set everything -- nice touch . And , all the instructions are on the outer ring and the back of the watch , so you can lose the instructions no problem.As I said , I got this for my girlfriend , and it 's size makes it a lot easier to read than those dainty women 's watches , yet it looks good on women or men . Great gift for the money , and the recipient will really appreciate the alarm.I ca n't give it 5 starts because of my previous experience with Timex watches , but for some reason I keep getting them again , hence the 4 star review . If you want a watch that will last you the rest of your life , and then some , my Omega is over 40 years old , and my neighbor has some Rolex watches that are a lot older than that . But , you should know that when they need service , and they will , each service will cost you a lot of Timex watches.Follow-up : This watch is now 3 years old and still going strong so I 've upped the rating to 5 stars . My only complaint now is the band broke and I was not able to find an exact replacement from Timex . While not a huge deal , bands do n't last forever , the OEM watch band was really , really nice .	1
I like the Timex for travel . It is inconspicuous and not flashy and it has an easy to read dial in any light and it has an alarm . I do n't believe in going to a country and wearing a watch that obviously cost as much as the locals earn in a year . It is not smart and it is not kind and it definitely would end up costing me more when I negotiate for any goods or services which are often on a sliding scale with foreigners charged 3-4x as much . I would rather pay 2x what the locals are charged and recommend leaving your bling at home . It is also 4 times as accurate as a Rolex or similar anachronistic timepiece that people seem to crave for status alone , so if you do need a watch for navigation without a GPS or for when the GPS packs it in , a digital watch is the way to go.When I need to get up and leave for the airport or some other time critical destination I do not like to rely on hotel alarm clocks or wakeup calls . I carry a travel alarm but I also like having the Timex available as a backup alarm.Battery life is exceptional and I have gone three years without replacing the battery . I do not use the light function much which may be part of the reason for the long battery life . With its white dial and analog display I do not need the light the way I would with a digital display .	1
It is a solid and rugged performer . I 've had one for a few years and giving it four because they have done nothing to improve it , while others have added temp and/or altitude sensing . For a watch labeled & # 34 ; Expedition , & # 34 ; it should do more than just tell you the time , date , and provide a stopwatch .	1
I just wish the back ground was n't green . Otherwise , perfect size and weight . This is my second , the first lasted forever !	1
I work 3rd shift outside year round so I need a watch that can and will stand up to abuse . For starters the velcro band is very comfortable and sturdy . The watch is so light that you will forget you 're wearing it . The display is fairly large and easy to read . Not to mention that the greenish background makes it easy to read even in sunlight . The only thing I 'm not enjoying anout the watch is the plastic case , but hey if anything happens I wo n't be upset like I would if it were my Citizen ... Anyway buy this watch , you wo n't regret it .	1
There is really nothing I can say that has n't already been said . I could NOT believe how user friendly the watch is . Setting the time was a jif ! I did n't even have to read the instructions . Yes , I am female and purchased this watch for myself . I will be using it for day hikes , mountaineering , rollerblading and general fitness . My boyfriend loved it so much , I will be buying one for him too . Fantastic watch !	1
This is the second time that I bought this watch . The first one lasted 3 years through military service and probably just needed a battery change . I Wear it daily when I work out so it has been through it all .	1
I have a parrot who loves to chew my watch band ! so I need to replace it alot ! this band holds up even to that ! It came on time and is great for someone with a skinny wrist like I have . The velcro holds up well and can stand up to parrot stress lol !	1
I found this watch for my husband probably 10 yrs . ago . He is really hard on his watches being a mechanic . He likes all the feature , backlight , timer , stop watch , alarm . The band is the best , it has a strap that goes under the watch that helps to keep the pressure off the pins . It 's Velcro so easy to remove when needing to quickly . I only have to purchase new when he either scratches up the face to much or loses it like he did this time .	1
I picked up this Timex model about 6 months ago . I love the velcro strap . It is comfortable and solves the problem of finding the `` perfect hole '' in most bands . For me the perfect hole never does exist . If my watch is too tight I move to the next hole and then it is loose and rolling around on my wrist , which I can not stand.This T48061 fits me perfectly . It is lightweight to the point of not even realizing you have it on . The module itself is great . Keeps great time , and setting it is a breeze with the prompts you receive on the screen of the watch during setting mode ... great feature.I have used it during chainsaw operation , fence building , and various other jobs and it never misses a beat . I actually bought 2 of them so I would have a back up ! For the money this is a great Timex !	1
grand daughter lover her new watch . great for a child in the first or second grade . she loves it a lot	1
Looks just as advertised . Great price . Came in a very short time span . Well secured , no damage . Perfect size for our 4 yr old to wear & get used to wearing a watch & seems simple enough to help her learn to tell time . Satisfied w purchase .	1
THe watch is very cute , daughter likes it , and it does glow in the dark . There 's no alarm , which we like , because it means no beeps in the middle of the night .	1
Good price point - wroks well . Great aid in teaching my 6-year old to read time . Would definitely recommend it .	1
My six year old granddaughter is learning to tell time and will just love this Christmas gift . It is absolutely delightful with the daisy circling the face of the watch . It arrived very quickly and I am very happy with the purchase .	1
I got two different watches for my twin granddaughters : this one and the Red Balloon Kids ' W000182 Butterflies Stainless Steel Time Teacher Watch.This one was their favorite because they could get it off and on easily , it fit their small wrists well , and they loved that it glowed in the dark .	1
just as i expected !	1
Great Christmas gift for my 6 yo granddaughter . Very cute , colorful , soft , adjustable , the right size , great time teller for a small girl learning to tell time . Great price and fast shipping with Prime . I recommend it .	1
Thbis Timex watch is just the thing for teaching the young lady in your life how to tell time plus it is a very attractive item for her to wear on her wrist . Learning to tell time was quick and effortless . I would recommend this watch to anyone who has a youngster in their life that is ready to learn how to tell time . Thanks Amazon	1
Daughter got this from the Easter Bunny . Wears it every day . It is durable and keeps correct time . Words are a little small to actually teach her anything but that was n't why I bought it .	1
It 's meant to be a gift for school aged little girls . Very helpful watch for them to learn time reading .	1
I bought two of these for the grand kids . They loved them and wear them every day . Was very pleased with my purchase !	1
This is a really cute watch and works very well . The indiglo is an added bonus ! The second hand is flowers that work their way around the clock . My daughter loves it !	1
My kindergartener loves this watch and so do I ! She is quickly learning to read the watch do to the way the face is set up for learning . The wrist strap is soft and stretchy and easily adjustable . She loves the glow option .	1
This is a darling watch - gave it to three little grand daughters . A big bang for your buck ! Not only cute , but very funtional . Love the hands instead of digital .	1
This watch is great . It has the hands identified so that the child can know which is hour/minute . It has a light which m daughter loved . The strap is comfortable and it is a cute design . Highly recommend it .	1
She loves it , and wears it all the time . Her color is purple , and the watch is purple . Great little watch .	1
We bought this for my daughter 's seventh birthday . Easy to fit on her wrist and she says it is comfortable . It is a great little watch for our kid , who is just learning the basics of telling time but likes wearing a & # 34 ; big girl & # 34 ; watch . Pleased with the purchase !	1
I got this for my six year old as a way to reinforce the need to learn how to tell time . I was surprised with how large the watch seemed right out of the box but it is very easy to adjust the band to fit even the smallest wrist . The face is the perfect size for kids to see . The hands are labeled & # 34 ; minutes & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; hours & # 34 ; and of course the hours are marked around the face . The one complaint I have with the watch is that after you hit 30 on the minute labels , the minutes count down back down to zero so instead of saying & # 34 ; 35 past the hour & # 34 ; they must read it as & # 34 ; 25 til the next hour & # 34 ; -- not sure if this is the standard way of teaching time but we 've had to adjust our thinking a little bit to help our 6 year old interpret the time after 30 . Overall I am happy with the watch .	1
1 . I am going to state the pros and cons of this according to my eight year old daughter.PROS2 . The design is pretty.3 . It glows in the dark.4 . It makes telling , and learning how to tell time , time easy.5 . It comes on and off pretty easy.6 . It is lightweight.CONS1 . The band is not water resistant and so the watch has to be removed too often . ( It usually gets a little when she washes her hands . ) Then there is a long period of waiting for the band to dry out when she ca n't use the watch . The alternative is to remove the watch whenever there is a chance that it will get wet some how and that can be time consuming and runs the risk of her losing it if she places it somewhere at school , in a public bathroom etc ... 2 . The material of the wrist band itches her skin around her wrists if she wears it even slightly damp .	1
This cute watch and nice price . I was buy this product many time . This is just very nice gift all kids i bought it for them . Thay just love it and i still continue to buy it for them everytime when i go to Thailand .	1
I bought this for my daughter for xmas . She was delighted ! ! ! ! She has yet to actually *wear* it , but I think it 's adorable , and it the time it displays is in keeping with my perception of the time-space continuum , so , thumbs up ! I might take to wearing this myself , if it will fit around my adult wrist !	1
I sent this to my niece for Christmas and she loved it ! ! She actually received two watches for Christmas but likes this one better because it has a back light . She said she 's already learned to tell time .	1
It is a great little learning watch for small children . The strap is not as well made as one would expect .	1
I have had several Timex 's over the years and they 've all held up . Timex watches usually outlast the bands they come with ! We bought this for our daughter who was learning to tell time in First grade . All in all it 's a good watch and she likes the look of it . The only complaint we have is that the numbers for the seconds are really small , making it hard to read them . In a perfect world , those numbers would be a bit larger . All in all , a great watch for a young one learning to tell time .	1
I hope the watch lives up to the Timex reputation , although it did n't cost much was still running when I opened the package . I hope the battery last her more than a couple of months . I hate to see kids bummed out .	1
Bought this for my niece once before . She left it by mistake at summer camp and was heartbroken . Replaced it , and she is all smiles again . Great watch !	1
My niece loved it and it will help her learn to tell time easily . Perfect for a 3-4 year old .	1
This watch is very practical and lovely . It shows the date and when you press the side button , it dial lights up for easy viewing . I have a small wrist and it works for me . The band is embossed leather .	1
This is a really good looking ladies watch , plus it has my favorite feature of pushing the stem and having the watch face light up . This is especially great during a boring movie , play , opera , etc. , to tell you how much time you have left before you can get out . Or going on a trip and waking up in the middle of the night and being able to see the time . The gold finish with the pearlized face gives it a nice , expensive look . The band is nice , but I 'd like to see a grosgrain band for a dressier look . All over , This watach gets an A+ from me , because of the price and the great look combined .	1
I just purchased this watch for the third time in the last 13 years . I love it and it works great and forever . It is simple and easy to read . It has a date and indiglo light which are the two must haves I was looking for in a watch . I 've had to replace batteries and bands occasionally over the years but they last quite some time . I wear it daily so it gets lots of use . The other two I still have and technically they still work . One I must have bent the back metal cover when replacing the battery as it wo n't stay on . The watch works but the battery falls out ( my mistake , no fault of the product ) . The second still works but the indiglo light just went out recently . Again , I 've had it so many years I 'm not disappointed and will keep it as a backup for when the new one needs a new battery or band . The other 2 I purchased at K-Mart two separate times . K-Mart still sells this online but not in stores and is more expensive than Amazon . Walmart also has it online for similar price but I could n't get it as fast as here . I 'll continue to buy this watch whenever I need a new one as long as it is made .	1
I got this for my husband 's birthday . He works outside in horrible wet weather lots of times and needs something to quickly dry his boots overnight . THIS THING IS AWESOME AND I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO YOU ALL ! No more left over soggy/wet feet the next morning .	1
I live in Dallas Tx and ordered this item in spring thinking that I would put it away till the winter ( all 3 days of it in the DFW area ) . Two days after it arrived my twins came home with soaking wet shoes and socks after attempting to jump every puddle on their way home from school . Their shoes were so wet that I knew that it would take days to dry even if I used the shoe rack inside of my front loader dryer so I decided to take this out of the box , put it together and give it a go . Assembly was a breeze , no issue at all . I like that it comes with the hardware to mount it to the wall if that is how you want to use it , I just put it together with the leg stand . Initially I had planned not to use it till winter of 2011 and thought our youngest child would be old enough by then that it would not pose temptation or danger . I tossed around having it on top of the table till I knew how hot to the touch it was when operating but we decided to plug it in in the kitchen and just block it off while it was in use/turned on . We plugged it in and it did not feel hot , a little warm but not hot . After 15 minutes the same and after 30 minutes the same . We placed both boys shoes on the tines ( ? ) as shown in the instructions and left overnight . In the morning the boys shoes were completely dry , not hot or crisp and again I touched the unit and it was warm to the touch . I to buy a few more of these to have enough for the whole family 's gloves and boots .	1
This gets use year round , not just in the winter . In the winter , my wife and me both use it . She gets to put on nice warm shoes and socks , and I get to put on nice dry shoes and socks . I do n't have a problem staying warm outside in the winter , even when temperatures reach -40 . My problem is sweat . Shoes can only be washed so often , but it is nice to not have my shoes smell like they are rotting . This does not get hot enough to cause any damage . If you forget to turn it off and leave it on all day and night , you are n't going to burn your house down or triple your electric bill . I might get another one for guests at the house .	1
Bought for my son for his work boots and gloves . It dried his boots overnight . There is no fan , so no noise , and he just put it in his bedroom using the floor mounts . We had another boot drier with a fan that we used in the garage but this design is much better . You would think this would do nothing because you can touch the prongs when it is on and it barely feels warm . When I put my hand up inside when the boot was mounted on one of them though it was much warmer , but still not overly hot . Pretty neat how it works .	1
I am so happy with this boot dryer . As soon as my kids get home from school they put their boot on the dryer and turn it on . The next morning they have warm dry boots .	1
Have n't put them on yet but they do look sexy and ca n't wait to wear them . cant wait to put them on	1
It is weirdly difficult to find hold-up stocking that are n't designer . These look pretty , and they seem to be holding up pretty well without any snagging . I like to rinse them by hand just so they do n't get beat up in the washer or dryer .	1
Since i dont often weat stockings , i decided the cheaper , the better ! these are decent for the price- not the softest and if you catch it ( like any ) they rip . Came nicely packaged just like retail and fit me perfect ! ( 120 lbs , 5ft 6 )	1
These stockings by Leg Avenue are indeed very nice . For the purposes of full disclosure I will admit that I initially bought them to wear with a ( I was a nineteenth century Parisian courtesan ! ) costume . However , since then , I have found that they also work great for everyday use . I have worn them to work and also for more formal events . My beautiful stockings have not let me down yet ! Great price , perfect fit ! What more can a modern woman ask for ?	1
For heavy duty outdoors , these are the best pants for protecting your legs against scrapes . They are indispensible for logging and have saved my legs from a lot of pain . They are comfortable , especially after a few washes . I would recommend them to anyone .	1
Great work pants can put up with a lot of use and abuse I have had them for a few months working in mental shops and they show no wear and look brand new when I wash them . My only complaint is that they are a little on the baggy side and I find myself getting the cuffs snagged on things here and there when I work .	1
Pants fit great and plenty of room for comfort . Long lasting and great excellent works pants for any job for any work environment	1
these are some of my favorite pants for work . ive ripped most of my other ones and these have held up . the thick material provides protection and they fit great .	1
The double fronts last . They wear like iron and can feel like iron , they need softening . althoygh I would notr get anything else .	1
All Carhartts are sized differently no matter where you buy them and always have . Be careful that you know what size you wear for each different style before ordering . We knew ahead of time which style size we wanted , and amazon saved us the 60 mile drive to the nearest CalRanch to purchase these . This particular style is the closest to the hub 's actual size . They are PLENTY long . That being said . Carhartts are the only pants I buy my husband . They are as tough as they say . You can walk through a field of burrs and not feel them , and they are great in the snow . Highly recommended as long as you know your size , because EVERY STYLE IS DIFFERENT .	1
I 'm a welder and have put these to the test . They have held up better than every other pair of jeans I 've ever owned .	1
Great pants , I own several pairs ! The only Carhartts still made in the USA ! I 'm not in construction , I wear them as everyday pants . They hold up great , last for years . I also love that they do n't shrink in the dryer.My only gripe is that the inseam is a tad too long , but that 's how all Carhartt pants run for me so I 'm used to it .	1
Tough , well built , and comfortable . THESE PANTS FIT AS EXPECTED . As if you wear a 38 , order a 38 etc . worth the money and will outlast your regular jeans . Worth the investment .	1
I have the double front cargo pants from carhartt and these are quite a bit longer , which is good for me , because I am 6'8 & # 34 ; and finding something that fits like these is not easy . I just got these so I have not had a chance to verify the durability , but I can say that they are water resistant . These are probably the best standard work pants for wet weather and resisting stains . But I like how they are cut and the fit is ideal for wearing layers underneath but wearing them alone is fine as well . carhartt makes very practical work clothing and they tend to know what they are doing .	1
These Carhartt 's work great for upland bird hunting . We live in the desert and briars and thorns do n't penetrate the heavy canvas .	1
Just a little note to say these jeans are extremely stiff . I washed them and used extra fabric softener but they still are stiff . I am hoping once my husband starts to use them they will break in .	1
Bought these for my son for Christmas . He 's tough on his clothes and so really needs the double front for added durability . He lives in these jeans !	1
The pants fit great , but they run a a couple inches long ... .the 32 & # 34 ; length seem closer to 34 & # 34 ; ... maybe more ? ? Not really an issue when I put on my boots ... .These pants are certainly stiff ... .i hope they get a tad softer after a few wearings .	1
A great pair of jeans ! I 'm discontent with the design of jeans for women and decided to purchase jeans for men . They fit high on the waist ( which is wonderful . Something women jeans lack ! ) and this particular pair keeps me warm during the unpredictable Northeast winter weather.I will definitly purchase another pair .	1
Great pants . Incredibly durable . Clean up well . I picture these work pants lasting for years and years . Wo n't buy any other work pants .	1
These pants are awesome . Build quality is incredible they will last forever . The only complaint is they are long ! Much much longer then a standard 32 .	1
we are always buying him carhartt and the stores never have his size . i will be buying them on here from now on	1
MY HUSBAND FARMS , WELDS , CLEARS FENCE LINES , CUTS TIMBER , ETC AND ALWAYS WEARS OUT OR RIPS THE DENIM JEANS DOWN THE THIGHS WHILE THE REST OF THE FABRIC LOOKS LIKE NEW . GOT 2 PAIR ( ONE ON AND ONE IN THE WASH ) JUST TO SEE HOW THEY 'D WEAR . AT LAST A PAIR OF JEANS EVEN HE COULD N'T RUIN . TIGHTLY WOVEN DUCK MATERIAL WITH DOUBLE THIGH FABRIC WO N'T GET RIPPED UP BY BRIARS AND UNDERBRUSH . WO N'T FRAY FROM 80 # HAY BALES RUBBING AGAINST HIM AS HE CARRIES THEM . DIESEL FUEL ROLLS OFF THE TIGHTLY WOVEN FABRIC AND BACKHOE GREASE SCRAPES RIGHT OFF . REAR POCKETS ARE TACKED ON SO TIGHT EVEN GETTING CAUGHT ON TREE BRANCHES AS HE 'S RUNNING THE BACKHOE WONT TEAR THEM . THESE JEANS WEAR LIKE IRON AND LAST LONGER THAN 4-6 PAIRS OF HIS DENIM ONES . YOU 'LL PAY MORE FOR THEM BUT STILL SAVE MONEY SINCE THEY LAST SO LONG .	1
My husband loves these ; they take a lot longer to rip out the knee ( he is a licensed Contractor ) than the ones without the double knees.I get these for him all the time and this time I was able to get them for way less ( $ 10.00 less each ) than if I went to a local store ( who never have his size anyhow and have to order them in for him ) . And they had his size on Amazon and for a great price . Which is good , because it takes him about 6 months to get through the knees . And he usually wears them 6 months past that because they are so expensive.Anyhow , recommended for Construction Workers who do not like to wear knee guards .	1
This watch give great timing , and the only reason it needs to be replaced every couple of years is that the thin strap breaks .	1
This is a gorgeous and `` delicate '' looking watch . I can read it without my glasses and so far it works . I 've had trouble with Timex in the past , so I hope this holds up well . It is very pretty and can go with casual or a nice dress in the evening . Update : Do n't run it through the wash cycle ! Hah . Darn .	1
I love the simplicity of this watch ! I wear it nearly every day ! This replaced the last Cavatina watch that I had for 10 years but lost while on vacation ! I have small hands and wrists and so the thin band is perfect ! A must have watch for every woman !	1
This is a beautiful time piece from timex . It keeps very good time , and it is eleglance proves it . I love it and would buy another .	1
I bought this for a gift for my mother in laws 82nd birthday and she says she loves it and can see the dial clearly and that it is a pretty watch .	1
I love this watch . I needed something small but easy to read for work as I need to tuck it under my scrub sleeve . This is perfect for that and is also water resistant to if I get some on when I wash my hands it does n't matter . Even though it is very small it is very easy to read . And the price was great .	1
Purchased this sleek looking watch for my wife . She is hard on watches and I didnt want a $ 1500 Omega that would be scratched and destroyed a year later . This watch exudes classic femininity and looks stylish in work , play or sporting environments . Very reasonable cost with the only downside that it is water resistant but not water proof . It can probably withstand a shower but obviously not diving in the ocean . My wife received it and enjoys it , so happy all around . Would buy another one a few years down the road , when the current one gives out . Nice buy .	1
The color of this watch is a rich color and true to the color displayed in the picture . The face is easy to read . The band is made from quality leather . I have really small wrists and this watch fits well .	1
I have n't bought a Timex in years , so I did n't know what to expect . I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box . As you may expect from the price , it 's not a fancy watch , but it 's the perfect watch if you are looking for a simple and inexpensive watch . I wear mine every day to work and it 's quality is what you expect from Timex . The strap is skinny which is perfect for my small ( 6 1/2 inch ) wrists . I did not even have to have holes added . The face is oval and gold tone . If you are looking for a cute watch with a small face this is a watch you should consider . At it 's price , I would definitely buy another if it came is silver tone .	1
Bought this as a gift several months ago . Came earlier than expect with the right amount of packaging . My girlfriend loves it and wears it to work everyday . So far so good .	1
Its has a nice design for girls.. but I do n't know why , this watch will late about 1 or 2 minutes a day.. but the indiglo light is working properly ( compare the lights with other timex watch ) .. or maybe I should change the battery.. I do n't know..	1
My daughter picked out this watch herself and it is great . The Indiglo light allows here to read it at night . The little butterfly that moves around with the second hand it cute too . And the fact that it 's waterproof lets me not worry if she wears in in the shower .	1
I looked for a long time for a 'starter ' watch for my daughter . I thought this was the best of what I could find . First the pros : the numbers are large , the second hand is a butterfly , and it lights up . Cons : the wrist band is adjustable which really means that it is never tight enough and slides around a lot . I was hoping she would want to wear it every day , but she really does n't like that it 's not secure on her wrist .	1
After years of trying to teach my ( now 8-year old ) daughter to tell time , this watch was the thing that did the trick . It 's got a pink hour hand , which matches with the pink hours printed on the watch face , and a purple minute hand , which matches with the 0-60 minutes printed on the watch face . She just matches them up ( pink hour hand goes with pink numbers , purple minute hand goes with purple numbers ) and she knows the time.It 's perfectly sized for little wrists- the band is elastic with a little metal slider that allows for the watchband to be made smaller or bigger- and can be slid on and off . It 's also water resistant , so my daughter can wear it in the pool and in the shower with no worries.Thank you , Timex , for finally answering the question & # 34 ; what time is it *now* ? & # 34 ;	1
A birthday gift for my five year old grand niece . She is learning how to tell time , and loves the butterflies .	1
Nice Gift for the young lady in your life . Very Pretty and I am sure will make her happy . Thanks	1
We have had many of these watches over the course of the last 13 years and 4 kidsI LOVE the following : -if they loose it , Timex will replace it-it is analog ... .kids need to learn this before going digital..it 's vital ! -it 's sooo cute-the price ... quality , and it is able get wet so the child does not have to take on and off constantlyMy only gripe on this watch is the band mechanism to secure the length of the strap . It seems to wiggle over time , or come loose . I wish it was able to hold it a bit & # 34 ; tighter & # 34 ; . We graduate our kids to a Timex Ironman digital once this has ran it 's course .	1
My daughter learned how to tell time very quickly and easily with this watch . She likes the slip on strap - the material is comfy to wear and the adjustable strap makes it easy to size her wrist ( she 's 9 but has a tiny wrist ) . The butterfly that moves around as it counts seconds is a big hit ! I was concerned the butterfly would make it difficult to read the watch but that is n't the case at all .	1
These watches are wonderful for children learning the nuance of time . There are small numbers at the edges reminding them that if the big hand is at 10 , it is 50 minutes after the hour , etc . They are comfortable , and inexpensive enough that the kids can wear them to school without worry . They are NOT water proof , so need to be taken off before showering or swimming , but can endure almost all other activities . My granddaughters wear theirs always and I believe it helped them to learn time quickly and painlessly . The batteries are long lasting . They come in a wide variety of patterns and colors for both girls and boys . You really ca n't go wrong with these watches .	1
I bought two of these for the grand kids and they loved them . A very nice watch ! Well worth the money . I highly recommend this watch .	1
The band is easy to adjust , it 's soft and pretty . My daughter loves the glow feature . And it even took a trip through our HE washing machine and SURVIVED ! lol .	1
This is a great and fun watch . Love the expandable , adjustable band and the fun second hand . Perfect for small children .	1
We gave this watch to a six-year-old girl for her birthday and , according to her mother , she has n't taken it off yet .	1
The girl 's love it . They can tell time so much easier with hands the same color as the numbers The little butterfly for a second hand adds the finishing touch to a nice first timepiece .	1
It is well made . The wrist band is elastic and adjustable like the straps of a backpack , so you can create the perfect fit you kid . It has the Indiglo light , which my daughter loves . It lights up like mommy 's . It is water resistant , which is a good things since kids are bound to get it wet . It is also very easy to set the time on it as well .	1
Beautiful watch . Velcro fastening . The second hand is a butterfly and the little tail follows or flowers follow the butterfly around the watch . Very unique .	1
Timex makes the best watches . This is so cute . My granddaughter has just learned to tell time , so the watch for Christmas was a big hit . She loves it . It is very well made . Keeps perfect time . Great watch .	1
Timex Kids ' Color Indiglo Hearts Stretch Band Watch # T7B111 - I have been wearing these kids ' watches during the summer for several years . They are inexpensive and have cloth straps , so when the straps wear out , I feel no regret about tossing them and buying replacements . I got several in different colors to coordinate with my wardrobe . When the weather cools off , I put them away until next summer . They 've been very reliable and easy and cheap to get the batteries repaired , including at Wal-Mart .	1
Have used this sterling silver polishing cloth for years . Connoisseurs is the best for removing dark tarnishwith white cloth and polishing to high shine with pink cloth . Much better on your sterling jewelry than theliquid , too powerful cleaners which damage the finish.Everyone who has sterling MUST have one of these cloths . Also , cloths are large with a lot of cleaning service .	1
I have liquid silver cleaner also , but like that i can shine with the cloth even when i am wearing the jewelry . I use it on a necklace that i rarely take off .	1
Do n't even think it was the same type . Says it is a certain brand and that is not true or there is no marking I 've seen as that brand . Connis ...	1
I just tried this product on my silver jewelry that was tarnished , and after just 10 second on using this product my rings looks like new , so I 'm happy with my purchase ,	1
I 've always purchased jewelry silver polishing cloths at the jewelers , but this is an even better cloth than the ones I 've bought in the past . Very reasonably priced , large size and excellent at cleaning and polishing silver ! I highly recommend this polishing cloth !	1
I am quite pleased with this product to clean my silver jewelry . My jewelry store advised that I should only use a cloth to polish my silver bracelets and necklaces , as silver jewelry can be made with many different types of silver . I am happy with the two step cloth system ; one to clean and the second to polish . The price is reasonable , and there is n't an odd smell or mess when using the cloth .	1
this cloth is a wonderful and simple way to clean your sterling silver jewelry that has become tarnished from every day use or non-use . the cloth is both soft , sturdy and thick . a great cleaning tool !	1
The best to shine your silver . Nothing better that this rag . If you have lots of silver like I do , this is a must have .	1
This polishing cloth is better than the one I purchased before it . The chemically-treated interior cloth takes all the tarnish off quickly , and the outer layer polishes to a shine . It was shipped on time . The only negative I have is that it is over-priced . After I purchased it , I found it for several dollars less in a big-box store . Next time , I 'll buy it there .	1
If you want something to walk around the park , or when weather is hot & humid ( like in Asia ) , this is THE sandal to grab .	1
This is my second pair of KEEN sandals and it will not be my last . They fit perfectly and are so comfortable . I wear them in and out of the water as well , and they give me secure and confident footing on wet , slippery surfaces .	1
These sandals are super-comfortable and I wear them for everything , including bike riding , walking , and vigorous stair-climbing at the gym . They give some support and stability like running shoes shoes but are as comfortable as sandals . I even used them for running a couple of miles once and I got blisters , but no worse than the wearing-in period of some shoes that I 've had and I think my feet could get used to running in them regularly ; certainly hiking would be OK . They are comfortable when wet with some texture on the upper soles so they do n't feel slimy or slippery when it rains . The quick lace-up feature lets me adjust the fit easily from a bit loose to an overall tighter fit without uncomfortable binding areas like I get when I lace up running shoes too fast . I got them in black and after wearing them regularly for over a month they are still in good enough shape that I could probably return them ( which I obviously do n't plan to do ) even though I 'm usually very hard on my shoes.Sizing : I usually wear a size 6 extra wide or a 6 1/2 medium and my running shoes usually split at the sides of the toe box if I wait to long to replace them . Based on the reviews I got a 7 . It felt fine in the toe box , actually a little tight around the arch but that went away ( I guess there is some give , which I would not expect from the synthetic materials ) and maybe a little roomier than I would like in the heel . If you have normal feet you should probably get this half a size up and wide feet get it a full size up .	1
It 's just me , but I seem to like the regular Venice better than the H2 . I think the H2 is hotter , live in Florida , and the fit is just a little off.I do really like this shoe . It 's very comfortable and has that Keen style . Can walk long with them . Very good arch support , and you can wash them in the machine.Pretty darn good .	1
Keen is one of the main brands of shoes that I wear this is my 4th pair these are great for beaches , hanging out or just casual walking but not for trailing.Pros : They are comfortable I do n't have any problem at all with the fit and they are supportive at least for my feet . slipping them on and off is pretty easy for me so that 's not a problem . Love that color combo ! They protect my toes well as most Keens do . They have nice treads.Cons : THEY GET STINKY ! I do n't usually have problems with foot odor at all , but an attempt at bicycling , or long hikes in these and EWWWWW ! I find myself washing them frequently to avoid the odor .	1
These cute , red , go anywhere shoes also fit perfectly . I ca n't believe I 'm wearing sandals and not lace-up shoes with orthotics ! They are so lightweight and allow my feet to rock and bend , putting a spring in my step . I have n't tried washing them in the machine , yet , but I 'm sure it will be fine . Way above my expectations .	1
Love these shoes/sandals . Comfortable from the moment you put them on . They can be worn on almost all terrains , are very durable and provide a lot of support . I own 3 pairs so far .	1
These shoes are the most comfortable water/hiking shoes I have ever worn . I ordered my usual size and they fit beautifully . I plan to use them for white-water rafting and canyon hiking . They arrived on time and were everything the ad said they would be . I highly recommend them to anyone wanting this type of shoe .	1
These have got to be the best hiking sandals ever . I put them on and went for a hike , just perfect very comfortable , and the fit could n't be better . I usually wear a 8w or a 8.5 medium . I bought a 9m and it fits very well . Plenty of room for my wide foot , and not too long . So I think that means the 9m fits like an 8 wide ... . Hmmm	1
I was hoping for more arch support for my high arches , but the footbed seemed fairly flat to me . However , if you have flat feet , this amount of arch support is probably fine ( I would call it minimal , but I suppose it is all a matter of perspective ) . Otherwise , the shoes seemed well made and comfortable and they easily accommodated my wide feet and narrow heels .	1
I like these a lot . They are comfortable and very sturdy . I have trouble with pronation , especially in my right foot . These keep me walking more like I should be , almost like having linear platform built into them . My ONLY complaint is that they run a little small . I do n't mind paying extra for good shoes like this , but I wish they were more true to size . UPDATE : I wore these all summer long , and it did n't take long before these fit my foot really well , and were my go-to shoes most every day , leaving my 50+ other pairs of shoes in the dark closet !	1
I am so glad that i listened to the reviewers . I am a true size 10 in all my shoes but ordered a half size larger for these and i am so glad i did that ! These fit perfect ! ! I wore them last evening on a bicycle night ride and it was muddy and wet - i showered with these shoes on to clean them off and they are as good as new ! ! I want to wear flip flops while biking but that 's unsafe so i found these are even more comfortable because they give support , let air in for coolness and have toe protection too - plus they look really sporty !	1
My adorable free spirit daughter absolutely loves these shoes ! They are perfect for hiking , festivals or even a casual day around town . Her style must is comfort and all her cute little shorts and tees go great with them ... and if it even matters , her feet look teensy !	1
I have several pair of a no longer made Keen `` flip style '' which I love , but I love this shoe even better . It has the same supportive sole , the toe protection and the secureness of the heel strap . I love the flips for easy on , but for really walking around - this shoe is perfect for me.I have a normal to slightly high arch and a squarish foot . I ordered my normal Keen size 9 and fit was perfect . I threw caution to the wind and wore these 3 days in a row after receiving them - most of the days , tromping around doing errands . I had 1 spot that was resolved by a nail trim and that was that . I expected more irritation from the webbing but NOT ! A bit more effort to put on than a slide or flip but not that much so they work for a quick out with my dog.I bought these on a `` special '' and wish I 'd bought another or 2 more pair .	1
I am glad Amazon allows returns on these shoes . I ordered my regular size and taking the advice of the keenfootwear site I also ordered a half size larger than I normally wear as their website advised that this style runs about half size small . I have a pair of 8.5 Keen leather shoes that I like very much so that is my usual size . The size 9 in these sandals fits me better than the 8.5 in this style sandal . I do n't want the sandal to be super snug on my foot . I measured the 9 sandal against my 8.5 leather Keen and they are the same length and width . The 8.5 sandal is smaller than my 8.5 Keen leather shoe . The foot bed on the sandal seems to provide some arch support and I love the nice wide toe box . It also has a little give to it so it does not feel hard under my foot . I am looking forward to wearing sandals that protect my toes and also cover them from view . My toenails are not my best feature . I noticed that my doctor wears these sandals all of year round in her office so I thought I would give them a try . Her foot was injured when her horse stepped on it ( she was wearing riding boots at the time , not sandals obviously ) and she told me these Keen sandals are the most comfortable shoes she has ever worn even with the residual pain and damage to her foot . I have flat feet and bunions so I figured I would give these a try . I love my Keen leather shoes so I expect these sandals to become favorites as well . I like the fact that they can be worn in the water as I am often walking in creeks with my dogs and also have to walk over rocky ground down to the lake to swim . Keen brand shoes are so comfortable you can forget that you are even wearing shoes and that is how shoes should feel , completely comfortable . I love Keens and I am grateful that Amazon will allow me to purchase two sizes and return the size that did not fit as well . Amazon seems to understand that buying shoes online is hit or miss and there are going to be returns . With Prime membership the return shipping is free . Got ta love that !	1
Keen shoes/sandals have been my all time favorite for comfort and wearability . The sizing has not been an issue with me - I think they 're true to size . I understand some folks have issues with them getting stinky after a few wears , but thankfully I do n't seem to have that problem . Definitely recommend !	1
This is my 10th pair of Keen Venice sandals . I have both H2 and the leather . They are perfect walking shoes for me . I am so happy to get a great red pair again , I left my old red ones in Spain , and have wanted a pair since .	1
I do love the shoes , but you better think about ordering a half size up . I did n't take the advice from another review and ordered my regular size . I am returning them for a larger size . I just wish Shoe Mall had free return and exchange like some other companies do . I am looking forward to wearing these on my next trip .	1
I already know that I love this product ! This is the third pair of these sandals that I have purchased through Amazon.com . The shoes fit perfectly ( I have a narrow heel and wide instep ) , comes in several great colors and is washable ! ! ! What 's not to love , except the price ? ! Fortunately , by going through Amazon.com , I 've been able to save about $ 20 off of retail . Still expensive , but worth it .	1
Wow ! My new Keen Venice H2s JUST arrived . I had to go write a review right away , because I was stunned at the amazing comfort ... right out of the box ! ! I 'm normally a flip-flop girl but will be doing a bit of hiking on vacation and needed something that could support my bad feet better . If I ca n't wear a flip-flop , these are the way to go !	1
These shoes meet the requirement of my foot surgeon ! This is a very difficult task ! They are very comfortable on my feet , the look great and they are very safe ! I love these shoes ! This was a very good by for me ! I have worn them all around while traveling to the Grand Canyon ! Believe me there was a lot of walking to do ! I felt protected , safe , comfortable and attractive all in one ! Amazing shoes ! Thank you !	1
Comfort ! Wear them for all day outings , or short runs here and there , perfect fit and sizing is in sync . Recommend these sandals for anyone looking for style , comfort .	1
Bought these to go to Bali in February since a friend highly recommended them . Decided to first wear these on a weekend vacation to Monterey and Carmel with lots of walking . I put them on straight out of the box ( with thin socks as it was a cool day ) and walked miles in complete comfort . I saw the other reviews that said go up a size but I ordered my regular size and they fit fine . I usually wear a 7 or 71/2 and got the 71/2 . They are a bit wide in the toe box and I have very high arches but so far it 's been OK. Love the Sweet grape orchid color . Cute and fun shoes . They are going to Bali with me !	1
I love this sandal ! This is my third pair . I wear them for rafting a few times per week all summer and am wearing a pair for house shoes right now . Heck , I even wear them for dress shoes ! The fit is spot on . The heel height is a bit higher than many sandals , which I like , and I 'm able to glue a lift in the right shoe for my short leg . They are very durable : The ones I 've worn for over a year are have the leather straps ( not designated H2O , but & # 34 ; waterproof & # 34 ; ) , like the pair being reviewed , and have held up exceptionally well against frequent exposure to water and sand . The soles are sticky enough for walking on rocks , and the heels of my older pair show very little wear , even though I walk on pavement with them quite a bit . The jester red/persimmon color is very pretty and matches many of my river , yoga and casual outfits .	1
I buy KEENS every summer for my daughters . The comfort and arch support are wonderful in these shoes . I like this style particularly because there seems to be less material - my daughter 's feet sweat a lot and get very hot so less material allows more air to circulate which makes her happy . Speaking of sweaty feet , these shoes can easily be thrown in the washing machine for cleaning : - )	1
They have been getting hard to find ; but I was so happy to see these on sale at the end of the season . I have tried them on and they fit like all my other Keen 's . Ca n't wait for next summer to start showing them off .	1
I just love these , they fit great and work for everything . Very durable -- have had them for a long time now and they look new . I wear them without socks in Hawaii and for household work requiring toe protection . With socks for colder weather . I am a total Keen convert -- best all-purpose shoes I 've ever had .	1
nothing bad to say about keen sandals or about keen shoes in general . they are the shoes that my podiatrist recommended and i 'm so glad that he did . i love everything about all keen shoes ESPECIALLY the colors !	1
Sandals fit well and are SO COMFORTABLE ! ! I wear with ankle socks sometimes and without in the colder weather . The larger toebox is awesome and I really like the arch support.Ca n't beat these sandals .	1
Sturdy , secure shoe can be worn in water and out . Love the color and construction . Amazed how stabilizing the design is for sure footing !	1
I actually bought these from another site because of a 20 % coupon code and free shipping , although I did have to wait longer ... ..but anyways ... .Might I say this blue color is fabulous and uber cute ! ! ! My feet are slightly wide . .. not wide enough for wide shoes , but sometimes look puffy in mediums . Mt size is a 9.I would say the 9.5 is perfect fit . Not too snug , even after walking 2 miles and my feet swell a bit , they were not too snug and still felt good . Plenty of toe room too.The bottoms are a little more plasticy feeling , so to speak , than I expected but still comfortable.As a woman who has made the decision comfort is a priority but I still want a little cute , I 'm really happy with this purchase , perfect for the chic hippie , lolBottom line . ..I world suggest 1/2 size larger and they are fine for a slightly wider foot.Happy Shopping : - )	1
This is the 6th pair of Keen shoes I have owned but my first pair of sandals . I love them . I tried on all the different styles in the store and these were the most comfortable . They are great for walking in the summer because they offer comfort and support but are vented more than sneakers and IMO look better with shorts.I wore these to Sleeping Bear Dunes on our vacation last week ( big mistake ) and sand got pretty heavily imbedded in the foot beds . I took a toothbrush to them when we got home and it all came out pretty effortlessly . I love that they are machine washable too.Another great thing about Keens is that they come in size 10.5 ! Most brands skip 10.5 and go right to 11 . I am a 10.5 and these run true to size . 11 would be too big.I love these every bit as much as the shoes I 've purchased . I wear out every pair I get , I use them so much .	1
not as comfortable as old style dansko sandals , for the money , I 've had better shoes , I normally wear a 9 and had to go up to a 9.5 . I like keen slides better than their sandals .	1
Note - I usually wear a 9 and have to wear a 10 in these ! Once you know the sizing , though - they 're awesome . I wore them for 2 weeks straight and hiked all over Guatemala and Honduras and the Bay Islands . Not a single blister or back ache . They 're amazing . You do n't slip on wet surfaces , your feet stay in them , your toes are protected . The only drawback is that it 's a little hard to get a stone or sand out , but that 's a decent tradeoff for comfortable feet in my opinion . If you get them dirty you can hose or scrub them off and they look great - they can really take a beating.And they actually look cute on - I get tons of compliments whenever I wear them , which is often . They 've become my go-to sandals now ( what flip flops ? ) . They 're worth every penny .	1
I had my other pair of Keen 's for 3 years and I wore them almost daily weather in Chicago permitting . Well , one of my doc 's took a look at them and told me I needed a new pair , the shoes were worn out on the bottom . That was last Wed evening . I ordered my new pair on Thursday and the shoes arrived on Friday . Amazon prime is the best deal ever ! Okay , back to the shoes . I wear a 71/2 in shoes but read the reviews and ordered up to a 8 . 8 fits perfectly . I chose the color that was the cheapest , yes , some of the colors were $ 100 and well , I do n't think a color is worth an extra $ 30 bucks . My shoes were $ 67 bucks and I hope they last 3 years ! !	1
I love love love love these . I have two pairs and they 're almost all I wear all summer . They do run large . I 'm usually about a 7.5 , and I bought a 6.5 ( slightly tight ) and a 7 ( slightly loose ) . They are so , so wonderful for casual hikes/walks , especially if there 's water involved . They do n't work for me for all day , though , I get horrible foot cramps if I walk in them for over 2hrs straight . So I always bring an extra pair of shoes to trade out if needed . The other thing is , if you wear them all day , they start to stink . Like super-strong , super-nasty foot-sweat disgusting stink . And heck , keen might have fixed this in the couple models since mine . So , I do n't wear them all day , or make sure that if I do it 's for some outdoor and watery activity . I love how these wash in the washing machine . And they 're almost in the condition I bought them in , so well have they held up . My husband also got a pair ( the men 's ) and one of the straps is starting to pull up from the leather , but he 's really hard on things with his man-ness . He does absolutely love his , too , though .	1
These are the most comfortable shoes I 've ever worn ! I can wear them walking , hiking , and even in the lake !	1
This is a shoe for travel , I read other reviews and decided it was what I needed for a visit to Easter Island.Sand , water , rocks , hiking , slick rocks and such , heat , comfort . Wow these are just great for everything and my feet are happy at the end of the day . Remember to put suntan lotion you the tops of your feet as mine are now look like a checker board from the sun . I took them on to Thailand and even in the city they were great . You ca n't go wrong with these sandals .	1
Always can count on Keen shoes for a perfect fit , great support !	1
I read the reviews of Venice Hs and the Whisper series . Even comparing the styles by picture , this appears sturdier altho clunkier looking ... and it is so in person . HOWEVER , This is meant to be an active outdoor shoe and for that purpose I love this more thanmy old open toed active sandal of a different famous brand . I love the toe protection . I love that you can have the option of this light gray in certain colors rather than the black . It ' lets air thro nicely ( It 's a 4 because some small pepples that come in are hard to shake of without removing the shoe ) and I love this green but it is more pastel than I had wanted ... It 's comfortable and easy to slip on and off . i use it to walk the dog daily even after a rain . I also got it at a much cheaper price ( almost $ 40.00 lower ) because I bought it early spring . The prices rose thereafter . Thanks Keen for a great product .	1
Love this shoe . Put it on out of the box and wore it all day . Plan to make it my all round shoe on my upcoming trip to the beach .	1
These are so comfortable ! ! I wore them to work and had been wearing these Alpine similar sandals before - needless to say the Keens are so much more comfortable . My feet felt great at the end of the day .	1
wife really likes these sandals , and keen allways fit even better and are more comfortable than expected of any shoes we purchased	1
Update July 14 , 2013 I 'm back for another pair in a different color . This summer I have worn these to the beach , the mountains , through streams , puddles and daily life . They have decent traction in wet conditions . I found the sole does break in a little , conforming to your foot . They clean up easily with a quick rinse , still look new and provide great support . They stay on . I get compliments on these things . I still find the look an acquired taste , but pretty is as pretty does , and that makes these sandals absolutely beautiful . Got the Petrol blue/twilight this time , a good blue to go with denim.Original review : This is one of many pairs of Keen sandals I own . They sell more heavy duty soled ( NewportH2 ) and lighter soled ( Turin water shoes ) sandals in these water sandal type . They are all comfortable and have their uses , but these are my favorite all around . They are a little more open , yet the straps all hit in perfect places in relation to my toes . The soles have a nice flex that is thick enough to make a bluestone driveway a comfortable walk . They offer good support to avoid re-injury if you have suffered plantar fascititis . They stay on in the surf . My only complaint is that they will pick up sand and rocks ( and stuff ) while in the surf . Wear flip flops at the beach instead . These are my favorites for everything else . They are snug to pull on . Once on they disappear on your feet . Do n't get better than that . I also find the red is lovely , does not show dirt . If you have never worn Keen sandals before , these are a good style to start with . I usually wear size 8.5W in shoes , these I went up 1/2 size ( to size 9 ) and they are perfect . They will accommodate a wide foot , and the lacing will tighten to fit a slimmer low volume foot . The protective toe I have learned to love as it keeps much debris from between my toes when walking through the woods and fields .	1
I have had Keens before and I love the comfort and your price was absolutely great ! I Would buy them again	1
lovely colour , great fit as usual . Ca n't go wrong with Keen really , they are consistently excellent and consistent in fit too .	1
These sandals are extremely functional and protect your foot while walking or hiking . Although they have a rubber interior , my feet remained cool and did n't develop any blisters . Prices vary considerably depending on the color/size you select . Mine were under $ 50 which was a great buy .	1
Not really my style but I needed something very comfortable to wear to Disney World ... These fit the bill and now I LOVE them . I am a high heel convert , happy feet ! : )	1
I love these shoes . I first ordered my true size but it was just slightly too short and had to swap for a half size up . They are so comfortable . I even wear them with socks in the winter ! They have good arch support and look really cute with jeans . Highly recommend !	1
These shoes are comfy and fit true to size . Good fit for my wide foot . I have a hard time finding shoes too fit that I can wear all day .	1
These shoes are great , I live in them , and them beingwashable is fantastic . They are wearing very well andthe color is very pretty .	1
They fit perfectly . They are made to fit so as you wear them stretch . They are so comfortable . I received many compliments on my shoes . I wore them all day and my feet did n't hurt .	1
Got this jacket right before the polar vortex hit the midwest blocked the wind and insulated me from the elements very well .	1
& # 34 ; That 's what she said & # 34 ; jokes aside , this jacket is super duper warm . It is made big so you can put layers undereath , though it was a bit TOO big for me really . The sleeves were too long . It was also a bit stiff . But overall , tough and will hold up to working conditions like not other !	1
My husbands choice for decades . He ca n't stand the cold and this takes care of the problem , and holds up to the hard work he does .	1
This iconic American company makes tough outerwear for tough SOB 's . I got this one as a hand me down from my dad . It does everything you ask of it keeps you warm and protected in tough conditions . I use it for everything from winter logging & hunting to wrenching on my truck & shoveling the snow .	1
I own the the Waterproof Breathable Jacket - J175 - as well as this one , and love this jacket more ! It has deeper pockets and seems more insulated . I feel like I am wearing a blanket , it 's so warm ! It also gives you a presence when you wear it - it has a great look ! I highly recommend this one .	1
BOUGHT IT TO REPLACE AN OLDER ONE . THE FIT IS SLIGHTLY SMALL . I AM A 44 SUIT AND USUALLY TAKE A LARGE BUT IN THIS I NEED AN XL . KEEPS ME WARM AND IS RUGGED AND WELL MADE . LOOKS GOOD FOR WORK OR CASUAL USE . AM BUYING A SECOND ONE	1
Thinner than the old Carhartts I grew up with but it is every bit as durable and it is so warm I have to wait until I am on my way out to put it on or I will start to sweat.Anyone that complains about this being too stiff is just being silly . This coat will last for decades . It is built to last , quality snaps , stitching , material , and a zipper the size of my thumb with tracks not much smaller . If you complain about stiffness you might as well say & # 34 ; I 'm so upset my jacket has a 20 years of heavy use lifespan & # 34 ; . If it is that big of a deal to you then just put it in a laundry bag with some shoes and coldwash it . After a few washes the shoes should have broken it in nicely.Under the sleeves it has some stretchy cuffs to keep the cold air from going up your arm which is wonderful.The pockets are very deep and clearly designed not to lose your stuff and be able to reach in them with gloves on.The coat is also just big enough to accommodate myself with a hoodie , shirt , and underarmor on . Most coats fail to take into account it is winter and in cold areas you need to wear layers but not this one ! The cons : The hood ( www.amazon.com/dp/B002QG0EEI ) is sold separately and does not come attached . While the snaps are Carhartt last forever quality the fact remains it could possibly come off one day . The good news is a tailor will sew it on for you very creaply . I suggest going with a double stitched pattern like : ______________XXXXXXXXXXXX -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -The flap over the zipper is Velcro . While it is great Velcro that stuff does n't last forever and it will wear out one day . Once again very cheap to have a tailor put some strong snaps on the Velcro Pads.I like my coats to run a little long so if I lift my arms reaching for stuff it still covers my torso . As this is a work coat I feel that is a reasonable demand to expect this coat to meet.Overall : Wonderful coat and it only has a few issues , most of which are very easy to fix .	1
This jacket runs a bit big , but I expect that , dressing in multiple layers for -40 wind chills in WI . I have found that this jacket is best suited for sub-zero temperatures though , as anything above zero with this jacket causes me to overheat .	1
Bought this coat for my husband for Christmas & he loved it . However I bought the medium & he did need the large . Once we got the large it fit perfectly . It 's extremely cold outside where we live but not when you have this coat on . I 'm even jealous that he has such a fantastic coat that will last him for decades to come . Best purchase for him in a long time .	1
Never GOT this item - but gave a 1 STAR because the replies from the SUPPLIER was GREAT.They tried to send the item more than once.My $ was refunded in a timely manner too.It was a shame I never got it for my daughter - it would of looked great with her OUTFIT for Dr. Seuss WEEK at school.Most original.Maybe next time .	-1
I bought this product a little over a year ago . Now that I am done with it , I wanted to sell it . I put it on eBay and Craigslist . They had their lawyers contact the sites and have them remove the listing.Apparently in the tiny 4-point font disclaimers on the package it says that the license is not transferable , so you ca n't sell it as a used item after you 're done with it.Total crap !	-1
Have they lost their minds ? ? ! ! Over 100 $ for a costume ! ! Amazon , you are an idiot . This is an inexpensive costume . It better include a meeting with Tom Hanks for that price .	-1
This would have worked fine if the buckles had bee the same as on my luggage , but they were n't , so I had no use for the thing .	-1
If you 're trying to connect two 50 lb suitcases together , this is not the strap to use . Look for the Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker , Black , One Size.This simple buckle and strap looks easy to use but it is n't . When you 're in a hurry and you need to adjust the tension on this strap , you 're fussing around with it in baggage claim . The Travelon Multi-Bag Stacker has extra `` tongue '' to quickly pull on ( like a backpack strap ) so you can clip , pull to tighten , and GO.This Lewis N Clark strap is good for light loads and smaller bags . For larger ones , this one was a pain to use . You get what you pay for . Choke up the extra $ 5 and get the Travelon , you 'll be glad you did .	-1
I ordered the jet pack for my 6 year old grandson for Halloween 2011 to go with his Buzz Lightyear costume . Unfortunately , when we blew up the jet pack the day before Halloween and my grandson wore it for about an hour , it began to deflate quickly . We found a hole but were unable to patch it up so that it stayed inflated since the break was in a crease in the plastic material . Luckily , I was able to find and purchase another jet pack at a nearby store in my city which held up fine on Halloween .	-1
I expected a lot more from a & # 34 ; wrist computer & # 34 ; selling for almost 250.00 , and the Military version for $ 300 . First of all the visibility of the display is much too dark . The images of the X-Lander on the Amazon and Suunto websites have been enhanced to the point that a case could be made for false advertising . Secondly , the instructions to set the numeric values ( meters vs feet , etc . ) are n't even covered in the instructions that come with the watch , you have to download the full set of instructions to figure that out , then some of the fields used to set the values are so small and located in such bizarre locations , that even with 20/20 vision , I had to use an illuminated magnifying glass to see , then set the values . Thirdly , the backlight feature is useless in low light or bright daylight . It is only good for pitch black darkness ... much too dim , but is probably the same as their military version , which has to be at a low level to keep the wearer from getting shot ! Fourth , ( probably for the same reason ) the alarm is not loud enough , especially if you are wearing the X-Lander under a couple of layers of clothing . As others have stated , it should not be counted upon as a means to wake you from sleep . Fifth , the barometric trend indicator is totally unreadable ... too small and too dim to see under normal circumstances unless you also happen to be carrying a small foldout magnifying glass ( which , as it turns out , I do carry while trekking ) . Finally , the feature navigation is not intuitive , meaning if you do not use the features and sub-features regularly , good luck with remembering how some of the functions are accessed , and turned on and off , unless you carry the instructions on your person.I am going to keep this & # 34 ; wrist computer & # 34 ; for trekking , but it will not be the watch on my wrist for everyday casual use . That honor will still go to my Wenger Military . Because of that , there should be a way to shut off the X-Lander ( short of removing the battery ) so the battery does not run down while it 's in the safe ... still hoping to find out how to do that ... does n't have a stem to pull out like a watch.I can not recommend the X-Lander . It is feature-rich , fairly compact and lightweight , but the issues above make it less than desirable and overpriced . The Finns need to address these issues before I buy another Suunto & # 34 ; wrist computer & # 34 ; .	-1
Yelp , I guarantee this costume will rip on the 1st day of play . It is really cheaply made . It 's the same cheap costumes that you find in walmart for 7-10 bucks . And I had to cut out a nose and mouth it does n't give them a place to breath out of . YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR so do n't pay over 10 bucks for this temporary costume	-1
My daughter recieved this purse as a gift and we found it was missing some of the pieces . Since the pieces were sealed in a bag , it was a clearly problem from the manufacturer . When we went to exchange it , we found all of the purses on the shelf were missing at least the mirrors ! Pretty bad quality control , if you ask me . We ended up stuck with an incomplete toy ... pretty dissapointing .	-1
Hard to beat the price but I did n't expect that Casio still made this bad back lighting for night viewing . I gave the watch away a day after I got it .	-1
this watch should just be for a woman 's waist . It is really a small watchactually gave it to my 15 year old Grand-Daughter	-1
The title says it all . I loved these , but you literally have to wrestle your kid and near mangle his feet , even when a size or two too big- to get them on . THEN you have to lace and tie them ! On a kicking toddler ! Yeah , right ! IMPOSSIBLE to get on for the most part . And do n't seem comfortable either . they need to create this same shoe , but but an easy access ZIPPER on the side , down to the toe bed to get the young child 's foot inside .	-1
Like : Great look.Dislike : This item weights a ton ! Tongue moves around.Insole is so flat , I get sore feet after just 10 minutes walking .	-1
My son only wore these shoes once ( he 's only 2 ) because they cause so much distress to get on and off , we just do n't bother anymore . Why they dont make a hidden zip for the toddler sizes is beyond me . They 're expensive so wait until they 're older before buying this type of shoe .	-1
Great fabric and tight fit . Problem is that if you are over 6ft tall , then all Under Armour products will be too short in the torso . This company does not listen to the customer .	-1
El vendedor debe revisar las opciones , Me enviaron unos calzados de recien nacidos y seleccione uno de ninos , mi hijo esta muy molesto .	-1
These shoes run so big , and the size is very confusing . I emailed to find out if I could just exchange for a smaller size , but they wo n't do that . I have to send them back , and buy another pair . No thanks .	-1
I did not know that Converse stooped that low to get their products made in Vietnam or else I would never have bought them for my young nephew .	-1
Do these shoes always run so big ? I had to sell them to a friend who has a much bigger foot than I .	-1
I closely studied the strange sizing chart for this bra , and ordered a size 3 a few months ago . This turned out to be too big , so I ordered a size 2 . The size 2 was way too small ! I am about a 38F ; the 3 had too much room while the 2 did n't even fit around me . This gap in sizing has me confused but maybe when I lose some weight I will decide to try this bra again .	-1
If you like breasts that are cube-shaped , this is the one for you ! As much as I loved the back of this bra , I positively gasped at how it made my chest look . It got rid of any roundness , and just flattened the front ... not a flattering look . Returning tomorrow ... and the search continues .	-1
I bought the size that fits 34DD and I feel so constricted in this thing ! It 's not comfortable to run in for me . I feel like I ca n't draw enough breath . However , it does hold my top in place , so I do n't move at all .	-1
again , i bought this based on a recommendation of a friend , i absolutely hated the fabric it was a cheezy almost las vegas type shiny fabric , ugh also the straps were too short . i couldnt fit it right . did not like the front closure either , , you need a whole day just to get the thing on ! dumb design in my eyes , i sent it back ,	-1
I heard great things about this bra . I am a size 36 E ( DDDD ) and got the size 3 . This should fit based on the measurements provided in the sizing guide . It is hard to get on , so I know I could n't get a bigger size , but my boobs bounce around like crazy and hurt . I expected to have a lot more support	-1
I do n't like Ameribags because they are too hard to store things in and find things in . I do not like their bag .	-1
It 's not what I expected and it is to small . I will be giving them as gifts instead . Thank you !	-1
First of all I want to say that it is a lovely , well-made wallet . The problem I have is while it has many slots , it does n't close well when the slots are all or even mostly filled . The change purse clasp pops open and so does the snap closure . I am surprised that no else has reported these issues .	-1
I did n't think it was easy to open or that it stored cards and bills well . I sent it back .	-1
after reading all the reviews I was sure this was the wallet for me . It 's very low quality leather and does n't look well-made . It does have many , many card slots , but it seems it would break if they were full . Returned it .	-1
I did n't like the way the credit card sleeves were laid out and there was no zippered compartment . It was also slightly ugly . I sent it back .	-1
The card slots in the wallet are too tight . You have to force the cards into the slots and then they are almost impossible to get out . I used the wallet less than a month and the sides were already tearing away . I 've gone back to by old wallet .	-1
This is a nice wallet until you put a 'few ' cards in it . The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards ( which includes the drivers license , library card , 2 medical cards , AARP and towing cards-no charge cards ) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added . Sorry to say , I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for me .	-1
If the inside pocket is n't weighted down it flips upside down . If it is n't snapped shut in both overlaying flaps everything is all over the ground with the risk of losing cards and IDs . I even had a nightmare about on my second day of owning this . lol	-1
The check holder I received with this clutch was not removable , thus limiting its use for me , since my husband and I share the checks . I returned it to Amazon , a company that is the most cooperative I deal with .	-1
Large chest women can not wear theses.You know how difficult it is to tape things , just imagine your boobs.I had to try for only $ 10 . I wrote the review so you do n't have too.And I only intended to wear these with a strapless bra for more support , not alone so I was not expecting too much .	-1
I am a 38D in all bras , Victoria Secret , Playtex , Beyond Bare , but this one is way tooooooo tight . The cups are also a little too small , and yes , as another reviewer mentioned , I also feel like I looked like torpedo chest too . I would not recommend . I love Playtex bras but they made a mistake with this one .	-1
Bought a 40DDD . This bra is offensively ugly and clumsy . It has a lot of padding which makes my already large breasts look enormous , The cups are moulded and - of course since it 's Playtex - they are pointy . I was stunned at how horrible it looked on . Add to that the fact that the underwire and band are very uncomfortable ; they do n't lie flat against your body , yet they chafe and rub . I 've learned my lesson now . I 'll never buy Playtex again .	-1
The bra fits well but the cups are far larger than desired . Your boobs wo n't just flop around , they 'll look freaky .	-1
Had to return . Will have to find a place that sells full-size slips to try on . Do n't use Victoria 's Secret , they are way expensive .	-1
The pink color was very faint - almost white . The quality on these was a little disappointing as well . The little pad in the middle was way off-center on almost every one . They did n't stick as well as other brands i 've tried as well . Would not buy again .	-1
I ordred Queen size ... .It looks like my child 's 6x tights . It 's no way I could get a leg into these .	-1
This is a great idea , but they are very hard to put on by yourself , and they pop off real easily .	-1
Truly terrible . I purchased two of the three packs and upon opening one package I discovered that they were full of pulls that would lead to runs during/after first use . Next I tried on another pair only to discover that whilst the length of the stocking was fine the spandex/elastic was so weak that they almost immediately fell down even though they fit . Also , I found them to be very sheer . I thought that by purchasing the 'fantasy black ' that they would be more like tights in color but that was not the case . Overall , very unhappy with this product and will be returning for a full refund .	-1
Well I guess thy r ok but the stockings had a run in them after only 1 use and the skin under where the rubbery part is that holds them up was really sore after wearing them so um I 'm not going to so I guess the run in them dues not really matter just if u have sensitive skin u may want to not get those .	-1
I am a solid 32DDD . I 've been measured and that is the size of bra I wear in brands across the board . This bra has this weird extra nipple room that I did not need . I 'd probably be able to fit a tablespoon in there and fill lit perfectly . It is n't that the cup is too big , it 's only this extra nipple space . The bra is also scratchy . I 'll give it the benefit of the doubt and wash it a few times before I go to put it on again . I can not wear it with t shirts or thin dresses because of this extra nipple room , and because it does create sort of a torpedo effect . I would n't compare it to the torpedo boobs you 'd see on Marilyn Monroe and the likes , but it definitely does give a point to the breasts . I will only be able to wear this bra with clothing that is thicker , like sweaters , or dresses that are double layered or have thick material . I also ordered Wacoal La Femme Contour Bra . This bra is AMAZING . The Bali Bra in my size has 4 hooks and very large straps also , the cups go very high on the breast , covering almost the entire breast , making it illogical to wear with anything that shows even a little chest ( not breast ) because the bra is visible . The Wacoal bra is unbelievably comfortable and only a tad bit more in price .	-1
I normally wear a 42 B but I had to buy a C in this . It fit but man is it scratchy material !	-1
I was looking for a casual bra to wear when I worked in the yard and chose this one based on reviews and price . It 's going back.The bra is thin with old fashioned pointed nipples . The material fails to stretch to adapt to breast dimensions , causing some areas to be too tight and others too loose . It felt uncomfortable ( not too tight - just too rough ) as soon as I put it on.Because it 's a Bali , it 's probably durable and would hold up over time better than cheaper bras but I just ca n't get over the positive reviews so I 'm giving it only one star.For a better fitting and much more comfortable bra , try a Victoria 's Secrets wireless cotton bra . It gives you the smooth coverage you want , excellent support , and you wo n't even know you are wearing it .	-1
Itchy , pointy , and VERY uncomfortable ! How in the heck did this bra get so many good reviews ? I think one star is one too many .	-1
I really wanted to like this as an everyday bra but unfortunately while support is good , the shape is quite off , cone shaped cups are rather rigid and leave the 50 's bullet impression that is quite unnatural and not flattering on anyone .	-1
Wow ... I should have listened to the other reviews . While it looks comfortable -- it is n't . The edges alone are scratchy and the torpedo look I could move past as I 've had one other bra do that to me in the past , but after some time it worked itself out . I 'd have ignored it completely if not for the scratchy feeling at the hem lines . There for it 's being immediately returned .	-1
After trying this on , I 'm wondering what bra everyone else got that posted a review . It 's comfortable and supportive , but it ran at least a full cup size small . And the shape - so much torpedo . My chest was so pointy it looked sharp . I 'm sending it back before I hurt someone .	-1
I chose this low rating because this bra is highly structured and not made for comfort . It 's not right for me , but others may like and choose this type of bra . It reminded me of the 1960 's .	-1
I was doing a lot of reading online . And the bras with the best support are seamed bras . Most of the new seamless bras are overly padded and flatten me out.I looked at my local stores but it 's very hard to find a seamed bra that is n't a minimizer in huge sizes . Most start in D cups.This is an attractive bra visually and I would normally just order up one size , but I look like I should be the musical `` Grease . '' Or in a 1950 's TV show.My husband said I was a walking weapon in this thing . I could use my breasts to poke the eyes out of a potential attacker.It does not look like the photo of it on amazon . Anyone who put this on , would have to push their breasts into the front of the narrow part of the cup to fill it , and would end up looking pointy .	-1
I doubt anyone 's body is this shape , or that anyone would rate the fabric as comfortable , it 's scratchy ! Nothing like the picture ...	-1
I usually wear Lilyette Minimizer bras , but now they do not even make the one I really like . So I decided to try the Bali Minimizer , but although it fits , it does not minimize like the Lilyette does .	-1
I really wanted this to fit and be my go to bra because it holds you up and in so well but the sides are to high on my underarm and it chafes . if find this to be a problem in some bras so it 's not a defect but probably my body vs someone else 's . I tried going down a size but did n't help .	-1
Not the bra for large breasted women unless you 're planning on pointing torpedoes at Mars ! Seriously , what were they thinking when they made this bra . I am a 38DDD and definitely not happy with this bra . I would say it 's more for smaller breasted women who enjoy pointy breasts .	-1
It fits not too bad , but I did need just another cup size bigger . I thought I ordered triple D and that is what this says , but the bras say double D. I took the wire out , because it was pressing into my chest to hard , but the bra is comfortable . If I had the right size , I still would have taken the wire out .	-1
First off it fits way too small . I bought it because I was under the influence that it would fit a plus sized woman like me perfectly . Do n't be fooled by that ! This bra is not for plus sized women with larger busts . It looks nothing like the one in the picture . The under wires are so uncomfortable . I always buy under wire bras and this one felt like it was poking me to death and digging in under my breasts . The front of the bra sticks up and out ( the under wire ) right between the cleavage and it is very visible under any top . Getting it on was no picnic . I can usually reach back and snap it shut but this one refused as it felt too short . I had to turn it around and snap it then turn it back . It was horrible and too tight . I tried to adjust the straps and that helped a bit but still my breasts were sticking out ( muffin top ) . Nothing I did worked . All I keep thinking is that there is a reason they show these bras on skinny people in the pictures.If you do buy this bra buy it 3 sizes bigger than your normal size otherwise you will be disappointed like I am . The price for this bra is too high . The materiel is horrible and stiff , no softness to it .	-1
I wish my favorite bra had this kind of strap . Other than the strap I did not liked the way it fit me . I did wear it for awhile but not even close to wearing it out before I went back to my favorite ... .so , waste of money for me ... .	-1
The fit on this bra was not right for me . So I returned it . The straps are awfully short and ca n't let them out enough .	-1
The bra fits true to size however is VERY STIFF and a bit uncomfortable . It also has a unrealistically old fashioned style that makes it unflattering to look at . Keeping it because it great for minimizing but not the prettiest under garment in the bunch	-1
This is too expensive for the cheap quality of this product ! Because the plastic is so slippery , when you put it on the back of your bra and attempt to adjust it to your liking , as soon as you begin to raise your bra straps onto your shoulders , the little adjustment clip will slip/revert back to the starting point of where you begin when you tried to adjust it . I can see this happening if I were over weight and/or had large breast , but Im a size 8 and a B cup so this shows you how defunct this product is . Furthermore , the company I bought this from here on Amazon ( i.e . Lady Grace ) has an outrageous shipping cost ! This piece of crap should be half the cost to ship but the company charges an unreasonable shipping fee because they make you pay for them to mail you their unwelcomed catalog ( along with this cheap gadget ) which I threw in the recycling bin as soon as I got it . Total waste : - (	-1
I bought this brand and Danskin tights to see if there would be a difference in quality ( I have n't been big on Hanes , as a brand , before ) , rather than stock up on a bunch of colors in one brand.I 'm glad I did it this way , as I wo n't buy these again . They ended up getting a run the very first night I wore them , then they just tore into a hole.For starters , I did n't even like the way they felt . They did n't stretch well ( I have big hips and bought the size supposedly appropriate for me , according to the chart ) , and they were too snug around my upper thighs , of all places . It 's like they designed it for children 's legs.. very runway model , ignoring that women 's thighs are typically bigger than their calves.And they were SO THIN , I might as well have shaved and wore nothing . I bought white because I was hoping to get some white sheer like the picture , but it was nothing like that . So do n't expect these to hide any hair/blemishes you have on your legs , or even look like you 're wearing white tights.The only reason I can think of that this gets two stars rather than one is the price and I 'm pretty sure they arrived when expected .	-1
this style does not say if it is Sandalfoot or reinforced toe ... could n't buy because of that	-1
In one day I got a run and had to get a new pair , exact same problem . Wo n't be buying these again .	-1
Hanes needs some better quality control these days . The color I ordered , & # 34 ; barely there , & # 34 ; is a very dark color . It is supposed to be so light and transparent that anyone can wear it and appear to have bare legs . Overall , Hanes is a good product and fits well , but it 's a hassel to bother with returning things when they do n't catch color problems like this .	-1
I 've been needing a nude shade and this one seemed to fit the bill . However it is really thin and will probably run immediately . Also I 'm not too sure about the color for my skin tone .	-1
I bought these for my Mother who is short with heavy thighs . The fit was a little small and she found that getting them over her thighs comfortably was difficult .	-1
I do n't like control top . if you 're already wearing a skirt or tuck in your shirt or have something around your waist , this control top deal makes you feels like you are being squeezed to death . it 's just too tight and uncomfortable and really it pushes in some places .	-1
Sizing was fine , but they have a 'texture ' to them which caused them to get pulls quickly and were n't very comfortable to wear .	-1
I think a color labeled & # 34 ; Barely There & # 34 ; should be much more neutral . I realize that if I had a dark tan or were of a different ethnicity perhaps these hose would look & # 34 ; barely there & # 34 ; on my legs . But as it is they remind me of the nylons I wore in junior high , colored & # 34 ; Cinnamon. & # 34 ; In fact I may send them back , I 'm so disappointed . The shades depicted online are not at all representative . Can not speak to fit or durability as I have n't tried them on yet .	-1
Very light weight in texture I sent them back . Still waiting for credit . I thought for the weight they were too expensive . I was looking for more warmth in this product	-1
This bra is pretty , and I do love the & # 34 ; bounce & # 34 ; that a good balconette bra gives , but the straps on this bra stretched out almost immediately , resulting in me constantly pulling up fallen-down straps all day.I would n't recommend this bra is you 're a large-breasted woman .	-1
This bra fit nothing like the Wacoal and Natori 32DDD bras I purchased from Nordstrom . I wo n't say it was too large , or too small because that would n't be accurate . It just was n't *right* ... .	-1
Online this Bra looks Delicious ! I mean it holds the Babies in while looking Nice and Fashionable . The problem ? I think my Babies were a little too Big ... a little too much for Poor Old & # 34 ; Felina|Harlow-Unlined Demi-Bra. & # 34 ; They , I , did n't feel comfortable , nor safe walking or playing around in it . I think this Bra is best designed for smaller Babies , cause HOLDING my Babies was a bit Little Shady with The FELINA-Lady ! YOu dig ?	-1
This is cute but it 's scratchy in all the places you do n't want it to be scratchy like the band and the straps . The straps have nude felt-like material for additional durability but I think this is what is part of the problem because the material used is cheap . Anyways , do n't buy this one -- go to the department store and find another cute one .	-1
I was so excited for this bra and when I got the 38D the wire part fit great and actually supported ALL of my boob instead of cutting in too close on the sides . The cups were just a TAD too big , and I could have gotten it tailored I suppose but I returned them for a 38C hoping that , being a 38 , the underwire would still be wide enough too include all my bits but have correct cup size ... .cup size was alright , but the underwire was too narrow AND the underwire that came up between the boobs was too wide ! It was like pulling my boobs apart from the center ! No thanks ! Plus , it pushed really hard into my sternum ! The material was super scratchy and uncomfortable , I just wished this worked out b/c from the picture it looks so pretty but the material is awful .	-1
This bra runs suuuuuper small . Make sure you order up a cup and bands size . If I had gotten a proper size , I may have had a better review : (	-1
I wear a 38C Bra size , and this bra fits the bill ! ! ! Love it ! I just ordered another one . I would highly recommend this bra . It is very sexy , and comfortable.Update : After wearing this bra for a day , it 's NOT comfortable . I would not recommend it all , and I have returned the other one that was ordered , and the one I kept goes in the `` Not form fitting , and comfortable '' draw . I got the Marielle Unlined bra instead , so far it is very comfortable , and fits nicely to the breasts . I will be ordering another pair !	-1
I did not like the seam placement in the cups ... .it vastly took away from the style.The lace was very pretty though .	-1
I have to agree with a previous poster that said the straps were too long . I adjusted it to the shortest setting and it still was loose . I 've probably only had that problem with 1 % of all the bras I 've ever bought , and sadly this was one of them . The cups run generously sized ( which for me , as a D/DD usually is a positive thing , but in this design was too much of a good thing & I would have to size down ) . The overall design was cute , but the odd sizing made it a no-go .	-1
This is the second time I purchased a bra on Amazon and the sizing is not the same as the bra in store . I got fitted for Felina bras and was told that I am a 32DDD in their bras . When I tried the bra on in store , it fit perfectly so I decided to order on Amazon because the store price was way more expensive . This bra has so much space in the bust area that I can not possibly wear it as the 'girls ' will jiggle with any step that I make . Terrible !	-1
I wore one pair once and gave them away because I did n't like the way they felt . The fabric felt rough and the leg bands too narrow .	-1
I probably missed the explanation for the & # 34 ; seam & # 34 ; up the middle of the back side on this brief . Just a little too & # 34 ; clingy & # 34 ; for me , thanks.However ... for those of the younger set the clingy-fanny thing might just blow your skirt up.Was in a hurry when I ordered these and might not have read the details .	-1
Fits like a sack , styled like something my mother might have worn - very late in life . Not nice at all . I DO N'T wear tiny underwear , but there 's enough fabric in these for two pair , going on three . Yuck .	-1
I was debating between a 1 and 2 star rating . These Jockey briefs are good quality , but Jockey has a sizing problem between sizes 7 and 8 . I first ordered 3 size 8s and they are somewhat large so went back on Amazon , checked the sizing charts then ordered 3 size 7s . There is at least 2 or more inches difference in the width of these two sizes and the 7 is more than an inch shorter . I ca n't complain about the quality of Jockey , but sizing is a totally separate issue . The size 7s will be donated to Goodwill ASAP .	-1
I found these to be huge , far bigger than a size 6 . I have ordered in the past from jockey and found I liked their products and so ordered another style in a smaller size to try once more . I hope these fit and are not so old fashioned .	-1
I thought by ordering Jockey I would avoid the generally poor quality of underwear that seems to be in the marketplace these days . Jockey is no better than the rest . The individual panties are not cut the same despite being marked the same size in a 3 pack , and they run small to size and do not provide correct coverage as a French cut .	-1
The quality of the item is fine but there are 2 different sizes in one package of three . How can you reorder with that kind of inconsistency ? No way would I recommend this to anyone .	-1
Horrible smell gave me an asthmatic attack when they arrived . Unfortunately I bought 15 jockey underwear so they are going in the trash . Waste of a lot of money ! Shame on you Jockey ! I have allergies and asthma and only buy unscented products . There should be a warning label on these toxic underwear . Do NOT buy !	-1
I have been a jockey fan for many years but the last package was poorly constructed , very thin and has started to unravel already . I would switch to hanes all cotton ; the waistband is thinner and the fabric is less sheer .	-1
These shrank something fierce after a couple of washes in warm/hot water . The legs just became too tight to wear .	-1
When I bought these panties , I really wanted to like them , but I could n't get any further with them than opening the package . They have a & # 34 ; perfumed & # 34 ; smell . I really do n't want any fragrance on my underwear .	-1
I have bought Jockey before and they were quite good but these seem already stretched to the max Before putting them on , very little give left in the bands .I do n't know if it 's a cheap knock off with a bogus Jockey label or if Jockey is now cutting corners but I would n't buy them sight unseen again .Probably back to brick & mortar for Jockey purchases ( see what it is Before I get it ) .	-1
Cup is odd and puckers near the under arms . I 've never had that in a bra before . Material is cheap and feels & # 34 ; scratchy . This bra went back .	-1
Unfortunately these were much too small , even though I got the biggest size . I usually wear a 2x clothes , and the 5-6x did n't fit so that pretty much explains how small they run .	-1
i found the same Spanx Power Panties at Nordstrom Rack for 19.99 . Since these do n't last through too many washes ( maybe 8 tops ! ) , I think spending $ 36.00 is just ridiculous . No thanks ! ! !	-1
does I do n't was very it was too small for me to too small I ordered the right side but it still to size smaller but thank you anyway for the product I just all I did was we sell to sell it thank you though	-1
I am a fairly thin person with a little extra weight in the upper thigh area and was hoping these could minimize the look under dresses or more fitted pants , but unfortunately they did n't seem to do anything for me . They were very tight and hard to get on , and once I did I still had the same lumps and bumps . Very dissapointed .	-1
These pants are thick , and they do n't compress me very much , so they actually make my clothes fit tighter . Expensive and a waste of money .	-1
I ckecked to see what size I should order . Following as it said to dam small . I think you should be able to breathe .	-1
I thought that these would be kind of like cut-off control top panty hose . They 're more like just cut-off regular pantyhose . There was no 'control ' at all in the 4 pair I bought , following their sizing charts . Unlike other reviewers , I did n't find them too tight , in fact I thought they 'd be tighter . Regular firm control briefs are better . Waste of money .	-1
I used to wear Jockey Elance Bikini Briefs exclusively , but in the past year they have changed their design . I am a larger framed man with a 48 inch waist and I have always worn the XL size . They have always fit very comfortably and still have some give to them . But the last few times I bought this product , they have a smaller , tighter fit . Very tight in the pouch and between the legs . They also have a lower cut , both in the front and back . I 'm constantly pulling them up in the back . My junk is popping out of the top and the sides ! These might fit a woman comfortably , but not a man . There 's no stretchiness or room in the front for `` the boys . '' This bikini would be better if Jockey offered it in other facrics such as Modal , Tactel or Nylon . I do n't know why Jockey changed their design , but I do n't like it and I will not buy this product again until they change it back . Sometimes change is a bad thing ... and this is a bad thing ! May sound odd , but Jockey makes women 's panties that are FAR more comfortable compared to Elance bikinis for men !	-1
It might work for a Superman costume , but Spider man is supposed to be a weedy teenager . So it looks funny . My little boy 's Spiderman PJs are more convincing than this thing .	-1
I ordered the black leather jungle moc and received a suede pair . I called customer service and they said they would send the black leather pair overnight . When I opened the box , the shoes were BLACK SUEDE AGAIN . I called customer service and the woman did not know the difference between suede and leather . I am a server in a fine dining restaurant . I can not wear suede shoes . I am returning these again . A total waste of my time .	-1
Merrell 's WERE great , perhaps when they were made in Canada . These are identical in stated sizing to a wonderful pair of Merrell Jungle Moc 's I wore comfortably in and out of the house for years , but my heel slipped a lot in these , there was way too much toe room , and they seemed 1/2 to 1 size too large . I wear a 9.5 US Merrell but these felt like 10-10.5 's . I had to return them for properly fitting and comfortable Teva 's . I do not recommend these , I would not buy again , and I hope this helps someone .	-1
Did n't like the look of them when I took them out . Should have inspected at the store but did not . As always Amazon delivered and with no questions asked took them back ! Awesome .	-1
I have many other pairs of 9.5 W shoes and they all fit just fine . These arrived and while the box said 9.5 W , the tag inside the tongue said 9.5 . So now I have to wonder if they just dont put the W on the inside tag , or if they shipped the wrong product.I tried them on and WAY TOO TIGHT ! Obviously these are not a proper wide size so now I have to wonder if all Merrells are a snug fit and Wide really just means Normal , or if I got the wrong product . Since no store anywhere in 50 miles of me keeps the wide sizes in stock , I will never know.They look nice and seem like they 'd be comfortable if they are the right size , and I think they provide good traction on slick surfaces , but since I am returning them I didnt feel like making a trip around the block . Shame , because I think these are exactly what I need for walking around this winter.Be aware if you have wide feet you probably will not be able to find comfortable Jungle Moc 's .	-1
First let me say I love merrell shoes in general - worn them for years . This is the first time I 've tried this tyle and thhey spueak when I walk - right out of the box . Ca n't tolerate that .	-1
The size is not true . I bought a pair of 6 1/2 about two years ago from a different website and they fits perfectly . So I bought the 6 1/2 again . But they are at least two sizes larger . I have to return the shoes . I am not sure what happened . Did they do it on purpose so people think they have small feet or was it a mistake ?	-1
they looked good but were n't nearly as comfortable as i was expecting . i ended up returning them . shoes need to be comfortable ! if you want a comfortable shoe , i 'd go with the sketcher go-walks . they do n't look quite as sharp but are super comfortable . great price , too .	-1
I rodered this shoe in a 5.5w BIG GIRL and recieved and baby shoe the shoes looks like picture defintely and im sure you have seen it before however i was not able to return and get proper size at deal price .	-1
If I could give it zero stars I would . Not only was it HUGE . The body would fit my three year old ... .but the legs would fit my 9 year old . Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume . This showed up without a cape and was a & # 34 ; Super Hero & # 34 ; suit . The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off , and were not even straight lines . Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by .	-1
HEre 's the thing ... .everyone says these sandals need a `` break-in '' period -- - a ) that 's ridiculous , and b ) they absolutely DO NOT fit a wide foot ( E , EEE , or EEEEE ) . These are soft leather , nice looking and for a thin foot probably very comfortable . I wear a 7.5 EEE . I ordered one size larger ( 8.5 - 9.5 MEdium ) and they absolutely DO NOT fit -- while you can get your foot into the strap , they cut into the skin between the toes , and there is absolutely no way to `` break in '' the sandle ... .I wore them for about an hour and found that a ) not only do they not loosen up in any way they also dug into the top of my foot and created bloody welts . These 50.00 sandals became unreturnable because they have been worn , and they have dirt on them , and they have blood on the straps. $ 50.00 worth of garbage within one hour . DO NOT BELIEVE all these folks on here who say `` just break them in '' ... .they do not fit a wide foot , period . Save your money .	-1
So I lusted after Rainbows for about 7 years before I decided they might be worth the money.-I got a large ( I wear 9.5M ) and my foot went right to the edge , so I got an extra-large.-The wear in period was n't so bad , I did get a blister as expected.-My largest problem is that the foot surface area got so smooth that my foot kep sliding in and out of the shoe , and it dried out and rubbed up against my foot . I feel like it was polishing the bottom of my foot.-I feel like they are going to fall off when I walk-I thought there was going to be a bit more arch support.-The bottom is very hard.All in all they are good looking sandals , but I 've tried on a friend 's REEFs and they were incredibly comfortable . If I could go back in time , I would have gone with the REEFs .	-1
If you are looking for the Reeboks that were made in the 80 's and 90 's , this is not it . The first pair I ordered in the size I have worn for decades was too short and way too tight thru the toe area . Ordered a half a size larger and they were still tight thru the toe area and the heel area is too large , but the length was right . I had to use inserts in the heels and put them in a stretcher to make the toe area comfortable . Will not be ordering these shoes anymore .	-1
I have weak ankles , and decided that I needed to wear high top sneakers to give me some support . Years ago , I wore Reeboks exclusively , in many different styles , and never had any problems with sizing . I had read some of the reviews that noted that the shoes ran narrow , but I figured that I would try them anyhow.The shoes arrived yesterday . I liked the sneaker , and the way that they were made . Problem was , that after just one look , I knew that they were not for me . They were n't a little narrow , but so narrow that it was obvious , to the naked eye , that these sneakers would not fit . I tried one on , and was just about able to squeeze my foot into them . Walk in them , forget it.There way no way that I could wear them . Some people had suggested buying a larger size , but I was afraid that it would not work . They still would be narrow , and too long.I have looked all over the internet , for a basic , white hightop , at a reasonable price . Apparently anything that I have seen are either very expensive , or come in garish colors only . Any suggestions ?	-1
The nape , though comfortable , lasts only one wearing before it is all pulled . Nice feeling but last only 1 or 2 wears , which is n't good . It is hard to find a good compromise between soft and durable .	-1
Every pair of pants fit differently however before you buy these keep in mind a dungaree fit means you will be wearing them like a rap star . Hanging off your bottom , and look ridiculous . Good quality material just get a pair of suspenders with them .	-1
Have purchased Carhartt for years and recently have noticed the fit and the crew ribbing at neck have not been uniform . Different locations where made all have different issues . Purchase in question , color spinach is stamped & # 34 ; original fit & # 34 ; . No others have this and this fits the most different . Am comparing this to what I considered original fit when the product had tags . These are sized uniformly and the ribbed neck have held their shape after many washings . I 've purchased the 6.75 oz . only when stated , when no mention of weight assume their not . Am not a happy camper .	-1
I have been buying Carhartt work wear for my husband for over 20 years . I have always been happy with their quality . These tees are cut so thin that they were tight on my 6'2 & # 34 ; hubby who weighs 160 pounds . I bought the Medium because that is the size he always wears in Carhartt . Unfortunately , I was expecting the same quality as other products that I have purchased from them . I washed them before he wore them so I ended up throwing them out ! I will be looking for another work clothes manufacturer . The muscle tees are also cut too thin .	-1
The shirt 's quality was very nice , but it was incredibly long . In all fairness , I did n't realize the shirt was made to be very long . i would have ordered a small .	-1
This jacket is a different style than some of the other carhartt 's such as the camo series that has n't been around a long time . The hood on this was a couple inches shorter than the other carhartt I purchased . It does n't quit cover the face , so sent it back . I have n't run in to that style hood since the 90 's when carhartt was cut smaller .	-1
I 'm not very impressed with the quality of Carhartt bibs/cover-all I purchased -- I will admit that I have n't purchased a new Carhartt coat or bib set in a long time -- I had no idea how low the quality has gotten . First , the zippers are very cheap and get stuck easily , 2 . The canvas material is not what it used to be either , my old set seemed to be bullet proof but this new set is not the same . 3 . The sizes are so different , I ordered the bibs/cover-all a size larger than I wear , but when they were delivered and I tried them on , it was as if they were two sizes smaller . The material is thin , and the insulation is very cheap and again not what it used to be . I am very disappointed in this Carhartt product , to the extent I will probably not trust Carhartt with any more purchases . The quality is very low , but the prices are way too high for the quality .	-1
My husband is 3x type guy that works in cold areas on ocassion . He 's purchased carhartts for more than 30 years and knows they always run small so he opted for 2 sizes bigger than normal in the insulated bibs and , as it turns out , the largest size carhartt offers . Sadly they were still at least 2 sizes too small ! He was soooo disappointed to have to return these and purchase an brand other than carhartt . Wish Carhartt would review their sizing and offer a bit more of the larger sizes AND more accurate sizing information.As I said ... sadly , these were returned . : (	-1
Sized incorrectly and could not obtain them in the size / length needed for replacement . Had to return for full refund . Disappointing considering the brand .	-1
I bought one pair of these for my husband to see if he liked them . When I saw the quality and heard him talk about the comfort , I immediately ordered another pair ... ..should have ordered a couple more AND I WILL ! I usually order Levi 's relaxed but these seem to last so much longer and have the extra room men always want in certain areas ( said that as nicely as I could ) . Now , after washing a couple times , I will no longer purchase those other jeans which are very weak in the pockets/crotch area and seem to tear easily . These Carhartt jeans are amazing ! My husband really loves the comfort . I 'd recommend them for work , as well as , dress jeans . Very handsome ! You get much more quality with Carhartt and pay less . You ca n't beat that ! UPDATED : May 15 , 2014 The last jeans I purchased were washed three times and have torn on all corners of the back pockets . I should not have been so quick to give such a great review since the one pair held up pretty good . In looking at them again , the pocket corners are all thin and fraying/tearing ONE MONTH LATER . I use a light laundry detergent and do n't leave them in the washer so it ca n't be that . I guess I will have to continue my search for those sturdy work jeans . If anyone has suggestions , please let me know . Thank you ! UPDATED : June 21 , 2014 THESE JEANS SUCK ! I am returning all three pairs I bought to Carhardt . The entire seat of these jeans finally just ripped two months and just a few washes later . I have already patched all three pairs twice . The material is very , very cheap !	-1
I 've worn Rockport brand for many years and I 've purchased more than a few pair of these very shoes . However , when I purchased this most recent pair of the World Tour Classic , the decline in quality workmanship was very noticeable . The shoes are now made in Vietnam and the look of inferior materials is very obvious on this shoe . The logos and Rockport brands are still in the same place , but `` made made materials '' ( cheap plastic ? ) has replaced what used to be leather . Very disappointing for a $ 100 shoe . What has happened to what was once a good company ?	-1
Have used Rockport 's for years . They use to be top of the line for comfort , yet look dressy enough to wear in the office . Comfort , quality , and value ... ... but something changed . I bought a brown and black pair of this model . They are wearing faster than the older models and are NOT as comfortable . When you notice that you are wearing shoes that is usually a clue that something is not right . The old Rockports you could put on and walk in all day and never think about your shoes or your feet . Not so with this stiffer version . Sadly looks like when these wear out will have to try to find a more comfortable shoe .	-1
Poor quality , the price is expensive . You should buy this product with caution . I hope I can help to you	-1
These shoes have the most inferior insole of any walking shoe . If you want to add a decent insole , you wo n't have much breathing room for your foot . The shoes overall are n't as comfortable as everybody is saying , but I have a slightly wide foot . I am fine when I wear my New Balance shoes with a width of D. I do believe that this shoe is n't what it used to be . They are a decent pair of shoes for someone on a budget . I bought theRockport Men 's Ct Sport Oxfordwhen I bought these , and highly suggest those . Those shoes have a much better insole , and the shoe breathes well .	-1
the rockports are sold as walking shoes but they hurt my feet after about 10 minutes of walking .	-1
I 'll begin by revealing I am 57 years old and thus have been wearing jeans for a full 5 decades . It is safe to say I am aware of what my jean size is . In fact , as I write this review I am wearing a pair of size 33WX32L Wrangler jeans , one pair of several I own.Which brings us to these 2013 model lined Wrangler jeans , purported to be size 33x32 . The waist size on this pair is so far off I went straight to the size label to see if I had been shipped the wrong size by mistake . No , the seller apparently got it right but Wrangler has these jeans sized at LEAST one size , if not two , too small . Come on now , Wrangler has been manufacturing jeans longer than I have been alive and this is ridiculous . And , since these came from an Amazon seller , not Amazon directly , guess who pays the return postage ? These jeans were labeled as being made in Mexico ( assuming THAT label was accurate ) . I suppose when outsourcing to whichever third world nation is the low bidder , little things such as quality control and accuracy in sizing can be overlooked in the interest of saving a buck ( or Peso ) .Lesson learned : From now on I will try on jeans and personally inspect them before I buy . So much for buying jeans on Amazon , especially from a third party seller such as Sportsman 's Guide . And , so much for Wrangler in general .	-1
These are very nice hoop earrings for a child . Very small . They did not work for me , but if you like small earrings they might .	-1
I actually purchased these in March 2004 and to give some perspective , they are so well made that today they are as good when I first purchased them . I did beat the current price , but at $ 19 , they are still worth it . They are on the smaller side , as other reviews have noted , but they are still perfect for young granddaughters and those of us who prefer smaller hoops.September 1 , 2009 update : I was amazed to see that the price has increased by over 10 times since I purchased these earrings in 2004 . Allowing for the fact that gold has increased , all the same , if you buy these at the current price of around $ 140 , you will be disappointed , notwithstanding the supposed , and inflated , retail price . Why ? While they are pretty , these are very lightweight and fragile . They have held up over five years , but I am very careful with them and do n't wear them that often . The hoops are about dime sized , so they are small . My guess is that a teenager would probably break these fairly quickly , again because they are lightweight and thin at the wire closure . My opinion is that these should sell for at least 50 percent off what Amazon is offering them for at present , and if possible , I would change my rating to two stars .	-1
These earings broke a week after I got them . I was very happy with the way they looked , but than they broke . Very cheaply made .	-1
These earrings are a lot smaller than they appear on the website , I am returning them since they are much to small for me .	-1
They were pretty , but I was shocked by how tiny they were . I am a small person , but these were too small even for me . They were a very close to the earlobe fit . They would be perfect for a little girl .	-1
I rated it a 2 because the picture is grossly inaccurate ! ! ! This earring is so small and very appropriate for a little girl . I had to return it . I believe the product is of very good quality however the picture makes it look like its for an adult- when you get the earring - you will be very disappointed . For a girl 6 and under - yes however for an adult - no	-1
These earrings I had to send back because they were n't that big like I wanted them to be and they were flimsy and for the price I expected to be a bolder look , and a heavier weight .	-1
I purchased the 14k yellow gold 4mm ball earrings , and one of the balls fell off and was lost within a day .	-1
i bought it when it was in the gold box deal for $ 19.99 . it 's a very pretty and shining gold just like the photo really . the gold ball is so hollow and made it very..very thin . the push back lock is a little tiny super small that i had a hard time to hold it in my hands and tried it on my ears not easily . i 'm 4'11 & # 34 ; , my ring size is between 4 and 5 , imagine even my fingers have the hard time to put it together on my ears , that 's not good for me . when i received it , the gold ball had the little dent about 3mm , and the push back i could not use it , it fell through right away when tried it on . so i returned it without the problem . and if you are the one who always change your earrings several times a week or a month , i would not recommend to buy this one . but if you are so careful and very delicate on jewelry , it should not be a problem .	-1
I was dissappointed with these earrings as one of them was actually & # 34 ; dented & # 34 ; , pushed in at the side . I also bought the larger 6mm balls which are perfect	-1
I 've purchased the 3mm , 4mm , 5mm & 6mm sizes . I was happy with all , but not with this 6mm size . These are from a different manufacturer/supplier , Leach and Garner . While they look good , the posts are too short and very slippery , also the backs do n't stay on tight , slipping off very , very easily . I have thin to average ear lobes , but found I could n't wear these without them falling off ( potentially , getting lost ) . Otherwise , they would have been fine . I returned them and would not buy this pair again .	-1
Beautiful earrings but one of the backs was missing . This is embarrassing when giving as a gift . Fortunately , I had another from another earring , but when buying fine jewelry , this is not appropriate .	-1
for $ 10 these were too good to pass up . First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece . First time I wore them , lost one because the back slipped off though they were n't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.This is the second pair I bought ... first set was fine . Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping ( or a different supplier ? )	-1
They do look pretty but I have never been able to wear them because I am afraid they will fall and I will lose them . Definitely have to figure something out . I would not recommend them since you do n't feel safe wearing them .	-1
I used this 3x ... I lost the other one on the third use . I did n't even feel it slip off my ears . The backings come off easily .	-1
I read the reviews on this product thoroughly , so I was well-aware of the problems with the short posts . However , I have very petite , thin ears , so I thought I would be able to wear them . Not so . One earring could be worn , but I had to secure the back in so far that my ear turned red . I could not even get the back on the other earring because the post did not stick out far enough . Oh well . I returned them .	-1
Received these as a gift and while as a general rule I enjoy wearing ball earrings I will NOT be wearing these . They are going to be returned ASAP . They really are awful , feel much more like plastic than gold and are sure to fall apart or dent on the first wearing.There are other pairs of 14k gold ball earrings in my jewelry box and even the ones that are much smaller weigh more than these.If your intention is simply to just own something made of 14k gold then I suppose these would serve that purpose but if you want a pretty and serviceable pair of earrings , pass these by .	-1
I received these earrings and had the looked at my a jeweler and they are not real gold they react to a magnet I was disappointed because I paid so much for fake gold but tried to wear them anyway to see if they hurt my ears cause I have bad luck in that department and within one day the back had fallon off one of the earrings and I lost the stud . I will never buy gold from amazon again its the only time I have been disappointed by amazon	-1
These were very flimsy and the clasp broke soon after I bought these . I would not recommend them because of the clasp .	-1
All I wanted was a pair of hoop earring , yellow or white gold . I 've worn this style as every day earrings for years and managed to lose one . These looked perfect and in spite of the outrageous increase of the price of gold , I decided to order them . The size was exactly as described and would have indeed been perfect except for the following : the part that goes into the piercing is not the usual wire . Instead it is a thin flat piece of gold that is significantly wider in diameter than a wire and was terribly uncomfortable . If you are a person with stretched out piercings , this may not bother you , but it was a deal breaker for me . The second problem is that earrings like this must have a good closure . ONE of them had a very tight closure- almost too tight but I could have lived with that . The other was so loose that it would have definitely come unhooked and I would have lost it . Needless to say , I was terribly disappointed . If you are a person who is used to wearing larger diameter earrings , I would say this could be a good deal if you get a pair with decent closures . They 're beautiful and shiny and an excellent size . But if you 're like I am and thick earrings hurt you , look for ones with wire style clasp backs .	-1
The fabric is gorgeous and soft and the fit is good- maybe a little tighter than sized . But they were n't capris on me ( 5 & # 34 ; 4 ) - they were full length . And the crotch was too long . It had a seam that was uncomfortable and felt like it was in the wrong place . Going back ,	-1
Will try to return when i come from Europe . Bought them for present , but they are very tight and it hurts the feet . As a design they are beautiful but very uncomfortable , sorry	-1
The sneakers fit fine but the material that covers the top of your foot digs into your foot so bad . I wore them one time and had to stop at a store and buy myself a pair of flip flops because I could not stand the pain anymore . I wish I would have wore them around the house before so that I could have returned them for a refund . I am so mad I just threw out all this money on such a crappy pair of sneakers .	-1
would n't stay on arm too large even though can shorten ... not what expectedcute to look at but dose n't function well for wearingwould not recommendpay a little more for something better	-1
Too crowded with stuff on the face , no kid would figure it out till they are adolescents . For learners , something less complex would be better .	-1
The material is too hard , shrank after washing , do not meet the stated features , I do not recommend purchasing this bluejean , sorry I wasted my money on this product and the worst is that nobody is responsible for the poor quality of the product and deception suffered , lo us & eacute ; una sola vez y luego lo tuve que desechar , se encogio tanto que no puede volver a usarlo	-1
Very cheap quality now , also smell like wet cloth and animal waste . I ca n't get rid of the smell .	-1
I washed these jeans one time as per the label directions and now I can no longer fit into them . They are extremely too small and I feel like I wasted my money by ordering them .	-1
This is what happens when you move a quality product from the US to a foreign country for manufacture . I 've worn Levi 's 501 's since before they were even called 501 's ( over 60 years ) and this product is not a Levi 501 . It is pure garbage and I 've ordered my last pair . It really is a bummer to see what is happening to so many `` American '' products that are shipped overseas to cheap labor manufacturers . I would even advocate a boycott of Levi until they return to the quality that made them famous ... Now I have to search for a replacement ... Maybe I 'll try Wranglers ... ..	-1
I have been trying to get a few pairs of 501 Originals ( which is not the shrink to fit variety ) that fit me , and have found the sizing of 501 Originals to be all over the map for jeans that all were labled 32w x 36L or 38L . In varying degrees , all -- ALL -- had waists that were bigger than 32 . And in varying degrees all but one pair out of eight were too baggy overall ( one pair was so baggy with a waist so oversize , that I could pull them off me even though they were all buttoned up ) .Some were a little longer than specified , some were a lot longer than specified ( far as I 'm concerned , that 's a good thing : I 'd rather have a tailor shorten them after a few washings , than find that after a few washings they are too short ) .Most had strange front rises that caused , in varying degrees , the dreaded codpiece bulge ( which can be simulated by grabbing from behind the upmost part of one or both -- the bulge is not always symmetrical -- inseam areas at the crotch and pulling strongly backward and upward ) ; the worst offender in this regard was the Timberwolf color , which I ordered twice in the hope that the first pair was a manufacturing mistake , but the second pair was just as bad : the Timberwolf 's codpiece bulge was even worse when viewed from the side : hideous ! As for the button fly -- that turned out to be the best thing . I 've found the button fly to be very comfortable , more comfortable than a zipper . The buttons are no problem once you get the knack of them and once the jeans are broken in.My dimensions are 73.5 '' tall and 160lbs . And of all the 501 Originals I 've ordered , the best fitting is the Dark Stonewash in 32x36 . But fearing when I wash it the length might shrink too much , I ordered another pair of the stonewash in 32w x 38L -- and guess what : that longer pair had the codpiece bulge even though the shorter dark stonewash pair fit perfectly . I give up.ADDITIONAL INFO : the different colors the 501 Originals come in , are not all made from the same denim weight . If you go to Levi 's website , you can readily learn the weight of most of the colors there . Some times a light weight is a good thing for casual wear on a hot summer day . It 's only a bad if you did n't realize you were ordering it.ONE MORE THING : 501 Shrink to Fit is NOT the same as these jeans , which are 501 Original Fit . The 501 Original fit will behave pretty much like all other Levis that are not Shrink to Fit jeans . Many people reviewing these Original Fit 501s did n't realize they were ordering the wrong jeans . Again , Levi 's website explains the distinction .	-1
For some reason this particular color was way long . Had to return 'em for a couple inches shorter pair . Love the 501 's tho ' .	-1
Did n't like the button fly , too many buttons - 5 to be exact . Makes wearing too inconvenient . Would n't recommend it .	-1
The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline , an endless abyss . The back label , which supposedly should be leather , cardboard seems now . The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least , in my experience , has been . I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world . Previously , a Levis jeans was a piece `` almost perfect '' , today I can not say the same . I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans .	-1
Way too small . Have owned a dozen pair of these and they fit perfectly . These are too small , a weird cut , definitely irregular . Very disappointing .	-1
I ordered these on the grounds that I needed a taller size . I loved the color , but they came up only midway up my buttcrack . When I did the 'crouch down ' test they revealed much , much more . The legs and fit indicated they were not original fitting as the leg stayed the same width all the way down the leg . All in all , what I ordered was completely different from what I thought I was ordering . If you 're a tall guy like me , do n't get them.Other than that , I 'm giving them two stars rather than one for nice quality and color .	-1
I dont know what is going on , but i bought a few size 36 and they all differ from sizing , i mean even though they say size 36 , they are like 1-4 cm bigger or smaller.So its like a `` 37 '' and the other is like 35 . Its really weird i dont get it why is there such a huge error in sizing , if there is one , been thinking and talking of this for days and cant find a reason or something ... They are all made in mexico , not made in colombia , i find this on my country for half price , same quality . i thought the ones found here were bad quality because of the price and this would be better , but aparently they 're not or are the same exact pant . the ones sold here are also made in mexico . Another thing i noticed is the seal on the inner bag was decolorated for 1 or 2 pants and the ones i found here some where like this too , so what im trying to say is the same pant . Im kind of dissapointed , not really the quality i was expecting for a $ 50 pant.Im not returning these , already washed them and took all the layers off , not worth the time , etc ... . =/.Your choice & lt ; > Buyer beware !	-1
Do n't be as stupid as the Levi Corporation . Although Levi jeans manufactured in the 1950 's sell for thousands of dollars in New York , the company has relentlessly degraded the product for 40 years now , trading on their name alone . They are actually so stupid as to try to compete with the slaves in a Chinese concentration camp by accepting products manufactured in Africa and South America . The original rivets are gone , their `` denim '' fabric is the worst quality ; all seams fray , especially cuffs ; belt loops fall apart ; and the only appearance achieved is shabby tissue . These fools do not have the intelligence to realize that people would pay hundreds of dollars for jeans produced on the design , material , and workmanship of the 1940 's . Stop living in the past .	-1
These jeans behave like shrink to fit jeans . So make sure that you buy a large enough size . Also , they wrinkle A LOT , and it 's next to impossible to get rid of the wrinkles .	-1
I bought the Levi 's Men 's 501 Original Fit Jean , Dark Stonewash , 38x29 . Other reviews said that the Dark Stonewash was the best material . However as someone who used to own multiple pairs of 501 's years ago I was sorely disappointed . The cut is not what it used to be . These pants should have fit my butt perfectly , but it seems the cut is now a bit saggy in the butt and crotch . The material is a lot lighter and cheaper than what I remember too . Original fit ? ? ? Shrink to fit ? ? ? Nope nada no way ! I have already washed them and there was no shrink to fit . My pair of jeans were made in Malaysia.I recommend going to a brick and mortar store and trying out various brands and sizes as Levi 's which I used to be able to buy just by size is no longer what it used to be.I give these Jeans only 2 stars : Minus 1 star for bad material , minus 1 star for bad fit , minus 1 star for not being American made any more .	-1
Paper thin fabric will not last anywhere near the 501s of yesteryear . Fit is unreliable . Feel is very disappointing . Will not buy again until Levis goes back to the old denim material . Absolutely disgusted !	-1
My husband has worn these pants since I met him in 1991 . These pants are much smaller than the pants we have purchased in the past . I 'm not sure if I 'll have to get one or two sizes larger in the waist . The other 's started off loose and tightened up a bit as they were laundered . These are so tight I 'm afraid to wash them . He can barely get them buttoned . I will need to exchange them for a larger size .	-1
there is not one thing nice i can say about buying these jeans . I have been the same size 501 's for my husband for years . so I know his size these were either missed marked or 2nd 's or something . never again will I get them here . trust the reviews on this one do n't bother to waste your time getting them here .	-1
These were poorly made , light material and just HUGE ! The front pockets sagged , the color was odd and my wife commented that she could get in there with me ( not a bad thing ) . I have 3 other pair of 501 's in the house that are the same size I ordered . These are pretty big . The other issue is they have redesigned the change pocket and made it lots bigger . So big it is nearly useless because it tucks under your belt if you wear a wide one.Now the comment about going to Penny 's . The last pair I bought there ( 501 's are the only thing I buy there ) seemed to be heavier material . Washed 501 's seem to have a lot of size variance , so trying them on is good . Second , the darker material blue ones fade more normally in the wash . These medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by 20 somethings . Almost looks dirty.I 've worn these things for 40 years . I 'll keep on wearing them but I 'm not happy.These went back though .	-1
DO NOT BUY THEIR WATCHES , SAVE TIME AND grief poorly made , the strap fell apart within a week to 10 days , Amazon has good customer support , i will not exchange , just a refund	-1
The watch I received did not have the word `` Titanium '' on the dial as shown , which led me to think that it was a fake . Returned and waiting for a refund . I 'll be buying this watch again but from a different merchant . Do not purchase this particular Skagen model from Jomashop.Updates* : So I returned the watch and ordered another one , this time , from Watchstar . And guess what ? It does n't have the word `` Titanium '' on its dial either . I suspect that Amazon just sent me back what I had returned . I guess I 'll just take the 30 % off they offered for this faulty product .	-1
Very nice looking , and the illusion of being slim ... but the clasp started undoing itself within a year . Replaced it with a model with leather strap , but one day the crystal just ... cracked ! For no reason . Skagen is junk .	-1
I have purchased different brands and sizes of Knee Highs . My legs are pretty wide at 200 pounds ; but these knee highs are supposed to fit someone much bigger and heavy than I . NOT TRUE . I had to return them and have given up trying to find a pair of stockings/knee highs that I can wear without being tortured . I am very short ( 5 ' ) so it 's impossible to find regular stockings that wo n't choke my waist , and the same goes for the knee highs . I have tried & # 34 ; Q & # 34 ; sizes to no avail , the elastic at the top is always terribly uncomfortable . If you read this and have any ideas , please contact me ? Thanks !	-1
Do not buy this product . I only used it a few times and the zipper broke on the two large compartments making it utterly useless . I purchased this so I could put liquids in it to prevent spillage in my suitcase but low and behold I can not use it anymore .	-1
I purchased these shoes for my husband who was opposed to wearing them initially . After some coaxing , he raved about the comfort and is a Sperry convert . Unfortunately , after wearing less than a week , they began to fall apart . I returned them and ordered a new pair which were a size larger than they should have been despite being marked a 9.5 . Sooo , I returned them again . This time , we 'll buy in person as Amazon can not be trusted to deliver a quality product that is sized correctly .	-1
The snaps are cheaply made from a thin punched metal . Two have already sprung open and he 's worn them only a few times.This is such a disappointment because the fabric part is great and he loves the look.I would n't buy them again nor recommend them to anyone who likes suspenders .	-1
The quality does n't look great . It 's very thin and it looks like it will disintegrate if I 'm any rougher with it . The sleeves were too long and the neckline as sagging . Does n't keep me that warm either . A cotton shirt might have been able to do the same job .	-1
This was a very pricey item that was a poor fit . While it was warm , the arms were too long and the material did not hold its shape once it was put on . It just kept stretching .	-1
very light material and look very cheap ... with first wash shrank and became loose . very unhappy with this purchase . I regret buying them .	-1
I do n't know if these are warm , they were so flimsy that I knew I would destroy them after wearing only a few times . I returned them .	-1
I purchased these for my husband , and I will not purchase them again.The canvas began tearing , and actually got holes in it on the toes ofboth shoes - after just a few weeks of everyday wear.I have purchased the Saucony brand in the past , and really expected aMUCH higher-quality shoe from this company !	-1
The tiny screws that hold the lid on fell out within a month of purchase.Poorly made	-1
I feel similarly about this item as I do about Communism : Seems good in theory , but in reality , it falls apart ( quite literally ) ! I was very excited about this item , ordered it , and it arrived with the hinges already broken , w/the screws fallen out . Then , because I thought it was just a fluke , I ordered ANOTHER one , and the exact same thing happened , only this time , half of the back side of the lid ( near the screws go ) was totally split . So basically , all this item did for me was cause me a bunch of time and trouble to return . It 's tempting , but my advice is find something else- stay away from this !	-1
It ran for two weeks . I am surprised since I have own many Timex 's over the years . None have ever quite this soon . It took several weeks to get but that has nothing to do with the watch .	-1
Timex Women 's T29271 Elevated Classics Dress Sport Chic Silver-Tone Bracelet Watch - felt cheap and was way to big for a woman 's hands . Resizing would have made it look silly for the number of links that needed to come out with the big clap underneath .	-1
I liked the functionality especially the countdown timer & the alarms . However , it did n't last . I was just in Mexico & condensation formed under the watch glass on a humid day . I did NOT go scuba diving while I was there . Now , the watch in useless.I would recommend the cheaper Casio which lasted almost 2 years for me until the band broke .	-1
It has a good strong alarm , and the three alarms with daily/weekday/weekend options are very handy . Also not a huge watch , very well-sized for smaller arms like mine . I had one for a couple of years that finally go too scratched up . I replaced it with another , and after one diop in the pool the crystal completely fogged up . So much for the 100 mete , good for anything up to and including snorkel diving !	-1
Within a few weeks there were many scuffs on the watch face . It had gotten to the point where I had to angle my wrist in a certain position to be able to see the time.The leather band literally disintegrated after 8 months of wear .	-1
The watch keeps losing minutes , and the light wo n't come on , anymore . Took it in for a new battery , and that did n't do anything for it . Too expensive , $ 28 , for it to fall apart so quickly .	-1
Ordered this for my wife , but returned it because she said the numbers , and therefore , the watch were too small.This might be the right watch for someone looking for a very traditional look , but it 's not large enough for today 's style	-1
Ok these will do the job if you 're looking for something that will only be needed for a few uses . The are really flimsy and once they 've been stretched to the size of your leg the next time you put them on unless you 're wearing a garter belt they are n't going to stay up .	-1
One size does not fit most . They are really loose and fall off unless I wear garters . They do nothing for the shape of my legs , but it 's not worth the hassle to return them .	-1
I am not a plus size woman , but decided to order these since I figured they 'd fit more comfortably than regular size . These fit terribly and get runs so easy ! I 'm only 5'1 & # 34 ; and wear size 12 in clothing , & they barely go above my knee and fit tight so they roll down . Terrible buy ! So disappointed : - (	-1
I ordered these in white . I was expecting them to need a garter , but they did n't . However , they were n't flattering . They 're not lace top and I think the intention was for them to be worn with a garter . The tops dug into my legs and I had to cut them and fix them . More work than they were worth . They 're also a very thin fabric , not high quality . Snagged easily .	-1
Once again from Amazon ... a watch with a short watch band . That 's one thing i like about going in a store is they have special long watches you can try on ... not having any luck here . Otherwise nice ! Band barely meets together on my wrist .	-1
Timex use to be a great company not so now . I have ordered several watches and all have quit working . I ordered this watch with several items that came in one box . Had company put the box up Christmas items opened it today to check out my items and the clock was running . No plastic strip to keep it off . Last time I will ever buy a Timex and we love buying watches . I think everyone should start buying quality watches not cheap ones .	-1
I bought this for my six-year old daughter and it lasted three days . OH ! and the first time she wore it in the pool , it filled with water . Extremely disappointing for a Timex product . My daughter has been begging for a watch but I guess I 'll keep looking ...	-1
I have at least 5 pair of KEEN 's . All are a size 7 . I ordered these in a 7 and found they were more like a 6 or 6 1/2 but marked 7 . These are a wonderful red color and very cute style . Will try again as this product is well made and wears like iron !	-1
Ordered a few of these and one pair had runs right out of the package and another pair ran just by her putting them on . Look elsewhere .	-1
I was very disappointed the first time I put these on since the cutout is huge ! It is not shown that way in the photo for this product . Also , as others wrote , they snag and mine got a hole in the toe the 3rd time I wore them so I am back to buy another brand . Also , after the first washing they shrunk and were then tight in the crotch area , which was odd . I would suggest buying another brand of crotchless pantyhose .	-1
He likes it okay as far as quality and warmth . In fact , for doing outdoorsy things such as shoveling snow , it may be too warm . The biggest complain he has is with the stiffness and it 's almost impossible to take off from his shoulders . It 's a good fit once he gets it on -- -just taking it off has been a problem .	-1
I ordered a pair for my husband but the quality of the fabric just seems too harsh for skin . Very stiff and course .	-1
I wear a 42 pants and in dickies usually purchase a 44 . These were a 50 and did n't fit . Quality seems fine , just bummed the sizes were off of what I usually order .	-1
these socks seemed okay at first , but stretch out while wearing them . Maybe I ordered one size too large ? Also , do away with that ugly beige color in the 3 pack mixed colors .	-1
They do not keep shape , run down on your feet constantly so you have to pull up to keep in place ; after two washes they look about 100 years old . I would never buy this item again ! The quality and fitting are horrendous ... wish I could have returned them .	-1
This sweater is much thinner then I expected . The photo shown to advertise it looks like the sweater is pretty thick or at least medium . When I got it , it was very thin & even looked stretched , the front design was very open . In the picture it looks like the design is stitched tight and therefore well made but the one delivered to me was n't . Also , the arms are way too long . I ordered size Medium knowing the length of the sweater is kind of long , that 's ok but when the sleeves are way too long , then it 's not practical . No wonder the women in the picture has one arm held up and the other in her pants pocket.I have ordered before from National & it was all good , but not this time .	-1
As stated , these stockings ran within twenty minutes of putting them on . I did nothing exceptional to cause it ... I just started at the toe and crept up my foot . Also , the nude color will make you look worse than dead . It is more pale than a mannequin . Just all around hideous and cheap . Do n't buy .	-1
These are not worth a dollar ... they are horrible quality and do not stay up on your thighs . I am a normal size 10 and they fell down to my ankles . Normally I would complain they were to tight as most stockings are but these were just blah . In my opinion go for something with a little bit higher quality . wasted my money	-1
I usually love everything I get from leg avenue , but these were very poor quality . the feel of the nylon was rough and uncomfortable . the tops lost their shapes and got saggy . Look at some of their other products though . this seller is usually spot on .	-1
Like I said I now know that I hate back seams it was just such a pain getting them in place and making them stay there but the thigh high them selves where really nice .	-1
Creeps up my back and the hooks do n't stay hooked that well . If you order it anyway , I would suggest going down a size .	-1
If I seem angry , I am . Leisure ? ? ? No . I bought this to hang around the house when company comes over . Forget it . Braless it is . This was not supportive so I might as well not be wearing any bra at all and be comfy.Leading Lady ... .get with the program . THIS BRA DID NOT FIT MY BIG BOOBS . Is n't that the line you are in ? ? ? Big Boobs ? I ordered two ... . and the Black bra is going to get the same review .	-1
This was so small that I could not wear it at all . I hope the problem with this bra is that the one I received was sized incorrectly . This was definitely not a comfortable bra . I am returning it .	-1
I think I would have loved this but it is smaller than any Size 38 I have and the cups are more of a C than D. Very skimpy . I have ordered other size 38 's in different brands and this one is 1.5 & # 34 ; smaller when I lay them on top of another .	-1
http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00804F5D0/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThe runs very small . I had to return it for a refund minus the handling fees . I bought a 38C because I wear 36C bra and read that this ran small , but I 'd have to order up 4 sizes for it to fit around .	-1
I originally reviewed this bra with somewhat optimistic undertones , stating that maybe it would stretch over time , or I would get used to it . But after owning it for six months , I grimly see it for what it is.-About 2 sizes too small-Unpadded-Utterly uncomfortable-A waste of money.This is mostly on me , because I did n't read the comments first . Other users have warned about these things , and if I 'd read them , I would 've skipped this one over . I was really looking forward to using this thing , because it 's so much easier to buckle from the front . But every time I wore it , I was squirming , and tugging at it to try to get some slack , and it left squeeze marks under the bustline each time . Not to mention that the complete lack of padding made for no protection , and therefore no comfort . Also , the lines that go up the breasts show through certain shirts . If you 're looking for a front buckling bra , keep looking because there are far better ones out there , and this one is NO GOOD !	-1
Pretty bras , but their sizing is way off . I had to return all of them , which was a pity because they were cute ... just clearly not sized correctly .	-1
The bra is comfortable but only for a few hours after that the front hooks start rubbing on your rib cage and it is very uncomfortable . If I had n't worn it all day , I would return this bra .	-1
I am returning this item because I like my bras to have a little more material over the breast . I do n't like push up or padded bras , but this material is so thin , that if you 're the slightest bit chilly , your nipples will be showing through your blouse . However , I did find that this bra was true to size ( 34D ) although it is a snug bra .	-1
The overall design of this bra is good - but the fit is not . It fits too tightly and is very uncomfortable . ( I wondered if it would loosen up , eventually , but do n't know if I could wear it long enough for that to happen ! ) I wear these types of bras when I work out with a trainer - usually comfortable and I do n't have to worry about straps slipping , etc . But , this bra is just too tight and uncomfortable . I have already worn it - so - I guess it will go in the give away box ! I usually really like Wacoal bras , so I was disappointed .	-1
The fabric is very thin . Coverage is a primary consideration , and I could n't wear this with a t-shirt without scandalizing the neighbors . It had to go back .	-1
The first thing you notice about this bra in Toast color is that it looks as a posture correcting device in terms of color , fabric texture , overall design and ugly straps in the back , in particular . So , in short , the look is bad , you can not undress without scaring your man . Perhaps , in black this bra would look better , but far from being attractive anyway . The cups are very thin , as other reviewers already noticed , but for me it was not a problem . Hence , I give it 2 stars for holding the straps at the center as a T-back supposed . The bust support is OK for one day until fabric stretches . Wonder why it is so expensive if it is neither good sport or comfort bra , nor a sexy dress style .	-1
The girlfriend here . I was excited to try this bra but it just was n't for me . I did end up returning it . It was accurately sized and felt very comfortable but it seemed to push down and not lift and I prefer a little lift ! Otherwise it would be a very comfortable bra . I do n't care for the extra thin cups either , I like a very slight thickness , not padded but not nylon thin either . These cups are nylon thin .	-1
I really , really wanted to love this bra . It shipped quickly and when I opened it up the product seemed to be of the usual high quality that comes with a Wacoal bra . But when I went to try it on it was far too small for me . I usually wear a 38DD and that is what I ordered . I have many other Wacoal bras and I always wear a 38DD no exceptions . But this fit like a 34DD . The cup size was fine but the band was far too small . I sadly went out of town and missed the opportunity to return it so I 'll hope that I lose a bit of weight and it will one day fit because it seems like a really good bra , just make sure you order up a size or two .	-1
Weird hook -- not standard for front-hook bras . Could n't get it hooked -- needed help . Then , it did n't fit -- cut the breasts .	-1
I bought some Old Navy fold-over jersey skirts in several colors for the summer , and took the `` no panty line promise '' seriously . It did n't work for me . Shows ight through ... period .	-1
How could they promise no panty lines when these panties show the worst panty lines I 've ever had in any panties I 've worn ? Not cool !	-1
These were too big and set too high on the waist . Otherwise they were ok I guess not mubh better than that .	-1
I bought some Old Navy fold-over jersey skirts in several colors for the summer and took the `` no panty line promise '' seriously . It did n't work for me . Shows right through ... period .	-1
They were sweaty - it was weird like wearing plastic . Also snagged and looked old after ONE washing . Whoever designed these did not try them on or wash them .	-1
While I expect these would fit ( based on my experience with other Jockey undies ) , I did not try them on , as I do n't like the looks of them . The panties are skimpy and the material is flimsy . If that is what you are expecting , they are probably fine , but not for me .	-1
Very Disappointed ! ! ! Returned ... Lace was n't soft , so definantly uncomfortable . Also , the cups are very strange . I was almost coming out if the sides because the cups extend out extremely narrow . Resembled a balloon that was n't blown up entirely . . . Best description I could come up with .	-1
I did n't look closely enough to the photo , becasue these were wierd cone cups . I liked the stretchy lace , but they are cut to make your boobs look like 50 's rockets and it just did n't fit right . Returned .	-1
These do not fit like theVanity Fair Perfectly Yours Brief 15712nor theVanity Fair Women 's Perfectly Yours Lace Nouveau Brief Panty # 13001with those panties being a size too big on me which I enjoy . These cotton panties were a size or two too small . After almost getting a pair on , I took them off , repackaged them , printed out an Amazon Return Form and immediately dropped them off at UPS - all on the same day I received them . From the previous reviews I expected bloomery , puffy cotton panties as from my childhood but it was not to be . I guess I will always wear nylon panties . I am VERY disappointed but refuse to go up to a giant size 10 or so . I gave it two stars simply because they were Vanity Fair but probably made in China .	-1
Tried these on over my panties , and it was a perfect fit . Ran them through the wash , and they came out AT LEAST a full size smaller . The shrinkage of the fabric was so bad that the elastic is actually bunched up now at the openings . The leg openings are tight now , the height of the panty from crotch to belly is so much shorter , the rear area is n't fully covered . I ca n't wear them , and i ca n't send them back now . Vanity Fair is disappointing me after many years of satisfaction.I ca n't say these are even worth trying . Keep looking .	-1
I needed a workout bra , my girls were so smashed they hurt , it is really hard to find a workout bra that does n't smush large breasts . This is unfortunately one of those , it did n't come down long enough either so I had to wear this and a regular bra over it which sort of defeats the purpose of having a workout bra- my search continues ... ...	-1
I found this bra to be uncomfortable . The straps were uncomfortable , and the band was uncomfortable as well . It did seem to provide support , however . Bali has other bras that are way better .	-1
I have a hard time finding a bra in my size , it works fine around but the cups are usally too large and bag out as is the case here . I know a good bra fit can be done because I 've had bra 's in the past that fit very well . Somehow things are not being manufactured as they once were and this bra ended up as were others - in my donation bin . Too bad really , wasted my money and am continuing to have no choice but to wear the old bra 's .	-1
I 've worn the Bali Double Support bra since the early 1980s . Certainly I 've bought other brands , and I had n't bought a Bali in a while . I was disappointed to find that as I 've aged and my body has changed , these bras no longer fit comfortably . I found a replacement by Bali that is terrific ( Comfort Revolution ) , and I returned this bra , so everything worked out fine .	-1
A style bra by Playtex I have worn for several years is not made in the band size I need now so I 'm searching for another . I 've ordered several styles by several companies including Playtex and the cups are always too big , sometimes by a lot , sometimes by a little . If I ordered the cup size I get when I measure myself by the way to measure for a bra , I would be ordering an even larger cup.This bra was okay other than being too large in the cup .	-1
Was ok for the cost , but did not support well in cups . And was not cotton where it needed to be for comfort sake [ inside under band ]	-1
The title says it all . This bra is not comfortable . Also , the cup does not fit properly . I put it in the charity box after one wearing .	-1
The cups on this bra are to shallow . The side do n't support you as much as I like them . The straps are to narrow , and eat into your shoulder . I do n't recommend this to a full breasted woman .	-1
Do not like the non stretch straps , they are too silky and fall off my shoulders . The cups were too big despite C being my size in all other Bali Bras . Will stick to buying them in stores .	-1
I read many positive reviews on this bra , which is why I was surprised to be disappointed once I put it on.It is comfortable and very stretchie all over , fits true to size , my complaint is in the cups , there is no support at all , some ladies stated this bra gave the the look of torpedo boobs ... That may be an improvement over having them look like a couple of wet noodles ! I was looking for true support without under wires , and this does NOT deliver . Not even worth the postage to send it back ! Good thing I also ordered a Glamorise Magic Lift , which is AWESOME , I will be ordering more of those and no more of these .	-1
Not sure why it 's called double support bra , because there is no support . The straps do not stay in place causing the girls to drop ... .so will not reccommend to anyone if they are REALLY LOOKing for SuPpOrT .	-1
I got these for a surprise for my fiance and regardless on what people said , the sticky things that are supposed to keep them on your thighs do NOT work if you have large thighs .	-1
It said they had an elastic/rubber band to keep these up without garter belt . But there is n't one at all ! So they wo n't stay up without one and roll down too much to wear : ( Ok if that 's what you want , but I was looking for the kind that stay up on their own .	-1
This product was not what I wanted or thought I was ordering . I wanted stay-up istockings and did not want to have to wear a garter belt !	-1
The first thing I noticed was the frayed edges on the lace that were unraveling right out of the package . The hose are indeed quite thin and while I managed not to put a run in them , I ca n't imagine they would last anywhere near a good pair of L'Eggs . They were a bit hard to get on ( imagine putting on your garters with your hose together , good luck getting it straight the first time ... ! ) but , you get used to it . What I would never get used to is that once I sat down to dinner and then stood back up , the garter was now riding halfway down my butt ! The host themselves were now down near my knees , with the lace tops well below where a mid-thigh skirt would hit . Nope , these are going in the trash .	-1
Nice Hose , but to small and will not stay up.the largest size are still to small for big thigh womenthey do n't make these hose large enough	-1
Earlier this year i bought the exact same size , style & color levi 's and liked them so much that i purchased this pair on line . Big mistake ! ! Does not fit even close to the pair i bought at the store . Plus the pocket stitching on the back has two different color thread : some is orange and some is white . What 's up with that ?	-1
Thinner material , 5 loops , yeah the customers wanted that ... riiight ! These 505 are cheap and are not the Real 505 of just 2 years ago . The waist line is cut lower.Thank you Levi , you just lost a 45 years life long Brand name consumer , including the Docker Brand . Glad you saved a whole nickel on the removal of 2 belt loops .	-1
I have a pair of 505 in the same size as the new pair I ordered on Amazon . The previous pair was bought on sale at a local Fred Meyer . They were durable and fit well . They actually lasted over a year with frequent wearing and once per week washing ( I estimate around 40-50 washes ) . So I bought the same size and fit on Amazon just in a darker color to wear at work . I also bought a pair of the 515 slim fit Levi 's a few weeks ago and they were perfect and fit exactly the same as another pair I own . But I wanted the less 'slim ' fit of the 505s for work , also wanted the regular and not low rise waist . So I ordered the same exact size and style : Bad idea ! The 505s I got came with a tag saying 'sits below waist ' , which is NOT what they used to say . Before , the 505s were a zipper fly version of the 501s . Putting the pair of 505s I already owned next to the new pair from Amazon , I could see the crotch to waist was almost an inch shorter on the new pair . Trying the new pair on , I discovered a most unpleasant sensation of my 'man parts ' being crushed in agonizing ways . No amount of tugging would get the pants to sit right.Then I tried on the 515 slim jeans , and they were actually ROOMIER in the crotch area . The thighs were a little slimmer than the 505s , but the seat was the main difference . No sag in the seat of the 515s compared to the 505.And then in trying on the recently purchased 515s ( in the same color as the new 505s I purchased ) I noticed something interesting . The denim in the new pair was thinner and tougher feeling than in the 515s . It was n't just the feeling of the jeans prior to washing . The 515s never felt that tough , and the denim was thicker in the side by side comparison.I returned them based on a misleading product description ( no mention of low rise waist ) and inferior quality . I gave the 515s a 5 star rating because they were as good as the previous 515s that I bought at a high price from a department store . The previous 505s were also great ( Fred Meyer of all places - though they do n't have the 505s anymore ... booo ) . So I 'm sticking with the 515s until something changes with them . I 'll take the slightly low waist and save my manhood . And the better quality denim means they 'll last longer anyway . So here are my comparisons : Levi 's 505 purchased 9/10/12 from Amazon - 1 starLevi 's 505 purchased fall 2011 from Fred Meyer - 5 starLevi 's 515 purchased 6/22/2012 from Amazon - 5 starJust be aware that the product might differ slightly from what is described , and that the quality appears to vary from order to order . I suspect that is why the great divide in 1 and 5 star reviews . I love Levi 's jeans , and I will continue to buy them , but I will be a little more careful with the online purchasing . And remember , if you buy from Amazon , they will return or exchange any unwashed clothing items .	-1
Levi 's 505 jeans have been my go-to work pants for about the past 20 years . I could go to any store , and pick up a pair with the 505 label , waist 33 , and length 32 , and have them fit just like every other pair I own . However , Levi has decided to re-shape these , but to retain the same 505 label . They are now designed for the teenage boy , twenty-something market . They sit uncomfortably low , on the hips rather than at the waist . They are tighter in the crotch . I suppose boys want to show off their & # 34 ; package. & # 34 ; I 've spent the past year or so trying to find something to replace to old 505 's , but with only limited success . These are no longer your father 's jeans . Too bad for me that I 'm still your father .	-1
The pants seem to be acceptably made ( the label indicates it was made in Cambodia ) - although slightly thinner material than I expected . The color that I ordered ( Blue Collar ) is fine and is what I expected . However , these pants are way too tight on the thighs - especially when sitting down , and it makes the length appear much shorter because of it . I though about keeping them , but I can not put up with the tightness at the thighs . Also , the pockets seem to `` bunch up '' too much and you must often put your hands in your pockets to keep them down ... a major fail , so I 'm returning them and will try out the Levi 's Men 's 560 Comfort Fit Jean instead .	-1
Is a regular waist pants size 40 but seems leg is size 38 ! Long legs and well although this is something up between legs !	-1
So annoying . I 've been wearing Levi 's 505 as long as I can recall . The move to overseas production has really hosed up the quality of these jeans , though . And they are terribly , terribly inconsistent . In the most recent instance , I ordered two pairs from the same seller through Amazon , in different colors . What I 've noticed over the last few years is that different colors appear to be made by different foreign factories -- some in Mexico , some in China , some in Bangladesh , etc . And depending on where they are made , the weight of the fabric and the actual fit is quite inconsistent . When I order these things , I want/expect them to fit the same way , every color , every time . Not an unreasonable expectation , I think . Levi Strauss was able to achieve this for quite a number of years . Evidently , though , like most other American businesses they have simply ceased to give a rip , opting for comparatively inexpensive labor and compromised quality . Makes me frickin ' sad .	-1
I 've been loyal to Levi 's for about 20 years now . I used to be able to walk into a store , grab some 32x32s , cash out and go home . They would always fit . This is no longer true . The quality of this brand has been slipping for years , and now it 's to the point to where I think I need to find a new brand to buy . It is hard enough to find 32x32 jeans , and about 1 in 4 that I try on wo n't fit right at all . Nearly every pair suffers from the `` leg-twist , '' which is caused when the manufacturer cuts the bolt off-grain ( this condition frequently gets worse after you wash. ) Other less frequent issues ( but noticeably more common these days ) would be crooked seams , crooked/misplaced tags , missing rivets , and uneven leg-lengths . It seems that Levi 's has been moving to thinner textiles , which means the jeans will wear out faster.Hopefully the quality returns . If not , I 'll be moving on .	-1
These do n't scream dorky but if you look closely that 's what they whisper . I bought them for my husband who is 40 and they look a little old for him- and we 're not really young . Fine if you are looking for something basic but not stylish .	-1
compre unos 34 '' y parece que fueran como 36 '' porque son grandisimos y me quedan super anchos . No me gustaron para nada	-1
Agree with the other reviewers who criticize the way they fit ( do n't fit ) at the waist . While they feel and generally fit like quality Levis , they are more low-rise than I expected or like and I am constantly pulling them up..	-1
The quality of Levis jeans seems to be a decline , an endless abyss . The back label , which supposedly should be leather , now seems to be made & # 8203 ; & # 8203 ; of cardboard and a lousy finish . The jeans manufactured in Mexico and Egypt are the worst labels or at least , in my experience , has been . I think there should be more oversight by Levis in its factories around the world . Previously , a Levis jeans was a piece `` almost perfect '' , today I can not say the same . I totally agree with all the people who are disappointed with diminishing quality of these jeans .	-1
I bought these Levis because I haved owned many pairs in the past and they have always been good quality jeans I could trust . Levis was recently bought and since has tried to change their look to appeal to the younger crowd . They messed with just about every type of jeans except the 501 but that has button fly and I prefer a zipper fly . The fit is super low rise on these 505 and every time I sit my backside shows and I ca n't stand it . My old 505s did not do this . The material is now super low quality and is not worth the price I paid for them . They shrink uncontrollably and now they are short at the leg opening exposing my ankle . These are horrible jeans in terms of fit and quality , look elsewhere until this company learns it lesson not to mess with a good thing .	-1
I 've always wanted to buy several Levi 's and be brand loyal but over the years the sizing across several styles and denim is simply all over the place . Seat is usually way too tight or too baggy ( as is the fit ) , inseam is always way too long . Had hopes with this style but again , disappointed . Certainly not a brand for those looking to avoid way too skinny or way too baggy jeans . Simple straight legged pants that fit as sized on the labeling are extremely hard to come by these days . Levi 's sizing is so erratic you basically need to try on a dozen pairs across a dozen styles to get remotely close to what might adequately fit . Should n't be this hard to buy Levi 's .	-1
hubby looks & # 34 ; hott & # 34 ; in the old 505 but these ? ugghhthey came out of the dryer wrinkled up . quality of jean material is shoddy.also , the pockets were stitched in to the leg . such poor workmanship.so bad , itz funny . since needing new jeans this year , i will be buying carhartt or dickies for work jeans.these are Junk ! !	-1
These may not be the worst jeans I have ever owned but they are way ahead of whatever is in second place . You would think that as much as the charge for jeans now that they could afford to put some belt loops on them . I should have the advise of previous reviews and not purchased these jeans .	-1
This is my last time of buying Levis . Order this model and 2 others at the same time during an Amazon sale . Been wearing the same and models for decades . The quality and fit of the fabric just is n't there anymore . One pair got a hole in the upper thigh after the first washing . All the jeans I bought this time , stretch out within hours of wearing . I have a 31 inch waist , and if I do not have a belt on these jeans are sliding way down within an hour . This is after washing and drying 5 times . Ended up going to Marshall 's and getting much higher quality jean for half the price . Sad to see a company like Levi let themselves forget about their customers . They are so focused on producing at the loweest price , that they no longer seem interested in producting a quality product . Too bad	-1
I had such high hopes for this garment . It 's PRETTY , well constructed , relatively lightweight , came in higher sizes , and had decent firming and control for a time , but this garment is soooooo UNCOMFORTABLE ! I found the material scratchy and hard , it also did n't really `` give '' or conform to my body . While the upper half did do a decent job of holding me in , the lower half was an EPIC FAILURE ! The legs kept rolling up , and that made the whole thing constantly twist , UGGH ! Needless to say I spent the day adjusting , and by the end of the day I was peeling myself out of this shaper in pain with red marks from all the twisting and adjusting . I made my purchase based on the reviews I 'd read , I bought it in black , white , & beige . I wish people were more forthcoming and analytical in their reviews , it would have saved me a great deal of time and disappointment . Maybe it 's me but I returned the 2 I did n't wear and my search continues . So sad ...	-1
Cheaply made , not much weight to it at all . Maybe I am used to my other bras with more fabric to them	-1
It 's hard to find 34DD in the stores where I live , so I ordered a bunch on amazon knowing that I would find one 's that fit great and one 's that suck . This bra sucked . I measured it against a 34 DD that I love wearing and the straps , band , and cup shape were all different . It 's made well , but does n't fit my body .	-1
After reading other reviews I decided to give these red label 517s a try , even though over the years no Levi jeans have ever fit my frame quite right . My aging body now has a little round tummy , along with skinny legs and a flat rear end . These jeans were baggy in the rear and so snug in the front that they emphasized my tummy . The material they are made from is also a much lighter weight than I remember Levi jeans of old . I sent them back for a refund , and bought Lee Men 's Premium Select Regular Fit Straight Leg jeans instead .	-1
I have at last 4 of the Levi 's but this one is too long ( & # 62 ; L ) and too small ( & # 60 ; W ) . I usually use at this time 32X32 , this one is 32X32 too but not fit , were disappointed : ( (	-1
I am having an awful time finding jeans to wear at the waist ... not low on hips like most . While these do fit at the waist and the length is okay they are too baggy and after several washes are still stiff and uncomfortable . The material is too thick . Wish I 'd have returned them , guess now is too late .	-1
The color of these seemed off . They had an odd shine to them , they looked more like coated women 's jeans . They were also very tight through the thigh . I have bought these exact jeans for years and have never had a problem , seems like the & # 34 ; formula & # 34 ; has changed . I sent them back .	-1
This is terrible ! I am upset and disappointed ! I ordered a pair of 517 jeans using a size . The jeans mailed to me showed the size on the Levi 's patch , however they were several inches too long and the waist was much wider than normal . This was definitely not the size stated on the label.Very frustrating , especially after we were eagerly anticipating their arrival I hesitate to mail-order jeans again after this experience .	-1
This used to be a relaxed fit . It 's now a skinny fit jean . Decently well made though . Why does Levi change it cuts so often ?	-1
This has to be a knock off . I 've worn K Swiss shoes for as long AS I can remember . This is my first attempt at buying them online . I 'll never do it again . The soles are removable in these shoes , which real K Swiss does not do . They are so uncomfortable ! Like walking on 2x4 's . They are super heavy and bulky . They do n't soften up , and now because they were worn to find all of this out , I doubt I can return them . Save your money and buy them at the store to make sure it 's a real K Swiss shoe because this shoe is terrible ! ! ! ! !	-1
This does look quite pretty on . However , the heavily textured embroidery is raised & ridged , & that is what is sitting next to your skin , as it is unlined . The cup runs a bit small ( compared to say , the Whimsy ) & also gives an odd , flattened shape due to the vertical seams .	-1
Must be made for someone with NO boobs . It 's obviously just a show bra . Do n't even waste your money . NO support , itchy fabric , and does n't hold a good shape .	-1
im not sure why but i wasnt exactly happy with the thickness of the shirt , i for some reason thought itd be thinner and larger . for the price next time ill just go to target or something .	-1
60 % COTTON and 40 % POLYESTER T SHIRT . Now , it was described as 100 % cotton , and that 's what I wanted to buy . If the sellers are not able to honestly describe their product , then they will lose the ability to sell to people via the web . ITS IMPERITIVE that the sellers are honest , for us to buy sight unseen . People do n't realize , perhaps , that polyester cotton blended cloth is much cheaper than pure cotton . PURE COTTON breathes in hot weather , and absorbs sweat better . The shirt looks OK , the color and size is nice , so is the cut . BUT , it will wear out MUCH faster , than 100 % cotton . It wont fade in that cool way that 100 % cotton does , nor will it shrink a bit , which is why I buy 2X for 100 % cotton . I 'm VERY DISAPPOINTED , especially because my TIME was wasted , simply because the seller felt like being dishonest .	-1
I have purchased other Rago products with pleasure , however , this one does n't do the job . There was no waist reduction , which is the point of a cincher . I am tall , so the length was a bit short for me , but most things are too short in the waist .	-1
I wanted to return this right away but never got around to it . I hated this . It wasnt long enough and it pushed all of my fat down making it look like I had a ugly pouch . Then the top around my ribs it was too big . It really needs to have multiple slots to choose from like a bra so you can tighten one area and loosen another . If your trying to reign in the love handles try something else .	-1
Far too thin and elastic to be able to do anything except gently st around your waist ... Waist of money.mtotally..Stick to the suqueem rubber or cotton/rubber , they are th only one providing any sort of support and tightness ...	-1
This does not fit . I ca n't get all the hooks fastened . It is not the right product for me . Once on it would be comfortable but I would have to have someone help me get it on every time .	-1
I got this cincher for my holiday party dress , but it was awful . My boyfriend did n't like it at all . It cinched me in , but it was too long for my torso and added an extra & # 34 ; curve & # 34 ; where it ended . I did n't look like a better version of myself at all . I ended up not wearing it under the dress and just returned it.I also ordered the Fleece cincher based on reviews some people liked this one better and others that one . Similar issue there . I returned them both .	-1
I absolutely hate those thighs . They are cheaply made , they do n't fit right , sizing is way off . I absolutely hate it . Luckily they were inexpensive but still , money that ended in my trash . Do n't buy it !	-1
It does not stay up . The backing behind the lace that says it helps it to stay in place , fell of as I tried it on . Weird .	-1
I 'm not really a plus-size gal ( 12/14 ) , but I have chunky thighs and I hate the thigh-high mushroom effect , so I went with plus size just to be safe . No luck - these were incredibly tight and very unflattering . There was also an odd greasy residue on the cardboard insert in the package . Of course you ca n't return stockings once opened , so now I 'm stuck with these useless stockings . They really are pretty to look at draped over a hanger , but if you have large thighs , that 's about all they 're good for.Fortunately , the capable folks at Sock Avenue were able to help - they recommended Leg Avenue 's Plus Size Sheer & # 34 ; Lace Top Stockings with Backseam , & # 34 ; which were , oddly , so much stretchier they were almost too big , which was actually perfect . Now I just wish I knew what to do with these !	-1
I loved this watch when I first recieved it but I have quite a collection and do n't wear any one watch often . Bought this one in July 2012 , it is now January 2013 and I 've only worn it 3 times . On the 3rd wearing the band came loose from the face and at this point I can only get a partial refund . NOT COOL ! ! I have one other Skagen that I purchased at the same time ( a browm dial ) and now I 'm almost afraid to wear that one . Like this one , it is thin and nice to look at . I will not even consider another Skagen in the future . Looks and feels like quality , but NOT !	-1
Sadly this watch looks cheap and is cheap in person . I returned it . Maybe it is n't a good idea to buy jewelry like this over the internet .	-1
This bra pokes you in the armpits . I usually buy Elomi , mostly because it 's the easiest to find in my area , but I thought I 'd go out on a limb because this bra gets good reviews . It provides good support but it pokes me in the armpits every time I bend over to pick something up ( which I do all day long since I have small children at home . I would not buy this brand again .	-1
i had a breast augmentation over a year ago and to find a great fitting bra that doesnt look like a granny bra is hard ! ! i tried this and it is FULL coverag . now i dont walk around with my boobs hanging out of my shirt or anything . i returned this asap .	-1
I ordered this bra with hopes based on reviews . Unfortunately , when it arrived , I was disappointed to find that it was not only completely sheer , but had no padding or molded cup . It is not a sexy bra either . It does offer a good deal of support , however . I went by the size chart as I am normally a 40G ( north America ) and purchased a 40F as per recommendation . Unfortunately the cup was a bit small , but as I live in Canada , return shipping is too expensive . Within an hour of trying on the bra , I went back to look at it , and noticed that the seam in the middle of the cup was already a centimeter unraveled . But as I did not notice it before I removed the tags , there is nothing that I can do other than to stitch the hole up myself . I feel that I paid too much for a bra with a hole in it .	-1
The fabric was stiff and scratchy . The band was a little small and the cups were way too small and cut into my breasts making ugly bulges . I ordered two other bras at the same time ( same size but a different brand ) and those fit great .	-1
I loved the Penache Daisy bra which is n't made anymore . This is not similar . Looks a bit like it but the fit is so small and the material is far to sheer . Sentit back .	-1
Sent it back because at 34G there is just no way the tiny straps , and double hooks would support me . Other brands like Fantasie , Freya , Prima Donna , when you order larger cups you get wider straps and triple hooks.but perhaps for someone very young this could work . Good price but SUPER sheer , not like what the models have on .	-1
I ordered the 32K , per size charts ... I think the cups run smaller then the size chart states.The bra is made of a rough material , it rubbed my armpits and cleavage raw after only a few hours.The under-wires poked threw after the second wearing . I only hand washed it.The stitching and seems show threw even heavy tee-shirts ... The stretchy straps are a bad idea for large breasts ... Overall I am not impressed with the quality of this product . I would not recommend it to women with large breasts .	-1
This bra was too pointy for my chest -- empty fabric actually stuck out away from my body in a point at the tip of each cup . The bra definitely was n't too big , because at the same time there was a little overflow at the top . What a weird fit . It 's a pretty bra , but not the right shape for me .	-1
This bra was great except the underwire is not covered enough so it stabs you ALL day . Was very disappointed ... sent 2 back . Also the bra was itchy in cups .	-1
I bought this bra in 4 sizes ( 32 FF and G , and 34 FF and G ) , determined to get one that worked . Well , the 32FF fit best , and the cups nicely covered the whole bust area , but the underwires go up weirdly high in the center and kind of stabbed my sternum . ( Some reviewers had this issue with the wires up under your arms , but I did n't have trouble there -- only in the center . ) This happened with all 4 of the sizes , so I think it 's an issue of the make vs personal fit.Also , this definitely gives you a 50s torpedo shape to your bustline . Even with the underwire issue , it was pretty and priced well enough that I considered keeping it ... until I put on a shirt and looked in the mirror . Everything was very high , separated , and pointy . I know some women like that lift , but as a somewhat younger consumer ( 29 ) I prefer a more rounded , natural look.You also do n't really get any cleavage line since everything is lifted so far apart . Again , that may be preferable for you .	-1
I ordered a 32F . The band seems looser than my others and was riding up in the back when I tried it on . A 30 would have worked well . I did not notice any itchiness or stabbing from the wires like others have posted . However , the cups give my breasts a cone shape and that is not something I find very flattering . Also , this bra did not have any tags ( sales tags ) other than the one attached to the hooks , this is something I expect when ordering something new . I will be sending this back .	-1
I 'm a 38H and this bra was great at first . But the weight of my boobs has formed a permanent crease in the band under my boobs , right where I need support the most . This results in a saggy appearance . I 'm giving up on trying anything that does n't have underwire . At my size , I think it 's just absolutely necessary for proper support and lift .	-1
I love Bravado bras but I do n't like this one . It 's one that you pull over your head so it 's more like a workout bra I guess ? It has too much fabric and the material in uncomfortable . Just not one of my fav bras by this company .	-1
I usually like Natori brand but the fit was weird on this bra . Totally the wrong shape , even though the size was correct . I returned it .	-1
I understand that I wear a size 38DDD , but I still feel that even if I wore a smaller size , this bra would do nothing for me . It is like a normal bra and will be used as such . It gives less support than some normal bras that I have had for over a year , a medium amount of lift and if I wore this to run , I would probably get hit in the face with a boob . No lie . The fabric is thin and does not & # 34 ; hold you in & # 34 ; as a sports bra really needs to do to be effective . Two stars because it does not do what it is intended to do . If you are looking for a good sports bra , I would definitely not recommend this one . If you want a & # 34 ; lounging around the house , comfortable cleaning bra & # 34 ; then yes , this would work for you .	-1
Did not care for the shape of this one at all . The fabric seems ok and the fit was good . But it makes pointy boobs .	-1
This bra was too big and made me look very pointy . Did not like and returned . Do like the exterior underwire .	-1
With all the great reviews , I knew I had to try this bra . Well , it is going back to Amazon . It is so thin and feels flimsy . I 'm going back to Champion !	-1
I 've previously had the Fannings and loved them . I thought since it was the same company that makes these they 'd be very similar . I was very disappointed to learn that was not the case . These state they 're medium and I 've never had an issue with a 7M before , however , when I try to slide my foot in the back strap near the heel is too narrow and cuts into my arch . It 's extremely uncomfortable and I had to return them due to the discomfort.I should have just stuck with what I 'm used to . I knew the Fannings were comfortable and I these looked so similar I thought I 'd give them a try . Even from looking at the photo of these the straps do n't look like they 're squeezing the foot but either I received an item that was put together wrong or the shoe is the photo is just better.I hate complaining and returning but I really had no choice on these . Looks like everyone else has had success .	-1
for these price I rather add more bucks and buy another pairs of fit flop.I owned one pair of fit flop and tried to get another pair cheaper for sandals so I tried reef but it failed me . not comfy . bad quality.I returned it .	-1
I loved my Keen sandals , mostly due to nice fit , they were a little sweatty though . So much that I bought the shoes ( very good ) , bought the work boots ( steel toed also very good ) , bought the socks ( not so good ) .I do n't honestly wear the H2 sandals that much , maybe had them about a year ( bought them last late summer/fall ) , but live in the northeast so its mostly a summer shoe , 4 -5 months a year or so . So we went to Grand Tetons , these were my `` off hiking day '' shoes for the trip . We did a 6 mile flat hike and the backs ripped out of one of them . By the way the socks have holes in the sides ( not heals or toes like you might expect ) . Used to be all their products seemed to have 5 star ratings ... me thinks the expansion to all kinds of shoes may be causing some kind of performance issues.So not much use , the treads on the bottom frankly look brand new but the heels ripped . I dunno if I will get another Keen shoe , I am seeing some of their newer stuff has some bad ratings . Still I 'd take them over almost anything Teva , but not at full price . I guess I would take another shot for $ 50 or $ 60 ... but for $ 100 they need to last more than a season .	-1
I like the Keen concept , but they are cheaply built and unacceptable as a beach sandal . I have the black model and they have turned a dark purple . The sun or salt water may have caused the change . I wore them everyday during my Culebra vacation . The shoes are not sturdy enough to use on a gravel beach . When I hiked a rocky path , I had to be careful or I would twist my ankle . My companion wore Teva sandals they proved to be a better casual sandal .	-1
I 've recently ( last 30 days ) bought three pair of KEEN shoes . All conventionall leather upper casual shoes . I 've ordered size 12 and the size has been spot on , until now . I just did n't like the way these fit Soooooooo I 'm returning them .	-1
I 've had these sandals for about a year . My brother swears by them and is on his second pair . First , they are very comfortable , and you forget you have them on . I like the closed toe design , which helps keep stones and sticks from getting in under your feet . That said , I will never buy another pair of these . Why ? They smell more than any other sandal I 've worn . I 'm 60+ and have had my share of sandals . These are the worst regarding smell . On a recent road trip w/ my wife and brother , if one of us took our Keens off in the car , the windows went down and complaints went up ! We laughed about it , but it was irritating nonetheless . Sure , washing them helps , for awhile . Depending on how often you wear them , you may need to wash them weekly . The 'anti-microbial ' treatment of the sole is a laugh . I 've had Merrell 's that have never had this problem . And my leather-insoled sandals never smell . I 've read so many other complaints about the smell of these sandals , that I know it is a problem . And I do n't think we need to hear about washing/powdering our feet as a solution . The solution for me is to look for a different brand of sandals .	-1
... this one 's just & # 34 ; okay. & # 34 ; It 's basically more of a glorified wallet . It has a lot of organization in it , but it 's so small that you ca n't do much . In one side pocket I have a little Vera Bradley journal . In the other side pocket a tiny credit card wallet and lipstick . The main compartment is big enough for my Epi-Pen , a pill case , my cell phone , and one Baggu , and that 's it . I 've ordered a Le Sportsac Frame Bag and that will replace this as soon as it arrives .	-1
If you have a short rise or are a little butt challenged order a size smaller . I used the sizing guide and these come to my belly button and are a little saggy in the back . You can see a little a line if wearing spandex . Not terribly noticeable . I would not order these again . Now that I have been been doing more comparison shopping , I can do better on price with brands that fit better , like Calvin Klein , etc .	-1
I do n't like the material - they ride up constantly and are not made as good as other jockey styles .	-1
I was excited when it was delivered , but when I tried to open the bag up one of the buttons fell off .	-1
The backing of the bag that gives its nice shape is made of some kind of wood or other hard material or cardboard . I was excited to get a `` man purse '' to carry my cell phones instead of attaching them to my belt . I placed the phones and tried to close the snap button but the backing broke . It cracked . I did n't even use the bag yet and the backing cracked in half . The backing could not even withstand pressure applied to close the snap buttons . What a major disappointment . They could n't make it out of something less brittle ? Useless .	-1
I 'd send it back but that is too much bother . The stitching is awful . It is just a single very thin thread stitched around the border . It is loose in several spots even before I have used it.It also still looks like a man purse even though it is canvas with black metal fittings . probably because it flares at the bottom.So if you want a canvas man purse that is badly stitched ... look no further .	-1
I did not like this unit , and returned it , because it is a bit bulky and does not have enough dividers and pockets to meet my needs . It may be suitable for other people , but definitely not what I needed .	-1
This visor slides down my forehead . I am constantly adjusting it . My hair is short , maybe it is for women with longer hair .	-1
I own at least 5 or 6 golf visors . I bought this one because I am constantly in search of a more comfortable one . This one had such great reviews I felt that this must be super comfortable - NOT ! ! No Headache Visor ? YES , BIG headache ! ! By about the 4th hole it felt like my head was in a vise . I guess I always thought I had an average sized head , and no one has ever told me otherwise , but maybe not ? All I know is that I 've never had another visor , or any other hat for that matter , fit as tightly as this visor - this thing was just plain awful ! I wo n't be wearing it again !	-1
Dickies needs to start making these shirts in an athletic or slimmer fit . The shirts are wonderful and comfortable for working in , but the tails are too short and the excess room in the stomach area makes it both come untucked and bunch up way too much . We 're required to wear these where I work , and tucked in , so the strange ( boxy almost ) cut makes it keep coming untucked . The bunched up look around the waist line is also very sloppy.If they made these in a slimmer athletic fit , I would but a million !	-1
I 'm 6 foot 175 with a 42 inch chest and 32 inch waist and bought a large . This thing fits like hammer pants for my torso . If you have an athletic build , avoid it .	-1
Maybe smaller sizes feel and fit better but with the larger size on my body it felt like I was wearing a rough potato sack . I returned the product .	-1
My husband likes these but I very much do n't . The edges at the open neck are only serged , not turned in . Not only does that look cheap , the rough edges are gathering pills from other fabrics in the laundry . The stitching of the button and the buttonhole that shows at the open neckline is cruddy , too . Where collar and beard stubble meet is getting pillie and worn after just 2 or 3 wearings . He bought four of these but I 'd be happy never to see them again .	-1
The pants have so much wrong with them , plus they look awful . It is my guess that dickies enjoys making money at the expense of the customer , both by making them pay too much for them and making them look stupid wearing them.1 . ) CARDBOARD PANTS . They are STIFF . Wash them 100 times and I guarantee you they will still feel like cardboard.2 . ) They are so tapered they barely fit over any boots you wear . Your feet look enormous next to these skinny pants . NO ROOM ! ! 3 . ) They ride so high on your waist it is uncomfortable4 . ) They are n't sized properly , a 36 is a 34 , 34 is 32 etc ... ..STAY AWAY .	-1
I returned them , they feel like you are wearing ski pants and are horribly uncomfortable to wear & # 8230 ; . unless you need some ski pants : )	-1
AS SOON AS I PUT THESE ON I BEGAN DEVISING A PLAN TO RETURN THEM TO OUR LOCAL KMART FOR AN EXCHANGE ... TOOK TWO TRIES BUT I GOT THEM SWITCHED FOR A KMART BRAND THAT WAS MUCH BETTER ... .AND YOU COULD SIT DOWN IN THEM .	-1
Not even kidding ... brand new they are stiff as cardboard and extremely uncomfortable , especially when you walk or sit/crouch . Washing them a dozen times may help slightly , otherwise wear them everyday for a couple years without washing them.Unbelievable .	-1
I am very slender and was surprised to find how incredibly tightly these pants are cut . There are , at least , cheap , but what does that matter if they do n't fit . I gave mine to Goodwill	-1
The outside pockets are crapy and the sleeve length is too short , other than that the jacket is fine , the hood is also a bit too large .	-1
The title says traditional fit , but when I tried the jeans , the have bell bottom legs . I wanted the normal cut around the ankle , not bell bottoms .	-1
I ordered 35 waist where I normally wear a 34 waist on levy 's , wrangler and Lucky seven . These are extremely small and there 's no way the size is a 35 . I did not like the fit at all .	-1
Got a pair of the Carhartt dungaree flannel jeans . Loved them . So tried the regular jeans . They are cut different so were returned . They come up higher on the waste , almost above the navel . The flannels did not come up that high and were a more comfortable fit .	-1
I was n't at all expecting cargo jeans when I opened the package , which I strongly dislike as does my husband .	-1
Always wear a 30 inch inseam . When I tried these on they were very long . Perhaps they were mislabeled . The waist seemed a little snug as well .	-1
first wear after first wash and already ripped pulling them down after buttoning . seriously , these are thin . I got them because I have some duck canvass ones and thought these may be a bit lighter on warmer day . yes , they are light , and are NOT durable at all . unless you want these for the additional pockets or because you think they may be a good carpenter pant forget it . too weak .	-1
THIS PRODUCT WHEN PREWASHED IS SMALL , OTHER CARHARTT JEANS 18=OZ SAME SIZE HAS LESS SHRINKAGE STOP BEING CHEAP NOT GOOD	-1
I was so disappointed with these jeans . I got them tried them on and thought these are what I have been waiting on . I desired to have a pair of carpenter type of jeans tha tkept their shape for at lease longer than a day . The day I put these jeans on , I was so excited about reaching my goal . Well , I was totally surprised when on the day of putting these pants on , that within four hours theses pants are 'bigger and longer & # 34 ; . This is what I did not want at all . I thought trying this brand would remedy the problem that I have with other brands with this type of jeans . Would I buy them again-NO ! NO ! NO ! . The process of the delivery of the jeans to my home was great without any problems or complications .	-1
I ordered two of these Carhartt long sleeve shirts , one in `` Ash '' color , the other `` Navy '' blue . I 've had some trouble finding real cotton long sleeve T-shirts ( I mean NOT cotton/algodon which is thin and rough feeling ) the reason I bought them at Amazon was I 've returned so many bought at JCP and Macy and thought I read the description to trust Amazon . ok , the shirts arrived and right away I notice the Ash shirt has that rough feel . Each is made in another country , the Ash is marked 99 % cotton and made in Dominican Republic ; the blue one is 100 % cotton made in Honduras . The Ash shirt shrunk in the first wash so much the sleeves are too short to wear it unless I push up the sleeve . The Blue shirt is fine quality shirt all around . So I 'm saying be careful ... we just do n't know nowdays what we will get for our money .	-1
This item does not fit as well as I would like , they are to loose fitting around the legs and do not me my needs as an active wear undergarment .	-1
I 've been having a lot of issues with boxer briefs that ride up and I 've been on a non-stop quest to find the perfect underwear . Unfortunately these underwear feels like a medium even though I ordered a small . They are the most comfortable piece of clothing I have ever worn . But since the fit felt too big for me , the boxer briefs ride up easily and it makes my underwear saggy .	-1
I bought a pair for my husband after hearing someone who is a laborer rave about them . My husband was n't impressed and laughed when he found out price . He works inside so apparently these did n't offer anything special for him that his others did n't .	-1
For me they did not fit - the side is a bit tight . I returned them and decided that I would stay with the traditional men 's boxer shorts . There is nothing wrong with the shorts , it is simply not my fit and style from an older perspective .	-1
they rode up , rubbed my chota raw with all the motions . I think I 'm glad I just got one pair to try them out . I had to rub bacitracin ( sp ? ) to cure the rub-sores.. never had any shorts do this before .	-1
Let me preface this by saying that I own 5 or 6 pairs of the ExOfficio standard briefs , and I absolutely love them and gave them 5 stars.However , these do n't measure up ... literally . They do n't provide any support for your package , and you will be bouncing all over the place as you would with a standard pair of boxers . I ordered mediums , just like the regular briefs that give me fantastic support , but the boxer-briefs have the crotch hanging much farther down , so you might as well be wearing boxers . The thighs fit right , so it 's not a matter of going a sized down , because then the thighs would be too tight.I bought these for my cross-training class at my gym so that when I was doing crunches and other exercises where my legs are up in the air I would n't be flashing my bright white upper thighs to the class , but I also do n't want to have my stuff flailing all over while we 're doing jumping jacks and whatnot , so I 'm now having to wear these over a standard set of briefs to accomplish that goal until I can find some other boxer briefs that actually provide support.If you 're moreso looking to wear these instead of boxers with everyday clothes where you 're not worried about twisting your boys and getting testicular torsion , then these could be great for you.BOTTOM-LINE : Do n't buy these for athletic support . The ExOfficio standard briefs are an excellent choice if you do n't care about covering your thighs .	-1
After reading reviews on ExOfficio products I decided to order a medium rather than a large which I would usually order underwear for.Even at medium - these were too large . Fabric and construction seemed to be very good . But compared with the Adidas Men 's Sport Performance Climalite 2-Pack Trunk @ the same price I give the nod to Adidas and these will be returned .	-1
these fit great . I am 5'6 & # 34 ; 180. problem is i wore them 3 or 4 times and two random spots started to & # 34 ; pill up & # 34 ; one spot on my right & # 34 ; cheek & # 34 ; and the other on my left thigh . i wore them to a normal job for about 6 hours . normal dress pants . Amazon sent me a new pair . will update after a couple weeks of wear and see what happens with new ones . I really want these to work out , they fit feel great .	-1
These are hands down the worst pair of workout boxers I have ever bought . I thought they were going to be a better version of under armor given the other reviews , but they are terrible . The sag in all the wrong places , refuse to hold you business in place and sit akwardly . I WOULD RETURN THEM IF I COULD	-1
followed the instructions for wash and presto the hole in them renders them unwearable . wtf ! ! ! really disaapointed as i bought 5 pair .	-1
Years ago these were the best briefs you could buy . I ordered several packs . So far I have thrown away about one third of the briefs . Some fit perfectly . The ones I have thrown out have had the following problems . About three had the elastic in the leg section so tight I could hardly get them on . Four had the elastic stretch out within minutes like I was wearing bloomers . A couple seemed to be a smaller size than the rest.Apparently these are made without attention to consistent quality . Needless to say I wo n't be purchasing these again . I guess I 'll have to go back to buying Fruit of the Loom . I do n't throw as many of those out and they are much cheaper . If anyone knows of a good pouch brief out there please let me know .	-1
I regret buying these , they 're too thin and alternately too loose or too tight within the same pack . Get the Jockey 3-pack , those are AWESOME . I 'm actually stocking up on them as we speak ...	-1
So it was not clear that these were made for men 's shoes so I ordered them ( I wear a 6.5 womens ) and can not use them in heels or any shoe that is not a boot . So I will be ordering another set of WOMEN 'S for heels . I can say these have worked for my ankle boots ... .	-1
The size is too small for shoe size 7.5M . Wood is cut down too much especially front part.Spring is weak . It can provide enough pressure to keep shoe in shape.Not a good shoe tree .	-1
This thing hung as loose on my wrist as if it were sized for a gorilla . It felt heavy and clunky . If you have a slender wrist I do not recommend it .	-1
Time to reiterate : the face on this watch is 1 '' x1 '' . It 's very small . So small in fact that , within minutes of the watch arriving , I gave it to my wife . Are there smaller women 's watches ? Yes . Are their men 's watches as small as this ? Really , no . Is this watch truly `` unisex '' ? Probably not .	-1
This is the 10th Timex Ironman watch I 've purchased since 1987 , and it will be my very last . Timex has begun using `` chi chi '' watch bands . Well , my wife looked down at her christmas present after only 4 months , and the watch WAS GONE FROM THE BAND ! What a piece of garbage , I 'm out $ 35 ! ! If you use Timex Ironman watches , you know that the plastic bands eventually fail . What are you going to do when this band fails ? NOTHING AT ALL , YOU 'RE GON NA HAVE TO THROW IT AWAY ! ! ! I 'd rather own a happy meal than this watch . From now on , I 'm going to buy the Ladies Expedition model , which uses standard watch bands . TIMEX THIS IS MY LAST IRON MAN PURCHASE ! ! !	-1
keep setting watch & it returns to another time/date . directions impossible to read so small . too bulky to wear at the card table , but like it when it works	-1
Bought this just over a year ago and the strap is falling apart : o ( I wear my watches daily and do a lot of physical activity so I need them to be able to take a lot of abuse ... ..this one did not perform well at all . The color fades to a yucky tarnished brown color ... .pretty for a few months and then ... .well yuck ! Since you ca n't change out the strap this thing is a terrible waste of money ... ..now I have to buy a new watch and it wo n't be one with this type of strap . The strap has a wider end to it and it keeps catching on everything ! Oh and did I mention that the strap has stretched and stretched ... ..I was using it on hole # 3 and now it 's on # 5 and still stretching ... ... just NOT a good buy .	-1
Bought 3 one of these . The watch is easy to see , has 3 alarms , and has nice colors.But , the bands are not replaceable ( they stretch off the watch ) and the lighter colored ones show dirt , and some of the dirt ca n't be cleaned off . The band on 1st watch gave out after one year . The 2nd watch did n't survive beginning open water diving ( 20 minutes at a maximum of 35 ' ) . The band on the 3rd watch lasted only two months .	-1
Not the greatest look , but if you need super wide bottomed pants you might like these . I do not think they flatter so I would only wear them if you have to keep your shoes on when removing them .	-1
My husband is 5'9 '' and wears a 36x32 in pants . He already had a pair of UA pants in XL which were very baggy , but the length was ok . I heeded the warnings after reading the reviews here and ordered a size smaller and bought a Large . The length is crazy long and the waistband is extra wide . It looks like these were made for someone 6'6 '' ! They will be returned .	-1
The wallet is leather outside and plastic inside . No double snap closure . It feels really cheap inside . Dissapointed . The color is lovely , though .	-1
The color in the ad is deceptive and they are not a & # 34 ; hint & # 34 ; of mint green , they are very bright . I ca n't wear them much .	-1
GV jeans are great , if you can find the right size . This is the same old song sung by so many people here , and it 's been sung a long time , and GV jeans company just keeps on experimenting with cheaper and cheaper manufacturers , most of whom do n't have a clue about hiring employees who can run machines or teaching those who do n't . Quality control is non existent . These jeans , this year , the light denim , were manufactured somewhere in southeast Africa and they were laughably small , the completely wrong size , not even a child 's size 12 - just wrong . I do n't think consumers ought to have to check the & # 34 ; made in & # 34 ; tag or even be concerned about where an item is made , the company that makes them ought to be involved enough to be proactive in the quest for quality products , but GV has n't and I do n't expect they ever will be . since their jeans are still very popular . Women get disgusted with sizing and quality , then they find a pair that fits , and they love the brand again . And they continue to buy . That 's what GV counts on . So ... that 's the way it goes with this brand . As for these jeans in particular , as I said , they did n't even try to hit any measurements , or to check for quality , so they went back to Amazon , who thankfully has a good return policy . I have n't bought any more GV jeans since this experience , I just do n't love the jeans enough to put up with the never-ending hassle .	-1
I do n't like that this jean is not provided by Amazon . I purchased two pairs of these jeans , one white and the other Latte size 10 . The white fit perfectly and the Lattie fit like a size 8 . These are great jeans if you are sent the correct size . They are all made in different countries and that seems to be the problem . And if the jeans are not provided by Amazon but a Florida company you will need to pay for returns which I think is wrong . Evidently , this company has had a lot of problems with sizing so please do not buy from this company .	-1
I am 5'1 '' and 125 pounds . I ordered small . The waist was too tight , the butt , hips , and thighs were too baggy , and the length was too long . The seat of the pants has a round patch of fabric . It looks a bit weird . I will be returning them .	-1
As others have said , the sizing of these is remarkably inconsistent . I bought two pairs ( in different colors ) and each fit differently and ran small . The waist was n't tight at all , but the legs/thighs were and thoroughly diminished the possibility of actually using any of the pockets and cargo pockets.In addition to small and inconsistent sizing , the pants just do not seem well made at all . I 've seen similar generic/no-name cargo pants sitting on the racks of places like Ross , Marshall 's , etc. , for far less that were made far better than these . The fabric is thin and the `` vintage '' aspect is simply another way of telling you that these have been washed with pumice stone ( I found a couple in the pockets of the ones I received ) , which only add to the general feeling of how low-quality the fabric is . If it was low-quality to begin with , in this case , washing it with pumice stones does nothing to help it and only showcases how low-quality and non-durable the pant is.Returned mine .	-1
Pants are very poor quality for the price . They should be half the cost . $ 15 would be reasonable . Would not order again .	-1
It was a gift for my Mom and she was disappointed ; I personally thought it did not look-like picture at all and was poorly done .	-1
The silver on these is not a woven Celtic silver knot . The silver is die cut , thin , almost foil thin . The silver is poorly worked to make it look as though it is a knot , but there are many rough spots . the welding of the know to the stone setting is uneven . And caution , because it does n't jump out at you from the product description , the stones are synthetic.The metal is stamped 925 ( for sterling , but the workmanship is so bad I question whether this stamp is accurate ) . The ear wires are also stamped 925.Product is labeled `` Made in Thailand . ''	-1
Purchased this necklace from the supplier and was pretty disappointed . The distinctive texture of the photo is n't apparent when one actually wears it . Looks like hardware store chain for miniatures or crafts . Kinda boring . Definitely too flimsy to embellish with additional charms . Would likely break easily . Not recommended .	-1
I do n't know they would call these suspenders & # 34 ; heavy duty. & # 34 ; Once of the clasps broke as soon as someone tried to put them on . I filed a complaint with Amazon and they sent a replacement . I am still not pleased with them .	-1
This bra could be sexy if the opening was bigger . I ordered a 36D and the whole fit was nowhere close to a D cup , when I tried to arrange things all I got was Very Pointed Rocket Boobs . The opening needs to be bigger if the cup size is larger . Returned item	-1
I was not happy with these they felt they laced the support and comfort ! Sorry guys I would try them on in a store before purchasing again !	-1
The little catch that should pop up to hold the umbrella in place when it 's closed doesns't function at all . I think whoever packed this had to have known as it was pretty obvious . Shame - I loved the color . Back it goes .	-1
Title is misleading-it is auto open , manual folding ( close ) and it will not stay closed.Cheap , not well made at all , total waste of money .	-1
I have to say that I 'm disappointed in this strap , largely because the elastic strap on the top for holding the watch in place is sloppy and allows the watch head to move around a lot . Definitely going to look for another brand .	-1
I am a watchmaker . The Voguestrap size is not as advertised . It does work well with a watch with 20mm lugs but it does not work with 16mm lugs . Perhaps I received the wrong band . It is a quality band but did not work for me .	-1
Although I have had Dickies in the past , the quality of the sewing around the zipper was bad . After only wearing these to work for the second time , I noticed the stitching was coming apart where the zipper cover was . It looked as if my zipper was open at the top . The pants were not small , as a matter of fact I thought a 36 '' waist would have been more appropriate after I tried on the 38 '' , but decided to keep the 38 in case of shrinkage . Anyway , I ended up stitching the seam myself , and now all is well , the comfort and easy care of the work pants are fine .	-1
These , and ALL Dickies brand work pants would be perfect if it were n't for the following:1 . ) They are stiff as cardboard . Incredibly uncomfortable until you wash them several dozen times or wear them in . If you wear them for the first time and it 's hot outside , they are stuffy , itchy and you sweat like a pig in them.2 . ) A button really needs to be what holds the pants closed , not a clip . When you kneel down to do something , it pops open , which allows the zipper to come undone . Not cool.3 . ) Waist rides too high and is so tight that if you tuck in a Dickies shirt ( which some places require ) you wo n't be able to close the pants . The shirts are a whole different story ... ... they suck too .	-1
I bought two pairs of 32x30 black , and both waists were a full 1 1/2 inches shy of 32 '' and no way I could get them to clasp . Sending both back . Also , I imagine you 'd have to wash these like 20 times before they 're comfortable . Super-coarse fabric . Durability 's no good to me if I ca n't even stand wearing them long enough to beat 'em up a bit . I have a couple other pairs of Dickies ( which are also sized a little funny , but not this badly ) and suppose I 'd try something else of theirs , but who knows ...	-1
these would be great if they were 100 % cotton ... I bought them anyway for the phone pocket but now I find that I do n't wear them because of the fabric . It 's not comfortable .	-1
I 'm 6'2 & # 34 ; and these run very short on me . If I reach over my head the hem comes all the way up to my belly button . There is n't much to tuck in and they wo n't stay tucked for any length of time . I also ordered them in 'Desert Sand ' and those are just as short as the black ones , so I doubt it was just a bad batch .	-1
The tag-less feature is a thick plastic iron on label , that at first seems very flexible , but as the t shirt wears and the cotton shrinks ... ... the label that is permanently glued to the inside of the neck does n't shrink , so the t shirt starts to get distorted in that area , actually making the tag-less feature even more bothersome on the neck than a normal tag that I could just cut off.Until they change the design of the tag-less label to something different , I will not be auditioning these shirts for my everyday go to t shirt . I 'm looking to buy 20 shirts ... ... .all same brand and size of course.This shirt wont be it .	-1
I expected these to be loose and comfortable to wear around the house in lieu of slippers.However , they are way too tight around the calf and would only work for me when using them with high boots .	-1
I bought 10 trousers off Amazon from different suppliers and they all true 42 - however this product is more like a 40- coppmpletely wrong fit and I measured the waist .	-1
Bought these for work , and I like Dickies stuff , but these pants are sized small . they fit , but tight . If I was going to buy again , I would get the next size up	-1
The material is not soft and they are not very feminine shaped . ok for school , but mostly for emergency days when nothing else is clean	-1
It just looks like a cheap tee . The graphics are n't impressive . My husband is a big fan of Metallica but he 's owned this shirt for two months and has never worn it . The shirt itself is n't thin or see thru so I think it 'll wash up well . It 's just the graphic itself that I 'm not thrilled about .	-1
Wow , this runs really small . The XXL was more like an athletic fit XL . The print was n't centered correctly . Disappointed .	-1
I purchased size medium in black/silver colored GoldGear Legging Bottom . Turned out , what a disappointment this particular item was . And here 's why : * Under Product Features , inseam length was left out - it is ( approximately ) 27.25-inches long . * The company logo is not embroidered , but fused ( to minimize the labor costs ) . Expect the company logo to be peeled off in the future . * Under Product Description , it reads , `` Dual-layer EVO ColdGear fabric ... '' But it is NOT men 's UA EVO ColdGear Legging . It is men 's ColdGear Action Legging , instead . What is the difference ? UA EVO ColdGear Legging comes with working fly . * The fabric does not provide 360 Reflectivity , and will NOT keep your legs warm in cold temperature . * The fitting is `` compression '' - ultra-tight , second-skin fit feel ( imagine you are wearing women 's pantyhose ) . * Unless you want to see some dark color stains on your skin , wash it in cold water/no bleach before wearing . * By the way , this garment is made in Southeast Asia .	-1
These went back as soon as I saw the quality . They were n't soft and looked cheap . I would not recommend these .	-1
I 'm keeping it . It 's a fine bag . I 'm just upset because I ordered green ( I even went back and double checked ... just in case I was wrong ) and they shipped black . Not happy about that but I detest returning things so I 'll keep it and use it .	-1
I really wanted to like this little canvas bag but it has too many shortcomings . The pockets in the portfolio are too deep for regular credit cards - they slide way down and it is very difficult to remove them . I just leave the cards I use most often standing up so I can reach them , which is n't really secure . The velcro that holds this portfolio part shut is very loose - it opens all the time from the weight of my normal cell phone . The clasp that holds the top of the bag shut was so hard to open and close that I just cut it off . Since I ca n't close the top , my cell phone tends to slide out of the bag . I was living with all of these minor issues , but now the lining of the pockets has started to fray - and it 's a pocket that I almost never use . It 's one thing that I 'm not happy with some design issues but the fact that I 've had it for less than six months and it is wearing out lead me to rate it one star . It 's a great size , has a nice strap and with a few changes could be a wonderful little bag . Without those changes , I advise you to keep looking .	-1
Once you close this it is shorter , so if you are looking to maximize the luggage you can take on a flight , then this is not the 36 '' bag that you want .	-1
Ugh . These are so uncomfortable . Fabric is stiff no matter how I wash it . Waistline is extremely stiff and uncomfortable . Not flattering for those of us with slim waists and small behinds !	-1
This is a great , amazing bag and sturdy , comfy , everything . The only problem with it is that it faded pretty quickly . I do n't take it in the sun ever , not at all , but it did fade a lot . I do n't know why . Anyway , this faded look would be just fine if I were a guy and could hang with a more rugged look , but I 'm a female teacher and kind of think it looks grungy . I like the bag though and still use it sometimes .	-1
I bought this along with the matching nightie . Pretty and nice EXCEPT it lost a button on the very first wash ! ! No extras came with it ... Now what do I do ?	-1
Got dooped by the reviews on how they 'd fit . This company needs to get their s*** together man . Mine showed up and first off ; they are a lot more cotton than they are poly . They look good - I like the pocket placement . It appears as though the two snaps over where the Medic scissors on the photo are will break off in about 4 minutes . The biggest complaint however , and the reason I have to turn around and sell them , is that I wear my jeans in a 32/32 or 33/32 if I can find them . I got the `` 31-35 '' size . The waist fits out of the package like a 33 , which is great . Unfortunately about 7 '' down on the top of the thigh/side of the crotch they fit like a 28 . It 's the strangest way they tapered them . The rest of the pant fits great , everywhere . The only reasolution would be to pull the belt line up above my belly button ... which I assure you there is enough crotch slack to do . Dammit . Buying pants online is always such a bastard .	-1
purchased two in & # 34 ; mocha & # 34 ; and one in & # 34 ; yam & # 34 ; , all double XL , and the yam colored garment is at least two sizes smaller than the mocha colored garments ( which fit perfectly ) - the yam garment is also lighter weight . i noticed that the tags in the mocha garments show that they were made in thailand while the tag in the yam garment shows that it was made in china . i really dig the mocha garments , they are perfect in every way , but i would i would like to order other colors . unfortunately ordering other colors is problematic given there is clearly a difference between the garments depending on where they were made . can the seller indicate which colors were made where ? this would be extremely helpful .	-1
I am between a medium and large , so I ordered the large size . They were too small . The fabric was also thin . It turns out that 'Heavy Cotton ' is just a name , not a description . I returned them . Ordered the Russell Athletic tee shirt at the same time , and it was the right size and thicker cotton .	-1
Be aware and beware that most of these shirts are not tag-less as advertised , and are flimsy and cheap . I do not believe they are from Hanes or Fruit of the Loom . I believe they are Chinese knockoffs . Avoid this seller at all costs .	-1
The shirt itself is ok , the fit was way to tight . these run a bit small . I normally wear a large , wish i woulda ordered an XL . It 'll be a good oil rag .	-1
Material is so thin tou can almost see through it . Not what you would expect from a Fruit of The Loom Company . Says Heavy cotton . Wrong .	-1
Only time will tell how long they last . But I 've had shirts from expensive mail order houses that wore through the elbow in less than a year , and from cheap no-names that lasted ten years . These look nice both with jeans and with a sport jacket . * * *Follow-up less than two months later : After only a few wearings and washings , two of these have started to come apart at the seams . This shirt is way too light and flimsy . I would not buy these again . Dropped my rating from four stars to two . Hopefully my two remaining shirts will last longer.I will stick to the Hanes , which seem to be better quality .	-1
I did not have a good experience with my purchase . I bought 2 of the long sleeve t-shirts when I received them I realized I bought the wrong size so I sent them back and never received a refund ! This was the only time I 've had an issue with a return but very disappointed ! ! !	-1
Purchased this shirt at a Walmart for $ 3.00 on closeout.. I wear 2x long sleeve t 's . Purchased a 3x , it was huge until laundering once ( cold water ) . It is now a large at best.It 's now short , wide and the sleeves are short..If it shrinks anymore it will be to small for me.So buy big , way big.Of course you will then get a very large waist also .	-1
I needed this shirt for a project , and the deadline is fast approaching . Was supposed to be 50/50 cotton/poly blend , pre-shrunk , so I ordered the size appropriately . Turned out to be 100 % cotton , which , of course , shrunk in the wash . It 's too inexpensive to be worth mailing back for a refund , so I 'm out a few dollars . Believe the other bad reviews ... this is a total bait and switch.Retailer was NY Lingerie , fulfilled by Amazon.Edit : Amazon has offered a refund , given me a free return shipping to print , and help in waiving shipping fees for an alternative shirt . As always , Amazon is awesome when they get a complaint . It seems a lot of comparable shirts on Amazon have complaints of bad QC , sizing , or other issues , so I 'm just going to try and get something locally instead .	-1
Unless you like thick , bulky , overweight low-quality cotton t-shirts I would n't recommend this , it runs too large in my opinion as well .	-1
I knew going into this shirt , I 'd probably expect nothing great . But man , its barely breathable , it 's small when compared to other brands of similar type and size . And when I can go get a Jockey shirt for same price that fits like a $ 30 one , this one is just a joke . Will not buy again , and probably wind up in the car drying towel pile	-1
This is the only Haynes T-shirt that does not bunch at the back of the neck . It is light and drapes well . But it is too light for printing .	-1
I bought 5 other shirts in the same style from Hanes and they were all ok - not very soft , but thick and hopefully will wear well . The yellow you can see from the moon , I think . Be warned .	-1
Runs wayyyy big	-1
I got a large ( I wear a medium ) just because it 's cotton and I figure it might shrink . Well , it did shrink -- much more than I expected . Probably next time I would get an ex-large , just because I like them roomy , expecially for exercise .	-1
these shirts advertised as being preshrunk . however , these shirts shrink ! ! ! ! i bought several shirts and all of them , after 1 washing , shrank . false and misleading advertising . wo n't buy these shirts again and you should n't buy at all ! ! ! ! !	-1
This is a wonderful bra IF you can wear it . I ca n't . I like everything about it and wish I could wear use it , but because of the shape of the cup , it cuts into me under my arm and it 's actually painful to wear for longer than a few minutes . I noticed that another reviewer mentioned this particular problem , so I do n't think it 's unusual . Forewarned is foreARMed .	-1
When I recieved these sunglasses in the mail , I noticed it was missing a nose piece . I thought maybe I could just glue it back on or something but I saw that it was missing a screw . I do n't feel like going through the hassle of returning these so I just threw them away . The pouch could be useful to me so I decided to save it .	-1
Unhappy - received scratched , only a couple of bucks , but still it would be nice to get them in & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; condition . Stick to the gas station selection ...	-1
Made for small/narrow heads . I need wider ones , these were not worth my money but if you have a small head they may work for you .	-1
They are made of a nice terry cloth material and feel comfortable material-wise , but the fit is for the narrow foot .	-1
I purchased this armoire based on the positive comments from other buyers . I was very disappointed at the very cheap quality of the drawers . When you pull them out far enough to have a glimse of the items in the back compartments , the drawer just falls out . If you ever want to see items stored towards the back of the drawers you will have to pull the drawer out entirely . Very cheap workmanship . Not worth it . If you are a prospective buyer , I 'd go for one of the more expensive and durable models .	-1
This is not worth the money that was charged . The pieces of wood are uneven and not strong . Poor paint job . Hinges on lid do not tighten therefore it wobbles like it 's going to fall apart . Drawers do not fit properly . I would not recommend to anyone to buy this .	-1
The wool shoe part is lovely and warm and stretches . The same is true with the wool ankle part . But someone FAILED TERRIBLY in the design because where the two parts are joined , the heavy stitching does not stretch and is so tight it feels like a tourniqet and after ten minutes there is a deep compression mark left on your instep . This is where the blood flow to your feet has been restricted . Wearing them for any length of time leads to foot pain . I tried without success to stretch this stitching to no avail . What a shame . And yes , these are my correct size in every other way . A good idea but worthless because the construction was n't thought through enough . Go back to the drawing board Muk Luks Company , I would really like these if you got it right .	-1
Have become a complete advocate for Playtex recently and had high hopes for this style of bra , but was disappointed . It is much tighter than others I have recently purchased in the same size . The cups do n't seem to be quite the right size either and give that unfortunate & # 34 ; overflow ' look ... .I will keep it but it will be in the back of the drawer for an occasional need of a deep plunge , non movement kind of day .	-1
Bought a few pairs . On one , the silicon rubber was already so bad they would not stay up . On the others , it got flabby within 3 or 4 wearings . But , that 's not so bad ... since they are so ridiculously thin and run so easily ( I put socks over my nails when putting them on , so no , that 's not it ) . These are really disposable 1 use stockings . Blech .	-1
You should consider getting a larger size as these were not comfortable for my girlfriend around her calf . Pretty cute otherwise .	-1
I would not buy this product again . It was not worth the money . I wore it one time and there was a big hole in it before the night was over .	-1
pretty design , great color - aquai but i would be enbarrassed to wear these . they bulge out in the middle like a rowboat	-1
Nice looking shoe . I bought this shoe hoping it 's work . What matters most for me is how WIDE , how stable , how much heel support & price . These 10XW turned out to be too long & narrower than what I wanted . The bottom of the soles are also VERY slick . Avoiding falling , while wearing them , would be tricky . I spend HOURS looking @ Ros Hommerson , Clark , Trotters , SoftStyle ( among other brands . ) From the 1 pair of Soft Style I tried on , I 'd say they 'll soon feel like shoes that will be hard on one 's feet & will fall apart in no time . Since the bottom of the sole is SO slick , avoiding falling is also problematic . I 'm returning the pair I bought for a refund . I found other brands in similar prices that are much better made shoes .	-1
Seems tight around the top of my foot . Not as stylish in person as it is on-line . Was n't worth keeping .	-1
These shoes were made for extremely small feet . I ordered my size and wide , but they were not wide at all . They were pretty , .and looked comfortable . I will have to remain with Trotters .	-1
This shoe was way too small ! I 'm not exaggerating - order it about 3 sizes larger than what you normally wear ! I ended up giving them to the goodwill . It was n't worth the hassle of trying to return them .	-1
Not the best fit , and not the best color . I wear them occasionally but not often . My feet tend to slip out for some reason even with my arch insoles .	-1
Purchased these shoes at the end of September . There are cracks on the top of both shoes after barely a month of use . I do n't subject them to a lot of wear and tear ; I work at a desk . This is the second straight pair of Skechers that have lasted me barely a month . Suffice it to say I will never purchase Skechers again .	-1
good shoe and comfortable , other than around the toe area , where dents and wrinkles form even within a FEW DAYS and do n't go away and make the shoe look pretty crappy , I 'd go with whatever the other shoe you 're thinking about if you 're deciding between this and the other	-1
looks nice , but i cant wear them without wearing 2 pairs of socks.cuts into the top of my foot and i literally have a cut on the area above my toes .	-1
The length of the legs was fine , as was the waist but the shoulder straps barely reached to connect . Im only 5'11 so Im a regular . They should tell customers these are & # 34 ; short & # 34 ; torso and not regular or long . You buy things like this for comfort and ease of movement . Walking bent over or struggling to get them fastened isnt my idea of comfort . If I was shorter they would be a good buy .	-1
I had hoped to find some overalls I could garden in , but these things are so heavy that they are uncomfortable and way too hot . I guess they would be great for a late fall clean-up in the yard , but forget them for summer .	-1
I really like the design and style of these pants but was very disappointed with the extreme bagginess of them , so much so that I have not worn them at all .	-1
I 've ordered Bandolino 's in the past and always had a good fit ( size 10 ) . In fact , the day I ordered these Mylah 's I also ordered the Bandolino Capture pumps [ [ ASIN : B00B5NSRLU Bandolino Women 's Capture FB Platform Pump ] . The Bandolino Capture 's fit great , but the Mylah style was to tight across the toes and very tight over the top of my foot . These shoes just run small . I ordered the Gold and I did like the style and color , just wish they fit correctly .	-1
I ordered the pink suede shoe ... ShoeMagoo via Amazon ... .BIG MISTAKE . The fake Bandolino arrived in a brown box , ..not the Bandolino shoe box I usually get ... .the shoe is faded pink.almost like dirty cotton candy . Then I 'm comparing the shoe to another shoe I have ( same style different color ) shoe is visible short , uneven , faded and the peep toe is uneven.This clearly was a fake Bandolino shoe from Shoe Magoo . Shoe Magoo has a note in the box that tells you never contact Amazon for order issues contact Shoe Magoo ... umm no that was a red flag right there . Needless to say the fake filthy shoe that had been glued together with school childrens glue was returned . I contacted Amazon and they apologized for the sellers poor quality .	-1
The description of this shoe says it 's suede , but it 's all manmade material . The shoe description does not say synthetic when you are viewing the item at the time of initial purchase .	-1
You get what you pay for - these are so painful to walk on . Even after stretching them out , they are way too painful to use . I am tossing these .	-1
These kept falling off when I was hiking and I would have to go back looking for one . They also broke after 2 seasons use . They need a strap to hold them on and could use to be more durable . Not for the serious hiker . For the occasional snowstorm in your driveway maybe .	-1
These yaktrax were purchased to use on a vacation in the mountains in the winter . They provided excellent traction control but bot of the shoe covers broke after 2 uses . Thankfully Amazon customer service is wonderful and provided full refunds .	-1
I was so happy when my Yaktrax walker traction device came in the mail today , I immediately put them on ( carefully ) to run some errands , it 's pretty icy here in Maine . Within 5 minutes , both of them had slipped off and I lost one . I was pretty happy with the Yaktrax Pro Ice Walkers that I used last winter but they were hard to put on . These lighter Traction Device Walkers were much easier to put on and clearly easy to remove , much too easy ! I ca n't even return them as I now only have one . I am going back to the Pro Ice Walkers , the velcro trap keeps them on my shoes where they belong . I do not recommend these lighter weight ones without the strap , they sure did n't last long !	-1
I 've used my Yaktrax maybe 10 times , 4 of them were when I was running . They were great at first , helped me not slip on most ice ( still slick on certain surfaces ) , and I could run in them . But last time I ran I noticed that two of the elastic bands snapped , same band on both.I 'm thinking it was caused by one or two things : I take them off my shoes almost every time since I use them on both my hiking boots and my running shoes , I 'm thinking that could have given the metal spirals to shift a bit and pinch the elastic band.The last time I ran on them I would say it was clean cement 70 % of the time and ice and snow the other 30 % , so another possibility is the rough cement caused the elastic to fray easier.Will definitely buy heavier duty ones next time .	-1
I think I have unusual feet in that I do not need a wide through the heel , only through the toes . These did not fit me at all .	-1
Poor quality after only 5 months of wearing the crease in the cuffs let go and began to fray . I wear all brands of Khakis and I will not go with this brand again .	-1
Very Large	-1
Well the tag was on the sweatshirt so it appears it was n't a defective one but after only two washes the stitching has started to come off and the HUGE shrinkage after the first wash was unreal . If you do plan to buy from this seller you may want to order one size larger	-1
In the winter I wear turtlenecks & this sweatshirt 's neck is really open showing more than what this product picture shows.Updated 02-13-14 : The shirt is already peeling . If you want something nice , this is not it . If you want it for around the house , this would work for the price .	-1
I 'm fairly unimpressed . the Quality of the shirt is 'ok'.. but it 's certainly not a very dark black . It looks like what last years Mock necks looked like after having been washed 5-10 times . Also it was huge ... definitely not true to size .	-1
I ordered this for my husband last year and they sent a matching shirt instead , never got the pants even after calls to customer service . Quality appears to be okay for the price , although it 's never been washed or worn .	-1
For me , these shoes were not good at all . the look is nice but the fit is totally uncomfortable . It 's unfortunate as I do need a comfortable shoes for my job .	-1
THESE SHOES ARE GOOD HOWEVER THE SIZE WAS INCORRECT AND MY SISTER COULD NOT WEAR IT AT ALL . SIZES SHOULD HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY	-1
I purchased these much larger than size listed by chart to avoid rips . They slot over the abdomen as I was putting them on very carefully this morning -could not wear them , will return . Very pretty but not if I can not wear them . Sheer and shimmery .	-1
Too dark for light toast . I was looking for a color just a bit darker than nude . I will keep looking . Capezio seems to be a better choice .	-1
Too small for taller individuals who may be 6'0 & # 34 ; or taller . Definitely would not recommend for people in this size range !	-1
Needed for daughters dance class , did what it was , however was n't has thick as others , so tore fairly early ... .I would n't buy again	-1
I did not like the look of the leather . It looked like cheap brown vinyl . They were n't very comfortable either . This was a disappointment since I 've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past .	-1
These boots feel great on your feet , but I had the same problem as other where the buttons just fall off..Seems like a consistent quality issue . If you do n't mind the defect they do feel warm and cozy .	-1
I wanted these to fit so badly ! Unfortunately , I could n't get my foot all the way into the boot . I was hoping I would be able to easily slide in and out of them . I did n't even have socks on . Now I 'll have to return them for a different style .	-1
I brought 2 pair of bearpaw from the owner but they are of different quality . This one is with hard fur and the size is right . Another pair of boot is the same size of the Camel color . However the Camel one is with soft fur but the size is a little small . And the first time I try the Camel one on , one of it 's button fall off . Now I have sewn the button on by myself .	-1
Too dark for light toast . I was expecting something just a bit darker than nude . Unfortunately had to return . I will look at Capizio .	-1
too small ! My daughter usually wears 8 , sometimes 81/2 . After reading reviews , we sized up but it is too tight and slightly long . terrible choice if feet are slightly wide .	-1
These tights will make your legs look they are naturally SUPER pale , like you have ghost legs ! Mine also fit like they were the right size but tore in the crotch within hours . Oh well , they made me laugh and then I had to thrown them out .	-1
These look like your grandmother 's old , dark nylons from 100 years ago . I was looking for a natural , darker than nude color .	-1
I just opened this package of socks . Goldtone Bermuda Combed Cotton socks . Three pair , sz 9-11 , color demin . I like the color , the fit and the feel of them . I did not expect them to be any thicker than they are because I read the reviews that said not to expect that . I do find them to be a little thicker than the usual cotton socks of this type that I find in the stores . Overall , first impressions are really good . Except : I am not happy that the socks are only 50 % cotton , when I was specifically looking for socks with 80 to 99 % cotton content . The content is 50 % cotton , 31 % acrylic , 18 % nylon , 1 % spandex . To me that reads half biodegradable and half not . While that may feel good on my feet , it 's not good for our planet and all the creatures on it . I work hard to avoid buying plastic products . So it upsets me a bit that these socks were falsely advertised . FYI - made in Mexico not the USA . You can buy socks made in the USA . ( February 28 , 2014 ) . Update : I contacted Amazon and They refunded my money . I can also contact customer service to facilitate the purchase to make sure that they are cotton . They also said that they would check into the problem . I hope they do ! So , so far , a five-star response from Amazon . I will check back to see if Any changes were made .	-1
I have been wearing Gold Toe a long time , but these socks were not made well . The threads are not tight , with some spaces not woven well . They also shrink when washed ( and I do wash them in COLD water ) , and I need to stretch them with my hands before putting them on . They were also expensive for an Amazon sock product . A waste of money .	-1
Too synthethic feel , socks keep running down . Just terrible product and totally unworthy of any attention or money from you .	-1
My old socks had either worn out after years of use or slowly got nabbed by the Gripes in the laundry , so I ordered a set of Gold Toe knowing that those were supposed to be the name-brand.Straight out of the package , they look and feel very nice ( they are a perfect thickness ) , and as you start to put them on , you think everything 's going to be great , and that 's where it ends . Unfortunately , once I got the socks all the way on , I could feel a very distinct seam in the toe that was driving me nuts . I tried adjusting the socks several times and swapping them for the other foot , but the seam was still very noticeable.On top of that , since they are polyester , they do tend to slip down my leg a little more than my old cotton socks . By the end of the work day , they were slightly sweaty from being less breathable than cotton , though not terrible.I will wear these until they wear out or I get sick of them , because they 're not terrible , but I would not buy these again.There is a similar style brand I used to buy that has a gold stripe on the toe instead of the gold block , but I ca n't remember the name and have n't been able to find them online at the moment . I bought them at a military exchange store , and they were very comfortable and lasted me for years , but it 's driving me crazy that I ca n't find them again .	-1
Not thrilled with these . The elastic at the top is almost nonexistent so they constantly fall . The fabric is thinner than I expected . They are n't even that cheap . I expected more . I regret this purchase .	-1
it says women 's 9-11 , soooo sorry if this is true they send me men 's socks , when I put them on they look well , when I took them away they had grown twice its size and remained so . I feel like I bought something that was not well specified . Lost my money	-1
The size listed on these socks is wrong . The socks that I got were way too big . The socks say shoe size 6-12 ( which is too big of a range to begin with ) . I wear a size 10 so I thought I should be fine . Not even close . These socks are probably for a shoe size 16 .	-1
this was washed four times , then was completely useless . Do n't buy . Also , it shrunk so much , I could n't fit into it anymore .	-1
The socks do not fit over my calf ! I 'm not sure if there is not enough elastic or what the problem is but it is too tight to fit over my calf . I do not consider myself to have oversized calfs but these socks suffocate my calfs to the point of pain where I can not wear the socks . Shocked to discover this issue ...	-1
These socks are not good . They are shapeless and have very little cushion . They are like a short version of tube socks . Very uncomfortable , which was a huge surprise from Gold Toe .	-1
they sock are soft and i do like the quality of the material . but they bunch around toes and feel uncomfortable inside shoes . i wear size 7 shoes . maybe it would fit better on a bigger foot .	-1
After two or three washings , these socks shrank and became hard . Although I do n't have diabetes , I want soft socks for my feet . Regretfully , this product does n't fit my requirements . I asked for a refund .	-1
Bought these , hoping for classic gold toe quality ( nice heft , thick cotton cushioning , long life ) .Unfortunately , I was completely disappointed . While these are a slight step up from cheapie Hanes socks from the big box store , these are NOT the same quality we used to get from Gold Toe.The six pair I bought shrunk , pilled like mad ( bits of cotton sluffed off inside the sock after every wash ) and they all developed holes within 3 months of wear . No , I do n't use bleach . They simply were not made of very high quality cotton and wore through at the friction point at the ball of each foot.I wo n't buy Gold Toe socks again until I hear that they 've returned to their classic standard.Why , oh why , ca n't women get the same high quality socks that men can buy so easily ? I hope Gold Toe reads the mail and improves their manufacturing standard . Until then , I opt out .	-1
I bought these after reading the reviews and found them to be no better than the cheap Hanes socks I got at Walmart . I used to buy the White Stag socks at Walmart and they were WONDERFUL ! Unfortunately , they are n't making them any more . I 'm still looking for socks that were as comfortable as they were . THESE are NOT worth the money . I 'll keep looking !	-1
These shrank . Not the quality in gold toe socks I expected . I have bought them for years from JC Penney . Possibly a knock off or cheap imitation ?	-1
Just as with the Champion 6-Pack & # 34 ; Performance & # 34 ; socks I ordered , this sock is not at all as pictured in the photograph . It appears from the photo that there will be a nice thick cushion from heel to toe . Not at all true . Gold Toe used to make a great crew sock that looked like this . They still make a great ankle cuff sock with a thick cushioned sole . Why not with the crew sock ? ? ? ? Ca n't find it in department or athletic stores either .	-1
These socks say they fit mens shoe sizes 6-12.5 . I wear an 8.5 mens , and they were way too large on me -- the heel of the sock was sticking out of my shoe ! These really should fit something more like a mens 9.5-12.5 . I mean , how can a sock , other than a tube sock , properly fit both a size 6 and a size 12.5 ?	-1
I supposed I may just be spoiled by fine , soft wools , but these socks are made of some of the scratchiest , least pleasant wool-blend fabric I 've experienced . As a sock , they function just fine - I prefer a slightly tighter fit than these ( as the Gold Toe nylons tend to be ) , but have not had any issues with them falling down , so functionally they are tight enough . But the fabric itself just is n't comfortable , it does n't transparently blend in with my body and form a second skin . It 's very apparent , and rather unpleasant . I 'll keep these around , as socks do have a way of going missing and losing their mates , but I certainly wo n't be buying any more .	-1
I do not like these socks , The material makes your feet sweat , and your feet slide around in your shoes . The toe seem is very uncomfortable . They did into your legs and leave marks and a swollen lump in your leg above the sock . They do stay in place .	-1
I expect two things from white socks - be thick enough to jog and stay up on my legs . These do neither ! They are paper-thin and have no elasticity right out of the pack . I 'm just lucky I did n't waste more money by buying more socks ... .	-1
Ordered the wrong sock style . My son will only wear soft socks and I meant to order the crews , so had to send these back and order the right style , that is the only reason for the low rating .	-1
Gold Toe fluffies use to the be only sock that would last a decent time for my husband ; not anymore . We got in on a deal from Amazon , that offered 12 pairs for a wonderful price . He now wonders if they were selling seconds because they wear out in no time.Just like everything else , a company gets you to like something and then sends the quality all the way down the sewer . We are on the hunt for a better brand of sock .	-1
I was very disappointed with this purchase . Tissue then sock advertised as & # 34 ; fluffies & # 34 ; . I have purchased & # 34 ; fluffies & # 34 ; before and they were twice the thickness of what I received . Given the poor quality , I would have expected twice the quantity for what I paid . I would not buy again .	-1
I have changed my review from one of positive to negative.I have now received two different designs for this sock . The one I wanted was a 3/4 sock with a thick non-ribbed bottom ; I got this the first time around.What I got this time , was a full length ( for those without calves ) sock ribbed all the way through with very little padding at the foot.I have contacted Gold Toe and the sock I was after is the Cotton Crew 513S.This is the 3/4 ( Approx . 6 inch top ) with full padding on the foot sock I was after to begin with.Gold Toe admitted that they have so many sock designs now that the customers are having problems ( as I did ) finding there old standbys from years ago.I hope this helps so that everyone does not have to go through the research process that I did to buy a simple sock ! Addendum : I have finally found my favorite ( 5 '' top ) Gold Toes at JC Pennys for $ 13.00 for three , they are called Ultra Tec Cotten Short Crew.I would highly recommend this sock .	-1
considering that these are over-the-calf socks , they fall down within 1/4 mile of walking , which kind of defeats the purpose .	-1
A little too big for me . When I ordered Over the Calf I thought they would be about Calf high.. or just over ..Not going up to about just below my knees ...	-1
Maybe is was the supplier but these socks are not what you expect from Gold Toe and my experience was different from 70+ other reviewers . The elastic will not keep the socks up and the weave in the sock shaft seperated on the first pair when putting on for the first time . Will not reorder and makes me hesitant to purchase Gold Toe in the future . Update - December 30 , 2012 . The seller responded to my complaint with an adjustment and a comment that they were surprised at the quality problem since this was one of their best selling socks .	-1
I was sure these would be good socks based on the brand name , company history and positive reviews . But this was a disappointing purchase and I would not recommend these socks to anyone.Six pairs of socks . Put the first pair on and found them to be comfortable , fit perfectly . Second pair of socks , the elastic on one sock was unstrung and hanging loose but I wore them anyway and clipped off the dangling elastic thread -- this sock will not likely stay up in the future after several washings . Third pair of socks , I found a hole in the foot of one of the socks -- a small hole that will undoubtedly grow larger over time . Fourth pair of socks , discovered a rather large hole in the ankle area of one sock . I have n't worn the fifth or sixth pair yet.Let me be perfectly clear : these are the worst made socks I 've ever bought . It is an insult to charge 20 bucks for 6 pair . The socks I bought have a multitude of flaws and they cost considerably more than the bargain white crew socks you can find at any Walmart or `` dollar '' store . True , they are comfortable and soft on first wearing but , really , three out of the first four pair having manufacturing flaws should be a hint as to what you can expect for future wear.I originally thought about returning them to Amazon for a refund due to the poor quality but I decided to do a negative review instead so prospective customers would be forewarned.UPDATE 04/28/2013 : I 've worn the other two pair of socks now . One had two holes in the ankle area and the other was unstitched at the top . Really ... I can not overstate how poorly this item is made . If you happen to get a package with no defects , I 'm happy for you . But I will never buy Gold Toe socks again .	-1
I have gotten these socks for quite some time , and wear them for work . It appears that the actual size is determined by which ever manufacturer happened to make the socks for Gold Toe . The last three times I have ordered these socks I have gotten different sizes each time . The most recent order , the socks have been noticeably shorter , and tighter , especially in the ankle area of the socks . Yes , I wear a 13 shoe , and I 'm a bigger guy , but that is why I order the Big and Tall size . I 'm starting to question if it is worth it to pay the premium price for Gold Toe . I want a good quality sock , but also need accurate sizing .	-1
I ordered both the black and white socks . Despite the advertised ratio , which included no polyester , the black ones are labeled having 1 % polyester . The white ones were as advertised.The price was so favorable that I did n't send back the black socks . But I can really feel the difference that 1 % polyester makes and I would not buy them again . Also , if you take a pair of black socks on one hand , and squeeze , and compare to doing that with the white pair in the other hand , you 'll notice a giant difference . The black socks feel like 50 % polyester.Both the black and white socks feel pretty thick and warm . The white ones , upon wearing and washing , have shed clumps of material . Higher quality socks cost disproportionally more , I think.Do not get the black ones .	-1
Gold Toe has changed the way they make their men 's socks , and not for the better . The material is thinner , especially on the sole . There & # 8217 ; s far less cushioning than before . The fit is tighter as well.One pair in my pack had significant fraying at the top edge right out of the package.Rather than be a premium brand , these socks are now just a tiny bit better than the cheap socks from brands such as Fruit of the Loom . The only saving grace is that the elastic is a bit more comfortable.I bought these on a price dip so I got 6 pair for $ 11.99 . Had I paid the regular price , I would have returned them.Very disappointing quality , and I would not purchase them again .	-1
I recently bought a six pack of these gold toe sock in black , because $ 12 was a great price for a six pack of gold toes . I can tell you they are not the same quality of the pairs I had 5 years ago , and it makes sense why the price has gone down . They have changed them and have made them lesser quality , so that now they fit too loosely , they are thinner , less comfortable , and the material seems more coarse and more prone to wearing out . They have ruined what was a great sock . I recommend buying Adidas or Nike dri-fit socks which I now consider to be better quality .	-1
The fit in the foot area is ample . However , the fit in the calf area is too tight . They even look like they were made for men with skinny legs . I ended up cutting them off above the ankle so they would be reasonable comfortable .	-1
I bought a pack of these 2 weeks ago , washed them once normally and today there is already a rip in one of the socks . I did nothing to rip it myself , just noticed a hole there in the ribbing . Not satisfactory at all . Gold Toe seems to be cutting corners or something .	-1
Bought these sock with the similar Hanes version in White . After two washes these socks shrunk to the size of a youth . My 11 now wears these JUST after two washes .	-1
This sock is all bottom and no top . In other words the picture shows a nice upper ribbed quarter , whereas in actuality there is not much of an upper quarter at all . I sent them back .	-1
I bought the extended size ( 12-16 ) of these socks , and they are a little tight on my foot . I have n't even washed them yet ... so I expect it to get worse . At least they do n't slide down into my shoe .	-1
These are without doubt the worse socks I ever purchased . I 've worn these for years but the ones i received the last 2 or 3 times are terrible . They do n't even make it through one washing and the material washes out of the sock and you can see flesh . Might as well wear them new without washing so you get at least one wearing before you have to throw them away . I heard the same from other reviews so had to reinforce the other low reviews.Gold Toe Boys 8-20 6 Pack Sport Quarter Sock	-1
These are expensive stretch socks . I am beginning to think that some manufactures have the same size stretch sock and just label them to any size they please . Just because the sock will stretch to my size foot does not mean the sock is the right size . If the stretch force is pulling the material from the heel then at some point the heel material may very well side off the heel . The socks are going back and I know there are some from Walmart that does not do that . The ease of buying socks from Amazon Prime is so convenient that it 's hard to resist trying some other brand .	-1
I have bought Gold Toe socks for probably 20 years or more . They have always been high quality and wore very well . For the last several years I have bought them from Amazon with no problems . The last package I bought from Amazon were terrible . The bottoms frayed very quickly and wore through and the fabric became dingy and no amount of washing or bleach helped . I understand that they are now made outside the US so that explains it . I have seen this happen with dozens of products that I have used over the years . Before too long it will be impossible to buy ANY quality products in the US.Someone on here recommended Adidas socks and I followed their advice . No luck there either . I ordered 6 pairs of Adidas black low top socks from Amazon less then a week ago . A couple of days ago I wore a pair and then washed them . The bottoms looked like they had been ran through a shredder and one even had a hole all the way through the fabric.I 'm starting to think that Amazon needs to screen their sellers a little better . I buy a LOT of items from Amazon because I despise shopping but some of the items I 've been getting lately have me believing they might be knock-offs , including these socks . I know for a fact that a lot of sellers are running scams . I have seen things for sale for as much as 10x the price that they are available for everywhere else , one company with a Hispanic name tries to sell all kinds of items , mostly grocery items , for 4-5x their usual price . A lot of times if you point it out in a review Amazon refuses to post it.CAN ANYONE RECOMMEND A BRAND OF ATHLETIC SOCK THAT WILL LAST MORE THEN A COUPLE OF MONTHS ?	-1
I ordered a set of Large . Well , large is for shoe sizes 6-12 , which means they fit a size 6-8 , NOT a size 12.That is not large , that is the standard size for socks , which is too small for someone with a size 12 foot.Please be aware of this . I am not a happy camper .	-1
For the price I paid I expected a decent quality product . What I got is comparable to socks you can buy at the local flea market at $ 5 for a dozen pair . These 'Big and Tall ' Quarter socks designed to fit people who wear shoes size 12-13 just fit my size 13 foot . Putting them on I can see then pulling thin at every seam already . At one point I could actually see my flesh between the threads at the toe seam and in the heel cup . I have little hope of these lasting very long but since I do n't often wear shoes/sneakers and socks I 'm just going to keep them and switch to a different brand when these eventually apparently quite rapidly fall apart . { Update } Wore and washed these socks . 2nd time I went to wear a pair one of the socks completely fell apart at the ribbed shaft . I know I said I expected them to fall apart but I thought I 'd get more than one use out of each sock . The only bright side is Amazon 's amazing customer service who have already issued a refund for the cost of the socks less than 12 hours after I contacted them.Avoid these socks .	-1
These socks are on the thin/scratchy side when compared to my other Gold Toe socks . I understand that workout socks should n't be thick but they 're not even thick/soft in the toes or heel . I 'd pass on these again .	-1
The size 12-14 was not at all adequate . I wear a size 12 shoe and the socks were binding and did not fit at all well . This is why I returned the items .	-1
Put them on , put your socks over them , put on your shoes , walk five minutes , take off your shoes , take off your socks , re-install these useless tubes , put your socks back on , put your shoes back on . Repeat until you throw the sock liners away and get some good silk ones .	-1
I have size 14/15 feet , and bought these socks for when I 'm wearing athletic shoes with shorts ( very stylish , right ? ) . The problem is , after walking around for a few hours , they start to feel like they 're slipping off of my foot and down into my shoe . They 're comfortable and seem to be of decent quality , except the fit . I would not order them again .	-1
This works well except if you have a few more inches in the waist . it pushes up your back fat ( uh , yes , I now have post pregnancy back fat ) and leaves unsightly bulges under you clothes . You can also see it clearly under your clothes unless you wear bulky loose fitting tops .	-1
I do n't recommend this belt at all . I wore it did n't help at all and it is very uncomfortable . pay more but buy good one	-1
This is stiff and did not fit . I could n't wear it at all , which was frustrating having just got home from the hospital and needing support .	-1
I just had a baby and I wear somewhere between a 16 and 18 currently so I got this in a large and its about 5 inches too long , so I ca n't even use it !	-1
I bought these to wear with jeans on the weekends , but they are too uncomfortable to wear . Very stiff . I 'll try washing them with fabric softener , but I think they 're just a waste of money . They pinch all the way around even though they 're a little big . I tried adjusting the string , but no luck . Would n't buy again , and would n't recommend .	-1
I started dancing again after 14 years , and could not find my old ballet shoes . I ordered these , WHAT A MISTAKE.The first pair I ordered a 1/2 size up from my normal shoe size , mistakenly listening to other reviewers . DO NOT BUY UP IN THESE SHOES ! I REPEAT ! DO NOT BUY LARGE IN THESE SHOES . Besides being too large , they were an awful fit . I thought returning them and ordering again would solve the problem . The new size ( my normal shoe size ) arrived and the fit was just as awful . It was normal fitting in the heel , tight fitting in the toe , and extremely gappy in the arch area . Plus the toe seemed EXTRA long . They were so loose in the arch that I would not feel comfortable doing spins or jumps in them , as I can see the shoe getting twisted , slipping , or tripping me . WORST fit ever ! The problem with both pairs I ordered were the same . Gappy arch , tight in the LONG toes , etc . I am returning this shoe again and will be trying a different brand . Capezio used to be good dancewear , I guess a lot can change in 14 years ...	-1
These shoes are shape-less , with too much width in the toes . Also , you can not see your arch . A very poor shoe . Not even worth being a house-slipper .	-1
Sizing is off . I ordered my size 7.5 and they are way too big . I should have ordered the 6.5 which I never wear . The cost of shipping them back for the correct size was too much . I ended up keeping them even though they just sit on my shelf .	-1
fits too tight in the toe , and flared out in the middle . returned them for a refund . Not what I expected at all..	-1
VERY CHEAPLY MADE- inside lining peeling back & losing glue brand-new ... fit is poor & not true to size ... shoes are synthetic except for upper part & smell funny right out of the box . Cheap manmade linings cause sweat & discomfort . Capezio goes further & further downhill every year . Not worth the discount- will definitely spring for real Grishkos next time .	-1
I had to return these , because they are so incredibly small . I ordered them for my two year old and could not come close to getting them on her . I recommend ordering at least 3 sizes bigger than what you would normally wear .	-1
Certainly this shirt looks nice enough -- no better than your average shirt really . Shirts cut straight from armpit to tail should be banned -- their manufacturer 's relegated to fry cooking at McDonalds instead of making useless ugly shirts cut like these . Hey Geoffrey , 32 should be closer to 32 than 64 ! And those using those plastic collar stays that fall out all the time should have a special torture designed for them . And their shirts should be rigged to apply that torture the moment the stays fall out . These shirts alone would put them in an asylum since the stays fall out every time they are washed.This shirt has both of these indicators that the manufacturer has no business manufacturing pick-up sticks let alone shirts.My last purchase of anything made by this pretender .	-1
I give it a 2 star because the person I purchased it for did not like it and I had to return it . He did n't like the red part ( which I take full responsibility for ordering ) or that the shirt was shiny . The shirt is fine if you like red and with a sateen shine.It is exactly as it is advertised ! !	-1
I ordered these for my husband and was disappointed with the quality of this Russell Athletic T-shirt . Thought I was buying quality based on my prior experience with Russell brand tee shirts . Seems quality has taken a backseat to profit . Fabric is thin and after one washing the tee shirts fit too snugly . A few more washing and they will be ready for donation to non-profit .	-1
sizing is off . it says xxxl but fits like xxxxl . do n't know why this is but that 's the way it is . company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this .	-1
This is the first disappointment in a Carhartt item in tall . This sweatshirt is not nearly as heavy or well-made as one I bought last year from amazon , and it was more expensive . It is very short in the back and in sleeves , but front is marginally OK in length . It is tight around the waist in a LT . It simply does not cut it at this price . Perhaps at $ 25 I could forgive the problems , but not at this price .	-1
I do n't know what others are looking for but I did n't find what I had hoped for in these shorts . The fabric is stiff , almost rough rather than supple . The crotch has a 2 - 2 1/2 '' inset that is unsightly and the seam in the back is folded over at the waistband , and sewn down . Poor workmanship . Also , the waistband is the kind used on men 's underwear , which makes the shorts look like an undergarment . Return policy is poor and shipping is high so make sure you are not going to return these shorts .	-1
I like these shorts for the fit and feel ... very light , easy wash easy wear ... pockets are excellent ... BUT ... 2 issues ... beware they run small..second ..and more importantly 2 out of three pairs are un-stitching below the pocket reinforcement ... after only one wash ! ! ! ..love Columbia ... but not in this case ... thank you amazon for the free return and credit ...	-1
Columbia has yet to let me down in the quality of their clothes , durability and materials used . This shirt , is no exception . The only problem with this shirt , and it 's a big one , is that the size is waaayyyy off . I would venture to say 2 sizes off . I ordered a large , as I am a large in every other brand including other Columbia product lines , but this shirt was so big I could fully loaded ruck sack underneath it ! ! Seriously , it is at least one size larger than labeled but I would venture to say it might even be 2 sizes too large . I 'm going to give it to my dad who typically wears a XXL and see if it fits him . Bottom line , do not order this shirt online unless you have confirmed your size in a store first .	-1
I guess I was expecting too much after reading all the great reviews . However , I was SOO disappointed after opening the boxes . The stones are small and get lost on my ears -- and I do n't have particularly big ears . The settings are thin and bendy . Here are my comments regarding each set : Garnet : Too dark . When they 're on my ear , you can hardly notice that they 're red . They look almost black.Amethyst : Too light . They 're almost pinkish , and do n't look like amethysts at all.Blue topaz : Too light . The color is washed out and almost unnoticeable.Citrine : Again , washed-out . The color is more yellowish than orange.Peridot : This is the only set with which I 'm even the slightest bit happy with . Nice lime-green color.All in all , I wish I 'd spent my money on something else .	-1
Way too small ... . no way anyone over a B cup could wear this ... .no support at all for a bigger busted gal	-1
After all the great reviews I could n't wait to get a pair . I have actually never given a product less then 4 stars because I try to be nice , but honestly these are horrible . The fit is terrible and the look is so cheap , it would be embarassing to be seen wearing these . They wobbled on my foot . I am size 5 1/2 to size 6 depending on the the cut of the shoe . I got these in a six and the only reason I could get them on was because my foot is on the narrow side , but the back of my heel hung out a bit with thin sock . It was nearly impossible to adjust the cheap shinny plastic buckle for my instep . If you are used quality shoes like Dansko or Clark 's , do n't even bother to order . I kid you not , that these look like cheap plastic shoes purchased from the Dollar Store . For the price ( though not expensive ) you can do a lot better .	-1
The seams on these are poorly constructed/sewn . They pulled apart after the second wearing , and no , I did not buy them too small . Just poor quality clothing . Ca n't recommend these .	-1
they would fit someone 6'9 '' so the extra leg folds over and they are not warm as other brand I 've bought and would not buy thwem again ! !	-1
The material is way too thin ! The elastic band for the waist has virtually no elasticity and the pants can simply fall off .	-1
I gave these to my boyfriend for Christmas . He washed them in our front load washer before wearing . I pointed this out so that no one can blame the damage on the agitator . He put them , walked to the kitchen and came back with a shocked look on his face . All of the stitching on the side of the crotch gusset unraveled ... from crotch to waistband . He is a competitive cyclist and is very lean and trim so it is not like he was too big/heavy for these pants . They fit him as you would expect but did n't last more than ten minutes . I am returning them . It stinks that Amazon is charging me for the return when the item was defective .	-1
These feel like you 're wearing individually assembled pieces of soft tree bark . The worst part is the age old long undewear problem : they wo n't stay up	-1
I have a lot of Ex-Officio products - they make great travel/outdoor pants and shirts . I ordered two of these undershirts in medium and they fall short - literally and figuratively . I am a perfect medium size and 5 ' 10 '' tall . While the width around the torso is fine , the length is too short - it barely meets my belt line . I should have studied the catalog photo more closely , you can see for yourself , the proportion indicates a shorter length .	-1
Pros : -Absorbs sweat-Dries *kinda* fastCons : -Gets ruined easily ; backpack straps , anything velcro , they will tear at the material and ruin it REALLY quickly.-Though it absorbs sweat , that sweat SHOWS-Does n't look good . Definitely not a shirt you can wear out . ( IMHO ) Definitely would n't buy a shirt with this material again .	-1
This hat is really small . Too small for my melon , to be sure . I have a fairly big head ( 7 1/2 ) but I do n't usually experience too many problems with fit when it relates to stocking caps . Received this one , pulled it out of the box , tried it on and started laughing . Great hat for a lady or a little kid , but if you 're bloke with a good sized head , spend a couple more bucks and get a carhartt , which is what I should have done .	-1
As much a I love BH this belt let me down . Did n't stay at the tension I out it on at and I 'd have to re adjust too .	-1
The 'diamond ' is obviously fake . And sooo much bigger than in the picture . Cost wayyy to much for what its worth . So regret getting this ring .	-1
I bought this ring and received it timely , I always buy size 6 for both ring fingers . This ring is a size 5 at least NOT 6 as ordered , ca n't get it past my knuckle , it 's not just tight it absolutely wo n't fit , very disappointed and never have had a ring be to small before in my size	-1
Shocking - holes developing already come on CK ths ca n't be right . Any comments elsewhere as I am surely not alone ? Not worth a premium price .	-1
If you have a square body like sponge bob square pants , this is your T shirt , it will fit you like a glove , if like everyone else on earth you have a rectangular torso AVOID this T shirt ! It is a joke how badly these are shaped , and cheaply made , an absolute joke !	-1
I bought these as undershirts to wear under a dress shirt and tucked into dress pants or khakis.After a couple washes these shrunk in length and now I have the annoying problem of the shirt becoming untucked or wrinkled up at my belt line.If you are looking for a casual v-neck to wear untucked with jeans or whathaveyou , these might do the trick . As an undershirt , I will stick with the the Dockers V-necks .	-1
I always bought the Columbia items and will continue , but this item is the worst I ever have seen . I saw the picture and never hesitated to get the item . Well , today I got it and when I opened my jaws dropped . This is thinner than a handkerchief I believe . Never rely on the picture you see . It was my fault that I never consaulted with some customers and when I sent mails to Columbia , they never replied . This is a no-good vest ! ! ! ! !	-1
I have never worn these ear muffs because they are too difficult to open . They keep getting twisted . It 's too bad because they look like they would keep my ears warm .	-1
I was very disappointed when I opened the package from GemAvenue . Here 's why:1 . The ear muffs are of a very LOW Quality . Hardly worth the $ 14.99 GemAvenue ( e4hats ) charged me for it. $ 0.99 would have been a fair deal.2 . The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite `` second hand '' feel to it . It reminded meof opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store ! ! ! No Joke . In fact there were no tags on it at all toinform me of where it was made , what it was made of , washing instructions , etc . it did not even have thename of the manufacturer ! ! ! ! 3 . The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure . Adjusting the width wasnerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it ! 4 . The `` wool '' ( ? ) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it . Furthermore it was sparse and flat ... . NOT warm and fuzzy . Idoubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue . Besides , there was no tag to indicate thatit wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester.5 . I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely , so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my earswarm at all.IN CONCLUSION , this product is NOT NEW , NOT SOFT , NOT WARM , NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN ! ! ! What more can I say ? I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue ( e4hats ) for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK ! ! ! I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue ( e4hats ) EVER again ! ! ! Adding some comments to my previous review : It seems that people are still purchasing this product despite all the warnings from mine and other reviews . And some even gave 4 and 5 stars to this PoS product ... unbelievable .	-1
They work OK for a while , but it wo n't take too long before they break . They very cheaply made , which is to be expected for the price . The band is plastic , and the point where they connect to each ear muff is plastic and not very sturdy . After some use by the kids opening them up and putting them on , the plastic connection that snaps into place loosens up , and will continually come apart . Since they 're adjustable enough to get more than one season out of them for the kids , we 'll look for a better quality pair next time .	-1
I do n't like to write bad reviews but I must on this one . Extremely difficult to untwist . Not sure if this will ever be used .	-1
While they are very warm , they are very difficult to untangle each time you want to put them on and if you move a lot they will try to slip off your head and roll up in to a little ball again . I would not buy these again .	-1
I purchased this visor to replace one I thought I had lost . Fortunately I found it ! This visor is small , short and white under the bill . It does not protect my face from sun and the white reflects the glare into my eyes . My original visor is about 2 inches longer at the bill and black underneath . This one is for kids ! ! !	-1
I 've had this chain for about three or four weeks now and while it looked great when I got it- I 've noticed some tarnishing already on it . I do wear it daily , but I think it should last more than a month without looking dull and dingy ... .It is , however , strong enough to hold up to the rather large charm and locket that I have on it.EDIT : It 's been a little over a month since I bought this and it broke yesterday . No real reason at all- just broke . Now I 'll have to try to find a new chain , hopefully one that will last more than one freaking month ... .	-1
Maybe it 's because I am so bust-heavy . I ordered a bra a size larger than my normal size because of the sizing comments . NO WAY ! This thing did n't even come close to fitting correctly . I need this for my job . Genetics was not kind to me in the bust department so I have to resort to trial and error for bras . This is too expensive and a waste of time if you are rather large .	-1
I do n't feel right about dinging this bra because these are such a personal item and what I hate another may love , but I found this bra to be stiff and uncomfortable and the cups were a bit larger than as sized . ( Extra fabric in a D. ) It felt too big too exercize in . Maybe it would soften up after washing but I did n't like it enough to keep it and try . I hate most bras- but I also got the Anita Momentum in this order and that one was much softer , supportive , breathed well and felt true to size .	-1
I do n't know how this product is a 40in band . I could n't even get it on . Returned , the band sizing runs very small , so size up ?	-1
I guess if you want a heavy thick check book holder with lots of extras like card holders and money slots , this would be fine . I was expecting something much thinner . Not so many frills . For me , way too bulky . I wo n't be using this .	-1
This item is listed as a checkbook cover , but it is really a checkbook wallet . It has 7 card slots , came with a plastic insert for pictures , and even has a zippered change pocket . All I wanted was a bloody checkbook cover . On top of that , the wallet is made of the cheap , rough , chalkboardy-feeling leather that I hate . I wanted wallet-leather , the smoother grain leather that wears down to a nice smooth texture.To add insult to injury , the fold-over flap for duplicate checks is about 2 centimeters too short ! It only covers a portion of the check , so in order to use the cover , I have to have the checks slid over to the right , so the numbers will all be recorded on the duplicate.Needless to say , the hunt goes on for a decent checkbook COVER ( not wallet ) I gave them 1 more star than an absolute worst rating , because the item still does fit the checks , and more or less can act as a cover -- it just is n't one , and it does a poor job at it.2 stars	-1
I was looking for new gloves made of fabric with minimal loss of dexterity . From the product photo and the product description , these sounded wonderful . They looked like they 'd fit trim and snug , but have enough stretch to not be restrictive.I measured my hands , and they are 7.5 '' at the knuckles . Bingo . Size Large fits 7.5 '' .Only it does n't . These gloves are by no means snug . They are over-sized . The finger seams are crooked , and the thumb gusset sits too close to my thumb . Furthermore , the fingers are odd lengths . My fingers are rather short . The index fingers fit well . That means if you have long fingers , the index fingers of the gloves will be too short . The remaining fingers are far too long . In fact , the pinky fingers are nearly as long as the index fingers . These simply are not well-made . They feel strange on my hands . I 've bought gloves that were too large or too small before , but I 've never had a pair of gloves so oddly-shaped.The fabric is decent . It is n't that stretchy , though . On the palm side , the gloves are covered with oodles of gripping dots . They 'd be great if I could actually grip anything , with my thumbs being pulled away from normal by the gussets , and the fingers being so long.I ca n't recommend these gloves . If the cut and sewing are typical of Manzella , I would n't even recommend the brand . I 'll donate these to Goodwill .	-1
I tried this on in store and ordered off Amazon as the price was more reasonable.I was so happy to find a nursing bra that was comfortable and provided good support ( hard to find in the 36D size ) . Unfortunately after a few washes , it 's really stretched out and now does n't provide much support.Which is dissapointing given the price.Would n't reccomend .	-1
and way way too small . these things dont even go up to my crotch and Im not that tall . Are these supposed to be little girl 's tights ? THey are one size fits all .	-1
Color is nice . Fit our needs . But - Both straps broke after minimal use . The backpack is now useless . Returning for refund .	-1
it looks so nice on the model , but when i openedthe package i was so disappointed . it just is madeof a cheap cotton material that looks like somethingyou 'd buy from a 5 & dime store . Just junk.Do n't waste your money .	-1
I love wearing sarongs in the summer to the beach and the pool ! If I need a great quick cover-up I always go to them . This came packaged , and when opened it felt damp to the touch , and a dead beetle fell out : ( YUCK . It did not wash well with the tassles . I have had one that I picked up for about the same price 13 years ago and it still looks great compared to this . Sadly this went to the garbage can .	-1
I went to Sam 's Club to buy a Seico watch ( I have had two of them ) and liked the one I saw except it did n't have the luminous hands I liked . I was going to buy it anyway but when I tried it on my wrist , there was no way the clasp would work . I asked the saleslady if she had another one and she 'sighed ' and went to a cabinet and found one . I tried to get the clasp on this one to work and it was the same as the first . She finally got it to hook , but not while on my wrist . By the way , I was already irritated with her long , decorated and embelished purple fingernails and her attitude . I finally gave up and left . When reading the reviews I see that I am not the only one who had problems with the clasp . One 'expert'said the size of the clasp and the hook did not match up . So I am off to find another brand and goodbye to Seiko~	-1
All of these reviews are based on nostalgia , this was a great watch in the 80s but now is trash , i do n't even think Seiko care about this anymore since young people do n't used watches as they use to . If you want a mechanical buy an Orient diver , is a lot better than this Seiko diver . The past is gone , this is not what it used to be , be real .	-1
This `` was '' a great purchase - I thought . But after less than a year , the watch band broke . This IS covered by the warranty , but the customer service person at Seiko was a nightmare . She said that the watch band was obviously twisted , and basically , called me a liar . Nice Seiko ! Good way to treat your customers ! !	-1
I opened the box and said , `` Wow '' this is a beautiful watch . Too beautiful to wear actually . Finally after several months passed I put it on my wrist , gave it the intial wind up to get going and took a four mile walk , gently swinging my arms as I walked . The watch second hand stopped about every fifteen minutes and I had to shake it to get it going again . Despite walking four miles it failed to wind the spring automatically and would only run for a minute or two tops before it stopped.Now I have to mail it to Invicta with a twenty five dollar check for return postage and handling plus the cost of mailing it to them ! Maybe , I just had a lemon but I urge you to wear it the day you get it to use the Amazon warranty and keep in mind that Beauty is only skin deep even if it 's stainless steel ! The one star is for being beautiful.Updated 12/07/07I mailed the watch to Invicta for repair and waited almost twelve weeks for it to be returned . After the first seven weeks I called Invicta to check on the repair status . They said it had to be mailed overseas for repairs and would take longer before it was returned to me.Yes , I now have the watch and it actually works . I purchased an auto watch winder and have left it on the autowinder since I received it . It has been running just fine and keeps accurate time.I will now wear it on my wrist and see if it holds up to daily use . The moral of the story is that while the watch is beautiful it is in reality just costume jewelery and not a serious time piece.I have increased the rating to THREE STARS but be prepared to be dissapointed if you want a serious time piece.Updated 12/21/07Well , I have worn the Invicta on my wrist daily for two weeks and it has kept very accurate time and there have been no problems . This is my conclusion . I love the appearance of the watch and the price was very affordable . I now agree with all the reviews that rave about the watch . You may be one of the lucky ones and get an Invicta that works right out of the box . I blame myself for not wearing it during the 30 day return period intially.I can now raise to rating to FOUR STARS for satisfaction and value but only if you are one of the lucky ones not to be shipped a lemon watch , even then the stellar Amazon service will exchange it during the 30 day exchange window.3/1/08 Well its back to one star for a rating . The auto=wind appears to be on the blitz . If I wear it all day it stops within an hour of taking it off my wrist , even on the automatic watch winder it will not keep running because the rotation is too gentle . What can I say , it is a beautiful watch but is really just costume jewerly . I have a seiko `` black monster '' dive watch now that is perfect in every regard.7-6-08 While the watch has been collecting dust in the draw I am still drawn to the beauty of the time peice . I now wear it again but must manually wind it up twice a day to keep it going . I am truly amazed at all the positive reviews that always start out this watch appears to be much more expensive than what I paid for it . I suspect the vast majority of those people are too embarrased to edit their glowing reviews to simply say that their watches have stopped working after a few months . These Invicta watches are all flash and no substance . Be warned , spend a few more bucks and get a Citizen or Seiko dive watch for a truly quality watch that will give years of service and uncompromized customer satisfaction . Everytime an Invicta automatic dive watch is sold an unhappy customer will be the result in a few months . You have been warned ! !	-1
I bought this as a gift for my husband on his birthday , he liked it very much ! SInce its automatic not sure about the time adjustments needed to done often as other reviewers said , overall good .Update After 3 months of use : The time has to be reset daily : - ( Not so great for people who work sitting in desk all day without much movement , do n't know whether I can return it now , my husband is annoyed that he has to set the time everyday morning : - (	-1
This is the second Invicta watch I purchased that was defective . In this case , the automatic movement began working ( after some initial winding ) but I was surprised to see that it had stopped in the middle of the day ( while wearing it ) . I cranked it up and again , it stopped after a couple of hours . This pattern continued to repeat before I finally decided to return it for a refund . Yes , its a nice looking watch ( if a common and tired design ) and is sold for a great price , but I 'm now quite skeptical of Invicta 's quality . I had previously purchased the very similar ( but smaller ) style # 8932 from another store and it had the same issues of running for a while , then stopping . Which was even more surprising in that case since it was a battery-powered quartz movement ( battery replacement was no help ) . So I guess if you are one of the lucky ones to get a good unit you have a real bargain - if not , you may be out of luck and late for your appointment !	-1
It is very small so that fat men like me is not going to be good , is going to be very small like a woman 's watch .	-1
I understand some of these watches come with screws for removing links . This one did not it came with only small brads and the brads themselves do not secure the band and keep it from falling off of your wrist . I would not recomend any watch that has a band that the links are secured by links .	-1
The size was too small for me . I have large wrists and this looks very small on me . The appearance is not the usual high visual I get from as I did with my previous Invictas I have purchased .	-1
Watch came deffective . Chronograph functions are not working . In addition big seconds ' swipping hand in not functionig . Horrible , horible quality . Came deffective right out of the box . What a shame ! Because watch looks and feels great on the wrist . I knew I was taking a chance with Invicta , but two out of two watches deffective ! Anfortunately it 's probably true for most of their watches .	-1
This is one of several Invictas I 've purchased , and I 've been pretty impressed . However , this model is so small that it hardly qualifies as a men 's watch -- and I 'm a fairly short guy . I 've seen watches this size advertised as ladies ' models.The second problem with this watch is the clasp . It almost takes a pair of pliers to loosen the safety clasp . While it 's nice to have a tight fit , when you ca n't take the watch off , it 's a problem.Timekeeping is fine , and I still recommend Invicta watches to others . But unless you 're a really small guy , this watch is simply too small for wearing . ( You could , however , give it to your wife or girlfriend ; )	-1
Too small like lady 's size , but it 's very heavy compared to my Seiko . Seems like the watch band is thicker so it 's heavier . Returned it .	-1
While this was a good price and the build quality seemed great for the price , I returned this after a few days . When I got the watch the second hand was off , and it spaced up IN BETWEEN the second/minute marks on the right side of the watch , from 12 to 6 . It was not bad from 6 to 9 and hardly at all from 9 to 12 . Then , after a few days , it got worse all around and was not the same each pass . In fact , the second hand started to skip , and in some cases fall back a little . it was VERY choppy and does not `` sweep '' but `` clicks '' Unfortunately the clicking was so bad I could not keep . I would have expected more , but from now on will get better quality , and thus have to pay more . In o way did this compare to my Citizen and would not buy another Invicta . You would be wise to shop around , and Amazon is a great place . This watch looked great , and could have been great , but you will find other choices . In any case , I highly recommend Amazon and will always patronize this company .	-1

This is the watch I just recently replaced . I purchased it elsewhere , but I figured I should write a review.When I first received the watch , I absolutely loved it . Appearance was excellent , craftsmanship appeared solid , nothing was out of place -- I was feeling pretty good about my purchase ! I wore it all the time . Well , it appears I got a bad one . The water resistance on mine was nonexistent . I was washing lettuce of all things , dunked my hands in the water , and that was pretty much the end . A little water got inside , I figured I could just lay it in a bag of rice and let it dry out -- nope . It dried , and it died . The watch was under warranty , but they required $ 28 for return shipping , after I pay to ship the watch to them in the first place . That 's approaching 42 dollars from where I 'm located . For a watch that 's under 50 dollars in the first place , I 'd rather not go weeks without a watch to save a few dollars resurrecting a watch that I 'd be afraid to ever get wet again . After reading some of these reviews of the horror stories of sending it in , I do believe I dodged a bullet.Anyway , I went with a different brand this time . I do n't know much about the Invicta brand , but after that little fiasco , I 'll try someone else .	-1
First when I got it ( really quickly by the way ) I could n't figure out how to wear it ... the wires for the underwire were on the outside of the bra ? Huh ? Yeah , super weird ... plus the sizing was totally wrong . I had to go to a store and buy one , this just did n't do it at all . Gave it to a friend , maybe they can use it !	-1
they made this bra smaller and the cups smaller and the cups also make my boobs look pointy , what happened and why have they changed ? and mine is not 95 % cotton either so the material has changed too ! ! ! Do n't buy these , I think I am returning them for false claims , the cotton content is not the same and the bra is not as comfortable ! ! It gives that uni-boob look , it is very comfortable and holds the girls in place so they are not bouncing along but I sure wish it was made so it would separate instead of forcing them together .	-1
this bra is horrible . I ordered my regular size , and the fit is way off . The band is too tight , the cups are too large . Not only are they large , but they 're too pointy . I 'm not a fan of cone-shaped boobs that stick out in opposite directions .	-1
This is the weirdest fitting bra I 've ever tried on . I will be returning it . I do n't ever want to have pointy boobs , especially when I 'm working out . So awkward .	-1
I read the reviews and ordered this bra in my normal size and one size up . My regular size would have been too small . The band is fine but the cup 's too small . And it does make a weird shape , cone-like . One reviewer said that went away after a while . I do n't know , I have returned this sport bra . The fabric feels nice , and it is comfortable . It 's for medium impact I 'd say , not enough support for running etc , which is what I was looking for .	-1
SO bummed out that these straps are n't adjustable , which means after a few uses and then washers , the straps will become even looser and offer no support at all . As it is , they are waaaayyy too big/loose , and I bought the bra size I normally do for sports bras .	-1
The wire on this bra may be on the outside but it still dug into my in cage . I returned it .	-1
I would not recommed this bra . The wires are very stiff . I had difficulty hooking the back . Had to ask my husband to help me out so I have it away .	-1
I nay have liked this product better if I had not seen the real thing . I have seen many rasta'a and spent a considerable amount of time on the internet trying to find them . I have owned the ones that are hand made and I wish that I could find them again . The ladies on Maui make them , and they are gorgeous ! The yarn is heavy , and the knitting is spectacular . They are large because most people that wear them , wear them over braids or afros . I would love to send you one so that you could see what they should look like . They would fit a toddler 's head , ( a bald-headed toddler ) but nothing larger . I hope that I can return them , but what I would really like is to find where I can get the real deal . The colors are nice , but they are very cheaply made . Size , material , and workmanship get a thumbs dowm . My friends complemented mine , so I ordered 8 of them as surprise gifts . They were a surprise alright !	-1
I ordered this , as I am a huge LOTR fan and figured for the price , it would n't be too bad , even if it was a little cheap looking . It was supposed to come in two days ( I have Amazon Prime ) and yet it never came it . The order was confirmed as shipped but I 've already waited a week and a half . I got refunded my money back . Good thing it was only $ 6 , or else I would 've been really upset .	-1
They were very inexpensive . So i do know you get what you pay for . they fell apart and the powder was everywhere	-1
I thought these would make good sandals for running short trips out of the house . They look nice but there is zero flexibility to the sole so it 's a lot like having a board strapped to your foot . I returned these and would not recommend them .	-1
To be fair , there 's nothing really wrong with these slippers . However , I found the quality somewhat subpar . Looks and feels like any cheap pair you can get in Chinatown . For the price , I expected a little better . Looks better in the picture than in reality - very plain , and something that your grandma would wear . Definitely not for a younger person unless you like the frumpy look . My last annoyance was the comfort factor . Now , I 'm the type of person who can overlook A LOT as long as it 's comfortable . This is not all that comfy as the reviews lead one to believe . The foot bed is hard and inflexible . It also makes loud noises when worn on hard floors , so wearing it around the house can be annoying for others . So , all in all , I 'm going to trash these at the earliest opportunity and get something else .	-1
They are expensive por made in china . I wear a 7 to 7.5 wide . These are more like a size 8 extra wide . I live outside of USA and returning then is not an option . I gave them away to friends .	-1
purple , not maroon in any sense of the word . very disappointing . my son used it for an orchestra halloween concert but will probably never wear it again . we have a hat by the same company that looks much better . The 2 definitely do not match !	-1
Like many other buyers ; I got duped . The scarf I received was purple , wrong color emblem , and 100 % acrylic instead of wool . The brand name of the scarf I received was Cinereplica , some french company . The scarf listed is & # 34 ; Elope & # 34 ; brand . I have seen the correct scarf at a book store , so I know it 's out there .	-1
Like all the other reviewers it is purple and not maroon ! Amazon needs to change the description to purple and gold .	-1
Some people have commented on the scratchiness of the scarf.It feels insubstantial to me . The crest feels flimsily glued on and is itself stiff and cheesy looking . The colors are less vibrant than I imagined . The scarf is also narrower than I imagined . We bought it to accompany the Harry Potter robes we ordered . The scarf was too itchy and the kids abandoned it for trick-or-treating.The scarfs at World of Harry Potter cost $ 10 more , but felt like soft polyester . They looked much better worn around the neck . I consider this scarf as more of a costume and decoration ( to be used at Halloween only ) rather than an everyday scarf . Our kids do not like to wear it , so I can not consider it a very good purchase .	-1
I ordered my normal size , what arrvied was HUGE . I had to send back for a refund . If you buy these buy one size smaller .	-1
I have another cut by this same maker in the same size that fit great . The seams on these ones are more & # 34 ; raw & # 34 ; and the leg-holes are strangely tight !	-1
I have worn a size 7 panty for about 20 years . While these were labelled a size 7 -- they fit w-a-a-a-y smaller on me than what I typically expect from a size 7 . I could n't wear them . They were just too tight .	-1
Does n't even come up to and cover my belly button . I thought I would try a `` high cut '' brief because I usually wear theVanity Fair Women 's Perfectly Yours Lace Nouveau Brief # 13001of which I have several pair in black and white . I like the feel of silky nylon but this is not it ; this is stretchy elastic and clothes would stick to it . I ca n't recommend these Hi-Cut Briefs because they are so small and do not cover my navel . I am disappointed that Vanity Fair would offer `` dime store '' underwear.Update 3-5-13 : I gave these to my best friend who wears a size 5 or 6 panty . She is delighted with my `` high price '' taste .	-1
THEY DO NOT STRETCH AS THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO ... ..NO LIKEY..IF YOU BUY THESE BUY THEM BUGGER THAN YOUR USUAL SIZE	-1
Unless mine were an anomaly , order up at least a size . I ordered my normal size and they are strangling . And it does n't appear they can stretch out .	-1
after the first wash , all the elastic us coming out , string by string . Wo n't be getting another pair of these .	-1
Ordered a size 8 , which is my size but these are huge . I also do n't really like how slippery and silky they feel . I do n't feel they are worth the money . I did n't really want them anyway .	-1
If you have wide hips with any fat on them , avoid this panty . I am 5 ' and ~120 and ordered the medium fit . They fit comfortably enough and the fabric was nice , but the string part of the bikini cut my hips into quardants . This is not something I could wear under a slinky dress because it would show . Badly.Oh well . I guess I have a new pair of period pants .	-1
I like the style and fit however the material is what I do not like . I prefer the lace version of them and think I will purchase a couple more pairs of those . Now the lace ones , those are really beautiful and comfortable .	-1
Six pairs all colors quite tight on a heavier calf . They did loosen up after washing a few times . Nice for thin ladies . I do not recommend these for everyone . Probably okay for teens . Not for anyone who works out .	-1
These socks do NOT fit as knee socks . I have ordered several pairs , from different manufacturers , in the recent months & of all of them , these are the worst fit for me.I am 5'4.5 & # 34 ; tall , not overweight at all , with a BMI of 21.5 ... so I know that my calves are not that heavy , although I do have large bones ... maybe that 's why ? ? Anyway , they only reach half-way up the calf , so for what I wanted , they did not fit the bill . I gave them all to my daughter , rather than go through the hassle of returns , etc . At least she can get some use out of them ...	-1
This piece of clothing is a mess all the way around . It is way to wide for the size ordered , it is out of whack in terms of how it fits ... Tight in the chest wide in the hips and I am 5'5 , 109 lbs.. Stay away	-1
The slip pictured here is a full slip , mid calf The slip I received is just a bit longer than a camiWhat happenedWhat is in this picture is not what I received	-1
I just got this and , like what another reviewer said , only one zipper per compartment ( different from the pic which clearly shows a double zipper on the larger compartments ) , no Velcro grip on the handle , and the green one was not even close to the color ordered . My mom has a black one from Walmart that I actually like better ... going back . The inside was ok- but just like any other . Oh well , thanks to Amazon for being easy in these situations !	-1
This watch is hard to use . Also , it 's overly complex : i just needed a watch to tell time , wake me up , and time my runs . For example , it has five alarms ( huh ? ? ) . I like that it has a dual timezone clock . But all the features are hard to set , despite reading the instructions . It is annoying to have to read instructions EACH time you want to reset an alarm or change your time . ( I travel a lot for work ) . If you are looking for something easy to use , this is not it .	-1
It is a great watch . Unfortunately i bougth two and i received just oneWhere is the other ? . Just the boxI paid 43.9 usd for thi watch .	-1
Ordered the stainless steel bracelet version but received the rubber diving band version . I decided to keep it and so far it has performed correctly on my watch winder and on the wrist.It is running about 15 seconds per day fast so far which seems to be typical of Seiko automatic wind mechanical watches . For some reason mechanical watch manufacturers seem to favor running fast to running slow .	-1
I used to own this Seiko Black Monster . It really was a looker of a watch . Good craftsmanship , durable case and bracelet , and very bright luminous markers . It had good waterproofing too . But when it started to gain at least a minute a day , and stopped on me for a couple of hours , like another owner 's experience , I just had to avail of Amazon 's excellent return policy . ( Thank you so much Amazon.com , I will always remain your loyal customer ) .	-1
If you 're going to order this bra , be sure to order up a full band size , or 2 . It runs very small in the band , but the cup size seems accurate .	-1
No stretch . Does n't do what the description says . Runs very small and the material is very inferior compared to the lovely , satin-like soft bras with great support that are out there .	-1
I got one to try it after reading the good reviews , but they 're not for me . They run at least a size or two too small , and I felt badly smooshed inside . It went to the back of the drawer to try again after I lose more weight , but it does n't seem like it 's for me .	-1
I tried this bra on as soon as I got it in the mail , and not only did the size feel like it was already too snug even before I finished fastening the hooks , but as I was in the process of fastening the many hooks in the front ( TOO many , which makes it more inconvenient to put on ! ) , I noticed that the bottom hook was ALREADY BROKEN before I could even get it attached ! I opted to return it immediately and get my money back rather than exchange it for another one , since if that was an indication of the quality of the bra 's construction , then I 'm not willing to be foolish enough to give them another chance to unload their shoddy , ill-made merchandise on me ! I will try another brand of support bra instead !	-1
It 's very stiff and still does not provide as much support as I would have expected . Will stick to purchasing this type of stuff at store ...	-1
My 15 year old daughter has bad posture so we thought we 'd try to correct it by purchasing this bra , as braces and other gadgets are not recommended by doctors . This bra is very lightweight & does not offer enough coverage or support , and my daughter hates it . She has to wear it with another bra to get the coverage and support she needs . The strap design is created to try to remind ladies to stand up straight , but it 's not really working for my daughter . Overall , a waste of money for us .	-1
I received this bra but could not even get it around my body ! Needless to say , I ca n't say I liked it or that I would recommend it to others since I never got to wear it . Returned it .	-1
This is a cotton front closure posture bra . The cotton wrinkled after hand wash and air dry , It had nothing to do with posture , and was not an easy front closure bra . I had to iron the cups because of wrinkling .	-1
This bra is at least 5 inches smaller around the bust than my other 38 's . It also has very little stretch to it , so it is impossible to pull together in the front . I was very disappointed . I have ordered from this company before and the bras have fit great , but there is something wrong with the material and sizing of this bra .	-1
Purchased this for my teen to help her with her posture and the concept was correct . I even went up a size as most comments stated . She wears a 38B and I ordered 40B BUT could have gone up to a 44 with as tight as it was . It did n't even come close to closing on this one . Amazon was good and I was able to return . Hit and miss on this one .	-1
It is unusually loose in the bust area ( actually to the size of the bust near the underarms ) . It will bunch under clothing and be uncomfortable for this reason . It will not fit like the model unless the sides along the chest area is taken in . I am going to see if my Mom can do this for me , so I can wear this slip . Otherwise the slip will not work . Maybe a triple or double D can fill this out ( not sure as it is oddly bunched up to the outer edges of the breast ) .	-1
I wear a 36D bra and thought the size 38 would fit and perhaps even be too large . I was very disappointed when I tried on one of the camisoles . It was tight in the bra area and much too small in the lower skirt . I am not going to send them back because of shipping costs ; I will just give them to a charity . I liked the fabric because I thought it would not cling to whatever I wore over it . Frustrating !	-1
Product arrived , the pants came down to my ankles . They looked ridiculous . The 'snip it ' rows of lace were at my ankles .	-1
I 'm returning these . I wear size 14 and got a large and it 's way too small in the waist . Material is ok , not great . The fact that you can snip to the desired length is a plus .	-1
I thought this gown was so pretty and feminine so I ordered two . When I took the gown out of the wrap I was shocked at how wrinkled it was , a sure sign that the material was n't good quality . It was thin and flimsy , not at all like the picture shows it looking . It looks like it would be flowy with a heavier type of material , it was n't at all . Very disappointed and they make you pay for the return , waste of money either way , not a good value at all .	-1
I have other Shadowline gowns that I adore . This one is not the same quality . I could not believe what I received ! Flimsy material cheaply sewn , just not at all like my other items . I do n't know if it 's just this vendor ( it was National ) but I am so disappointed . It is going right back today .	-1
This robe is so flimsy and cheap . You can hold it up to the light and see through it , BOTH layers . It is a lint magnet . The blue was not at all what was shown in the photo . It is a VERY VERY dark blue . not pretty . For this POOR quality , it was WAAAAY overpriced . I wouldnt pay $ 5 for this robe	-1
The cup folds down right at nipple level so this may work for pumping ... but its terrible for breastfeeding because the baby ca n't get a latch on anything more than the nipple . It teaches a bad latch , in my opinion . I 'm keeping it only for pumping .	-1
I took a gamble on the size , and I got it right , however the way this bra is constructed it gives you pointy cone boobs that will appear under your clothing . I am returning it in exchange for the Bravado silk seamless nursing bra , which is super comfortable and has sufficient padding to cover my lady bits , but looks natural .	-1
Not the right bra for me . Just did n't like it at all , so it went back .	-1
` Even if you are full with milk , the cups are way larger than expected . They dent in and do n't stay out . The material is so bad , it is like the equivalent of memory foam so when it dent in , it stays that way until you push out the cup again which is embarrassing . No one wants a dented in chest look . Take the cup size down a notch when ordering this one . Also this tends to cut off my supply 10 fold with the underwire so if you really need an underwire try this but I 'd go down a cup size for sure .	-1
Make sure that you get fitted properly by a professional after giving birth otherwise you 'll be waisting time and money !	-1
I got this to wear under some gauzy shirts I have , but they are just too hot for the climate I live in .	-1
I ordered the correct size but the bra is too small and i shall have to give it to someone else cause anything that cuts into my back is not acceptable	-1
The bra is very flimsey eith little to no support . The straps are very thin and offer no support and leave marks on the schoulders . Olga has such a good reputation for quality , but not for the cami bra . I would not recommend this product . The other csmi bras on this website are a much better fit and quality .	-1
I missed the fact this is an underwire bra . I am over 40 and this would fit a teen or young person . Not for older women . And the lace felt scratchy anyway . Back it goes . Was delivered really fast .	-1
I tried it but it was n't exactly what I was looking for . There was nothing wrong with the material or fit , just not right for me .	-1
I do n't know if Amazon sent me the wrong color or if the picture is wrong , but the picture that shows the LEVI 501 STF 501s in `` Black Fill '' is not right . The picture shows an inky blue 501 and what Amazon sent me was just a Black pair of 501s . I do n't know which is wrong , but I 'm sending them back and I do n't want someone else to make the same mistake.Amazon needs to update this page or their inventory because if the picture shown is correct , then they sent and pulled the wrong pair , which I find is highly unlikely since all the items are given an item number for identification , and not pulled from a verbal or visual description.The 501s themselves deserve 5-stars once you find the right ones that will shrink to your body shape and size .	-1
These jeans do not retain their color and after and after one wash they shrunk so tight that I can no longer fit them and have had them less than a month . I am very disappointed and feel like I have wasted nearly $ 100 dollars on two pair of jeans that are of no use to me , I do n't believe I will order anymore clothing from amazon because the return window has expired and it is too short for something that is mail order . There is not enough time to see if the item is satisfactory because I tried them on and then did not wear them until 2 1/2 weeks later . Also , there are never any jeans for the low price that Amazon advertises ; they are always from $ 46 and up .	-1
It 's probably been 25 years since I bought any Levi shrink-to-fit jeans , and I 'm really sorry I bought these . I have no trouble wearing any brand 32x32 jeans , but these shrink to fit 32x32 are way too small , too tight . And worst of all they come out horribly wrinkled . I bought two pairs on clearance for $ 14/pair , but what good is that if they 're too small to wear ? I doubt I can return them since I washed them but I 'm going to try . Not recommended . Jeans have really changed , and these are a giant step backwards . Very disappointed .	-1
Too small despite me ordering his normal size . I had Christmas ordering issues , so ended up with 2 pair for the price of one since they did n't arrive in time for Christmas . Both pair too small . Returned both pair , and got credit for only one . I 'll shop at the store for these jeans from now on ... ..	-1
I can not believe this product . I ordered shrink to fit but they shrunk 4 inches in the length and 2 inches in the waist . I conatcted Amazon and they had me return them and they will credit my account . Bummer the color was nice .	-1
I do not know about these pants because I had to cancel the order . I do n't know what more I can say since I did n't do n't have the pants .	-1
Returned	-1
This fabric is not good . The jeans could standup on their own after three washings , so I finally went for hot water and now these pants are a hot mess . The wrinkles are etched like wiskering , and even ironing does not improve the appearance . Hot water was a bad idea , but it was liked these pants were shellacked . Now they are small and wrinkled .	-1
I bought two pairs of Docker khaki 's , a pair ofD1and this D3 'classic ' fit . While the D1 was amazing and fit perfectly as I 'd imagine but these were just horrible . The first thing I noticed was the cut before I even put them on . These were hideous looking and it is not even remotely close to the picture ( I posted some pics ) . They appeared fat and baggy and when tried them on it they made me look like a hip-hop fan . One of the reviewers here stated that he 's also gotten different sizings . Returned this and kept the awesome D1 .	-1
They say it is a t-back its nothing like a t-back . Dont even bother its a waste of ur money and time	-1
This review is specific to the black stretch . Normally the standard 511 are my jean of choice , but I decided to try the black stretch . They wear and fit like straight denim , which was nice , but the spandex has broken and & # 34 ; pilled & # 34 ; up across all the fabric . It looks like I 'm covered in crumbs that you ca n't get rid of.The jeans were rendered completely unwearable after only maybe 100 hours of use .	-1
even the 3rd time washing everything turned blue . they must be defective and amazon sent me a return label . even the inside of the pockets are now blue	-1
I am used to Lucky Jeans 101 ( Super Slim ) which is their match to the Levi 511 . In those I wear a 30x30 but they are pricey and have limited colors that often are discontinued or sell out fast . In these I have to try on 3 different sizes with each new wash as the cut sizes and patterns are never the same . Sometimes a 32x30 works , sometimes 30x32 and in some washes they are so messed up I ca n't get a size remotely close . How hard is it to put out jeans in the same size and cut when they are all labeled 511 ? Edit : I finally landed on 30x32 and they shrunk to fit nicely after a few cycles ( wear for a week then wash/dry cold/low ) so I ordered 2 more pairs , from this exact same page , exact same size , color and cut and they came fitting the way the washed pair did - Just right . I fear what will happen upon first wash so I may end up avoiding washing them for some time and hang dry . Between quality , inconsistency in size and cut and unexpected results after washing you are probably better of going into the $ 100 range .	-1
just okay . would have gotten a better deal elsewhere . looks far better online than the real stuff . i was disappointed	-1
I tried the pants before buying them on line in a levis store and the waist was not expectedTo resolve the issue I thought of a trouser belt but It does not have enough clamps for it .	-1
I did not think that jeans would wrinkle . How wrong I was.These jeans are made of some very flimsy-feeling material . They wrinkle practically on sight . I tried them on for fit and took them off immediately . They were covered in very noticeable wrinkles . The jeans were not tight in any way , so it was n't that .	-1
It was way too tight . i could n't fit in it at all . i tried to return it but for me it would have cost too much to return since i am an international customer . i regret buying this .	-1
I chose this rating because I had to pick a star . would be preferred to of given no stars Cuz after one wearing without washing they were completely covered in anything possible that would stick to it and lots or fuzz from blankets or anything . I 'm very unhappy with them do n't know where they 're made but you should check for if made in China do not buy them Levis were a U.S. product & should of stayed that way . I would not recommend this to anyone . I 'm Very unhappy and when you do wash them it does n't come off.. I was very happy with jeans bought from & # 34 ; Elite Hero company & # 34 ; Perfect all around . ( Dickies )	-1
I wear 34/34 . To fit my size I should of order 36-38 waist and nt the 34 i did . Looks like a joker . terrible .	-1
Bought two different sizes , but on both pair , my thighs bulge out as if I 'm wearing yoga pants . I do n't have thunder thighs nor do I have chicken legs . They are athletic and muscular legs with very little fat . You really need to be thin and lanky for this pair to look good on you . Also the material is n't your typical jean material . Quite thin and stretchy . Not unlike your typical yoga pants that ladies wear . There is also the danger of male cameltoe appearance unless that is the intended effect you are going after . Not for me . I 've seen the picture of the members of Journey taken together sporting ill fitting and tight contraption like jeans from the late 70 's . We 've gone past that . Steve Perry is gone from the band and so should his fashion sense from the 70 's .	-1
I must 've orderd a half dozen pair of livs over th past few months , and none of them fit the same , none of them made in the same country and none made here in the USA . I find it disappointing and problematic . I love shopping on Amazon , but this type of inconsistant fit makes it very difficult to shop here for levi 's . Thank goodness Amazon will refund you gladly , but must caost them a fortune on shipping charges . Im still trying to find that majic fit .	-1
The material is much thinner than other jeans I have bought . They look like they have been washed one hundred times ! !	-1
i did n't like the color on the light poly personally , but they are levis and they are cool so im sure somebody out there likes em	-1
I had some of this style Jockeys from back in the daywhen we still made stuff . Lasted at least 10 years . ThoughtI would go up a size due to shrinkage and so forth . If you aregoing to wear these under chest high trout fishing waders oryou are Pee Wee Herman these fit great . My wife fell out ofbed laughing since they almost covered my nipples ! Do yourselfa favor guys , just go & # 34 ; commando & # 34 ; , cause you ca n't purchase adecent pair of under ware in the USA anymore .	-1
I have always loved Cole Haan shoes , quality , fit , style . They always wore like iron . Recently ordered a pair for my husband . They were too small , too tight , not as well made , and - oh , by the way - made in India .	-1
I would not have bought if I did tried it in a store . Too much bother to return it . I will go back to my old brand .	-1
This is my first online shoe purchase . It wo n't be my last as I simply draw no enjoyment from that trip to the store , but it is a disappointment.These are beautiful shoes , but too small . I thought they 'd & # 34 ; break in & # 34 ; as has happened with other Cole Haan shoes , so I wore them a few times ( and enough that I could n't return them -- another mistake ) . They did n't . All I got were blisters and irritation at my own stupidity.Think before buying .	-1
These panties are nylon/spandex -- not cotton . They 're as sheer as pantyhose ! They 're entirely see through . They 're horrible . Save your money . You might as well wear a pair of stockings without panties , because you 'll be covered just as well , which is to say not at all . I am shocked at how horrible these panties are . Shocked ! Do no waste your money on these .	-1
Bad fit , too large and I ordered the smallest size . And caused muscle strain in my legs . Also too low of a cut in the toe area . Made it even more unconfortable .	-1
I have a solid size 8 foot . In a select few sandals , a size 7 1/2The slipper did not fit right , tight - and had to be returned .	-1
The first day I wore these I thought I had finally found the perfect slipper . These were true to size and very comfortable . After just a few days , something inside the soles started bunching up to the point it felt like there were pencils stuck across the soles under my heels as I walked . I wore them a little longer hoping maybe it would get smashed down after a time , but it only got worse . When I looked up the manufacturers warranty , I found on their website you had to pay to mail the defective slipper to them and enclose $ 5 to pay for their return shipping of a new pair for you . At $ 13 for a brand new pair , this just is n't worth it . When I went to throw them away I also noticed the fabric on the bottom close to the soles was starting to wear through .	-1
I loved the & # 34 ; Isotonor Classic Satin Ballerina Slipper & # 34 ; so much that I thought I would try these . The terry cloth version is too clunky , has thick rubber bottoms , slips off my feet too easily , and seems harder to get on that the satin version . If you are looking for something that is low maintenance , looks nice , and feels good on your feet then I recommend skipping the terry cloth and ordering the SATIN Ballerina Slipper .	-1
Got this for travel but they 're not as flat/small as I expected . The sole is a thick foam and while it is soft , they do n't compress as well as I thought for travel .	-1
They want $ 500 for a pair of $ 12 slippers ? Are they high ? There has to be some sort of error .	-1
I was expecting these to be just like the classic satin ballet-style slippers , which I 've had for years and love , only they would be made of terry instead of satin . But the toe portion was too short for the rest of the shoe and the sole is very hard . I was very disappointed and returned the shoes .	-1
There 's something wrong with these slippers . They feel wrong no matter how I swap them around . It feels like I have two right slippers but even then , they do n't feel like a good fit . Not impressed with the sole . What happened to Isotoner ? They were good years ago .	-1
The pant had a large yellow stain on the right front below the belt loop . The material was nice and they run large . I was very disappointed receiving dirty dockers . I returned them pronto .	-1
Tried them on and they fit fine , the fabric is good weight and length was good for me . I am pretty standard size 10 . I went to put my hand in the pocket and it was only 3 inches deep , token pockets in the front and no rear pockets . There are fake placket and no pockets ! They went back , did not mind paying for shipping to get rid of these .	-1
I had n't looked at these jeans when they were delivered . As I was starting to wrap them for Christmas , I noticed they were a BUTTON fly ! Nowhere in the description did it say that . The fabric was tacky and had a sheen to it . NOT nice at all .	-1
34 x 32 has fit me for years , and I have n't gained weight . I ordered slacks in the same size at the same time as this order , and they fit fine . Now I have to try to unload these jeans on somebody else . At a loss , no doubt . : (	-1
Flimsy shoe . Fit is just okay , but ZERO support . Sole got ruined from standing in a parking lot ! Color came off after 2 wearings . Garbage brand . High shipping costs mean that however low the price it , this shoe is not worth it .	-1
the left shoe is too narrow . Not built correctly and it squeezes my foot and leaves a bruise . Tried to widen them but did not work . Now they sit at the back of my closet . Total bummer	-1
I wear a medium in pants . I ordered this pants in a large because I wear a lumbar back brace . I could n't even get these pants up to my knees . They were like a size small . The sizing is so off , I would not know what size to order . I have several other pairs of pants like these and I wear medium or large in them with brace . Totally disappointed .	-1
I got these in May and now it 's January I think I started wearing them in October and they already have holes in the legs . I got an XL but I definitely could have gotten a smaller size . These things always fall down . I do n't suggest buying them . They are comfortable just cheaply made .	-1
If you need a temporary `` tread '' for your shoes , this is the product for you . If you wanted something permanent , this might not be it . It lasted 3 days for me , and did a great job for those 3 days . Then it started peeling off and then I had to throw it away .	-1
Grip is good but did not last on the underside of my brand new shoe for more than a day .	-1
In my opinion , these were not cheap by any means and I expected them to last . I used the first pair to reduce slipping on a smooth surface shoe bottom that also made a funny noise when the foot 's front hits the floor . This got rid of the sound but it also lasted maybe 3 weeks tops , during which I wore the shoe less than 7 times . I put the second pair right after and this pair lasted even less time , about 4 uses.When they stop working , it feels like you 're about to slip in a different way . Needless to say , I was annoyed with the quality . I went to peel the rest of them off and saw the glue melted off . I used these last fall and never walked on any warm surfaces . It was gross and left my shoes with a sticky bottom , which then took forever to remove .	-1
These are just too shiny for hetero men to wear . They look like girl shorts . And they wrinkle like crazy.The fit is good , though , and they are comfortable.. It has a white , thick , drawstring , which is another drawback , since that 's also very noticeable .	-1
These diamond earrings had lots of great reviews , so I thought I would try them . They were pretty ugly - no sparkle , dark and drab in color . The gold was good . I sent them back - I guess I should have known , since they were so affordable .	-1
How disappointing that these beautiful earrings caused my ears to become infected - the first time in decades ! Anyway , if you do n't have an allergy problem these are for you . They are gorgeous , well made and beautiful . Just not for sensitive ears . I 'm soooo disappointed .	-1
I have multiple pairs of Wigwam socks and love them . So I was a little surprised to notice after a few washings that the fabric was really pilling up around the toes , and its slowly coming apart . Not sure if I got a bad pair , but I 'm going to stay away from buying the Cool-lite hikers from here on out .	-1
The top part of the socks was so tight I could not wear them . I gave them to the Salvation Army . I had thrown away the packaging or I would have returned them . At almost $ 18 a pair this was a big waste of money , and I sure hate to waste money .	-1
Oh dear , this was my worst buy of the year . No big deal as its only 10 dollars but even so please do n't waist your money . New already I could see they where not fitter around the angle but straight up and down from the heal which I thought was weird but I needed to use them so I did . They do not stay up but crunch up in every place possible in you boots , even the heal moves and yes they where the right size for me . Then I thought never mind I will use them as indoor ware to be around the house . Well that did not work either 1 weeks down the line they where so out off shape and stretched they did not even stay on my feet , you could n't tell even where the heal was anymore and I could n't walk in them . I could maybe ware them in bed if I do n't mind my foot being half way up the sock but even then they are not comfortable . What is more they look like they are years old already , I have washed them in cold and line dried but they have gone all bobbly and horrible too they look like a pair of old ill treated Grandad socks . I think my next step will be to put them in the garbage . I am surprised they get away with selling this type of bad quality ! ! !	-1
Ordered a 48 ... it 's smaller than my all my 46s ... sizing chart is not accurate on these ... fabric is very stiff and copper color buttons look very cheap .	-1
Incredibly small ! also the material was very coarse . I ordered a Levi 's Mens 527 Bootcut Jean of the same sizehttp : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004G9OIPY/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_17Fit 's perfect and the material is WAY nicer . Perhaps the color I ordered is just a crappy material , and perhaps this was a defect but the jeans I got are terrible and I 'm returning them and will never buy Wranglers again .	-1
These seem to be good quality , but had to return due to not being quite right . He usually wears a relaxed fit but lost some weight but these didnt fit in all the right places .	-1
OK , I 'll admit that I thought I was ordering the 937 stretch jeans , but I mistakenly got 936s . They are stiff as a board ! We laughed when he tried them on because he could just stand them upright and step down into them . Also , my husband 's other jeans are all a 34 waist , but when he tried these on he could barely get them fastened . ( And no , he has n't gained weight ! ) . I thought perhaps they were sized wrong so got out the yard stick to check . Yes , they are a 34 waist , but they fit really tight . I am returning them today and will be more careful about getting the 937str instead .	-1
have worn Wranglers for decades but this is the first time that I purchased them online . I returned them because the seams were out of alignment and that results in the jeans legs being twisted ... and as a result , looking bad .	-1
Fit is o.k.I own some `` normal `` Wrangler Cowboy Cut Jeans- this George Strait Superitem is thinner than my cowboy cut jeans and have very poor and faded color.The fabric is well made , therefore 2 points.To this poor color do n't fit indigo jacket cause pants color is too poor and faded . Ca n't go out with this jean.Color in the ad is better/darker than real.The Material is thin- nothing about heavyweight on it ! Living in germany there is no chance to return , but for this -Is'nt worth the money- item i switched to carhartt jeans .	-1
as someone have already said in the review , the soks are too tight on the top , cut in to the leg : (	-1
I did not like these socks . They were not worth what I paid . They slipped off too easily . They are thin too , where I live I need them thicker . The only socks that worked for me were fisher-price socks , only problem is I ca n't find them anywhere . I do not recommend you buying these socks if your child always tries to take off his socks . The fisher price socks he can never get off . DO NOT BUY !	-1
I purchase these for my husband and when I opened the packaged , I had an instant visualization of my husband wearing these . I immediately decided they were going back and ordered him a thicker non see through pair , which he loves .	-1
I got this a few months ago and was trying to live with it . I have to buy another one I got so sick of this ugly shape and hard nylon material . The opening on the legs cuts in to your legs almost stopping blood flow ! There is no way to adjust this , it 's not elastic either but something hard and set and feels extremely uncomfortable . Generally , it 's badly cut , badly designed , ugly and shapeless on the body , it sits on your like some kind of plastic bag you pulled over your privates . Avoid this like a plague .	-1
This dress adds 100 lbs , i swear . It is a good price , but you would look better naked . It is unfortunate , but please save yourself and do not purchase this dress .	-1
I just tried it and it really looks easier that it really is ... as far as I am concerned ... it was a waste of my money ...	-1
I do n't need to say anything more . They would n't let me leave it a rating of no stars , so I have to give it one .	-1
This is plastic and is cheep this is great if you are going on a trip and you do n't want to take your good set	-1
The Izod American Chino is not worth the cost . While they are comfortable ( the minimum requirement of any pant ) , they are more comparable to Lee Stain-Resistant pants which sell for about $ 18 at Kohls and that is what these pants should sell for . I ordered 3 but returned 2 . I kept the Pumice ones only because I liked the color a lot . If you want Izod casual Chinos I recommend the Madison series instead . More comfort , better material , better made .	-1
This item does n't fit tight to the shoulders . It seams like they just took a t shirt and cut off the sleeves . Not impressed .	-1
Ordered several different colors of these shirts and was extremely dissatisfied . They are very thin and , because of that , anticipated to not wear well . Have ordered Russell in the past ( with great satisfaction ) but apparently not the same shirt . Would not recommend .	-1
This shirt had surprisingly thin fabric and huge arm holes . My husband is in good shape , but the arms are cut very strange .	-1
There is nothing special about this shirt and I found that it just looks plain weird on . The sleeves are strange .	-1
The material is very stiff and not soft even after several washings . the color is nice and the fit is good but that 's about it . does n't feel like a cotton shirt .	-1
OK so I bought 3 of these tanks:1st one : It was a grey one . I bought a Medium and it looked GREAT . It was a little too big on me so I was like why not buy a second one ? 2nd one : I bought a white one . WTH ? ! Is this made out of paper ? ? The material was complete crap , nowhere close to the first grey tank.3rd one : I stupidly forgot I bought the 2nd one and gave them another try . This time it was a blue one , HORRENDOUS MATERIAL.Bottom line : Buy the grey color one , it 's actually uses clothing material .	-1
These shirts are too tightly woven and heavy . Have no give to them , and do n't like the shape .	-1
Could not believe that it 's Cotton - more a Cotton/Sisal blend . Had to wash it several times and use fabric softener so that it does not itch anymore .	-1
Compared with any other clothing I wear , including other cotton tanks , this product is substantially undersized . I will shortly return it for a larger size and perhaps a different brand .	-1
The shirt is ok for the price . I would not purchase it as a great quality shirt ! So that is what you are looking for do n't hesitate in purchasing it !	-1
When I got these shirts they fit great ! After one washing in cold water and air - drying it turned into a different shirt . They got a lot shorter , up to my belt short and the neck got a lot bigger , showing lots of skin in the front and back . Yet some how they stayed wide . They are great if you want a disposable shirt .	-1
Ordered a large size..got overlarge . Fabric is n't great either..though it looks good in the picture . I love ordering clothes online but experiences like these hamper me .	-1
I wash all of our clothes in cold water to avoid shrinkage , but after a few washes this shirt lost a couple of inches and looks ridiculous .	-1
ordered an XL , runs like a small Large.washed it three times , and it 's still too itchy to wear.would not recommend .	-1
Having purchased both , it is well worth the extra five dollars or so for the cotton performance tee . The performance tee is soft and comfortable . The basic tee is unpleasant .	-1
top does not stretch at all , seem to be all polyester , snag easy , waste of money . feel awful even if top was n't was stretchable . do not buy . awful .	-1
in the picture they are very impresive but in reallity nothing to talk about but i live overseas so i can not return anything so i will be left with themruthi	-1
We bought a medium for 9 year old . It is tiny ! Made with a very cheap material , with weak stitches.Back is wide open ( from waist up - only Velcro on top ( and on the wrong side too ) ) so plan to buy larger so child can wear shirts underneath.Cape is not usable - one velcro and slides offDoes n't include breather box or booties or gloves .	-1
These were so light weight that they constantly shifted when I attempted to wear them . They should have been made with double amount of gold . I certainly do not recommend these earrings .	-1
There are plenty of us burly folks with thick necks and a muscle or two , who do not want to feel squeezed in our attire . This ungenerous sweatshirt is composed of thin fabric cinched on top by a too-tight neck . I should have read David Marvin 's true and informative 1-star review . This is over-priced for the low quality . I 've bought thicker , better quality sweatshirts from WalMart . That 's how cheaply made this thing is . I ca n't tolerate a tight neck pulling on me all day like a rabid dachshund ; totally uncomfortable to say the least . As the group Little Big Town sings on their CDThe Reason Why , `` There 's a price for keeping me , I may be cheap , but I ai n't free ... '' This cheap fuzzy offering in larger sizes ( 2x , etc . ) turned out better : Soffe Men 's Classic Crew Neck Sweatshirt .	-1
This was ordered as an XL Tall . It was n't all that long to begin with , but after washing it , it shrunk so much I could n't wear it anymore . It 's way too short for a tall size . I wo n't order Russell anymore . I have found the Carhart brand does n't shrink nearly as much and is a better value , even though it 's more expensive .	-1
I ordered two new TALL sweatshirts on the same day from Amazon . Got them on the same day . Washed them on the same day . The Russell in XL navy blue shrunk up so short I can no longer wear it . Gave it to my shorter sister . The Carhart gray , did n't shrink much at all , and it 's my favorite . I wo n't order Russell anymore with that much shrinkage .	-1
I ordered XLT and got a 4XL . I mean it fit my 330 lb dad just fine but for me this was like a dress . I do n't know what they were thinking when sizing these but it is craziness .	-1
This bag is a good size for my 5-6 year old to use for swim class . My first complaint would have been that it is too hard for him to tighten the drawstring . You have to have some muscle to pull it tight . My second complaint is that the string actually came out so now the bag hangs WIDE OPEN making it absolutely not usable .	-1
I bought these as a pair of work shorts for around the house . The right pocket opening was stitched up so high it caused the opening to be too small . So small that you can not fit your hand into the opening . I should have returned them but I did not . I would never buy these again , nor would I recommend them . Typical cheap mass produced Chinese junk . If you actually buy these shorts , they do run a bit large , so order wisely and prepare to be disappointed .	-1
Much bigger than I expected and the nylon feels a little cheap . Although , for the price it does the job !	-1
the total price of almost ten dollars ( including shipping ) was n't worth it . the quality was very thin and the sewing was n't professionally done- the buttoned down part by the neckline was not straight and there were threads loose here and there . i would have kept it if it was just thin but the sewing was just too cheap looking .	-1
to small to short , when it gets washed and dried it will get smaller i do not recommend shirt	-1
The worst material in the world . Dont waste your money . This material is so coarse that it might leave gator marks on your body	-1
medium is baggy on a lean frame , material is a bit coarse , nothing special here . Spend a few more bucks and get a good shirt .	-1
I do n't know what I was thinking buying such a cheap shirt . It looks like I got what I paid for.If it had cost more I would have sent it back.Very cheap , wrinkly looking and needs ironing after the dryer to look anywhere near presentable . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I do n't know why , but these shirts are not sized according to normal standards . My husband wears a large in all of his shirts so I ordered a large in this one . I also got a large pique polo in another brand . This shirt is SO MUCH BIGGER than the other one . It looks like it 's probably actually a 2XL at least .	-1
I got this shirt for my husband because it seemed pretty cheap . I guess you get what you paid for . The material of this shirt was very ROUGH , he did not like it at all . Also the shirt is not true to size ( I think ! ) . The medium seem so big , I even took that shirt and measured it against other medium shirts that my husband has and it still seemed pretty big ( by big- I mean wide ) . He is skinny so that might have affected a little bit , but I still I do no think it is completely true to size . I do not recommend this product . Do n't let the price catch you ! I rather pay $ 10 more and get a decent shirt made with a soft material .	-1
The product promises a lot but delivers very little . When you touch is you feel unpleasant touch , rough . While it probably cleans something , as it becomes black while rubbing it against the piece of jewellery , it definitely leaves the piece in the previous , unshiny look . It also leaves stains in your fingers .	-1
This product BURNED MY SKIN SO BADLY I HAD TO GO TO THE DOCTOR 'S ! ! I WROTE THE COMPANY AND THEY SAID THEY WERE & # 34 ; SORRY & # 34 ; , BUT THAT DID N'T PAY MY MEDICAL BILLS . If you have sensitive skin then DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT ! !	-1
The quality of the jeans seemed good but the length was 33 1/2 instead of the 32 inseam that I ordered . I had expected the material would be a little heavier since there described as rugged outdoor style .	-1
Denim is denim is denim . These jeans meet all the usual standards in terms of appearance and toughness . The problem is that although I ordered my normal size they are cut slightly , bot noticeably , too small . The next size would be too large . One particular oddity is that the back pockets are so small that they are difficult to use .	-1
Ordered up a pair , reviews look good , got them fairly quickly , tried them on , they fit good . The right hand from pocket felt like there was something in it , like an `` Inspected by # 277 '' note , but it was just the wrinkled and crispy pocket itself . I inspected it closer , and it was full of holes ! The front left pocket had the same problem . Bummer . Sending back for refund.. not taking another chance , I 'll just go to the store and get jeans .	-1
Coarse material , too . I could recommend these only if you were looking for a work jean and you go down a size in both the waist and inseam .	-1
They look good the lenth is very good . But the waist a little tight do n't fit like my other ones I have purchased .	-1
I provided the correct size and they sent me two pairs of Wrangler Jeans that had the correct size on the label . But the length was not even close ! Now , I have to have them shortened at my expense.I 'm really upset about this goof up . Who ever labeled these must be an idiot.My problem is that I 'm unable to return the Jeans . I 'm 86 yrs . old and no longer drive	-1
I am a Wrangler jean 's fan for many years . I had purchased and worn another pair , but lost weight so was looking for a smaller pair . Yipee ! I went down 2 in . by waist and hips , but allowed the & # 34 ; relaxed & # 34 ; in my newer sizing thinking , & # 34 ; Gosh , sure hope I did n't get over hopeful for smaller size. & # 34 ; When I tried them on , I was astonished that the waist was 2-3 in.s larger so have to use a belt to cinch it up tight enough so I wo n't loose them . I have worn them but becuz of the tight belt to keep them on , I am uncomfortable when sitting or bending over as the belt does n't & # 34 ; stretch & # 34 ; with use light the jeans do . Out of the dryer , they are tight for a little bit but they soon & # 34 ; stretch & # 34 ; out with wear . ( I HATE the women 's & # 34 ; stretch & # 34 ; jeans ! ! ! When wearing them , I feel they do like the hated pany-hose and gradually the crotch feels like it 's trying for my knees which is truly uncomfortable ! ! So & # 34 ; X & # 34 ; to those type of jeans ! ) Plus , I like the thickness of men 's jeans cuz they wear for a long time for me.I 'm debating whether or not to send them back ( got ta look at & # 34 ; returns & # 34 ; to see if even feasible ) .My husband use to get so aggravated when buying his Wranglers at the size he wanted because no 2 were alike in size ... some coming small and some large . Wrangler needs to make sure the sizes are correct !	-1
I do n't know where they are making these jeans now a days , but be prepared to have them altered , The measurements are all off . I had to have mine altered by a taylor .	-1
too small , too small , and i even ordered the size larger . what ? yea.. too small and it 's too small bummer	-1
Quality is good but Use caution when ordering , jeans are at least two sizes smaller in waist.To me returning items is a hassle that I would would rather not bother with but unfortunately it looks like I do n't have much of a choice .	-1
On me , they fit poorly when compared to the & # 34 ; other & # 34 ; big brand who makes lots of denim jeans . Tight in the wrong places where the others are looser fitting . No problems with the quality , just not a good fit for a mid sized round guy with short thick legs , lol .	-1
Their the smallest 35 's I have ever seen . They would n't fit my son at all and were very tight on my grandson that wears a 33 .	-1
WAS EXPECTING LOOSE FITTING JEANS AND THEY ARE NOT	-1
I ordered a 54 waist and the rear pockets seemed like a direct clone of a 30 , I could only get my fingertips in there . No , I do n't need to put my whole hands inside , but with these only a thin wallet would fit . I say when they make the pants bigger they should make the pockets proportionally bigger too . It would not only be more practical but would improve the & # 34 ; look & # 34 ; . To my eye , rear jeans pockets should both start from about 2-3 inches from the center seam and be sized big enough to cover most of the butt . At Wrangler they start the small pockets about 2 & # 34 ; from the 2 side seams and then that 's IT , leaving a big empty butt space .	-1
I bought the size I get in Levi 's , and even though they appear baggy in the photo they were much too tight . I 'll stick witht ht ebrand I know .	-1
This lacy , thin , beribboned confection is certainly pretty , but it 's not engineered to handle 38DDs . The girls simply overwhelm the thin material and begin to spill out . *sigh* I know there are Nonbeige Bras That Fit Large Breasts , but this , sadly , is n't it . It 's not up to the task .	-1
terrible.looks cute , but left rash under my arm due to the fabric itching me so terribly . also made my boobs itch and sag because the straps are so long ! i 'm like dang can i get some real and natural upward support ? you know you got the wring bra when you 're contemplating getting a boob job . i 'm just saying =/	-1
These look nice but were too tight across the top . I ordered a six 1/2 wide . A 7 would have been too long . Returned for refund .	-1
I bought these shoes in size 9W . I like how they look , but somehow they are big in the back and at the same time tight around the toes . It is the first time I 'm having this problem with wide shoes . I ended up getting blisters both times I wore them . Also , the second time I wore them they made a squeaking sound when walking , so I 'm not sure I want to wear them again , at least not at work and public places . I 'm disappointed because I wanted to buy these shoes in every color before trying them on .	-1
Received this watch today , 2 days after order . Great shipping Amazon ! However , if you are a man with at least average size , this watch will be too small for you .Description showed the watch at 37mm ( 3,7cm ) , it must count the whole face and border of the watch .Very hard to see the date , if you are mid-life man without a 20/20 vision , you can just forget it .Everything else are just about right for a $ 15 watchI gave it to 8 year old son and it looked OK on his wrist .Definitely , positively NOT a men 's watch !	-1
seems of very good quality , but the finish is poor , it seems an expensive ring but up close you notice scratches and cracks . I do not recommend	-1
i 'm a small and have ordered cherokee pants in a small before and they fit snug . i ordered an extra small this time and these were HUGE on me . dotn know if they changed the measurements for the extra small or what but if ur ordering these i recomend get it 4 sizes smaller than what you are	-1
The white color that I have to wear is see-through . A classmate wore undergarments with pink stitching and you could definitely see . These should be made thicker . I bought white tights to wear underneath , but it made them uncomfortable to wear . Also , these are n't for people who have big butts , as your underwear show when you sit down .	-1
The pants were HUGE ! ! ! I am plus size person . I bought extra large . I could place another person in . Also , I bought extra tall because the regular is short for me . But the product was too tall ... I could wear high heels and they are still too long .	-1
I wear XS scrub pants but these were so huge . I was not happy with the fit and felt right off . Very disappointed .	-1
I am tall and need long pants ( seam 33 & # 34 ; ) but these are longer . Ok to wear to work in a hospital as scrubs if you are a very tall lady or a man about 6 feet but I was hoping to wear them everywhere and they are not made for that . Thin cotton which is good for hot summers in Arizona but I will need to alter them before I can wear them as casual pants for running errands like grocery shopping or hanging outside with neighbors .	-1
This rubber band is a rather cheap copy of the original and did not even fit my Seiko Divers model . I do not reccomend it .	-1
I ordered a black shaper tank from self expressions in a med ( from amazon ) and it was less expensive than THIS one . It fits perfects..no see through , flawless , no need to wear a bra . They did n't have white available in self expressions , so I tried this , expecting better quality than the cheaper black one ? nope . A med was to large..the material that is supposed to smooth your tummy at the bottom is actually quite see through . If this does not bother you , atleast order a size down for extra smoothing . Also the top is completely see through so a bra must be worn . Defeats the purpose for a shaper . I returned and hope for white to come along from other seller	-1
Dissapointed - I ordered it in a large size - and it 's too tight - very uncomforatable . I 'm going to try something else .	-1
I bought these quiet some time ago . I wear them to the shower , to the mailbox , and at the beach , which I may visit 10 days in a year . I am disappointed that they 've lost what support they offered at first . I do n't put many miles on these things . I wo n't buy Reef again.I am now a Chaco man .	-1
I 've used this sandals for like 5 days now , the reef logos in the back end of the sandal are already fading and looking really bad , like the sandal had like months of use.Also i ordered the black ones and they are getting to look like white dirt or something on the foam bed . I thought they would be more comfortable but not what i expected . This added to the fading logos make the sandal look like at least 1 year old.I should return these , im thinking . For the price , i definately got ripped off . I bought Adidas sandals in the past for the same price i got these , i still have them since Dec 2007 and wore them until i got these and they still look VERY good but i just thought it would be a good time to buy new sandals , either i was wrong or chose the wrong brand . = ( Buyer beware .	-1
I have never had a pair of Reefs that has fallen apart so quickly . First the leather lining comes undone on both sandals , then a few months later the nylon part is broken . My past reefs have lasted at least 2 years if not 3 . This pair broke in less than a year . I wonder if the manufacturing process has been compromised . My sons Reefs bought at Costco had to be returned after about 2 months because the leather was delaminating from the sole . What is up with Reef ?	-1
As at least one previous reviewer had noted , these shoes come just a little too high at the ankle , which made wearing them , even for a few minutes , too uncomfortable . They 're nicely made and were exactly as advertised ( other than a little larger than I expected based on my usual size ) . But because of the height issue I could n't imagine wearing them even through a single day .	-1
They are very average shoes . Please do n't buy them thinking they are better than any quality shoe on the market . Go to a Vasque dealer and get better shoes .	-1
Just to get to the point , my problem with the shoe is that the leather seeps in water . When it rains or snows , the leather gets soaked and in no time , my feet starts to feel wet . This mostly happens at the front of the shoe where the leather meets the sole . At first I thought that the shoe I got was just a lemon . Distraught , I called the Clarks customer care service and they sent me a new pair of the same shoe without any hassle . But alas , after the first day of rain , my feet were soaked again . I am compelled to say that this line of Clarks is just poorly made . Do n't buy this shoe if you plan on being outside in them on a regular basis .	-1
I guess I just do n't get the style here , but these were some of the most uncomfortable , impractical shoes I 've ever worn . You ca n't make them fit right , there is n't padding around the top , the sole is fashionable I guess but better not step on anything wet .	-1
These look good in pictures , but do not look so great in person.to make matters worse , they are not very comfortable.They remind me of those shoes that you rent at the tuxedo shop before a wedding or prom or something.Not comfortable.Shiny , but not comfortable.These are especially bad if you are actually going to be using them . Walking in them , wearing them day in and day out.They are stiff , uncomfortable , hard , and they do n't seem like they will wear in very well .	-1
I recently had the displeasure of returning three separate pairs of these , due to poor craftsmanship . The first pair I received , the left boot was about 1/2 '' longer . The second pair had a big glob of adhesive all over the suede , which was clearly from someone doing a lazy job of adhering the sole to the upper . The third pair ? Same thing , but this time , there was also a nice blob of glue up towards the top of the boot , from someone clearly having stuff on their hands/gloves . If I 'm ordering new shoes , and paying close to one hundred and sixty clams for them , they should be just that : new . As usual , Amazon was first-class as far as handing the reships and returns . I used to be a huge fan of Clarks , but after this ? I really ca n't see supporting a company that really does n't care about the true matter at hand : quality .	-1
Not a Fan of the House Coat . Somewhat small for the size . the background color looks dingy.. Brought it for a gift and will not give it ... ... .	-1
The earrings are cute but , in my opinion , they do n't stand out enough . They are very tiny do n't look at all like what 's displayed . Not returning , will save them to give as a gift . I 'm sure a young teen will enjoy the .	-1
The cups on this bra seemed small and the band seems big . The bra kept sliding down all day and did not provide any lift . I wear a 34b so I there 's no heavy lifting . Sadly , I kept it because I 've had no luck at all finding a strapless bra and it 's better than nothing .	-1
We bought 5 Maidenform bras on Maidenform 's website , and when my wife compared them to each other you could see the majority sent were an inch and a half shorter in length ( the 36 was more like a 34 ) , and the cup size was 1 size smaller too so it did not fit . They said over the phone they could do an exchange , then when we paid $ 10 to ship it to them they said 5 weeks later that they do not do exchanges . They have no consistency in their bra sizes , and they have terrible customer service support.The one bra out of the 5 that she did keep because it `` mostly '' fit she later threw away because it made her breasts look like they were going in opposite directions and the cup size was too small making it pop out in an unattractive way .	-1
After reading the glowing reviews for these earrings I ordered a pair as a gift for a friend . When it arrived opened the box to find the earrings in a plastic jewelry bag - they looked dull and something that could be easily made by my teenage daughter . I held them up to the sunlight ( out of the bag ) and yes , the crystals change color as expected , but at least the pair I received , are not Swarovski quality and lack the brilliance in color I was hoping to see in this item.On the good side - they are not overly expensive . Honestly though , I think they probably cost no more than seven dollars to make ( having looked at jewelry making stuff in craft stores ... ) . The packaging is your basic silver cardboard jewelry box for earrings with a piece of cotton batting in it . The earrings are in a small plastic jewelry bag , and the box is inside a plastic bag for shipping.They probably would appeal to some , but for me , they are a a 5 out of 10 in terms of overall value , look and quality . If I did n't need them as a gift 'right now ' - I 'd return them .	-1
These were not very good quality and I returned them . In the picture they appear to catch the light and have life , but they were flat .	-1
I waited a while to buy this hat and well I wish I had invested a little more to keep the sun out of my eyes and off my nose and cheeks.The brim of the hate is not as pictured . The offering of larger sizes is what made me try it out . Not useable .	-1
I 'm noticing more and more garment makers are guilty of inconsistency in sizing . It 's like jean makers assume we 're all gut and no butt or waists . Same with bra designers . If I 'm a 36C or a 38B it should be 36 inches or 38 inches along with the appropriate cup . But I 'm convinced there is no standardization at all when it comes to something that has been treated and portrayed as being standard . I ordered mine ( like this ) on the Jockey site itself . It came made for a tween with A cups , when I ordered something more on the C end . Unless I used duct tape there was NO WAY I was going to fit a C into their so called 36C . It flattened me entirely and would n't even hook latch . They were no where NEAR one another to latch . The tag said 36C , I wear a 36C , so logic would argue it would fit . Alas , it did n't . This is n't the first negative bra encounter I 've had with Jockey - they usually run smaller than they should which makes it very hard to order . The only good bras Jockey makes are sports bras . But if you normally wear a medium in them , go for a large . They run small too , but have great support . I would avoid purchasing any of their other bra-like products as they run especially smaller than they are supposed to .	-1
I bought these because I have been looking for the sweat pants that have soft fuzzy material on the inside of the them . I have searched many stores and it seems that those are not made anymore . Thought I would try Amazon ... same thing . These are hard and not what I am looking for . I guess the ones I am looking for are no longer made . I give up !	-1
Do n't buy these . Unless you can pick them up for $ 5 , they are just likely to be one of those gotcha buys that will haunt your nightmares for years to come.I bought several pairs of these two years ago . They appeared to be part of a product line that had some excellent hoodies which I had purchased initially . I 've regretted these sweatpants ever since and have just ended up hiding them under one of the various and sundry heaps in my closet.The worst thing about these pants is the fabric . It is thin , it is SO thin that I can feel even slight breezes coming through the legs . The fleece on the inside of each leg does nothing to help with this or to give the pants a more luxurious feel . When I put these on , the fabric alone screams , `` Cheap ! '' at me.But that 's not all . The legs are cut too long in proportion to the waistline . This would n't be a problem if the result was just a fashionably baggy appearance . However , in both of my pairs of pants , the elastic in the bottoms is weaker than a 10 yo rubber band . As a result , the bottoms are constantly dragging on the floor and getting in the way of my feet . I finally got the clips that cyclists use for their cuffs . This helps a little but is also unnecessarily inconvenient.Last , I have not found the drawstring to be terribly useful . Rather than ending in two strings that I can securely knot , the drawstring is just one continuous loop that is much more difficult to secure . This is perhaps the most minor of the problems , since I can always just cut the drawstring in half . I 've been reluctant to do that , though , because this is often just a recipe for losing the string altogether.Companies often modify their styles in the course of different production runs . Possibly the problems I 've noted have been corrected . However , this purchase has left me feeling sufficiently burned that I am not likely to make a return to the scene of the crime to try my luck yet again .	-1
i am a size 5 in women and these were a size too big . ladies with small feet buy from the adidas big kid section .	-1
I bought these shoes and liked the feel . However , within a month , many of the nubs broke off . I contacted Adidas for a return pair . They do n't reimburse for return postage . No one from Adidas ever responded . Do n't waste your money on these ; buy another brand , or expect to find that they will deteriorate in short order.As an update , I bought a pair of the men 's version and they appear to be holding up much better . Like so many things , men 's products are also made better . Additionally , I got a better price on them than the women 's also .	-1
I purchased these shoes because I have neuropathy in my feet . I imagined that the innersole having the rubbber spikes would be good for blood circulation . I was wrong , they were terribly painful . I was going to give them to my daughter who loves sandals and she gave them back to me saying they were too painful . I then asked my granddaughter who is 11 to try them and she had the same problem . All along I thought it was me . Others in the reviews raved about them . Sorry I could n't join your praise .	-1
I wish these sandals had a smooth sole . I bought these because I teach ballroom dancing 25 hours a week , and my feet need something soft to relax . These do n't cut it .	-1
Horrible product . Bought them for one vacation trip and the second time I wore them on the trip the strip snapped on a walk around Philip . I looked at the strap and the reason they broke was because they did a horrible job gluing it on . I looked at the one that was n't broken and I saw that the strap was already beginning to tear half way down . They looked good until they broke after my second time wearing them	-1
I found these shoes by searching the women 's option for running shoes . The name may say Unisex , but there is no indication that the sizing is 100 % male . Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size.When the shoes arrived here , they were huge . I tried to return them , but Amazon considers this to be MY fault , and planned to charge back any shipping , promotions and coupons against a possible refund . I had done very well using a coupon , a sale , a `` buy $ 80 worth of shoes and get $ 20 off instantly '' promotion and Amazon prime , so my `` refund '' would be less than nothing.That 's right -- if I return the shoes , I owe money . Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women 's section of the site might be men 's shoes instead . Yeah , that seems fair .	-1
Sandals were very nice however totally different fit from the 3 pairs of Keens I already own . Very disappointed . Love Keens and will stick with models I own .	-1
Zipper broke first month ... ... ... ... .not real Jansport product ... ... .will only buy from authentic site from now on . Do not buy , waste of money .	-1
I have a worn Airzuit model JanSport backpack , which is no longer made . It is more than 15 years old . I went all over the US , Europe , Mexico and Turkey using it as my carry on luggage and day pack . The big Student Classic Series Backpack has flimsy zippers , zipper pulls , and fabric . The shoulder straps had thin , poorly padded straps . I read a review that was critical of this product , but thought that the reviewer was just a complainer . My mistake . I sent it back , and will get a minor repair done my backpack at a luggage repair shop . The Big Student backpack qualifies as a medium grade toy .	-1
Ordered this backpack because Jansport use to make good quality gear . Unfortunately this pack was not made to handle the rigors of middle school and the zipper ripped out within a week . I understand the need to make profits but if you are going to call a backpack a `` BIG Student Daypack '' at least make it capable of handling the heavy books and binders teh schoold require kids to cart to and from school .	-1
I got this to replace a worn old L.L . Bean bag . I chose it because I loved the color and because Jansport has a good reputation . Unfortunately , within ten minutes of trying it out , I knew I had to return it . ( And I never return things ) . The straps were extremely uncomfortable . Even with nothing in the backpack , they were noticeably less comfortable than my old bag 's straps , and with a heavy book in the bag , they were downright painful . I did n't realize how much I rely on a curved strap for weight distribution when carrying heavy loads . This bag 's straps are straight , padded but narrow , and not smartly placed . There is also no padding along the back , so if you are carrying anything hard or pointed ( like a book ) , you can feel every pokey corner . There was no reinforcement in the bottom , and the material felt thin and flimsy . I 'm doubtful this bag would stand up to much hard use . I returned this and got a North Face Vault , which I 'm happy with .	-1
Disappointed with the backpack . We bought this for our 5th grade daughter and it 's too small for her to carry all of her stuff for school . It 's also flimsy feeling , nothing like the JanSport backpacks that I had when I was in school .	-1
I carry my polycarb macbook in this and one day I decided to carry it laid flat on my bicycle . The corner of the macbook rubbed a hole open at the top right in the nylon material . That is not all though . The nylon also made the rounded corner of my laptop square and made it black and jagged looking like a fingerprint about 7mm across . If you 're going to carry a laptop in this use a sleeve . This backpack has a lifetime warranty so Ill see how that works out . Oh also I do n't suggest you use this backpack with a tank top . The straps are extremely rough and will rub you red .	-1
Disappointed and returned . Second hand does n't line up . Bezel does n't turn freely . Date and day were hard to adjust . Overall quality is not good so returned .	-1
price would indicate that it is-but no it is not-i bought another for less than half of that price and it fits and does not roll-i will just dump it-a lesson learned	-1
Too small and not the quality I expected . This was returned .	-1
Does what it says . But bit way too tight for me ! I 'm petite and bought small . It is uncomfortable for whole day wear and too tight not elastic enough around the upper stomach/ lower chest area . I wear it less ow . I wear my other brands . But it is good material and well made .	-1
This product is sized right and looks/works exactly like I wanted it to . . . Until I sat down and there were these huge bulges on both my sides . The boning works great if you 're standing but if you need to sit for any reason , people are going to know your secret	-1
I ordered this and the Rago cincher . Both were too long and added extra & # 34 ; curves & # 34 ; at the bottom when it ended . I did n't look like a better me at all . If you 're short ( I 'm 5'3 & # 34 ; ) I do n't recommend either of these products . I was trying to avoid getting the shorts because that seemed like it was going to be a big pain if I ever needed to go to the bathroom , but I should have probably gotten those instead . Other shorties , stay clear !	-1
The boning literally bent ( not broke ) but bent causing me to look like I had some odd looking hump on the lateral side of my waist . It was literally embarrassing . Maindenform makes some excellent products but this one was absolutely terrible . do n't waste your money on this .	-1
i dont like the fit . the top rolls down and they cut in my thighs and makes them look funny . They also run a little small .	-1
I was expectcing a lightweight easy to wear garment . Unfortunately , this one gave me a good idea of what it must feel like to have a boa constricter wrapped around your mid-section .	-1
I bought these in 3 different sizes trying to find the right one . The size chart is not helpful for these briefs because the size chart does not ask for hip measurements . It assumes that the bust and waist are proportioned to the hips and mine are not . My size in these ended up being XXL and I have never worn anything bigger than a size Large before . Even then , the leg holes are kind of restricting and I worried about losing circulation to my legs . Haha . I returned all of them and went with different shapewear .	-1
I had flexees panties I previously bought at Costco and was searching for something similar . This particular one was tight , heavier fabric than a panty , and felt more like a girdle . They were not what I was looking for . Bummer.I finally found the ones I wanted . They are number 44450/44154 and come in a 3-pack , but do not appear to be listed on Amazon as of yet . 44450/44154 are sized perfectly by the chart on the package , and are a light-weight panty that holds in the tummy just enough to help without being uncomfortable . Can be worn all day without feeling like you need surgery afterwards .	-1
I have worn Lilyette bras for many years , but every time I go to get a new one , Lilyette is not making the one I like . This has happened twice . Why do you keep changing it ? ? ? The one I got this time fits , but it does not minimize nearly like the old ones .	-1
I ordered this bra because I have one of these already and I love it . It fits well and looks great . So , I ordered another one , but this one does n't fit at all . I 'm not sure why it did n't fit , but when I tried it on , I could n't possible get the hooks together . It felt like the bra was 2 sizes too small . Realizing that there was no way I would ever get it latched , I packed it up and sent it back . maybe I got one that was improperly marked . It 's a shame because I love my other bra , it fits s little snug and keeps the girls in place , plus it looks great .	-1
Not sure whether is it because the cups are too small or too big but the cups do n't fit nicely and there are gaps between the top of the cups and breasts . A pity cos the padding is sufficient and not too thick . Another bra that will stay in my wardrobe	-1
I HAVE YET TO RECIEVE THIS ITEM IT 'S BEEN 4 DAYS PAST THE ESTIMATED ARRIVAL DATE AND I PAID FOR 1 DAY SHIPPING . I WANTED TO WEAR IT FOR MY BIRTHDAY YESTURDAY AND I ENDED UP HAVING TO GO OUT THE DAY OF AND BUY MY OWN AT A STORE NEARBY . I 'M VERY DISSAPOINTED AND I PLAN TO RETURN IT AS SOON AS I GET IT ! IT MAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD BRA BUT IT 'S WORTHLESS IF IT IS N'T DELIVERED ON TIME ! ! ! !	-1
I wanted to wear it under my wedding dress , but this did n't have enough support or coverage for me : (	-1
I ordered my regaular size 34B but the bra would not stay up and felt a full band size too large .	-1
I wear a 36 B and that is what I ordered but it was way to big . Not sure if the Lilyette Strapless will work for me . Will try 34 B next time .	-1
when i hold this item on my hand i told my husband , its cute , is n't ? but after i washed it , and then i put it on , its too big ! ! ! and after wash , the color mix , and then you see the color is awful and the lace area is broken . ca n't you believe it ? i just through it away immediately . so sad .	-1
I ordered the navy/classic and I thought it would be actual lace over backing . The lace pattern is just printed on and it looks pretty silly in person . Also the lace on the top and bottom is pretty low quality .	-1
Great at first but after washing the elastic in the waist shrinks so bad ! I wish they would fix this as the underwear itself is nice and soft and has a little extra padding up front for accidents , what a shame that the waist shrinks up so bad like that after being washed and only on a warm setting too , has these a few months now and disappointing .	-1
I bought two pair of these leggings . I used the sizing chart and was really disappointed by the fact that they were very snug and the rise was two short . I 'm giving them to my daughter who is a little shorter and a size smaller .	-1
My trouble with this boot is it is too tight in the foot and too tight in the calf . Have not been able to wear my boots and have had them a long time .	-1
I was not happy with these boots . They were very cheaply made . They looked cheap . The lace holes did not align , so they were impossibly hard to lace up . They look wonky and floppy on . I was expecting American made quality , but these were cheap .	-1
I returned this - I just could n't get over the feeling that I looked like an old lady wearing these ... They were ok comfortable , but not over the top comfortable where I could have gotten over the fact they did n't look good on me . If they felt more like a supportive slipper , I probably would have kept them .	-1
I bought these last year . I never wore them because the seams are sewn badly , with knots inside and pressing on my foot instead of knots on the outside . The leather also folds inward near the edge . It 's like they are only allowed a certain amount of & # 34 ; thread & # 34 ; and they just have to finish even if it is wrong .	-1
I was excited to try out these cute moccasins , as I loved the other styles of Minnetonka 's I have owned . However , after just 3 days of light wear , the lining of the soles are coming apart . The glue has become gummy and lost its adhesiveness , so I am unable to put the liners back in place . I am very disappointed in this product and I will think twice about buying another pair of Minnetonka 's .	-1
These shoes are 100 % leather , without that nasty fabric or ( worse yet ) plastic lining that so many companies put into their products . They 're called & # 34 ; Soft-T & # 34 ; for a reason : they adapt instantly to your foot . But for that reason , you ca n't expect a lot of wear out of them.Their other drawback is the composition of the sole . I wore them for the first time on a three-block walk to and from the market , and it had begun to rain by the time I left the market . These soles are very slick on wet surfaces , and down I went , opening up both knees . The shoes will therefore be usable in the Pacific Northwest , where I live , only in the non-rainy half of the year.Too bad . I like the look and the feel , but they are n't safe .	-1
Purchased the shoe in Gunsmoke . No wide sizes so bought medium . Shoe fit allright . Did not enjoy the quality of the leather , it was really tough and hard and just very low quality . Have had Merrell 's before , wore them out , wanted the same thing again . Quality has really gone down . I feel like I should have stockpiled stuff from 10 years ago , it was way better quality for the same price . I do n't recommend this product . At all . Sorry , Merrell . We have to part ways here , I guess . It was good while it lasted .	-1
These shoes look really nice , fit nice , feel great on the feet . So , what is the problem ? DEFECT IN MANUFACTURE - the rubber sole on one shoe developed a light spot , this became a & # 34 ; blister & # 34 ; very quickly , blister broke open , large hole and long , jagged tears grew from each side . ONLY WORN INSIDE - I returned these and will not buy this brand again .	-1
I was excited to finally get a 'grown-up ' pair of sheepskin slippers , but when I got these , slipped my socks off and put them on , I immediately noticed a problem - too much cold air flow around the neck of the slippers and across my ankles . I thought about putting a single lace in the top to hold the flaps up and then thought heck no , not for this price . So back they went , and I ordered a pair of Uggs Classic Mini , hands-down the winner in the warm-boot/slipper contest .	-1
Ordered my & # 34 ; normal size & # 34 ; and they are just 1/2 to a full size and width too small . Maybe it 's just Sebago . Bought replacements at a b & m store ... THEY fit fine .	-1
I own quite a few boat shoes and this is definitely the worst.They are so bad they 're unwearable.These feel like your wearing dry plastici returned these and was so upset with how Sebago has fallen	-1
I am disappointed because I got a bigger number . In size info description was a U.S. number 10.5 = 43-44 EU , but i got 44.5 EU , and they are to high for me . Something is wrong with the numbers , and make sure when you order .	-1
AGAIN , ,THEY ARE CUT TO LARGE , , ,	-1
Unless you are Ed Norton cleaning sewers , these are not for you . They are stiff and lacking any sense of style .	-1
I 've ordered these shorts 4 days ago and they still ca n't seem to get it shipped out of their warehouse . Do n't bother with this buy them from your local store . Who knows when I will receive them .	-1
I have purchased many Skechers in the past , but I must say this is the first pair I have been disappointed with . They really hurt my feet . I am trying to break them in although I have never had to do this with Skechers before . I CAN NOT wear them to work so I guess I will just wear them around the house . I suggest another kind of Skechers for people on their feet throughout the day . I do NOT like them !	-1
The footbed and insole were noticeably uneven , as you can feel that the heel padding was very pronounced under the foot . The insole is very thin under the ball of the foot without any padding there at all.The heel seems to be way too high , these shoes had a very noticeable 1.5 inches of heel height . As I am 6 foot tall , I do n't need any heel lift , I think this may have been a mislabeled production run of the platform shoes version . Actually made me feel self conscious about the extra height since it was so obvious.The sizes are a full size too large , I will try re-ordering a 10.5 and I wear a 11.5 normally . These shoes are also kinda heavy.i put some different insoles from a pair of skate shoes and the ball of the foot felt much better , and the footbed felt more level as if the heel height was n't so pronounced . For an expensive shoe like this , I should n't have to replace the insole to achieve proper cushioning or to make the shoe feel better.The tongue has very little padding and should be 1/2 inch longer . I do like the quality construction and materials and the subtle `` formal skate shoe '' looks though . Would prefer if they changed the D rings to actual eyelets instead , as i like to keep my laces loose , and D rings kinda look cheesy , hopefully my pants will cover them up though .	-1
Ordered a medium width . Much too large in the heel area.For a walking shoe not very flexible and shoes seemed to be very heavy.Quality of workmanship was excellent.Shoes were returned to Amazon with no problem .	-1
The shoes are good and they fit as expected , but I asked for a colour and they sent me one I did n't want nor like .	-1
These are very comfortable shoes . I had to run to catch a bus in these and they felt pretty good for a dressy shoe.But , they look fake . Not in a horrible way , but enough for a 2 star rating.I can see situations where this shoe might be perfect . Say you work in a restaurant and need something that looks dressy but is super comfortable , this would be a great choice.I was hoping for something very basic and versatile but stylish . This is a comfortable and inexpensive shoe , but the price really shows . Maybe the cap toe makes that worse . Do n't know .	-1
the back of this shoe looks different than the one in the photo.it 's too low cut . my heel is almost coming out the back.after trying them on i know i 'll be wearing a hole in my sock in the heel area .	-1
Tried two pairs of Docker Gordon in Cordovan and was very excited to get them at a great price , but unfortunately both pairs were extremely uncomfortable . The top cap was digging into my foot and the shoe felt cheap and I could tell it would not last very long under daily use . They were very narrow for D Medium labeled shoes . They look great and are available at a great price , but they very uncomfortable and cheaply made . Avoid .	-1
I 've always wore 10.5 wide shoes , so I ordered these the same way . Not only did the top part hurt the joints of my toes , the 'wide ' style shoes were tight on my feet .	-1
I purchased the Cordovan . Walked about 30 ft around the house and the leather/finish where your feet bend already showed signs of extensive wear/cracking . This is not the normal breaking-in wear . I own other Dockers shoes and this never happened to them . The order was returned to Amazon as defective .	-1
I ordered a U.S. size 11 . I 've been wearing size 11 for over 30 years . I liked the shoes , but when I put them on they were obviously not a correct size 11 . My toes felt like they were pushing through the front . I would have exchanged them for a larger size , but since I do n't know this brand , I was afraid the next size would actually be accurate to the proper size , which would have been too large . I did n't want to risk walking around with shoes like Goofy ... Too bad . Back to square one . No more online shoe purchases .	-1
I bought this pair in a 10 medium . They looked good and felt good on my feet . However , as other reviewers have said , the soles wear out fast within a couple of weeks ! I do n't recommend these shoes.Dockers needs to strengthen the soles .	-1
This shoes have great leather quality but they do not have any lining at all . It 's impossible to wear these shoes in the mountains , in the snow or just in the freezing weather . I wish I knew this before I bought them .	-1
I got these boots 1 months ago and refused to wear them due to them being so hard . These boots are literally harming my feet . I am hurting every night when I come home and you can see where they are harming my feet , they wo n't bend at all . Breaking them in is n't the answer , I have tried everything . If the seller could have stated if these boots had any give to them would have been helpful . Really wish they had been like the old ones .	-1
Sorry , everyone thinks the & # 34 ; lifetime & # 34 ; warranty is worth the money . I didnt have any luck with that . and maby luck was the key ?	-1
I really wanted to like these . I 'm wondering if there was a design change , because they were strangely narrow . I have wide-ish feet , but these were much narrower than standard shoes . They were strange looking , ultra lightweight , and uncomfortable , and did n't seem to have the arch support that Rainbows are known for .	-1
I had to return said flip flops . I was going to wear them around the house to stretch , but I did not want to hurt my feet . I can wear Chaco and Keen flip flop with no problems . It 's too bad they looked like great flip flops .	-1
These flip flops do not fit true to size . They run small not in the length but in the arch . Buying a larger size would make them too long but might not increase the size of the arch .	-1
I ordered a pair for my spouse in his normal size and they were a tad bit to small . so , I went back and ordered the next size up in waist . When they came they were the same waist size as the previous pair but longer . Both pants have the same size for length , so this is n't my ordering mistake . Rather they are several sizes to small !	-1
This is going back . Feels and looks very cheap . I 'm sure it would not last . Not worth trying . Returning . Ok	-1
I ordered a pair of women 's size 6 ( m ) US , they were painfully narrow , was very disappointed , had to return them .	-1
These `` boat '' style shoes are not waterproof though the leather seems to have a water-repellent coating.Why the boat shoes are not waterproof : After about three wearings , the plastic bottoms start to get slightly loose from the leather part in the front.Therefore , if you walk around water or rain , water comes in the front part of the shoe so that the leather footbed under the ball of the foot will be wet . When this occurs , it takes several hours to dry.I have tried the Sperry Authentic Moccasins in both classic white bottom as well as Sahara color and have had the same issue .	-1
Not worth the money . Very thin and poor quality . I would not purchase this again . Delivery was expensive too ! ! ! Seems like it will fall apart easily .	-1
Received these boots and fell in love . Unfortunately , I have to give these boots a low review as , after ordering a size 7 AND size 8 , I had to return them both ! ! ! They are SO cute and well made ( the soles are pretty flat , not a lot of cushion , but that may not matter to many ) . I believe several other reviewers have noted that they run small . That is very true . I got a size 7 and have a slender foot , but could barely get my foot in . Once in , though , I found the foot part to be too small , however the opening did fit over my calf.I returned the 7 for an 8 and will review that when it arrives . I LOVE that Amazon does free shipping/free return ! That 's the ONLY reason I shop online.UPDATE : I received the size 8 a couple days ago . SO disappointed . The foot part fit well enough - it was a bit big , but I wanted enough room to put in an Insole , BUT I could n't get the opening over my calf . I have very average sized calves . I decided to measure the opening and to my surprise it was over an inch smaller than the description . The description says around 13 '' , and the opening was maybe 11.7 '' . It was also just strange that the size 7 opening was ok , but the size 8 was n't . Sadly , I must return them . I then decided to go to the local Nordstrom and buy them there as I could try them on first . I got a size 8 and the foot AND opening fit great ( with an insole ) ! ! !	-1
After reading all good reviews , I bought this pair of shoes . It looked okay and felt okay when I walked around the house . So I wore them today at Legoland all day , and my feet were not very happy at the end of the day . First , I felt the springs on my heels , and my heels became sore in the middle of the day . Second , the sides of my small toes were hurting as well , both feet , by afternoon . I can not figure out why since nothing really felt hard on the side of the shoes , but regardless , they were tender after a long day of walk . It felt like I am wearing a pair of dress shoes when they are supposed to be comfortable walking shoes.I do not understand how $ 100 shoes are made such that I feel the springs on my heels ? I actually felt round shape of springs on my heels . Ca n't you believe it ? The company can not put thick enough padding ? In terms of my small toes , I bought wide shoes . I had enough space on the front so I can not figure out why the side of my toes hurt.I am very unhappy . Since I wore the pair outside for one day , I can not return them , and it cost me $ 100 . It is very expensive shoes to be thrown away after one day of wear.My suggestion : they look okay , but they are not good for walking unless you are perfectly fine walking on dress shoes for all day .	-1
I bought these shoes based on the reviews posted . The reviews I payed attention to were people who worked , and on their feet for more than 12 hours . I thought it sounded great because I have fibromyalgia , and arthritis , and bunions . My one concern was they must be a heavy shoe . But , not based on the reviews I read . Unfortunately , after the 4th hour of work last night my feet were dragging . The shoe is very cushiony , but the shoe is very heavy . The other reviewers said it was not , but with my feet they were a heavy shoe.I am passing on my experience because there was nothing written anywhere about shoes and fibromyalgia . I hope this will help someone else.This is a update , if you have feet problems like myself and have tried everything . Do n't give up . I am spending more than I would have like to on a shoe . But I look at it as a investment for my feet . I knew what I needed was a lighter shoe and cushion . The advice they gave me , is alot of people with my problem buy a running shoe.I ended up buying Asic Sneakers . The shoe has lots of cushion , and is flexible and a light shoe . I wore them for the first time last night . The test was after four hours . My gosh , it was wonderful not to be limping out the door at work . I even did not wear my orthotics . Can you imagine if I wore them what a difference that would be . I would check out Asics website , and do some research of your own , then go to amazon and check out some of the reviews . For the first time , I can walk out the door . I will always have slight pain , no matter what . The Asic Cumulus ( like the cloud ) shoe did make a difference . The pain is not as intense and throbbing . Before the Asics , and I tried the Spiras , It was so bad that it took about 4 days of not working to relieve the pain . I could n't sleep because the pain was so intense . But , now my pain is still there but tolerable . But , if I wore the orhotic which I plan to tonight , I am curious to see how I will feel after 8 hours . The only drawback is the shoe , colors are made for runners . Realize the color allows people to see runners at night . So , the colors are are very bright and youthful . But , I will say , GET OVER IT ! ! As long as my feet do n't hurt I do n't care what color it is.One other mention after this review , another shoe I recommend is called the Orthoheel . I never thought I would not wear sneakers at work . But , I find them the best shoe for my feet lately .	-1
Great except for one very important problem : They do n't flex at all in the toe region . I wore them around the house and my first MTP joints started smarting after about an hour . Toe flexibility is very important ! I returned them without any problems there , and that 's why I 'm giving them two stars .	-1
The fabric is not soft at all . I hope to soften it with multiple washings . However , it is true to size and well made .	-1
Bought for my mom ... Picture does not do justice ... it looks rather tacky . Colors are bright and all out there , dress is uncomfortable and transparent in the sunlight ... though with all those colors you can wear you red undies.She did n't return it but I know she did n't like it .	-1
Very cheap , inferior material . Like a $ 5 scrub top . Very disappointed . I 'm definitely sending this back and will never buy from National . Sorry , but this is pathetic . The picture looks like it has some body to it . Like it kinda flows , but really it is just lifeless and really ugly . The worst purchase I have made with Amazon and I have made many . The price is low but ugly is ugly . I hate to be negative and I feel bad for my bluntness but I ca n't believe they send this out .	-1
You get what you pay for . Ordered usual size of 1X . Way too short , esp . now that it 's shrunk . But very lightweight and colorful .	-1
The earrings I received did not resemble the ones from the picture on this web site . The very bottom bead in the picture is a very pretty pink-ish color and that 's what I was looking forward to when I ordered these . Well , the earrings I recieved had more green on the bottom bead than pink . I did n't like the fact that there was more green than pink and I did n't think it was worth returning them so I literally got out a bottle of pink nail polish and just painted them the shade that I wanted . Was n't what I expected but you get what you pay for .	-1
I was hoping for a longer than 'above the knee ' cargo short that was adequate quality and didnt break the bank . These shorts size run on the large size so if youre on the edge of a size , err on the smaller side.Also , these are manufactured by Rothco if that matters to you . I find that I return 90 % of Rothco stuff for lack of quality so I stopped ordering anything by that brand . If it said ANYWHERE in the description that these are Rothco I wouldnt have ordered . Pics posted .	-1
Very nice looking , and the illusion of being slim ... but the clasp started undoing itself within a year . Yes , suddenly the watch would almost fall off my hand . Replaced it with a model with leather strap , but one day the crystal just ... cracked ! For no reason . Skagen is junk .	-1
I was very disappointed when I received this watch . The picture of the watch looks much better than the watch that I received looks , the band and case are dull and the blue face is not nearly are bright or reflective as shown in the picture . Also , the clasp on the watch band seems to be poorly designed as it comes off or opens quite easily and unexpectedly . It is a very thin and very light watch , but I am almost afraid to wear it for fear that the clasp will open and the watch will fall off . The crown also feels very rough and flimsy . Not impressed with this watch at all and would definitely would not have purchased it had I seen in person first .	-1
I can not comment on the watch itself because I returned it after trying it on . The problem is with the band . Where the wrist strap is attached to the watch the band is not flexible . As a result the band sticks out on both sides of the watch making it difficult for a shirt cuff to pass over it and making it unsightly and easily knocked or caught . It would be fine on anyone with a broad wrist but not on an average or smaller wrist.Pity . I spent a long time looking for a watch I liked and this seemed to fit the bill because it has a pleasant blue face with white fingers etc which are clearly seen .	-1
This is a very attractive , thin , and lightweight watch with an unusual fold-over clasp that holds the metal mesh braclet together . I have worn the watch four times . Each time the clasp has opened up and the watch has fallen to the ground . I have had the watch longer than 30 days so Amazon will not give me a full refund.One of these days it will fall off and disappear.02 02 2011*************UPDATE************Since I am stuck with this watch , I worked harder to see if I could get the clasp to work better . I did.The main issue seems to be getting the inner clasp locked properly . Unfortuneately , every thing is the same color ( black ) and it is difficult to see the prongs and the small bar that they fit over . My new process is to lay my arm on a desk under a strong light so that I can see the prongs and the bar and then seat them correctly . After that , close the outer clasp . A bit of a nusance and impossible without the strong light.Nice looking watch though.03/09/2011************ another update***********watch fell off again . This time inside my sleeve . Be careful with the clasp ! 05/10/2011	-1
the product is good , the ad said that the band was actually titanium and it is not , it saddened me a bit .	-1
Not sure what problem is same size marked in shoe and on box as my Keds I have but would not fit . As always Amazon gave me no problem with the return ! !	-1
I was n't looking for a good walking shoe , just a specific look ; ( surprisingly hard to find simple plain blue sneakers ) . Since newer reviews seemed generally positive , I thought I would take a shot . Unfortunately , these are n't acceptable even for light use . Very tight and feel like cardboard . Note : I purchased the navy . The description says `` soft terry lining '' which these do n't have . BUT if you look at the different colors shown you will see that some colors DO have a terry lining ( red for example ) while others ( navy , black , denim ) clearly do n't . I am assuming that the positive reviews are for those colors constructed as described . Sending these back .	-1
I bought these shoes in black to match my work uniform only to receive them in the mail to discover that they are super narrow . It 's like these shoes are designed for rabbits or something . Thankfully amazon has very easy returns . If you decide to buy these shoes online try them on first , or read the return policy .	-1
I bought these in both white and stone . I really like the stone , as it does n't seem to stand out as much as the white . Also , it 's a nice change from white all the time . My mom liked the stone color when she saw mine , so I ordered a pair for her as well.We 've noticed there is a change in the way Keds have been made since the 90s . They are not as comfortable . The arch can be `` bumpy '' or nonexistent , and they run a little small . I wear a size 8 , and the stone pair are tight on me . Tighter than the white for some reason . I 'm sure they will get better as they break in , but I 've never had a pair of Keds that is this tight . My feet actually hurt the first day I wore them . That never happened to me with Keds . And I have narrow feet . Someone with a wider foot could n't wear these comfortably , at all . The sneakers also do n't last as long as they used to . I wore Keds a lot when I was in high school , and one pair would last me a long time . Now , I notice the edges at the bottom of the shoes start to come apart with much less wear , and the footbed becomes very flat and uncomfortable . They do n't feel as cushiony as they used to , even when brand new . Very different . Wearable , and I like them , but they are not as good as they used to be . I suspect they were not made in China a decade+ ago . I think they are made smaller than they used to be , because even looking at my feet while wearing them , I noticed they make my feet look smaller . I like that , but , not at the expense of comfort . I might try an 8 1/2 next time . The white fit better for some reason , not so small.Update : I wanted to add what happened in my experience with the stone colored sneakers . I am downgrading this review from 4 stars to 2.They were very tight at first . I thought I had broken them in because they felt better . However , after wearing them several times , I noticed that my small toenails had started to turn inward a little . I have never had foot problems in my life , and I am sure that this happened to my nails from the tight Keds . I have not worn them since and will not wear them again . I will probably throw them away . I went back to wearing my old white pair on days I want to wear Keds.I 'd recommend if you try them , make sure you try them on right away and if they feel at all too small , send them back .	-1
The quality of KEDS has deteriorated sooo much recently . This pair was terrible . Extremely stiff , terrible material , and the support was non existent . I wore them for a week , and because of the quality , I lost feeling in my big toe for almost a month . The tightness of the shoe at the top damaged a nerve in my toe . Also , after that happened , I bought shoe stretcher in the hopes of wearing them comfortably , but not even the shoe stretcher helped . I cant return the shoes any more because I wore them constantly trying to break them in , but I will never buy KEDS again . And I threw out the pair that I did buy . I would look around for another shoe brand , KEDS are not the same as they used to be .	-1
If you order these Keds sneakers today you will NOT be getting the same sneaker that has reviews from a year or more ago . Believe me , they are entirely different.Well , darn . As an almost life-long Keds wearer I can say with some authority that what I received are NOTHING like any pair of Keds sneakers I 've ever had before.Previously there was at least light arch support even in the most basic of their sneaker styles , this pair has none . The sole is stiff and clunky , the canvas fabric is thin and poor quality and they are in general , junk . No quality of any kind left in this previously reliable brand.My usual size in these is a 7 and that has always been 100 % comfortable and a perfect fit when worn with a pair of sport socks . This pair is saggy and baggy on top even when tied and the sides bagged out too.They WILL be going back.Save yourself time and aggravation and pass these by .	-1
For many years , I 've worn this type of shoe . I always bought the cheaper ones , not wanting to spend the money for Keds . They always washed up nice and I could get at least three summers out of them . NOT THESE ! ! I washed them ONCE , by hand , with laundry soap and a little bleach . They 're more yellow than white . I 'm VERY disappointed - I finally decide to spend the money on some & # 34 ; quality & # 34 ; canvas shoes and get ripped off . They look terrible , the entire top and sides of them are yellow . I 've washed them in just plain laundry soap and water , bleach and water , rinsed them in just water , used Sneaker Whitener . NOTHING WORKS . I will buy the & # 34 ; cheap & # 34 ; but QUALITY ones this coming summer and skip the Keds . I guess they 'd be okay in colors , but I always liked white , with a tan and summer clothes , they would go with anything . Time to also send Keds an email now that I 've found the details of my purchase . VERY disappointed .	-1
These shoes dont fit very well and are awkward to walk in . Not like shoes I bought from them a few years ago that fit well and were very comfortable to walk in . Cant say what wrong except they are cheaply made and feel like it . Very disappointed but will keep to wear around the house .	-1
I bought several of these kind of shirts but for some reason , this color , even after 1 wash in cold water , and low dried in the dryer , it always fade near the collar . I bought a second one and the same thing happened.I would not buy this color again . The other color seems to stay put although one of the lighter green shirt is now experience the color fade as this one .	-1
I feel that its a little to big and it seems extremely long . If I wear this shirt I 'm forced to tuck it in or else it looks like I 'm wearing a dress . Next time I 'd rather spend a little extra for a name brand shirt because I know it wont be crazy long on me .	-1
I am not quit 5 foot five . These pants are too short for me if I pull them to the waste . Surprising they are so short . Also found one defect in the sewing near the product . I put them on and wore them because I needed them so ca n't consider returning them . The rest of the pants are true to fit , like the three strip shorts , just not long enough .	-1
Horrible bras ever . Makes ur boobs look like cones and so not comfortable which was the main reason I ordered them for comfort . Do not purchase .	-1
This is the only bra that I have gotten through Amazon that did not fit . This is the second time i have been disappointed with a Playtex bra not fitting well . I have ordered several bras from different manufacturers through Amazon and all of them have fit very well and I was able to give them excellent reviews . The interesting thing is the Playtex bra is the same size as the other bras I have ordered .	-1
Well , I was desperate for a bra lately , as I 'm recently pregnant and gaining in size . I saw the reviews on this one , and pounced on it . I 've never worn a comfortable non-underwire bra , so this was a leap of faith for sure . I was disapointed when I tried it on ... first off , it 's super tight around the ribs . I know I 'm a 38 , and that size fits me with any other bra I wear , yet this one has no give whatsoever , and also is worn much further down on the `` ribs '' so I suggest you order up a few inches . I also noticed the material was super scratchy . The straps in the back- the metal adjuster parts DIG into your flesh if you have to twist . The cups give you a triangle look that points unnaturally high and sits strangely high on the chest . It looks just awful under a tee shirt . Then there 's so much material on the top , over the cleavage , that you ca n't wear anything that 's not completely full coverage over it , so it severely limits your outfit choices . Plus the straps are wide , so they 'll show on any tank top , no matter how thick-strapped the tank top may be ... I am NOT a fan . I wore this for 40 minutes and wanted to burn it . I 'm sending it back !	-1
Made my boobs look pointy and the material was itchy . I did like the comfort straps , hopefully I can find that feature in a different bra that works for me .	-1
I tried this particular bra twice , in two different sizes and although I love the color ( the sailor blue ) and the makeup of the straps , the cup is just too pointy and does not seem to contour correctly . This is the only bra that I have experienced this `` overage '' with . I went down a cup size and it did not make a difference ... I just could not get this bra to fit me.I 've tried several washes ( even drying on hot ) to see if a little shrinkage would help . No go . What I am left with is a relatively comfortable bra around the back and shoulders with a cup that has too much fabric in the front and is too pointy for me . Usually not a problem . Unfortunately , this bra has been relegated to the bottom of my drawer and is only used under multiple layers where any kind of wrinkles or gathered material wo n't be visible . I 'm glad I only paid around $ 10 for it.Two tries though and it still did n't work for me .	-1
This actually hurt my armpit and left red marks . The thing is , I 've ordered this bra before and my other ones do n't do this . The cut and the material has changed ! ! ! That 's unfortunate , because I used to love this bra , and just thought that it would be the same as my other ones .	-1
But after I wore it and washed it a few times the inside elastic on the bottom of the bra turned sticky and I ca n't get it to off .	-1
Great fit . Does n't ride up . Comfortable even in my very active job , while offering much needed support . Control in the back for the rolls n lift in the front for the girls : ) After my initial joy came distress . This bra was held together by glue , very cheap glue . Glue that comes apart when I sweat and material that dyes my skin . The bra quickly lost shape with each wash .	-1
The were huge and no support . Probably good for people that do not have huge watermelon boobs . lol , but seriously .	-1
It was to large , but I was able to give it to my daughter and it seemed to fit her swell ?	-1
I really wanted to like this bra as it is very pretty . However , it was extremely scratchy and irritated my skin in several places . I did not like the cone look ! I felt I looked ridiculous . I am big busted so this bra will probably work for those who are smaller . It 's just not for me .	-1
This bra feels good for about the first 2 hours you wear it . Then the band that goes across your rib cage gets bunched up and twisted and it diggs into your skin . I am always having to go into the bathroom and pull it down or readjust during the day . Also the cup is shaped like a cone under your shirt ( SO NOT NATURAL LOOKING AT ALL ) Also the cone shaped cup material ruchees from the nipple up to the arm strap after you have been waering it awhile . This product is not worth your money . Mine went to the goodwill .	-1
I have very ... round breasts , but I 'm a D so I need support . I had the same & # 34 ; pointy & # 34 ; experience - if I loosen the straps I get no support . If I loosen it too much I go from pointy , to saggy material . The edge has this itchy looping to it , the rings are relatively flimsy and all together it looks uncomfortable and poorly made . It is really uncomfortable on me , not to say it would n't work for some people . I think that this bra fits some people that need some & # 34 ; uplifting & # 34 ; but those that may already have it , well , we might as well start vogue-ing . That 's what I did . Got a great laugh out of my husband , then I put it back in the box , and returned it . If I wore it for a day there is no doubt in my mind I would be knocking things off counters and running into stuff with my & # 34 ; torpedoes & # 34 ; . No amount of camisole , t-shirt , or any other outer covering could hide this shape - felt like if I had a vintage dress this bra would have shaped me perfectly , albeit uncomfortably ( as they stuck out so far ... ) as it is , I have no sassy vintage dress to wear this bra with , and I have been fitted recently . This was an utter failure . But I purchased another playtex bra , Playtex Women 's 18 Hour Seamless Smoothing Bra # 4049 , which is an absolute win . If you arent into pointy boob , but you are into support , that one might work for you too . So I guess as they saying goes , you win some , you return some . : )	-1
I felt like my 44D boobs were being herded into industrial-style containers . Wow , it definitely supports them , and they 'd better not ask questions ! ! ! I went around all day feeling like my boobs were 'out there ' , well-managed , and not going anyplace.It 's not something I 'd buy again - it 's just a bit too uncomfortable - like they were stitched from the same material used to make backpacks , but the one I have will probably last a good while.2 stars because it is indeed well-constructed . SOMEBODY at Playtex said , by golly , I wan na design a bra that MEANS it !	-1
The fit is not as expected . The cup is too big and loose . You can see the bad fit through my shirts	-1
Band is unbelievably small , if you have large breasts but have the width of a stick , you should be able to fit into it nicely . Very disappointing . Material is awfully cheap , the knots in the back that hold your straps are plastic ... One good tug and it snaps and breaks .	-1
I do not wear platex bras because they make your best stick out like cones and I hate that . I gave this bra a try because it did not appear to have that cone effect in the picture . I was wrong , my breast stuck out like two triangles ... absolutely hideous so I sent it back	-1
it 's made long on the bottom and keeps rolling up under my breasts ... which aggervates the heck outta me ... love the wide shoulder straps ... if I could only get those with a NORMAL bra ...	-1
I already have the UPS return receipt to send this back for credit . I think there were so many on sale because the sizing was so far off the mark.I wear this size all the time in other bras I buy and this was just huge . Could n't give this one away so I 'm sending it back.Uses to getting good products but NOT this time . Oh well .	-1
When i got this bra i was so happy ... i have been looking for this model for years ... but then when i finally tried it on it was big ... i know my size ( i constantly measure myself ) and i always wear a 38C ... but the cups were so large i can not wear the bra ... so know your size well and maybe contact the company before you buy one	-1
This bra makes my breast feel very pointy like how those long ago bras used to fit and even thou i ordered my correct size d elastic that runs under d breast for d bra us uncomfortable ... ..	-1
This is by far the WORST bra I 've ever tried on . It does n't take me 10 seconds to finally just take them off . It 's uncomfortable . The material is rough . The name and description of this are definitely MISLEADING . I am returning them !	-1
I suppose at age 52 I should have learned by now what makes a bra give you that 60s Fembot pointed bullet breasted look and which bras do not , evidently I have not learned , but have now.It is the seams across the breasts that make you pointy , where a seamless one will give you a much more rounded t-shirt look , which is what I like . Pointy breasts in my humble opinion are not natural looking and I hate how they look sticking out of my shirts . Regrettably I ordered 5 of these , so 2014 will be a very long year as I have nobody to give them to and can not be bothered shipping them back , I only paid 9 bucks each , so will just suck it up and learn from this experience .	-1
These suspenders were not what I was expecting . They are thick and heavy and really quite big . The suspenders are at least an inch to an inch and a half wide . They were also not very comfortable .	-1
The fabric is very cheap quality and seems like it would easily tear . I returned these and got a pair of more comfortable and better quality Wranglers instead .	-1
I only wear Levi 's 550 jeans ( 38x34 ) . I must have about 20 pairs so when I saw them advertised on Amazon for a great price I decided to buy 4 pairs . Well when they arrived I was just going to put them away until I planned to wear them . My wife told me to try them on and it 's a good thing I did because the fit was so totally different from all my other pairs . I was really disappointed and had to return them all . I believe Levi 's has either changed the cut or it 's where they are being made . Nothing negative against Amazon . I order many things from Amazon and will continue to do so . Like I said , I think it 's a Levi issue .	-1
as a man i am speaking frankly . who in the heck would want buttons instead of a zipper . order some from amazon , did not notice til i started to wear-0both pair of them are this button up instead a one button , then a zipper . STUPID , and they cost a lot . need to make clear what it is you are buying .	-1
The Inspector Jeans are ugly . Neither the web page , my wife or I liked them . I returned the jeans and received andother color which was perfect .	-1
When a company like Levi 's , a staple of American society , starts taking the quaility of their merchandise so low that it is this noticable , we are all in trouble . I have 550s from 2 years ago and 550s that I got today and they are sooo far below the quality of material and weight of the previous pair that I thought they were fake . So now where are you supposed to go to get quality jeans ? Sad .	-1
returned these jeans because the did not fit as I would have liked . could had a little more room in the rear	-1
Fit was quite nice , but the center snap/button broke the first time I put them on . I know what you 're thinking -- no , I was not too fat for them ; - ) Maybe this pair was a fluke , but I ca n't help thinking that Levi 's quality is n't what it used to be . I decided to go with a slightly pricier jean , and it 's worked out .	-1
After 2 washing holes have started to appear in the legs . Very , very thin fabric . Think it 's time to stay away from Levis . Definitly do not order them online . The unpredictability of the quality and fit makes it imperative to buy in a store where you can try them on and feel the fabric . I order 3 pair and each one is different in quality and fit . Levi 's has outsourced by buying of their product ; wo n't bother with them in the future .	-1
I ordered these for my boyfriends birthday and ordered the medium stonewashed . I received the regular blue denim . While they fit just fine it 's not what he wanted . When riding a motorcycle all summer the lighter jeans are cooler . Not at all pleased with Amazon fulfillment ! ! !	-1
First , the pair sent had no tags . I 'm not sure if they were worn before.They are size 32x32 Levi 550 . I 've owned 550 's for years going between 31x32 and 32x32.THESE are soo tight . The are more like 30x32 -- what is going on Levi ? ? ?	-1
One good thing I can say , this bag inspired me to shop for a better made wheeled garment bag , it 's a very practical luggage design for me.Better made bags have the zipper in the middle of the side . This one has it in a very exposed and vulnerable outer edge . Add to that how cheaply the zipper is made and you 've got trouble in a vital function of the bag . Mine is broken on the corner making it much harder to use easily.Better made bags have folded-over top edges to protect the zipper and contents . This one has a bare zipper on the top corners . Do you think such a design will hold up to rough handling and bad weather ? It probably won't.Better made bags have a better system of keeping hangers hooked in place at the top . Mine ca n't handle any shifting . It ca n't lock hanger hooks in . I have to make a giant twist tie to keep them in place but that still wo n't hold 20 % of the time.Better made bags have an inner `` skin '' for pockets and divide the folded bag to help keep clothes in place . This bag has no such tidy feature . When you open the bag after a normal or rough usage you never know what is waiting for you , kempt clothes or chaos.Better made bags have a reliable extendable handle that stays up . This one 's handle has poor engineering and cheap materials that inspire no confidence .	-1
First off , this bag is too large to fit in the overhead bin on airplanes . That is the first thing that disappointed me.Second , the bag is very fragile . After the 1st time I checked it a few zippers broke off and the strap on the inside broke.Third , Did I mention it does n't fit in the overhead bin ... ? It is so irritating . You are able to go through security then check it at the counter , but seriously do n't advertise as a carry on when it can not be carried on.I would not recommend this to a friend ...	-1
It is very uncomfortable and very bumpy around the cup . Does n't look good under blouses or t-shirts . I would send it back but I ca n't find the box for it.- Beverly Redd	-1
I received this bra and was very disappointed . The fit is awful , the seam that crosses the cup does n't lay correctly and it 's just ugly on your body.Generally I like playtex bras for everyday wear , but this one is just awful .	-1
The last time I was at my mom 's she had just bought one of these . It looked very comfortable and pretty so I ordered one in my size . I wear a 34D in other brands , but Playtex does n't carry that size , so I buy a 36D and wear it on the tightest hooks . This band seems to run small , the 36 fit me like a 34 in other brands , I could wear it on the last hooks . The cups , on the other hand , run big . The foam lining also makes them a little stiff and pointy , so under a t-shirt it looked like my breasts were aiming off to each side , really not flattering ! A very odd fit , which is too bad because it seems like a comfortable bra .	-1
The name of this bra is a contradiction . Not comfortable , gave me an extra breast and made them sag .	-1
After I was measured I realized I was buying the wrong size Bra so I bought one locally to check out the new size and I loved it . so I ordered this pretty pink one and am so disappointed . It is too large , no support . Not worth the effort to send it back . I donated it to goodwill .	-1
Quality made bra , fits ok. NOT at all like the picture though . Maybe my breasts are just old and saggy ? lol The band just rides up under my breasts ( size 40B ) and imagine the rest . If you 're looking for a bra that fits ok and does n't hide nipples through clothing , then this one would do . I 'm too old and modest , so I 'll just wear this around the house and for gardening ... .. ; )	-1
I thought the straps were too long to give me the uplift i needed however the cups fit great so i wish it would have worked	-1
this is not what I was expecting form Playtex and what they claim , I am not happy with this its not comfy as I thought	-1
Ordered 3 - will return . Cups wrinkle and bag out in top half and this is ridiculous looking . ALSO : Playtex straps tend to be considerably shorter than other brands , so watch out - I could not get these to extend far enough to & # 34 ; fit well & # 34 ; . It just added insult to injury . Used to adore Playtex and still worship Style 4707 but it does n't come in enough colors .	-1
This was not a very supportive bra . It also felt uncomfortably tight in some areas and too loose in others . This is always my size so that is n't the issue . Not keen on this one . I	-1
Way too scratchy for me . The band was scratchy , the straps scratchy , the cups alittle too big . Returned it . I wear Playtex alot so I am dissapointed .	-1
I did not like the fabric . It just looks very cheap , too white and shiny . I do give credit to the support . I guess its good for someone who wants good support without wires . Like the wide straps .	-1
I chose this rating because this bra was to large in the cup and it has no padding at all in it.you can see through it .	-1
This product was way too small . It was my normal size and I could n't even fit it around me . I was so disappointed . This is the brand I have been buying for years and this was n't even close to fitting .	-1
I bought this bra because it looked study and seemed it would hold up well ; it does n't . The material is flimsy , the underwire bunches in the middle at the top and pokes out , the cups were too big in the front and came up short on the sides . Not worth the price . Why two stars ? I liked the color .	-1
i have been a pretty standard 36c for many years . i ordered this with two others . this one was the only one that did not fit . It was 35 % cheaper than the other two , but , it just seemed off . cup size was too full	-1
For a `` comfort '' bra this was very uncomfortable ! I usually wear a 36 to 38D but this one in 38D was very tight around the band and also itchy . This was even on the last hook . I do n't usually wear Playtex so maybe the sizing is different -so it 's back to Victoria 's Secret for me . I was really hoping for a comfortable and supportive bra that did n't add anything - not so easy to find .	-1
The bra has no support at all for an underwire bra , will not buy this bra again . Use to lounge around house , can not wear under good clothing because no support .	-1
I ordered this because it was the cheapest 34DD I could find on here . I was trying to figure out which size I should be wearing . I 'm glad I only bought this as a practice because it 's the ugliest bra I 've ever owned . The picture is misleading . The straps are ridiculously big with NO room for adjustment - well , maybe about 3 '' of strap which is nothing if you 're tall - I 'm on the short side so no big deal but for anyone that needs more room - do n't get this bra.And it abslolutely gave me cone boobs . I think I just missed the worst of it but anyone bigger than my size is going to have a problem . It was n't just cone-age - it separated my boobs so badly that it looked like they were trying to run away from each other . I wore this bra for a total of 24 hours ( and wore heavy sweatshirts all day so no one could see my weird boobs ) then got my butt pronto to my local mall and purchased much better bras in my new correct size.Yuck . Ugly bra , ugly fit - just stop now - put it away ! !	-1
A PIECE OF GARBAGE . it is paper thin and it is hard . YOU CAN SEE THROUGH IT . just plain crap . I am sorry I wasted a few bucks on this . and it is made in china . DO NOT BUY .	-1
Some slimy material . Unable to wear . It is AWFUL . How can it be advertised as cotton when it is NOT ?	-1
Serviceable , but not soft like a real cotton bandana . Color is good , and did not fade after a hot wash and dry	-1
the fabric is very rough and hard . the bandanna also is not as big as I thought it would be . the color is good though	-1
I 've had mine for several months now and I love it . Do n't be fooled by the low price . It 's just the perfect balance of soft leather and protection from drops and scratches . It looks very good , too . My only problem is I lost it somewhere while I was shopping . - it must have come out of my jacket pocket and I did n't notice it until I got out to the parking lot . Fortunately my glasses were on my face at the time . I just now ordered another and ca n't wait until it arrives.Update : I have downgraded my rating for the product and the manufacturer of it . I received the second one and I liked it , too . Then I recently ordered a third for my sunglasses . It came with a broken hinge which holds the metal spring closure together on the edges . It was totally separated and makes the case unusable . I immediately initiated a return request through Amazon and I got a reply from Amazon that the seller had closed the request . I wondered if that meant they had approved it or not , but I guess the answer was `` not '' . I have received no other communication . Well , it 's just ten bucks down the tube but that 's shoddy quality and a lousy customer service attitude on the part of the seller . I had been happy to buy from a USA manufacturer but I guess that does n't necessarily mean `` high quality '' anymore . Just be aware there 's a chance you 'll get a piece of junk and if you do then you 're likely stuck with it . My other two cases are still okay , but they turned a loyal and referring customer against them on this one .	-1
Not for me . The lenses were not pink at all . More of a purpley mauve color and also very dark . Looked like Dollar store glasses . Returned for a pair of brown gradient lenses . Really liked the style , just not the lens color . Ordered the 55mm . Fit nicely Recommend , just not the pink .	-1
As a retired pilot , I have worn Rayban sunglasses since 1956 . I have purchased an estimated and used approximately 20 pair since that time . Over that time period , these glasses have served me well.In the past the Rayban carrying case that is out of necessity worn on my belt , used an interior hard shell encased in a ersatz leather case that was robust and withstood the rigors of daily wear and tear . However , the current case is appears chintzy and has no reinforced interior shell . As a result the case often rips loose because of their very inferior quality of material and design currently used in their manufacter . Shame on you Rayban !	-1
This is my second pair . The first pair were damaged , the Rayban box they came in was damaged , but not the outside box . I returned them and am still awaiting my refund.Immediately after returning these I ordered a second pair and they had the same defect , ( nose pads/fit could n't adjust/loose sloppy fit ) so I took them to two local opticians and was told the same thing . They pointed out issues normally associated with pirated items , such as the screws holding in the stems were of different colors/length , polarization not strong , glue residue where it should never be , different box than the model the glasses came in , damage in the glasses and inside boxes but the outside shipping boxes were undamaged and clean .	-1
I was so excited to received my sunglasses to have a big disappointment . This sunglasses look like I hit them at the convenient store got $ 5.00 . Do n't waste your money . What a disappointment . I does n't even look like a rayban . I had to sent them back .	-1

Thought I was getting the normal large size aviator glasses but these lens were so small they were no way near my cheek .	-1
Do n't love . It 's too neutral . I 'm wearing do not feel beautiful . Even my friends all say it is not pretty at all . God . I just ca n't stand it . Now completely idle , it is a waste of my money . Preferably a woman wearing glasses . Then the page . This can be more intuitive to see the woman wearing this interesting .	-1
With most shoes I fit size 11 just fine but with these the shoe was so small and tight I had to return them . I do n't like the fact you have to go up a size and get a wider length , these shoe companies should be smart enough to know an eleven inch foot ( heel to toe ) should be comfortable in a size 11 shoe .	-1
I 'm a minimalist wallet kind of guy . I was looking for something to hold about ten cards ( credit/ID/medical ) and a few bills . And I wanted them all to be easy to access . The wallets I 've found so far are either too bulky or require bills to be carefully folded . Once I placed a couple of cards in this wallet , getting bills in and out of the center fold was nearly impossible.I designed and made my own duct-tape wallet which works perfectly and which will have to suffice until I can find a more durable ( and classy ... ) leather equivalent .	-1
This may be the perfect 3/4 pant . This is not a capri pant in the way women have capri pants . They are looser and shorter than most women 's styles . They have an adjustable waist that will get smaller a few inches from its maximum size by gathering up the waist in the back left and right sides , but not larger . They will look fine on any man . In fact the `` street wear '' long shorts that are popular in big cities are longer than these are . For me the problem is I am a true 31 '' waist and these are made in China , probably by people who do n't get paid to care and be consistent . Within the same color , style and size there can be up to two inches of waist difference between two pair ( eg . Some size small had at 32 '' waist and some had a 30 '' waist ; Some medium would not go down to a 31 '' waist ) . That left me constantly returning and re-ordering sizes medium and small to finally find the color and quantity I wanted . When it was all said and done , of the pants that fit me some were size small , and some were size medium , but all were about the same fit . That is very poor quality control in a pant that fits with sizing like XS 23 '' -27 '' , S 27'-31 '' , M 31 '' -35 '' , L 35 '' -39 '' , XL 39 '' -43 '' . If you are a waist size in in the middle of a given size range , I would expect these pants would be perfect . If you are on the line between two sizes , I wish you luck and watch the sellers return policy .	-1
I 'm a big boy , 4x should have covered me with some room . Was so tight I couldnt even sit down . Material is very light weight , in the light I could see through the camo shorts . Probably would not have held up many washes ... Very disappointed with this order ! I shall continue to search for the perfect `` fat guy '' clothes !	-1
Had used regular ones -- but saw these instead -- so decided to try . Did not like it . ( Not sure why I need to enter sooo many words ) .	-1
Was not impressed . I regularly purchase from Lipo in a box and decided to give these a try instead . Nope not impressed at all ! Will go back back to my normal trusted brand that has far more control , better quality and at least I know it is not a waste of money like these were ! ... .Sorry no thumbs up from me !	-1
I had high hopes that this garment would help with my muffin top issues . It does seem to smooth out the problem areas , but it wo n't stay up at ALL ! It started rolling down the instant I put it on . Will sadly have to return .	-1
I am returning this mostly because it was thicker that I was envisioning . The product is a good example of & # 34 ; you get what you pay for. & # 34 ; The embossing was crooked and the cover was not squared at the corners .	-1
Heck this belt holds nothing up much less your pants ! It goes on and on i can wrap it around my waist 3xs maybe more my arms got tired of wrapping so i just gave up ... maybe if your 300lbs plus you can get a size small .	-1
It looks like a beautiful belt . However I wore it once and when I put it on the second time it fell apart near the leather loop and buckle . I will exchange it for another as it got very good reviews .	-1
Belt was much larger than I expected it to be . The quality of the belt was good but the measurements shown were not correct .	-1
As others reported -- the padding on the bottom goes flat within days . I had difficulty keeping them on my feet if I did n't take the time to scrunch my foot ALL the way in ( meaning I could n't just slip them on and run off ) , and the soles are NOT non-skid ( though pretty sturdy , I felt comfortable stepping outside in them ) . Also they 're so fuzzy on the inside , it traps all the dirt and grossness off my feet and they get stinky within a couple days , and I ca n't wash them that often ( they have to dry overnight ) .All in all , a disappointment . I plan to try a ballet-style slipper next .	-1
I am updating my review because they fell apart completely already ! I have had my old Isotoners for 5 years and they finally got to having to be replaced . Unfortunately these did not even last 5 months ! I bought 5 pairs from different vendors and they are all falling apart , so the problem obviously is with Isotoner not the dealers . I guess in the five years Isotoners quality has really gone dramatically down . I am terribly disappointed , I am disabled and have lots of problems with my feet , Isotoner has always been the only slipper that would stay on my feet . I have no clue what I am going to do now.IIn closing I would tell potential buyers to buy another brand ... every single pair I bought a few months ago are falling apart and most are not even wearable anymore . My apologies to the seller , I have no problem with the seller ... but I would tell the seller to drop this line or at least confront the manufacturer .	-1
Fit except they stretched easily and flop if not wearing socks . Also , if not socks it 's necessary for her to clench her toes to be sure they stay on . Would n't buy again .	-1
Taking off my shoes and slipping into comfy slippers is one of the little things in life I look forward to each day . Unfortunately , with these slippers , I am now dreading putting them on each evening . They were somewhat comfortable at first , but after two weeks of wear , the cushiony insole is all squished down , and not providing much cushion any more . But the worst thing about these slippers is the hard rubber sole which makes them extremely noisy when I walk on my hardwood and tile floors ! I usually get to bed at least an hour after my husband , and he has actually asked me to PLEASE go out and buy new slippers because I wake him up each time I walk through our bedroom ! ! Yes , I suppose you can wear them outside , but I have had other & # 34 ; indoor/outdoor & # 34 ; slippers which are n't as hard bottomed , and therefore do n't sound like I 'm walking around in tap shoes ! ! It may sound silly , but I just feel like part of the joy of slippers is to be able to quietly pad around the house..not a concept in this pair .	-1
I wore these slippers daily because I live with fibromyalgia and do not get outside much . After 3 months they have completely flattened , stretched out and the heels wore down . I thought they might last longer than 3 months . I weigh about 135 lbs . so I do n't think weight is a factor . Very DisappointedLowered my rating even more when I noticed the stiching came lose today . I have another pair of Isotoner Clog slippers that were a gift and they only lasted 3 months . I will be writing to Isotoner for what that 's worth .	-1
I bought these slippers in January 2014 and they are already trashed . When I first got them they were very comfortable and I was satisfied . Little by little , they got worse and worse . Now it feels like there is only a thin piece of material between my feet and the floor . They are also stretched out so they flop around a bit . I spend very little time at home and I never wear slippers outside . Very cheap slippers.I had faith in Isotoner and the quality of their product . Boy was I wrong . I am currently wearing the slippers that I thought were worn out , which is why I bought the Isotoners . If anyone out there knows of a slipper that will support my tired feet , please share the information .	-1
my shoe size is perfect 7. i thought 7/8 would work , considering it should fit size 8 as well , but ... this is more like size 6.5 , felt very snug plus it was too short in the back too . victoria 's secret is doing a promo for free slippers for all pj purchase , so i 'm getting those instead since i need some pjs as well . i think the sole is quite comfortable , however i think all the color options are ugly , so is the design . the clog part is the only good part . i 'd think about purchasing it if they had leopard or zebra print , or tan color , something more flattering . also i dont like the fabric . but maybe i feel that way because of the odd color ...	-1
These fit good when you first put them on and then they stretch and get too big . Very strange indeed , I cant even keep them on my feet	-1
Like other reviewers I found these to be too narrow for tapered slip on shoes . They do n't stretch as advertised . Size may be good for 13 certainly not large enough for size 14 feet . Returned the product	-1
this bra is not sturdy . if you 're a stripper or using it as a costume for some other purpose it 'll be fine . if you expect it to support you and be wearable as a sexy undergarment ... it wont be very comfortable for one , clothes dont lie smoothly over ANY of my clothes ( which are not tight , or clingy or thin fabrics , for the most part ) i got it in a 36D and even without the removable pads i was spilling out of it.i did n't like it , i would n't recommend it , and i wo n't buy anything else made by this company .	-1
Adidas is one of my favorite brands . Usually I buy directly from the Adidas website , but these caught my eye because of the cheaper price . First of all , they did not fit well . They were much too big for the Medium that I chose , these bagged out in strange areas , I was swimming in them . I compared these pants to the ones that I purchased right from Adidas and these appear to be a poor counterfeit . The stripes on these pants are not the same quality , nor are they sewn on the pants as they are on the originals . Do n't buy these ! ! I believe they are not a true Adidas product . They are made in Thailand and I am convinced these are fake . I have ripped them up and am using them for dust rags ! Expensive dust rags !	-1
I like my pants really long , and these are not long at all . I was so excited since other reviews and the picture show them as being long , but nope ... I just measured the inseam and the small is 31 inches . Bummer .	-1
Crotch blew out after a week . Luckily I 'm handy with a needle and thread . Other than that they seem like decent material .	-1
Worked well for decorating as an ugly Team USA Costume by Ralph Lauren . It is comfortable and fits to size . It DOES NOT HAVE POCKETS , which is annoying . Well , you get what you pay for . It 's cheap .	-1
Cheap price , cheap quality . As expected I suppose ... My big issue is that there are NO POCKETS ( WTF ? ! ) and the elastic on the bottom is INCREDIBLY tight .	-1
I ordered an XX-Large , and they lookd liked a size medium -- -very , very small , especially considering sweats are generally loose and baggy at any size . I do n't know if they were mislabeled or what , but I sure would n't order again . Too much hassle to return so I just gave them away .	-1
This shirt is of poor quality and the fabric is , I do n't know how to explain it , not what I have come to expect . The shirt does n't hold its shape and the wrinkling is terrible .	-1
I ordered this item in `` yellow '' to get our 7 week old son through the summer . I thought the shorts would be bright yellow , orange , and green to coordinate with many of the clothes he has . When they arrived , I saw they were dull colored and ugly , with shades seemingly inspired by various forms of vomit . If you 're looking for something cute , look elsewhere or at least do n't get the yellow . I returned them so can not comment on size .	-1
I thought it would be great to get slip-on chucks , but these are imposible ! i struggled for sooooo long each time i tried to put them on because the stitching comes up pretty high and decided to cut them a bit . Good idea , but did n't help at all . ended up chucking the chucks . boo	-1
returning these , I received infant shoes . too much work trying to figure out the sizing so I am going to go into a store and try on sneakers instead .	-1
What was I thinking buying Lee ? Maybe it was the price . The right size . Must have been out of my mind.These jeans , if they can be called jeans , are cheap and flimsy compared to Levis . I work in the field and industrial environments and these jeans just did n't hold up . From the odd pocket designs to the absurd Lee logo which serves as a belt loop to the flimsy quality of the denim ( i hope it is denim ) , these jeans have been epic failures all around.I would have rated them lower but they , technically , still function to protect my legs.Results of wearing these jeans into the field ? Holes , tears , snags , and rips . They might be ok for casual wear ... but if you are looking for a high-quality pair of jeans that will last , look elsewhere .	-1
The waistband on these clacks is so tight ... ... no give . Which can look great , but honestly the button was stitched on so tightly , that neither of us can even get the button hooked even when not wearing the pants ! The button is not far enough away form the waistband material to even loop it into the button hole . VERY disappointed . These are fine looking pants . They would be great , but I do n't think getting a larger size would help . You just ca n't put them on .	-1
Very difficult to buy pants without seeing them , these had very wide bottoms , like boot cuts ... Sorry I had to return them .	-1
They wrinkle , the material has an unusual feel to it . The size is small and when you buy a relaxed fit you do not expect stretch pants .	-1
Obvious too baggy for me.However , the material is good value for the money.. If you like this style , it is worth every penny .	-1
It 's cut fine , but the material is scratchy and would probably grab a lot of lint . Perhaps , a really good wash and fabric softener would help , but I did n't want to risk it and make it non-returnable . I returned it right away .	-1
Legs are n't straight as seen on photos . Size is n't tight or slim as I read on other reviews , these are very baggy . Maybe I received a wrong item , or they did . Fabric seems to be good . The worst jeans i have ever had ...	-1
I bought these lee Jeans over 2 years ago . The reason I gave these jeans a 2 is because they shrink . No , I have n't put on weight because the Levi 501 's I bought at the same time are still exactly the same fit . At first these jeans were a good fit . I always needed a belt to keep them up and they were easy to move in them . I am still around 185 lbs in weight and 6 ft plus tall . I noticed that these Lee jeans did shrink a little with each wash . I use reasonably hot water to wash them but no other brand jeans shrink like the Lee regular fit . I did buy Lee Dungarees a month ago to replace these in my normal size and they are a little big , but the Lee dungarees do n't shrink . I have 4 pairs of Lee regular fit jeans in different colors . I like the style , color choice , and the heavy weight of the denim . I 'm going to try for the next size up and see if they shrink down . I want Lee dark blue denim jeans that have n't been rubbed or bleached and by the look of the Lee range I can only get them in Regular Fit straight leg . I will let you know if this size change works . These jeans do shrink so remember this unless you buy them big in the first place they will shrink and may be tight on the legs and the waist . They did also shrink in the leg length . Great jeans Lee but fix this problem .	-1
I the first time ordered Lee jeans . Before always bought Levi 's . I was waited by disappointment as jeans appeared less for the size from declared .	-1
The button closure is made of plastic . The jeans broke the first time my husband wore them . They have a silver cover over the tip of the closure to make it look solid , but its not . Do n't waste your money with these .	-1
waist is too small . legs are large enough to fit both legs in one . the color is dark grey , not blue	-1
I read all the reviews . They all said these jeans run a bit large . I 'm hard to fit : small waist , larger hips & thighs , so I thought I would order the jeans in the size I usually wear and I would probably be okay . The jeans are too small . Maybe it 's just the way I 'm built , but I did n't find that they ran large at all . They are nice looking jeans though . I 'm losing weight , so I 'm going to hang on to them .	-1
I bought these jeans a size up because I used to wear Riders in the same style as a teen and remembered that they ran small . I just got them today and tried them on to find that the sizing is still TOO small ! The fabric , while labeled & # 34 ; stretch , & # 34 ; has absolutely no give and the elastic is very tight . I immediately requested a refund and I 'm thankful that I have Prime because the return shipping is free . I was really hoping these would work but I am not pleased at all .	-1
Do n't expect the thick , long lasting quality that you would have expected from Lee 20 years ago . If you wear these just once every few months for going to the bars , you 're probably ok . But if you intend to wear these daily as part of your working wardrobe - buy something else like Dickies or Carhartt ... or really anything but Lee . My lifestyle is that I wear jeans as daily wear to go shopping and to do chores around the house . I 'm not rough on my clothes , but I do n't feel I should have to change them just because I decide to leave the pavement now and then.I bought 4 pairs of these at one time while on sale ( $ 11/per pair ) and they have all ripped at the rear pocket . Inspecting the material , the pocket is well stitched , however the material itself has ripped at the seat of the pants , exposing your underwear . I 've put no unusual strain on the pockets and simply only put the occasional papers or hankerchief in it . The tear is n't usually bad at first , but degrades over time . The last pair ended up splitting halfway down my leg while I was out car shopping ... I had to finish signing the sales paperwork with my butt exposed . Thanks Lee ... .	-1
the design is good but it is one size bigger than normal size . I have to wait for someone fromThailand carry back to USA for return .	-1
I have inserted a picture in the customer picture area so you can see what I am talking about . http : //www.amazon.com/gp/customer-media/product-gallery/B0008G282E/ref=cm_ciu_pdp_images_allWhen I was younger , I used to love Lee jeans because they were comfortable and lasted a long time , so I bought two pair of these . Unfortunately , the quality is not what it used to be . Both pair ripped at the rear right pocket where I keep my wallet ... one in 3 months , the other in 4 . These are a bit expensive to be replacing every 3 to 4 months . I would guess it is a result of using lighter weight denim , but until I see evidence to convince me to try again , I will no longer purchase Lee jeans.Buy these if you do not carry a wallet in your rear pocket . Do not buy them if you do as they will rip very quickly .	-1
My son has been wearing this specific pair of jeans for y.e.a.r.s . This time , the fit is significantly different and it is just smaller all over . The Levi 's he likes ( same size ) still fit the same , it is just the Lee 's that have changed their fit .	-1
This look and feel cheap . They were n't that expensive so what can I expect . Maybe I should have bought a more expensive brand so I could have something that is better quality . The really feel and look like I am wearing some cheap moccasins . They are ok for shuffling around the house and stuff . They are almost like house slippers with a rubber sole . They are also lighter in color than the picture portrays .	-1
Great service from The Shoe Mart ... .quick delivery . Even though the shoe was marked as a 9.5M , the shoe was about a half size too small and not the correct width . Obviously a problem with the manufacturer and not Sperry itself . I have 3 pairs of Sperry Topsiders , and all are 9.5M and they fit the same . The leather for this shoe did not feel as supple as my other Sperry shoes .	-1
maybe i got the wrong size but it seems to be inferior to the timberland one . china made not as good as the timberland boat shoe ... .get two and you dont need shoes for the rest of your life	-1
Having read the reviews about this shirt running large , I ordered an XX-Large in Heather Grey and New Navy for an otherwise 3XL husband.He is 6'1 & # 34 ; tall and has a large frame and wide body , what I would call a fire hydrant shape . He looked like a sausage in this shirt.While the shirt 's sleeves and body length were good , the cuffs and waist band were very tight . The torso was also tight.We 're not talking big belly . We 're talking straight wide body from chest to hips . This is a fitted and not a relaxed fit shirt , perhaps because it 's made in Mexico and not the USA anymore.Since this does n't come in a 3XL size , I 'll have to return it for a refund.The sleeves and torso would be too long in the Big and Tall Men 's size 3XL.The quality of the shirt seems pretty decent , but not the same quality of Carhartt in years past.My children were teasing my husband about his 10-year-old Carharrt sweats , so I decided to spiff him up with new ones : ) Sadly , it did n't work out .	-1
The pants is okay but the size is kind of big for me i can put it on though but ok .	-1
I ordered a 50 waist 30 length . No way these pants are either of these dimensions . I can appreciate a looser fit but these are falling off . I also have to roll the bottoms a ridiculous amount of times so I do n't walk on them . Fail . Fail . Fail .	-1
These alleged 'jeans ' were made of the strangest fabric I 've ever seen or felt in this kind of clothing . The color is not as blue as the picture indicates and they certainly are not denim like Lev & iacute ; 's . Do n't buy this product unless your into weird clothing .	-1
I ordered the white ones and the bows are white , not red as shown . They do n't have nearly the cute appeal I was hoping for , but my event is too close to exchange them : (	-1
Very tight fitting , but I 'm not a small girl ... Other than that they are very cute . For your information , in the picture it shows grey tights with pink bows . The order I received turned out to be pink tights with pink bows . That was a little strange and threw me off guard , but I kept them because overall , they do seem to be good quality and they are very nice looking .	-1
TS AN UGLY COLOR NUDE TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT LIKE IT IM STUCK I PAID 1.00 SO IM NOT SENDING THEM BACK !	-1
The band pulls apart from the watch case , the buttons pop off , and the paint flakes off.In short , a rather fragile watch that will work for anyone that wo n't really do much with it .	-1
This is the fourth Timex Ironman I have owned . It is not as advertised . I asked for a wrist wrap/velcro wrap watch . I received a normal wristband with holes.Also , the Timer feature has no tone at all . I really liked all my previous Timex Ironman watches , but this one has minimal instructions for usage . I am having trouble figuring out whether it works or if it has manufacturing defects.I hope there will be support for how to use this watch ( with the wrong wristband ) Help please , Amazon .	-1
I got this for my wife as she works out a lot . After three months the band broke . I contacted Timex and they never responded . It was past the time to return to Amazon . In reading more reviews on other websites the band is poorly made and breaks on a lot of people who never hear back from Timex . This is not a good product at any price	-1
I do not believe Timex understands the term `` IronMan '' .My wife did have this for 5 years . She did use it about 4 months before 1 marathon a year for 5 years . One year was 2 marathons . My wife is a small petite thing.Changing the battery was a humongous pain in the butt ! Had to install and take out ~5 times due to challenges with screen and such after battery inserted and tightened up . Do n't believe it ever really tightened up as it should . Not used in water , shower , etc.Great size and ability for the price.Just not an IronMan type quality . Maybe 'PrettyGoodMan '' quality ? Would not buy again .	-1
Unisex for me was larger in size than the ladies size so I returned them . I would never buy unisex again .	-1
If , as advertised , you want the ORIGINAL FOOTBED - which is NOT the `` Soft Footbed '' - then these are NOT what you want . I ordered them expecting the original foot bed and received the `` Soft Footbed '' version instead . This was not mentioned anywhere in the ordering process . Pick size , pick width , pick color and material , but no options regarding the footbed . So now I am packaging them up and sending them back , which is a waste of my time . Yes , I am annoyed because I think this is deceptive . Amazon should get it right . The reason they are cheaper may very well be because , in general , people do n't want the Soft Footbed , so they are trying to get rid of them . So now you wo n't be confused or fooled .	-1
I ruptured a disk several years ago and have worn sandals around the house ( hardwood floors ) since then . I read the rave reviews on Birkenstock sandals , so decided to give them a try . After wearing them for a couple of days , they actually caused my lower back to start hurting and pain down my right leg . Stopped wearing them for a day and pain went away . Returned for a refund . The sole also has very little traction . When sitting down in a chair and trying to push back , the sandals would slide before I would . Ordered a pair of CROC sandals and they are way more comfortable .	-1
Sealant I guess ? But that and the fake & # 34 ; copper & # 34 ; buckles made them look very cheap . I could n't return them fast enough . ( This is for the Brown Amalfi leather . ) Also , if you are used to suede Birks , be aware that the leather ones are very stiff . Much less forgiving on arches / ankles .	-1
It was enormous . Ordered 38M for daughter who wears size 7 ; the 38 was even too large for me who wears 8 or 8 1/2 . Return was easy with online process and printing of the label . Unclear if the problem was unisex sizing or if , in fact , Birkenstock runs huge despite the sizing chart . Their website was of no help . Yay for Amazon for their return process .	-1
I have had a bad case of plantar fasciitis for well over a year now and nothing was helping . Then someone recommended getting these for it and at first I thought they were right , but after a week the shoe was n't comfortable at all and actually caused my feet to hurt more when I wore them . Sizing was accurate for me ; I wear women 's size 10 or 10.5 and got size 41 M according to the chart and they fit perfectly .	-1
It is the same size as the last pair for Arizona Birki 's I bought my husband but this pair does not fit right . I will be returning it for a smaller size .	-1
Have n't had a chance to wear them around very much . They appear to have good quality control . Sizing was a surprise ; I ordinarily get a U.S. size 11 or 11.5 shoe in Wide . Based on past sandal sizing experience , I ordered these in Men 's 42 . That was two size increments below what I would take in a shoe size . Thank goodness I did , as the forward parts of my feet are quite loose . Good thing there 's a back ankle strap . At some future point I may wind up punching another hole in the most-forward sandal strap.Update : There is a greatly raised rim around the edge , and this bothered my toes as I walked . Problem was n't apparent from pictures or upon initial inspection . They drove me nuts and I gave them away . Not worth the money .	-1
I had to send these back due to the heel of the shoe . The heel was to small and it hurt my foot . The rest of the shoe fit fine but the heel was really uncomfortable .	-1
These were recommended by my physical therapist after I had my foot reconstructed . I really do n't like them because they are bulky and heavy . I just do n't like all that stiff weight on my feet , but maybe that 's my preference . I do n't find myself drawn to them when I go looking for some shoes to wear , and they end up sitting in my closet .	-1
To widow at front . Felt like duck feet .	-1
I wear a 10 medium , these are huge and stiff . Would n't buy again . Too bad , previous purchase from these folks were great .	-1
These socks did n't even get me through a winter . I paid $ 20 for socks that after once a week wear over 3 months developed holes in both heels . I do n't pay $ 20 for a pair of socks that end up pilling and falling apart after just a few uses . SmartWool USED to be a great brand , but not anymore . I highly suggest forgoing these altogether and go with the & # 34 ; tough & # 34 ; brand of wool socks .	-1
I was excited to try out these cute moccasins , as I was happy with the other styles of Minnetoka 's I have owned in the past . However , within 3 days of wearing them the lining of the soles started coming apart ! ! I tried to put the lining of the sole back in place , but the glue they used has became gummy and lost its adhesiveness . I am very disappointed in this product and will think twice before purchasing another pair of Minnetonka 's .	-1
these gloves are horrible , the fingers are extremely long only my 3 year old could fit his hands in them , but the fingers were cut longer than adult gloves , look elsewhere for this accessory	-1
I bought these thinking that I was getting the best slippers because of the UGG name brand . I have another pair of UGG boots and love them . These had no give in the sole so it felt like I was walking on snowshoes . Very stiff . The inside was plush and warm without socks on but I tend to wear socks so it was impossible to get my foot into the slipper with any socks on -- even thin ones . I have some slippers I got at Target that I would rather keep than waste so much money on these . If you love a very stiff sole with no give and want to wear slippers without socks these may be for you . Not for me .	-1
If I had read the earlier reviews then maybe I would have not had my Husband invest in buying these Ugg slippers . They are warm and cozy . But what I did n't like is how the intereior lining of the shearling wore off on where your heel sits . Mind you I wear a size 6 and only 104 lbs . So believe me it was n't my weight or if I wear them endlessly day in & out . Just got them 3 months ago . Wanted to just wear around the house for the winter months which my feet gets cold . The bottom sole is a bit hard to walk on but please do not waste your money . I did n't even buy this on Amazon . They were bought in a dept store and yet the quaility of this slippers are disappointing . Especailly from a high end name as Ugg 's . I wanted to share my comment here anyways so I can spare the disappointment .	-1
These were not my first pair of coquette 's . At first I felt like a previous reviewer and did n't think they were authentic . They do n't look expensive like uggs normally do . The structure of the slipper was not sturdy . By that I mean when I put them on the entire top of the slipper moved like fabric scuffs . The soles do not come out for replacement and are soles are & # 34 ; ouch & # 34 ; hard . I wore them so I wo n't send them back but I wo n't buy them anymore either . The ones I received were made in Vietnam . So much for Australia ! I also purchased a pair of ugg ansley charms , they were too tight . I settled on a pair of ugg & # 34 ; I Do & # 34 ; short boots Pretty pricey for a pair of house shoes but warm shoes in Wyoming winters are a luxurious necessity . I 've been treating myself to ugg products for years . They just do n't seem as high quality and substantial as they used to . Last year I bought a pair of bailey button knee high boots by ugg . Guess what ... the insoles do n't come out so I can change them . Fashion vs. substance I guess . My husband has been wearing the same pair of ugg men 's slippers for about 6 years now , we 've replaced the insoles twice . I know coquette 's are n't going to last forever , who wants forever house shoes , but I expect more from ugg .	-1
The lining is not as thick as other styles . They are hard . Theey are ok to run to the market or drop the kids off . They are not slippers	-1
Usually Isotoner is right on with their products but these could be made a little better in that the opening needs to be smaller . But the padding on the bottom is really thick and nice . And the material is soft .	-1
Purchased these hoping they would be cute and comfortable . Someone in my family has worn these every day for years . Unfortunately , for me they are not true to size . They fit small and dig into my heels . For this reason , I do not wear them . But , service from Amazon was great as always .	-1
I was sad to find that these fun small , but I mam going to keep them anyway . Too much a hassle to send them back .	-1
the slipper is nice and soft but there is no room for your toes like this picture shows , so I suspect it was made in a foreign country somewhere they have really tiny toes . I am returning them .	-1
These were too small even though I used the size chart when ordering . Also , I felt that they cut into the back of my heel by my achilles tendon . I returned them .	-1
I do n't get it - the suade like material looks very nice , but the wind breaker ( shiny ) material is on the inside . The windbreaker material gets COLD . That needed to be put on the outside . I 'm not a wus either - I ran in -34 degrees last week with my cedar point / cedar fair windbreaker , a long sleeve cotton shirt , and a short sleeve cotton shirt for extra core warmth and was fine . This thing is awful ! ! I would n't recommend it , not for COLD weather , which is what I wanted it for . It 's thick , the suade part , but the shiny inner makes it cold .	-1
I got the greatest deal I 've ever gotten on these shirts . I bought from Amazon Warehouse Deals for $ 2.04 and free shipping ( as I have student prime . ) I was expecting this to be a unisex shirt . I love tank tops but as a girl its like impossible to find a tank top that does n't have the annoying lines all over it , has full straps ( spaghetti straps look trashy to me ) , and is n't made to be super tight . I assumed this would be a male or unisex shirt and was glad that I had gotten a lucky deal on it and all would be well ... Well , it was n't . The package just got here and instead it is an exclusively men 's shirt . It 's a tank top with enormous arm holes that go almost all the way to my waist , not something a girl can wear anywhere . I ca n't even express how disappointed I am right now . I wish I could understand why stupid men have to have enormous arm holes . It 's so FRICKING ANNOYING to not be able to find a decent tank top anywhere because of it . Men huge arm holes is UNNECESSARY . You do not need a tank top that opens up all the way down your side . Its ridiculous and stupid , and that 's all it will ever be . These stupid shirts are going in the garbage I guess because I know shipping them back will cost me more than what I paid for them for .	-1
Fits as expected , true to size , same hoodie found at local discount store . Bought for husband , he wears it but says it 's thin and be careful not to over dry in the wash . It 'll shrink quickly . Decent for price but average quality	-1
So thin I could n't believe it..Not like the ones I ordered last time..they were Hanes tagless..I think The Texas T-Shirt company has gone down hill..Cheap shirts.Not the ounces they say.These were Fruit of the Loom .	-1
Do n't get me wrong , Fruit of the Loom makes good t-shirts . I bought some undershirt Ts and they were great , and ALL COTTON . These are advertized as `` 100 % cotton . '' Last I checked , that meant ALL cotton , nothing else . These are , according to the label on the shirts themselves , `` 90 % cotton , 10 % polyester . '' I specifically do not want any polyester in a cotton t-shirt . While it makes them more durable , it also makes them warmer . One wears t-shirts when ? In warm to hot weather , when one does not need something warmer.Any seller that falsely advertises their products should not be in business , period , and does not deserve yours.Fruit of the Loom 's website states that the material content of the shirts may vary with color , though they do not provide information on what color is what composition . At least they warn you that not all the shirts are all cotton .	-1
The size was up by one size and looked like a Large.Cheap make and the look is so cheap that my husb could n't wear it for any occassion . Bad choice !	-1
The shirt is too long in the body , and too tight as well , making it hard to get on and off - exactly the opposite of what I was looking for . My husband has been wearing this size for decades , so that is not the problem . The garment simply is made for a very long and skinny medium .	-1
Sized at 2xl it fits like a regular extra large . Did n't like , wo n't buy again .	-1
When this T-shirt arrived , I looked very closely at it in different types of lighting to make sure I was seeing the color correctly . This was NOT a deep navy shirt from what I saw . The shirt look straight black with no tinge of blue that I could see or notice . I sent the shirt back and decided not to get a replacement because I did n't want to waste time waiting for another shirt and still get a black t-shirt . The material of the shirt was okay , but I just did n't want a black shirt .	-1
For $ 7.20 you get what you pay for ... this did not fit well , very large arms and quite long ( down to elbow ) . Baggy and the material felt cheap . I returned it .	-1
The shirt sizing is good . And that 's where the pro 's of this shirt end.I did n't expect a whole lot at this price , but I got hosed on this one.I will tell you that the material is woven so thinly that the shirt is very close to being transparent . I have n't washed the shirt yet , and maybe I should n't . It seriously is what most would refer to being thread-bear . I have shirts 10 years old that have been worn and washed numerous times and they are in better shape than this shirt is new.I would n't take possession of the shirt again if it was free plus $ 25But that 's me .	-1
Wonder why other brands like adidas , fila , and Wilson , come larger in waist although being L ( large ) . This XL short has a smaller waist than all other L shorts I 've bought . The problem is that , other than the waist , they are certainly XL . So I ca n't advice to get a larger or a smaller size than your actual size . I just do n't recomend this product . It 's not well proportioned .	-1
I purchase about 8 pairs of shorts , tried on two ( that arrived first ) , they were a bit small , but fit fine . So I washed them all based on that and found all the rest of the shorts I got were so tight I had to throw them away . What a waste of money .	-1
This was very cheap material also it faded after the first was in cold water this was very bad made I thought they would be made better not happy ! ! ! ! ! ! ! C.m .	-1
If I wore these pants for an hour my waist line would be cut in half.I think it was the elastic as the pants without the fabric would have been XL . I probably could have salvaged the things with a new elastic.Second item from Champion that was not so good . I did find another brand that was a great fit , check my other reviews.I did send an email to csr @ txshirts.com and they did not respond . I now see all the others who have had similar experience from them in other reviews . They know it is not worth the money to return them or the bother involved . I threw them away.Not sure why they are still selling here . I have always had good experience with Amazon and guess these guys are getting below their radar .	-1
The elastic inside is supposed to be covered - forget that . It is not and as a result your skin will get covered with a rash - Do not waste your money . Not worth sending back . The shipping makes it not worth it . A good rag to rub stuff with .	-1
My husband picked these out and was unhappy with the thin fabric , compared to his other Champion shorts that are heavier weight and have side seam pockets . We returned both pair .	-1
The material is too thin and wo n't last and there is no pockets at all ; not even a locker key pocket in the waist band . They 'll go to the rag bin within a couple of months .	-1
I usually take XL but wanted some extra space so I ordered an XXL.It fit like a medium or large , too tight so I figured I 'll it to sleep in . Next day was getting dressed and if I wear it underneath a blousy top it wouldnt matter since it being tight wouldnt make a difference , SO WRONG ! One of the straps came torn in the middle of one strap , leaving it hanging by the front and back so I can no longer use it to sleep but I cant use it period . The material iscrap . I would think twice if your interested in purchasing . I did get a refund tho . But I really needed tanks and had planned on ordering more . : (	-1
I wear an XS top and the Large barely fit . I ordered several and returned them all . The look and feel is good , but not the fit .	-1
THIS TOP IS AWFUL . THE FIT OF IT IS LOOSE IN SOME PLACES AND TIGHT IN OTHERS AND MAKES ME FEEL OLD . DO NOT BUY !	-1
This is advertised as cotton , but it 's actually half cotton and half polyester . It feels more like polyester to me , not like a natural fabric . I usually wear an XS/S and purchased a L due to review AND my own experience with Bella . In the past for the Bella Vintage Helena Tank a L was the correct size . In the Raglan Tee Shirt it was huge . I 'd go with a S or M if the polyester did n't bother me . The fit is kind of unflattering and boxy & # 8212 ; like a boy 's top . Not impressed . Returning .	-1
Flimsy material , Target or Walmart quality . Only wear the shirt , for yardwork ! Granted I am picky but not spending my money on items such as this when I can get the same if I shopped @ Walmart .	-1
The sizing is dead on , but I expected a better quality pants ( thicker , more durable ) fine for winter layering , but not a solo piece .	-1
I had high hopes for these sweats as I have several sweatshirts by Jerzees that I really like . These are a poor imitation . I 've worn them bicycling twice and washed once and already a side seam and pocket stitching have unravelled ! ! I hardly consider that wear-and-tear , that is just way too soon for any garment to start falling apart . On closer inspection I see that all the stitching is cheaply done , you 'd expect more quality for .09 cents per/hr from a Honduran sweatshop.Hey Jerzee : bring the work back to the good ol ' USA ! ! The extra $ 1.50 in labor costs to the garment is worth it to have the quality back	-1
I guess they were made in china like everything else we have in the USA ! ! ! After two washes had to sew them back together.would not recommend	-1
I wanted to buy them but the size chart link gave sizing for chest sizes only . I do not plan to wear the sweat pants on my chest . I tried to find the size chart for waist sizes and unable to find for this unit . I hope the fix it soon or I will order a different brand . I want a nice sweat pant with pockets and drawstring .	-1
This garment is made well . It fits well . The material that it is made of is like a dirt magnet . Right out ofthe washing machine , it is covered with lint and looks terrible . I bought three of them . Wore themtwice each , and gave them to good will ... ... ... ..	-1
These pants seem small and not true to size . I advise ordering 1 size larger than you usually take . They seem to be well made and are true to weight .	-1
Like many people , I have a latex allergy . I spent hours looking at pictures of tshirts here for ones with a cloth label like this one advertises in the pic . It arrived with a latex label .	-1
Be sure to order a larger size ( or two ) if you plan to wash it.VERY disappointed in Hanes on this product .	-1
I use to have some beefy T 's back when they were better quality and the thickest/most comfortable cotton shirts I have ever worn . The fit perfectlly too and looked awesome ! These new ones , not so much.Pros : -Fits alright , not like it use to ( Size : Medium ) -Still thicker than most of those silk-like POS 's you find now-a-days . ( but not by much . ) Cons : -Collar no longer fits snug-Bit more athletic size-A LOT THINNER than they were before.I might buy some more considering the price and the selection I have offered is better than any other clothing store , but that 's all.2 Stars for gimping out on your product Hanes . Shame on you .	-1
advertised BEEFY TSHIT but its WAY TOO SHORT and WAY TO NARROW and the fabric is Less Than even a 'B ' Quality . I actually ordered a 4X and certainly expected better quality fabric and at least a 1x Beefy Size . This looks to be a size LARGE and that 's it ! So SAD !	-1
These T 's are a bit on the small side and the cotton is not as soft and does n't have the thread count I am used to in Hanes.Usually I like these T 's but they seem small and less comfortable than my past experience with these shirts .	-1
Be advised that you can probably get the beefy tees for less directly from Hanes , as I did.Also ( a big bummer ) over the last few years , I have received a tee shirt that is notas thick a material as it used to be . I have worn beefy tees ever since I had asign company that also did silk screening on just about anything , and we used to order only the beefy tees as they were a better T shirt than any other , but this wasthirty years ago , and the product has definitely changed no matter what Hanes or anybody else says . I do n't have a problem with the sizing as others do , and at $ 9.00 each with pocket directly from Hanes , it is still a good deal.Addendum : Contacted Hanes and gave them all the sorted details they ask for in hopes youwill not E-mail them back ( Color , where they were made , price , etc . etc . ) .All a bunch of bunk when they have my order number.This is nothing more than Corporate greed , just like Levi , Maytag and so many others .	-1
i did n't know the word & # 34 ; beefy & # 34 ; was a size issue . i thought it was more of a discriptive quality issue , so when it arrived and my whole family could wear it together i was n't happy	-1
I was a fan of these t-shirts buying it again and again over the time , now I found the fabric and quality is not the same than before , are not maded anymore in USA , and after some time and washes many holes start appearing near the sewing , now need find a replace brand because not going to waste my money in these t-shirts .	-1
Cheaply made . It is not tagged with as advertised . I am not even sure if this is real Hanes product . It is overpriced for what you get . Not recommended .	-1
I prefer Champion T-Shirts ; there 's something about the Haynes that just does n't fit well ... too tight in the shoulders . This may be a better product for someone who likes really tight-fitting shirts .	-1
Good fit until the shirt was washed . One washing cycle and the shirt shrank by almost 2 sizes . Gave it to a friend 's pre-teen son and she said it continued shrinking and now her younger daughter is wearing the shirt . Not the quality you would expect from Hanes .	-1
Does not fit too well for sleeping top . Wanted something warm for the winter months and basically wasted my money on this product .	-1
I 've read other reviews stating to get this in a size larger than what your normal size would be . When I ordered , that 's what I did . The large was WAY too big . I returned all three .	-1
I like comfy t-shirts so I ordered this one . I usually wear large or xl so I purchased a xl . It was to tight and to short .	-1
these overboots seem like they are well made but lightweight . they are a little pricey . they 're just the thing for a wet day at work.UPDATE ! ! ! i bought these boots in late spring and have n't used them due to a dry summer . they have sit on my covered front porch for six months . i got them out this morning after a rainy night and put them on over my shoes . they have dry rotted and had holes and cracks in them . turns out that they are JUNK .	-1
I was sent the wrong size , a large instead of a medium . I requested to return the item to trademark via Amazon.com . Amazon sent the return request to trademark . Instead of receiving return authorization , I was sent a request to give them a five star rating ! There was a link to review this item so I am.If this matter is resolved shortly , I will change my rating . It seems like a very good product ! I 've been using a pair of rubber boots from L.L . Bean . I ca n't put my shoes inside , it 's made for just feet . They were on sale for the same price . The tingly 's would be better for hiking or very long walks , I think.Update : Return/exchange process very difficult ! If I did n't already have a pair of rubber boots , I would be mightily disappointed ! Because of continued difficulty , I wo n't exchange them , even though , I would 've really liked to have had these boots.Update again : Amazon quickly remedied the situation by refunding my money . Amazons great !	-1
High quality material just could not stretc ) over my husband 's shoes . The sizing does n't allow for the stretch neccary to go over shoes .	-1
These earrings are cheap looking and not worth the price . The crystals are mostly flat and do not capture the light well . Perhaps the faceted crystals would be more what I was looking for .	-1
The brief tore at the waist band after 2 wearings . No I have to sew it . Too pricey for one pair of briefs that tore .	-1
ALL OLGA BRAS RUN SMALL ... FOR SOME REASON , OLGA BRAS ARE MADE SMALL ON THE SIDES OF THE CUP..I AM A 36 DD , NEVER HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BALI , ETC ... I HAVE TRIED MANY OLGA BRAS ON AND HAVE ALSO TRIED ON A NEXT LARGER CUP SIZE , I HAVE TRIED GOING DOWN A BAND SIZE AND UP THE CUP SIZE , OR WHATEVER , STILL USELESS FOR ME ANYWAY..IT 'S JUST NOT A GOOD BRAND FOR ME..I WAS TOLD BY 2 FITTERS , IF YOU ARE A 36 DD , YOU ARE A 36 DD , THAT IS THAT . SOME BRANDS ARE JUST NOT RIGHT FOR YOU , SO DO N'T TRY CHANGING THE SIZES ... I AGREE ... ... THANK YOU , GOOD LUCK	-1
I wish I had read the previous review before I ordered this bra . It does n't just run on the small side , the sizes are completely off . Believe us , the cup size is about 2 sizes smaller than should be . If you order a `` D '' cup in this bra , you will get the equivalent of a `` B '' cup , I went so far as to measure it against a `` B '' cup and they were approximately the same size . Save you money , time , and return postage .	-1
I am normally a 32 c and this was 34c and way to small on my waiste my waiste is a 26 and it had like 3 inch before it would buckle .	-1
Unless you 're wearing something with a puffed out high waist , this just wo n't work . I was hoping to have something that I could replace spanx with , but it made everything push out where it ended , like a reverse muffin top . Not what I was looking for . Needed to be about 4 inches longer .	-1
For what you pay for this bra , you 'd think the straps would be adjustable or the size would at least run true . Or maybe , just maybe , the cups would n't roll outwards , making it impossible to wear this item even under a sweater without your cup outlines showing.Sadly , none of these are true . I ordered my same bra size . Not only is the chest too big , the cups are very thick and , as noted , tend to roll outwards -- which means less coverage and support.Even the shoulder straps are NONadjustable , and they are HUGE . See the photo ? They 're easily pulled up that high . A stretchy bra is an ineffective bra . You will be nouncing all over the place in this doozy of an item as you move , ever closer , towards having what Sharon Osbourne calls `` National Geographic boobs . '' All this , just to make slightly less apparent the back of your bra showing through your shirt ? No way .	-1
Bah-llelujah to this bra ! It tends to run on the small side and it does not do jack for support . It is made of hosiery and the straps are not adjustable.Spanx has gotten celebrity endorsements and therein lies a large part of its appeal . I can not in good conscience recommend Spanx bras .	-1
This item was not at all what I expected . While it is comfortable , there was no support at all . I need somthing with no wire but support is everything .	-1
I should have passed based on previous reviews posted here but I love all the other Spanx products I have tried , including the wired Bra-llelujah , so I really wanted to give this a try . The straps are too short on my 5'8 & # 34 ; frame , so it rides up , as noted by other reviewers ... I do not have this problem with the wired version . The bra is pretty unattractive . Wireless bras are never the best in this regard but you can do a lot better than this one . And to top it all off there is some really itchy stitching where the straps attach to the band in the back ( again unliked the wired version ) , so it is not even very comfortable .	-1
The title of my review says it all . The shawl was crammed into a clear plastic bag that had a paper sticker on it with fabric content information . The only problem is there is NO label of any kind on the shawl itself and so you have no idea what it is actually made of . Any kind of shawl from a cheap acrylic to whatever could have been put into this wrapper . In addition , there is no fabric care label to tell you if the shawl is delicate machine washable , has to be dry cleaned or what . This violates USA import laws . Fabric must have a content and care label.I telephoned Amazon.com customer service about the problem with the 2 shawls of this style I ordered as well as one this seller advertised as 100 % cashmere and actually is 80 % cashmere , 20 % silk , that I also ordered . The label on that shawl says it 's from clubpashmina.com.All 3 shawls are being returned . The 2 of this style because they are not suitable for gifts with no fabric content or care labels . I have serious doubts they are the claimed 70/30 combination advertised.The other shawl because it is not the claimed 100 % cashmere.Be aware , you may not get what is shown or advertised !	-1
They say if something is priced too good , buyer beware . So true of this purchase ! The 'crystals ' I received had almost no sparkle to them with the exception of a few colors . The supplier is being misleading calling them 'Swarovsky Crystals ' , to say the least ! I did n't return them only because it was n't worth the cost .	-1
these shoes do run a little small i find , and also the toe is very pointy . I though it would be more rounded .	-1
I ca n't remember them well enough other than they were too heavy/clunky . So , I sent them back . I like other Jambu styles better .	-1
These say `` 3 months '' , but I have a long boy who 's 6 months who still ca n't wear these . The neck is HUGE and can be pulled down and off his body , while the length is too short . Thought maybe they would shrink because they 're cotton , instead they just stretch in the neck.*Update ! I kept these bodysuits thinking baby would grow into them , which was a mistake . Baby is now a year old and still ca n't wear these `` 3 month '' bodysuits . The opening for the head will fit a 5 year old , the suit will always be too short , and the leg openings will also fit a 5 year old . I ca n't imagine any baby proportioned to fit in these , they are just junk !	-1
Bought these for my 12 lb baby and they are way too big ! The neckline is far too open so both of her shoulders end up hanging out of the top . I 'm sure in a few months they will fit , but definitely not true to size .	-1
I ordered these for my son at 4 months . Even then they were too short and too wide for him ! They kept falling off at the shoulder .	-1
My son is 10 months and the sleeves that are supposed to be too big are 3/4 of his arm . The material feels good and all , but I bought this product thinking it will last him through the winter , but it 's too small already and he is not an oversized baby	-1
Other reviews have already mentioned the facts and I must agree , although these are soft , yes , nice and soft , they are not the softest and they do not last ! .. Big problem and waste of money on these and they do not hold up after even just a couple washes ; the neck stretches out immediately after just a wash or two and the sleeves are 3/4 length , which is not mentioned in the product description anywhere ! and the cut on the hip is too high and they do end up riding up on our little one ! We got a set of these and although they seem to run true to size , I would definitely size up , but then again I would never recommend anyone buy these unless you are looking for a 3/4 sleeve onesie with a higher cut hip area and a neck area stretched out after a couple washes..Save your money and just get the gerber brand , although the gerber ones are thinner , at least they have long sleeves and dont ride up the leg and the neck doesnt stretch out..Bottom line , a total waste of money and we really wish we would of never bought them ! !	-1
Sleeves of those bodysuits are ridiculously small . I bought 24 month size for my 17 month old son and they still are small for him . Fabric quality is good though ... I would not recommend buying those .	-1
I bought these for my twins , but was disappointed in how they shrink in length , but remain boxy and wide . The neck is HUGE and my twins seem to sport an 80s Flashdance look when they wear these -- one shoulder is always bare . The fabric is soft or I would have rated it one star . I would n't buy again .	-1
I did not like the fit or the quality of this product . I returned the shirts for a refund . Done	-1
First off I will try to be real honest here . I have no axe to grind.The fit : Great , pretty much true to size . I have long arms and the XL fit real niceThe neck : The mfg. , makes the neck enormous . ( Note to Mfg. , we do not all have giant pumpkin heads , well ... . I do n't ) .Color : Pretty nice looking.Material : Fairly heavy . Heavier than a tee shirt , but not to thick that you get over hot.Not the nicest sweatshirt I have ever bought . If the neck was so ridiculously large I would give this sweatshirt four stars .	-1
Material felt cheap . Was not soft and very big . Did not like it at all . Did not feel warm like fleece should !	-1
Very disappointed with this item . I 'm returning it . The one pro is that yes , it does pact relatively flat . But it does this by sacrificing space over my current hanging bag which has lasted at least a decade ( seems to be generic , I ca n't find a brand on my old bag unfortunately to recommend it ) . This is nowhere near that quality . The pockets are n't that well designed , not impressed with the zipper , and as other reviewers have noted it has a small hook to hand ( but that 's typical ) . Not recommended .	-1
This may work better for others , but it was not really great for what I needed in the way of travel.Pros : Nice colorLots of pocketsExpandableHangingSpill proofFlatCons : Pockets all VERY small and separated . I LOVE pockets , so when I say too many pockets , it 's a big deal . There are TOO many pockets that become rather useless.Not the right shape size - the flatness was a pro when I purchased but when I tried it out , it was less impressive . I struggled to fit everything I needed to in this bag . There is not much wiggle room , or room for oddly-shaped items .	-1
I was first disappointed in the stiffness of the so called soft fabric , Compared to Faconnable jacket I bought years ago it is like paper compared to velvet . I also notice the XL seemed a little smaller . The finish of the fabric had scratches on it too . But for only 60 dollars it 's an OK jacket but I probably wo n't be buying cloths online anytime soon again . I was hoping for a bit better than this from Amazon .	-1
bracelet is too small and too thin . Does not look like a high quality piece of silver . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I am returning it . I wanted something small just for my phone , ID and money that I could use hands free . My phone will not fit in it .	-1
This little wonder has been redesigned and no longer has the slip pocket on the back . They have also made it just a bit smaller both in width and depth so it will not accommodate my passport which has extra pages . I have been using one of these for years to hold passport , small phone , hand wipes , credit cards , cash , state ID and lip gloss - and it has worked brilliantly - sliding easily under a coat or jacket - for to and from the airport and in flight . This newer remake wo n't cut it for my needs . Thank goodness my old one is holding up nicely - I just wanted a back up with contrast light lining . If you do n't need it for a fat passport - or a slightly large phone , maybe it will work for you . But this one is going back . Glad Amazon has such great shipping and return policies .	-1
I followed advice to at least buy the shoe a half size bigger . Normally and 11M gives me room for socks and shoe pads . This shoe is really narrow and I could barely get my foot into it . Did n't trust that it would stretch because I bought it for the reported comfort postings . Also not as cute as I thought it would be .	-1
I love almost all of my Thorlos , but these gave me blisters . Stick with the thin pad style - they are amazing .	-1
Unfortunately , I missed the return date by 2 days so I am stuck with these socks . I have 3 pair I ordered direct from Thorlo and the are far superior to these . The bottom is good but the tops are already thread bare and will wear through probably with the next time I wear these . I will never order these again through Amazon as these might possibly be seconds .	-1
An expensive lesson . I ordered an 11 in white to fit my womans 8 shoe . After they were washed I could not get them on . They are way too small and I thought they were left here by our grandson . I just now realized they must be the Thorlo I had ordered.I received the wrong sock . The ones I have are all white and seem to be the woman 's sock that has cotton in it , which might explain why it shrank . I will contact Amazon to see if anything can be done .	-1
I 've bought 2 other socks made by Thorlo and loved them so thought I would give these a try . They are not the same . This pair is sloppy on . When I walk around the house without shoes , just socks , the bottoms slip up to the side of my foot . I have to keep reaching down and adjusting . The material is very different , feels cheaper , like something I could buy at the big discount stores . This sock has 85 % acrylic and the previous pairs had 70 % coolmax . I will check the material more carefully next time and stick with the coolmax .	-1
I bought these socks thinking they may be like some fantastic socks that I bought in a factory outlet in Salisbury , NC when I was visiting friends there . NOT SO . These socks are totally unfinished on the inside and consequently I feel little bunches of thread bothering my toes/feet . I am sorry I donated to the troops via this outfit , because I am afraid they just are n't what they 're cracked up to be ( regardless of the glowing reports ) .	-1
These socks are a nice color and felt great on my feet . Trouble is , you get hole after hole in a short time if you wear them often . Surprisingly , these socks are not very durable and do not warrant the rather steep price that Thorlo socks command . I think the Thorlo brand is vastly overrated . I 'm going to try Wigwam 's or Gold Toe socks next time .	-1
Final Edit 9/1/2013I gave these socks one last shot . I work them to the school where I work figuring as much as I 'm on my feet - and that 's MOST of the day - these socks will shine or suck . They chose to do the latter . They sucked . They were hot and I was miserable . I should have brought a pair of back up socks but did n't . I paid a hefty price for it . I 'll no longer wear there . In fact , if they do n't fit my son , and they probably wo n't , they 'll be heading to the land of the thrift store.I was sorely disappointed in these socks from start to finish and will NOT be buying any more.- - - - - - - - - - - - -EDIT 08/25/2013After an extended use on the trail being worn packing a heavily laden backpack for a week 's trip , I found these socks to be just as I predicted . I 'm NOT impressed . Not only were they hot but they were slow to dry in a side by side comparison withWigwam Men 's Hiking/Outdoor Pro Length SockandWigwam Unisex Men's/Women 's Merino Wool Comfort Hiker Crew Length Sock.To test the theory that they were n't as good as I had hoped , I allowed another member of the group , my wife , to wear them . She too , when asked , said they were hot and not as good as the Wigwams.I 'll continue to wear them until they disintegrate but I wo n't be back for more.- - - - - - - - - - - - -I was truly excited about getting these socks since I live in the desert . I had hoped for a hike today to check them out but knee issues had other plans . Instead , I put them on to wear around in the same shoes I use for local hiking.HOT . That 's how to describe these socks this minute - and I 'm wearing them now . The current ambient temperature today , far lower than usual at 71F , did n't change a thing.As for the fit , right on target . In fact , probably the absolute best fitting socks I own . I wear a Men 's 8 and it seems that it 's close to impossible to get decently sized socks without actually buying perfectly sized socks . For that reason alone the earned the 3rd star for the review . Otherwise it would have been a 2 based on the CURRENT situation.Perhaps time will tell . Maybe once I 'm out traipsing around I 'll find these things to be the best thing since soles on shoes . I do n't know . Right now , it 's not so .	-1
I wear uniform Danner boots everyday at work . I needed a sock that is comfortable for this type of wear . This sock is extremely thick and made my normally comfortable boots hot and uncomfortable .	-1
The material is very thick in certain areas and too thin in others . After one or two washings they get little lint balls all over the sock . They do not hold up well . Do not recommend them for boots .	-1
They 're very comfortable for my low hiking boots but after a few uses , the socks ( above the boot ) are piling something awful and look ancient.They 're comfortable enough so I wo n't return them but I would n't buy another pair .	-1
I 've had these socks for six weeks.I 've used them only as house socks ( mostly carpet and polished wood ) .No running or long-distance walking at all.They already have a hole in the bottom.I expect more from an expensive sock .	-1
I 've gotten better knee highs at Walmart , or K-mart for $ 2.00 -- The top band was a little bit larger than most -but for 11 dollars ? ? No way ! ! The body of the stocking was flimsy and cheap . No Support at all ! -- If they last a day or 2 I 'll be shocked . From the description , you 'd think they 'd have some weight or support . Famous Spanx ? Not these Do n't waste your money ladies -- these are a very bad deal .	-1
I bought this bag for work , I 'm an ER nurse and needed a sturdy , spacious , good looking bag . This is n't it . I use it as a beach bag instead , I do n't like it or care for it . The price is decent but this is just not a stylish bag . I only kept it because for the price it was too much of a hassle to send it back .	-1
Not very pleasing to the eye . Looked like a sturdy grocery store bag . Not worth the money . Also , no closure at top made it unsafe to use as a carry on that may have to be stowed under a seat or above in plane . Gave it to my Dtr to use as a & # 34 ; whatever & # 34 ; bag .	-1
Advertised as `` Timex Kids ' T79081 My First Timex Easy Reader Pink Leather Strap Watch '' FYI it clearly says synthetic leather underneath the strap . The fake leather strap feels like cardboard , it 's very stiff like a bangle.Straps aside , the actual clock is nice , and has the blue back light feature . I would recommend getting this with a fabric strap .	-1
This is the second watch of this particular model I bought . The first one has been running great for the last two years and I had no hesitation in buying another one for my dad . Unfortunately , I realized something was wrong with this watch the moment I took it out of the box . All Automatic watches need a couple of turns of the winder to get them started . The winder on this one offered no resistance what so ever . That in itself was a clue to a bigger problem . Once the watch gets an initial wind , it supposed to be able to wind itself as you move around . This watch stopped within 5 minutes . I wore it for two days , trying to give it enough wind to keep it going , but it still stopped 30 minutes after I took it off.Since the first watch was/is running flawlessly , it 's safe to assume that this is simply lack of manufacturer 's quality control . Therefore , I will be ordering a replacement once my purchase has been refunded .	-1
I own at least 30 Invictas and love most of them . However , their current rage for their most attractive styles is to make BIG watches , 46-50 mil and above . I wanted something in the 42-43 mil range which is how this is advertised . I also liked the fact that the movement was apparently the Myiota movement I have in several of my Invicta automatics . Excellent durable movement . THIS WATCH IS NOT 43 MIL IT IS 40 ( I already own one in 40 mil with a nicer dial ) AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A MYIOTA MOVEMENT . Sent it back disappointed . By the way , I do own a 43 mil Invicta in brown with a Myiota movement so I know they make or at least made them . I 'm growing wary of the new Invictas -- not just size wise -- they are looking somewhat cheaper in quality to me these days .	-1
This was actually pretty uncomfortable , but I 've never really found a good , comfortable , concealed travel wallet I like . It showed pretty bad unless I had a cardigan or something heavy on .	-1
This shirt is n't made for a woman . It is big and puffy in the back and tight aroun the stomach area , just like a man would want . It 's nice material though .	-1
Ours ripped after one normal use . Seems kind of disappointing and thought it would last longer.. Sent it back due to poor quality .	-1
We returned this because it is simply too bulky . We opted to borrow a snap+go stroller instead because we did n't think we could manage this in the airport .	-1
> > I purchased this same item from another seller on Amazon . The price may differ , but the Duro-Med product is the same. & lt ; & lt ; Bleh . After hunting around , I thought I had found a decent shoehorn for a good price . At a single Jefferson , it seemed too good to be true . It was.I wanted to replace a lost shoe horn with something a little nicer and this sounded like it would fit the bill . Instead , the upper handle grip came off the second day and now pulls off if tugged on too much . Some epoxy will likely fix this but still . Secondly , the spring hinged `` horn '' is way too flexible to be truly useful to leaver a foot into a show . It works , but I have to hold the column just above the spring , negating the benefit of the long handle . Lastly , the flimsy spring seems to be loosening and the horn part is ready to fall off . All in all , a waste of ten bucks.I suggest doing yourself a favor and getting the simple yet sturdy and effective2 Long Black Plastic Shoe Horns ( 18.5 '' ) . That is what I was replacing and what I am going back to.~ Kort	-1
I was just looking for a long-handled shoe horn and did n't realize the blade was mounted on a spring on this thing . I have no idea why anyone would think that 's a good idea . The blade just flops around between foot and shoe and wo n't stay where it is needed .	-1
not so much no soft	-1
I purchased these as a part of my hospital bag and there is no way that these are a large .	-1
This product was misrepresented as disposable briefs that were comfortable and at times reusable . They are made of this , rough paper that provides no comfort and how anyone washed them by hamd and they survived is beyond me . Do not buy these , look somewhere else , I threw them out .	-1
I was dissappointed with this Carhartt hoodie . I figured coming from Carhartt , it would be a heavy-duty hoodie . Instead it 's thin material and seems cheap . It 's not even that warm . I recommend buying a Carhartt jacket , but not the hoodies .	-1
FRYE Women 's Belted Harness Mulei got this mule and it was rather heavy and clobby when i walked . I ordered the tan color . I am sorry , this was about the ugliest shoe i have ever bought . My foot kept on sliding back over the little leather heel when i walked and it was very uncomfortable . Sent back , of course .	-1
The boot quality seems to be ok , although my husband never got to wear the boot to see how they wear . He is normally 9 1/2 D ( med ) , sometimes a 10 D and these boots were way too wide . I am also upset by the fact that I have to pay return shipping plus a pickup fee to return to Amazon . I was under the impression that during this holiday season , I would not have to pay return shipping on clothes and shoes . Anyway , the good deal that I thought I was getting is now negated by the return shipping fees all because of poorly fitting shoes . In the 40 years we have been together , he has NEVER worn a narrow in shoes or boots .	-1
Ordered a half-size larger that normal because boots sometime run small , but , these are absurd . Ca n't even get my smallest foot in with the thinnest socks I own.Boots look nice , but , for some reason , I thought they were American made . For this much money , they should be.Very disappointed .	-1
This was okay . The leather-like was not quite leather like . It is definitely a pleather experience Would never buy again .	-1
it did not . Fit was not as expected for the size and description and was lighter weight than expected . Returned .	-1
I bought the bra for my daughter according to her size . She had went to a bra shop earlier that week and was measured there and had bought a couple of bras from the shop which fit her perfectly and were the same brand as these . Since the bras she bought at the shop were more of a 'winter-weight ' and summer is here I decided to buy these as they are more light-weight . And , yes , they are light-weight , but somehow the fit was much too tight for my daughter and the straps chafed her shoulders after only one day of wear . Even though I think this is a good brand generally , I would not advise you to buy these particular bras .	-1
The moment I put this bra on , I knew it was n't fitting me correctly . It was not supportive and was too large in some places and was very uncomfortable . I returned it .	-1
To me it felt like a harness , yet for all the hooks and material there was a lack of support . Sending it back .	-1
I am disappointed in this bra ; I thought it would stand up to similar ones I had bought . It did not . Iam not sure what went wrong as the Bali bras are quite long lasting . Maybe its this style . It gives no support , you may as well not have it on.. will go back to the other styles I have bought .	-1
I have worn Bali bras for years and just love them . However Style 3372 , called a `` Gel Spa Closure '' is similar to the style I have always used ... .BUT : the edge seal of the `` Gel Spa Closure '' is welded ( rather than sewn with tread ) and is razor sharp . It actually grazed my finger as I tried to secure the hooks , and it was very uncomfortable to wear . The sharp edges irritated my back . ( Amazon instructions allow returns only for unopened products . As I really had to take it out of the package to discover how uncomfortable it is ... so I 'm stuck with it . Thank heaven I paid an Amazon price ! ! ) Other than the 3372 product , I 'd recommend Bali products ... . I 've been buying Bali products for 26 years and this is my first complaint .	-1
This bra looks nice , good quality , is comfy , but does n't fit me well as far as the cup goes . Seems to pull my girls down . I want to keep them up where they belong ! I do not like the shape of this bra at all , not for me .	-1
I bought the shoe thinking they had excellent support . Not true . Very flimsy and not easy on the eyes either . My husband actually said that these were the ugliest & # 60 ; enter expletive here & # 62 ; shoes he 'd ever seen in his life . I 'm returning and ordering another tried and true brand .	-1
WOW ! Am I blind because I can not see the skull . The company says they are 3/16 of an inch , but really they seem much smaller . I would n't buy these again .	-1
I bought these mainly for the backs , and with the hope they would be of high enough quality for my second hole . The backs are great ; the earrings themselves are dull and cheap looking . Buyer beware ; I would never wear them out , nor consider them as giftable . The company ( Sabrina Silver ) was a pleasure to do business with : timely delivery , secure packaging .	-1
had purchased as stocking stuffer for 20something daughter . way too small , even for a 3rd set of ear piercings . post too long and very soft . returned .	-1
Maybe they are sterling silver , but they look nothing like the numerous other sterling silver jewelry I have and seem to cause a reaction in my ear ... too bad . They are cute besides that . I gave one star because I would expect something that says sterling silver to without question appear to be sterling silver . Not that the price that was paid was extremely high , but for cheap material $ 10 is way too much .	-1
The size was more like a 3XL she never used then and cant sent them back if you buy then get one size smaller than you need !	-1
This is my first purchase of Dickies t-shirts . The shirts themselves are well-constructed , high-quality garments . The cotton is quite heavy ( too heavy for FL in the summertime ) . They run quite large , yet the neck is small in comparison , and constrictive when worn . I would return these if I could.My husband and I much prefer the Hanes tagless tee : Hanes Heavyweight Tagless Pocket Teeavailable here on Amazon .	-1
This jeans came as ordered and were exactly what I thought they were suppose to be . The only problem that I saw with these jeans is after wearing them for the day , the material `` strechted '' out and were a LOT bigger than when I put them on that morning . I would probably not purchase these pants again . I live an active life and do not need or desire to have pants that end up something that I am pulling up to keep on at the end of the day .	-1
The fit and quality of this item is good but I could not give it a high rating this time because there was at small hole in it near the back pocket	-1
not what I expected	-1
These have 9 heavy duty belt loops . The size and length are accurate . The material is a little stiff - towards canvas - only washed once tho . Very little shrinkage . Not as soft as old blue jeans , but feels armored . Much more rugged . I am buying another pair - different color.UPDATE : Its been 3 months since I bought the Jeans and the zipper broke . I was n't even wearing them at the time . In hand , I tried to unzip all the way down and it was hung-up . Zipper teeth section pulled right out . Very disappointing .	-1
Loose enough for me to get both of my legs in one pant leg . Length and waste was fine as with the fabric weight and color . Oh well , I 'll need to try on locally and then cost compare a style I know fits . Better yet I could loose some weight and get back in to a dozen pair from years ago .	-1
It is in absolutely different colour from the picture . Are you jogg & # 305 ; ng with me ? No chance for return , I m from outside usa , never advice . do not buy , never .	-1
it 's my size yet it is a tight fit . Someone got the cut wrong . I think these are no longer made in the good old USA .	-1
OK I ordered a 56 & # 34 ; x30 & # 34 ; to accommodate my Santa girth . The waist did fit as advertized but from there down these pants fit is ridiculous . The hip and leg room was sized for a much larger person , someone who did n't taper down from a 56 waist . I still fit comfortably in my old 48 waist jeans , except for the too-small waist . I was hoping the designers at Wrangler were cognizant of percentages and designed accordingly . I mean , out of 100 Santa-waisted guys you 've ever seen how many have huge hips and thighs ? Maybe 5 ? That 's who these are designed for , not the other 95 , at least the pair they shipped to me . The other design problem is the huge & # 34 ; rise & # 34 ; . For me to get the crotch up to the right place , the waist was 2 & # 34 ; above my belly button . Maybe they were designed for a huge _______ like the rest ?	-1
The picture is too different from the real item or amazon send me a another item . The color is completely different when you compare with the advertised one .	-1
This robe is extremely short . So much so that it 's not much of a cover-up . However , it is pretty , and the satin quilted hanger that it comes on is almost as exciting as the garment itself . I would have liked it to be longer . The chemise or babydoll fit me very strangely , and I will not be wearing it . I 've worn the robe once or twice , but would get more use out of a longer one . However , it was n't worth returning because it was so cheap that return shipping would eat up most of the refund .	-1
This abydoll is very big as large runs as xlarge . I was disappointed when I found it has 2 stain that make it ugly . Take care	-1
I originally ordered two of these one red one white , I got the white one first and decided to return the red one before I received it . The ties in back are confusing and it still doesnt fit right and the fabric is cheap . Plus I didnt ' think about it before hand but would n't you rather have matching panties than a padded hanger . I should have spent more , you pay for quality I guess . Would n't recommend	-1
These items were smaller than I expected and the quality of the material seemed flimsy too me . I returned these items .	-1
The straps in the back are long and are somehow supposed to go through various eye holes to look like they are laced up or something . This is IMPOSSIBLE to do by yourself and it 's also IMPOSSIBLE to figure out its supposed to look in the end . What on earth were they thinking ? The robe is fine but the babydoll thing is a joke , they dont include instructions on how it 's supposed to go together or look or anything . Very Strange	-1
This is really cute , the panties are really quite adorable , but the & # 34 ; girls & # 34 ; had no support and were n't really showcased well .	-1
First of all if you have a short torso and small boobs than this outfit is for you . This is not really made for women whose cup size is C or larger . Do n't get me wrong it 's a cute outfit but again if you are big busted there is no way you can fit in the top part and it 's really meant for somebody who has a short torso . I really do n't like the way it 's made but otherwise it 's cute but just not on me . When I modeled it for my friend he liked it but said that I was n't & # 34 ; comfortable in it & # 34 ; I agreed and promptly re-gifted it to somebody else .	-1
These are the size I always buy for my husband , but I ended up giving them away because I hate to deal with the hassle of returns , not to mention , this was the only size available . I gave them to a friend whose husband is typically a 36 and they were too small for him as well , so he gave them to his son who is a 34 ! ! ! Quite a disappointment , and my husband is still cold ...	-1
when clicking on link it did not say they did not have them it sent what it did have	-1
Of all the companies that you would think would manufacture their products in the USA , it would have been Wrangler . I was shock when I saw the label that said & # 34 ; Made in Bangladesh & # 34 ; . You have got to be kidding me ! The quality and fit of the jacket was so so . Some of the holes did n't line up to the buttons , and some of the seams were not finished completly . Amazon and Wrangler need to put the country of manufacturing on the site when they sell a product . My bad . Lesson learned .	-1
I bought this for my brother who is a pretty big guy and he could wrap it around himself 1 1/2 times . I sent it back and got an XL which fit perfect . It 's not that I hated the jacket per se , I hated having to send it back and wait for a replacement .	-1
The shirts is so big that i cant wear it , i ordered xxl and thats what I always wear ... But this is huge , i would return it but I live in Saudi Arabia and it will cost me alot ... I was exsaited for this one : ( , but I give it 2 stars becouse the quality to be honest .	-1
They changed the fit and sizing on it . I liked the way it ran really small . Especially on the sides . I am petite and bras always come up too high on the sides so they show with sleeveless tops . The old model of this bra did not come up so high , in other words , it was as not as & # 34 ; full coverage. & # 34 ; I remember seeing reviews on places like HerRoom complaining about the small fit of this bra . Maybe now it works for more people , but not me .	-1
I bought this ring for my boyfriend bevause he liled it and the wonderful reviews . He wore it and in 90 days the stones start falling out . This is considered a DEFECTIVE PRODUCT I CONTACTED THEM THEY SAID ONLY 30 day gurantee would not fix replace or exchange . I buy alot of silver rings for example Avon silver jewelery lasts forever and will exchange or credit you no problem . PLease email me if u have had problems w/this company betsortiz @ verizon.net they call themselves a customer service team with that kind of team the customer will lose everytime . I am questioning ring quality on this site i returned a womens ring same reason to a different amazon.co and they were wonderful . What is happening to customer service very hard to find now a days .	-1
I figured I 'd give this a chance . It came in a D cup , it had pretty good reviews , so I could at least TRY the thing for a new t-back summer dress I 'd purchased.Package came , first thought was 'thats not nude , thats a dark taupe color ' . So much for lighter or see thru dresses masking this thing.Followed instructions , tried the thing out . Looked in the mirror and laughed . What have I done to myself ? My poor breast tissue pulled away from their natural position to give a laughable amount of cleavage , while at the same time - COMPLETELY UN-SUPPORTED.Which brings me to my conclusion . If you have anything bigger than an A cup , do n't even bother . There is just no way this thing will give you any decent amount of support . I tried changing the position of the clasps and nothing helped.It 's just a all around terrible product for anyone with boobs .	-1
What a disappointment.I reccomend that you save your hard earned money and simply buy a $ 0.79 cent roll of adhesive tape from the local chemist .	-1
if you 're a 38C as I am , forget it ! Total waste of money , for something that only covers your breast nipples .	-1
Returned did not fit , so it seems unfair to rate this . So if it had fitted maybe I would have liked it .	-1
This bra may be good for some . However , for a support bra , it lacks good support on the sides . I am returning it .	-1
This bra was unattractive and uncomfortable to wear . The material was cheap and scratchy , and the bra was both pointy and flat . I had the same problem with another Glamorise bra . I 'll stick to Goddess in the future . Seller was prompt and responsive .	-1
Pros : Ordered my usual size and it fit . Pretty pink color . Back design is good.Cons : No lift/support . Cups are odd shape and no separation.Ordered my usual size and it fit . But no support/lift or separation . The back design is nice but that is only half of what I need for a bra . Returning .	-1
This was too big , too heavy and too ugly . I bought them for my mother who is an avid gardener but I agreed with her comments .	-1
I 've worn 527s for years . Probably have gone through 6 pairs.Ordered a pair of these and they are a completely different pant . The material is not only much thinner but rougher than my current 527s . It does n't even feel like denim.The front pockets are also at least an inch shorter.The jeans also seem to be a bit smaller . Granted , my current 527s are probably a bit stretched out and , yes , I 've put on a couple pounds , but these new 527s do not seem like a 34 waist - they are much tighter . I buy plenty of other pants in a 34 that fight just fine so something is out of whack with Levi 's sizing.These facts lead me to believe that these jeans are counterfeit.I never wear these jeans . They are too tight , the fabric is rough and thin . Complete waste of $ 40 .	-1
505 ( straight ) : A looser fit , comfortable , seems to stretch out pretty quick with wear . So far this is the only of the 3 pairs which I commonly need a belt to keep up . It is my wife 's least favorite in terms of the cut / look , I think mostly because she thinks they are to loose / to big , I think when I first got them or right after they shrink a bit from a wash she likes them more . Currently thought she says this is her least favorite of the three.511 ( slim ) : These are a slim fit as the style claims , but they are n't to tight and seem to have some stretch to them when you move around . They feel a bit to tight the very first day out of the wash , but by the second they are about perfect . They are probably my favorite of the bunch , in terms of look , feel , and comfort . They are tight enough to not look baggy/loose , but not so tight to be uncomfortable or give me a silly skinny jean look . They are my wife 's favorite in terms of the look as well.527 ( low rise boot gen 7 ) : These were my least favorite or the group . They were uncomfortably tight , when sitting I am constantly pulling , and 'adjusting ' to try to sit comfortably . I have pulled on them and wear them a bit extra long trying to stretch them out . They are still wearable , but I really only put them on if my other two pairs are dirty . My wife thinks they are the second best in terms of look , putting them in the not to loose , seems to look pretty good on me middle of the road . Obviously since they do n't feel good and are to restricting for movement , etc I give them last place . I would n't buy this style again .	-1
Seriously , it seems like there 's a conspiracy to get everyone wearing tight , skinny jeans , notice how the 557s are no longer available , and look at the pictures showing Levi 's different styles here on Amazon.Only part of the description that matches the product is `` low waist '' , they are tight in both seat and thigh for anyone with a regular build , if you work out do n't waste your time with these.Bought two 527s to replace an ageing pair I was extremely fond of , purchased right here on Amazon , these two new pairs even do n't fit exactly the same . 527 is supposed to be the straight boot cut Levi , not anymore . The new jeans are much slimmer and the leg opening is narrower by at least 2 inches , it 's nowhere near the 18 '' advertised . These are not boot cut jeans by any stretch , you 'd expect a brand like Levi 's to do better.They are actually skinnier than theLevi 's Men 's 517 Boot Cut Jeanwhich are supposed to be the slim boot cut style , and have a wider leg opening . Styling is completely off . I 've always worn Levi 's and was really happy I could get the ones I wanted online , but I wo n't be buying them from Amazon again . If I could give zero stars I would , that 's how disappointed I am .	-1
I have bought 527 jeans exclusively for over 20 years , as I only wear cowboy boots and these jeans fit me so perfectly.But the fabric has gotten shabbier and thinner with each passing year . Now they almost feel like pajamas when brand new , and they wear put at the crotch , out seams , and cuffs within months whereas they used to last me 2-3 years of constant use under often rugged conditions . Boooooooo ! What has happened to Levi 's quality ? Another great brand gone to cheap labor and cheap materials . Now what jeans can I wear ? Gon na give Wranglers another shot on my next order . Bad Levi 's !	-1
Inside of the boot there 's a weird chunk of material that hurts when I walked just a couple steps in these boots . A shame because otherwise these seem like pretty great boots .	-1
Buy a better one this is plastic and pot metal I broke it after 2 uses .	-1
There are two basic problems with this.First , the spring loaded platform that holds your watch bracelet is too stiff . The spring loading takes a lot of pressure to hold down so fine adjustments are impossible . This makes it difficult to line up the push pin exactly with your bracelet 's pin.Second , the plastic collar that guides the push pin is too fragile . Mine split after the second use.This is going in the trash . Bah .	-1
This is very cheaply made and does not work for me . It does n't fit the watches I work with and was a total waste of money . I do n't know why there are n't quality products availabe . : -/	-1
I bought this based on Amazon 's recommendation that it is frequently purchased with the watch I was buying . There are several types of bands as illustrated at [ ... ] and it is very difficult to determine which type your new watch has until it is in your hands . This does not work with the Casio Men 's WV300DA-7AC Waveceptor Solar Atomic Silver-Tone Watch that I purchased , so I just took my watch to a nearby jeweler and they sized it perfectly for $ 10 . The pins in the watchband are very small and pop out several feet into the air , so be careful if you attempt to size your watch band and do it in a large uncluttered work area , like on a large dining table , and be sure you have the right tool for your band . I added this to my tool box , but I am skeptical that I will ever use it . I am happy there are still local jewelers to assist with watches you did not purchase from them .	-1
This item has quite a good feel to it when first using it , and does n't feel very `` plastic-y '' like most of the other tools out there , but from there the praise ends.The height adjustment tool is a notched springboard at the end of the tool . The purpose of this being that if you 've got a thicker band , you can press down on it to align it with the pin . The problem with this system is that it causes the band to be unstable , and if it slips on the surface of that spring board , the pin will bend and snap off.Also , the pins included with this tool , while longer than most , are the flimsiest item I 've ever seen . I realize these pins are supposed to bend to protect your watch under too much pressure , but minimal pressure not only caused them to bend but snap completely ! I went out and bought another link remover , frustrated with this one 's flawed design , and it worked much better .	-1
None of my bands would fit this tool . I have standard size bands and this tool is just too small . It only fits ladies watches . Also , the pins are too fragile . Why do you think they need to include THREE !	-1
It is very cheap , so do n't be disappointed when it breaks . I read a review before I bought it , warning that it would break , so I bought 2 . The tip of my first one broke the first time I used it . You may be better off paying a bit more and getting a better tool . If you plan to use it once , this may be good enough . If you like changing your bands often , look elsewhere .	-1
The first time I tried to use it the pin broke ... and I was only using finger tip pressure straight down ... junk . The pin had less strength than the pencil lead for a Pentel mechanical pencil .	-1
Had a pair of these in the original vans ( not & # 34 ; off the wall & # 34 ; ) and they lasted me three years of hard wear and stood up for a few cleanings . Got this pair new , was shipped US Mail first off so my shoes were sitting next to the box for anyone to grab . Second thing is the quality is n't anything near the older vans , the nose part of the shoe 's sole did n't get enough adhesive and within minutes started to bubble . Not impressed , and will try something else next time . Though I had a friend tell me I can order the custom vans and get original quality , I 'm just not that interested anymore . If 50 bucks wo n't buy good skate shoes with Vans i 'm sure it will somewhere else .	-1
Until now I have not gone with Under Armour due to sizing ( the products are designed for those under 6 feet tall ) . After receiving two of these , I can tell you that the sizing issue has not been resolved . I also ordered Long Sleeve cold gear from another site that came today and those are perfect . Not sure why under armour does not make longer versions of their heat gear tops . I would gladly pay a few extra dollars for the right fit . These are going back .	-1
Whatever it says is the material , this is made of hard stuff that is not comfortable . These pants look odd and they are odd . Also , this is certainly not relaxed fit as advertised . The one I received was way too small , not the stated size . I returned them . Be forewarned .	-1
They are rough and uncomfortable . Also I think The size runs a bit small . All my clothes are 32x32 , but these are small in the waist .	-1
Barely fits foot let alone ankle and calf . If your calf is 10-12 & # 34 ; in diameter , then this is for you . If you 're nowhere near thin , you can forget it !	-1
Having had bought Pleaser shoes many times before I am well equipped in knowing that the shoes run small so order a half-size or whole size up . Sadly , even in sizing up , they were super small and really tight but for what I needed them for I did n't have time to get new ones so I kept them . The shoes are tight fitting around the leg which is nice because I hate when boots like this are bulky . I had to go to the store to buy 2 sets of padding for the insoles ( 2 for each foot ) because they are REALLY uncomfortable to walk in and stand in after about 20-30 min , there is NO support inside . The are so tight around the toes that if you DO wear them for more than 2 hours and you are on your feet the whole time you will suffer nerve damage like I did . I wore these in October and it is now January and I still have the nerve damage on the outer part of my feet to where I ca n't feel my last 2 toes or the outside of my foot anymore which sucks . Think when your foot is asleep and you ca n't feel it and it 's numb to the touch , that 's what I have going on almost 4 months now . These shoes are the worst .	-1
I wear slippers around the house all year long so wanted these for the summer months . I purchased a pair of Acorn slippers at Costco for almost half of what these cost . They fit perfectly and are so comfortable . I really wanted a pair in black because they do get dirty fast so purchased the black online . They are n't the same slippers . Apparently I 'm under the impression that Costco is selling a less expensive version as the soles are made differently but are made just as well . The top strap on these are heavily stitched around the front and they tend to dig into your skin . They are quite uncomfortable . I will wear them again but for now they are sitting in my closet . I did go back to Costco and they still had their version of this thong so purchased another pair in pink.. perfect . I wish Acorn would get it together and not sell one version at a cheaper price and then sell another version online for more money . They are n't the same slippers . Please offer both alternatives Acorn ! ! !	-1
I normally wear an 8 & 1/2 so I 'm sorta ' in the middle , but these 8-9 slippers are huge on me . I just wish Acorn would bring them out in single sizes as I 'm not sure a smaller one would work with these . The slippers themselves do n't have a lot of support but they 're okay for schlepping around in but not for all day on your feet .	-1
The thong part of the sandal was too short . Do n't think I 'll be wearing these since they are uncomfortable to wear .	-1
The length of the shoe was ample but the top of the shoe was too tight over my foot . I was very disappointed and returned it . The shoe felt very cushy but not supportive , almost too soft ?	-1
Seems cute and comfortable but not really.Sole is comfy but it is way too thick for walking and also btwn the toes it feels uncomfortable as well as on top of near the toes . Also embroidered company logo was irritating . couldnt they put it outside part of the sandal ? ? Returning .	-1
I bought a pair of these several years ago and they have been the most comfortable slippers I 've ever owned . I wear them all the time and only just now are they starting to fall apart , still as comfy as ever but the material has split open . I ordered a pair to replace them , same style , same size , and they are made differently now ! The toe separator has moved further down on the slipper making it less comfortable . The strap laying over the foot is much tighter and the top edge of the strap is digging into the tops of my feet which is painful . They also have a funny smell to them and look and feel as if they are made more cheaply . For example , the seams do not look or feel as well put together . Even the foot padding , which was my favorite thing about my old pair , is n't as comfy and fluffy as before . I am quite disappointed and wish I would 've tried these on in a store before buying online .	-1
As stated elsewhere , the shoe does need to be sized up a whole size from street shoes- I am a 7 and the 7.5 was too snug . I would have exchanged for an 8 if it were n't for the fact that there is NO LINING . On the inside of the shoe you can see the seams and two synthetic foam pads ( one for heel one for midfoot glued in there . It not only looks atrocious but it feels uncomfortable as well.So I ordered the Bloch Pump canvas shoes from Amazon instead ( which ironically have to be sized DOWN by 2 sizes ) .	-1
The shoe is fine but it 's just too small . I 'm normally a 6M in Sanshas . I sized up to 6.5 for these , but they 're way too small . I need at least a 7 , maybe 7.5 . Material does n't seem to stretch much .	-1
I purchased these and they were a little too big . I normally wear a size 12 in Nike Shoes so if that gives you some sort of an idea . I also did not like the gel inserts . I am a larger man 250+ and I felt like the princess and the pea . I guess if you already have that much weight pushing down on your feet its not a good thing to have something under them that they are not use to .	-1
These sandals have a tendency to pinch the sides of my feet ... They are nowhere near wide . Beside the pinching making the shoes very uncomfortable , there is a loud SQUEAK with every step , which I prefer my footwear not to do .	-1
Although these flip flops look very nice , the toe bed is too long , I end up catching them on stairs and such , ca n't even consider wearing them at a rocky beach I 'd be flat on my face . The width is also for a narrow foot , the straps are tight ... If I had n't worn them , I would have sent them back .	-1
I 'm size 7 and this feels like size 6.5 . The front tho..seemed right length but the back seems a bit short , and the straps were too tight . Not sure if the straps would be comfortable even if it was n't tight tho ... The sole padding feels just ok but the material they use should be questioned ... I dont think its comfortable on the skin at all . And its true the bottom can be slippery coz it 's pretty much flat . I do n't think it 's worth the money . If it was $ 13 bux I would get an exchange for a bigger size.My questions is why the hell do these companies make sandals that are uncomfortable and charge us what it 's to worth ? ? ? That is plain stupid . It is OBVIOUS they didnt use a shoe model ... Thank god for amazon tho I can just get a refund hassle free .	-1
They seem very nice , but were two sizes too small . I had to give them away to a lady that normally wears two sizes smaller .	-1
I had to return mine , but I was sad about it . Just fits way too small . material was soft and the design is nice .	-1
It said black and it was black but it also had this one inch logo on the front ... did not expect that . I guess I thought wrong , thought & # 34 ; shelf bra & # 34 ; meant there will be padding . There were no padding , only another layer of cloth at the breast . Not what I wanted so returned this product . Fabric feels nice , though .	-1
I wanted a cami I could use without wearing a bra , , , ,Not made for big busted girls ... Does n't give us much support ... ..	-1
Levi 's changed the 569 into skinny jeans . Career suicide if you ask me . I will never go back , even when they get smart and change them back after this terrible skinny jeans fad is over .	-1
Ordered 42Wx32L . In normal pants the width would be just OK and sometimes a little snug . Not with these pants . The width is at least 46W actually . The pants are nowhere near the body , at least there is a 4 inch gap , plus if you streatch them the gap could be easily doubled . I would say order at least one size smaller , but I would not risk it anymore . The length is correct though .	-1
the waist size was big for me so i returned it . but i am planning to get one with 1 inch smaller waist	-1
I called Levi 's to see why they are now low on the hips . They informed me people called and asked us to . I said , well people that LIKED the way they fit were n't calling ! ? ! Why do n't they make NEW designs , instead of changing what people like ! ? ! We also had to get 2 pairs . 1st pair the seam went across the front of your leg , instead of the side . They were also super long . I am so dissapointed . I told Levi 's we are going to have go to another company , there is n't anything left for my husband with them . They do n't have anything to replace these now that they are changed . On a side note for people smaller sized they said the closest thing to these are Silvertab Levi 's . Sadly , they do n't make them up to 44 , they stop at 42 .	-1
I returned the item for a slim fit , because this was baggy on the legs and rear . Not a good look for me .	-1
I only buy Levi 's . I buy two styles . I know my sizes well - fortunately they have not changed in over 20 years . Unfortunately , Levi is incapable of delivering a consistent cut ( both waist and leg length ) . This is the second pair ( of 5 recent purchases ) where the pant size is not close to the marked sized . THis one is monstrous in the waste ( at least two inches too large ) and short in the leg ( at least one inch short ) . Frustrating	-1
Initially I was very happy with these pants , but have come to believe they are seconds . The side seams do not run true . I was going to order others , but will not now and will watch to see that I order nothing from this seller .	-1
I am a pretty normal guy . Not fat or overweight at all . I run , so my thighs are also bit muscular . These are skin tight on my thighs and seat . There is almost no rise in these jeans . For reference , I ordered the 31 waist and had room for a water bottle between the waistband and my waist . So , skin tight thighs and seat , but oversized waist . I did n't measure , but the 31 must have been closer to a 38 or so.Terrible sizing.The color looked nice .	-1
levi 's 569 loose jeans are n't loose anymore.they WERE my favorite.now they cut them smaller and i ca n't buy them anymore.before the change , these fit me very well.i 've always had to be careful about jeans being to small in the legs.on average , i take a 36 x 34 and my upper leg measures approx 23 inches.now i am babying the 2 decent pairs of old 569s that i have left.washing on hand wash , hanging to dry.guess i 'll be looking in thrift stores to find the good old loose cut.or wearing sweats everywhere . nobody wants to see that .	-1
The material is as thin as paper , very different from what I am use to . They definitely are making these as cheap as possible , save your money . Not what I would expect from Levis .	-1
I thought that these would be the same as the 569 's I had bought a couple months ago at a local retail store . They were my first Levi 's that I 've ever bought . I thought that the ones I had purchased recently were the ones made with the thinner material and different cuts mentioned in the reviews on here ; however , this is not the case . These 569 's are of really poor quality , and not worth the money at all . I definitely will not be buying 569 's ever again . Wrangler 's are much better than this ... if only they fit the way the old 569 's used to ...	-1
These pants fit as loose as expected in the seat , crotch , and legs . They are very comforable . However , the denim is quite thin , which is n't necessarily a bad thing for comfort but may be for durability . They feel a little more like dress pants when on than like jeans ! I would buy them again if they wear well.Update 1/23/14 : I took the jeans down to 1 star , if I could go negative I would . These jeans wear horribly . They are a few months old and they are falling apart . Belt loops have fallen off . The coin pocket area of both pair I purchased is ripped . To address these issues , I have not worn them for any kind of manual labor work . Normal office work , and I have never used the coin pocket . Levis quality has went down the drain . I absolutely will never again buy Levis products . That is $ 80 wasted on two pair.Run , do n't walk away from this product .	-1
Ridiculous ... other jeans of the same size and cut dont have such a large & # 34 ; pouch & # 34 ; in the crotch , will not buy these again .	-1
I have historically worn a 34 & # 34 ; waist , and I ordered three pairs of pants at the same time with loose fitting waists . The other two were 550 's , and they were perfect . If I 'm a few pounds overweight , the & # 34 ; loose & # 34 ; part of the 34 & # 34 ; waist lets me cheat a little bit and still fit in a 34 & # 34 ; pair of pants , comfortably , and without a belt.That 's where the 569s fall short . These 34 & # 34 ; waist pants are more like a 38 & # 34 ; waist . Even when I can comfortably fill out a 36 & # 34 ; , I have to have a belt or else these pretty much fall right off my waist . They are just loose ... Just too loose . Unacceptable for a fit really , and not like other Levis jeans that I 've experienced.Also - they just do n't feel right . The material seems to be more thin than what I 'm used to and a lot looser than the 550 's that I prefer.Honestly if they did n't say Levis on the tag , I would n't think that these jeans were from Levis . Not just the fit , but also the material . I really regret not putting these back in a box and sending them right back when they first arrived . I tried washing them on hot , and wearing them often , and they are just how they are . No impressive .	-1

These , I 'm sorry , do not stay in place ! ! Move all over..MY ERROR..I thought it had a sticky backing..I did n't read the info clearly ...	-1
I found that these caused irritation to my sensitive skin ; I found the use of the silicone composition product work much better .	-1
What are these ? ? they do n't cover your nippies ... .ended up returning it . it was almost like i made a something out of craft paper and i was pasting the petals on to me . it a stupid product .	-1
I put boots on . and they pinch the foot , on the instep , above toes . could not walk in them . this boot looks nice , but wow they crease when you walk . and I WALK FOR A LIVEN ! ! ! !	-1
After reading the reviews on these shoes , I bought a half size larger than I normally wear . I was really surprised that even with the larger size , I could n't even get my foot in them . They are being returned and it 's going to cost me an additional $ 6 because I am having the package picked up at my house . I 'm disabled and do n't have any other choice of how to get them back to Amazon . I ca n't imagine why a manufacturer would produce a shoe and keep it on the market knowing it has a size issue . I hope Amazon will remove this product , since so many people have had the same issue .	-1
These look nothing like the picture shown . They are almost white with a little bit of black.Also , the leather is not buttery soft like other Sam Edelmans I have which make them much less comfortable . These went back right away .	-1
Price was right but the fabric is a little rough feeling and I really dislike the seam running down the inside against the face ! I think seamless microfiber is the way to go for a face mask/balaclava .	-1
Dont like these . they make your legs look really heavy , and I have very shapely legs . I would never purchase them again .	-1
I purchased these for my daughter for a St. Patty 's day parade . They were huge on her and she is 12 years old . But the part that I did n't like was how extremely thin they are . She had to wear regular tights under them to keep warm .	-1
I could not pull these tights over my butt ! They are like super low rise tights ! Hated them ! Also , I am 5'3 & # 34 ; and I weigh 130 pounds . Maybe these are for children .	-1
Unfortunately , I 'm big . I have fat thighs and I know it . But when something says `` one size fits most , '' I expect it not to cut off my circulation . I understand , because of my size , that I would normally need garters for stockings , since stockings tend to bunch and roll down on me . However , I have to wear these stockings just above my knees so they wo n't cut off my circulation . I 'm only a size 12 , which is still in the `` average '' range , so why a `` one size fits most '' item wo n't fit an average-sized person is beyond me . From now on , I 'm buying stockings that have size categories that INCLUDE Queen sizes .	-1
Super fragile , not reinforced in the crotch area , so they sorta feel like they 're going to split there , especially since they 're a little small . The color changes from one stripe to the next are not dyed , they are actually different threads , so there are little black threads and little purple threads that stick out at each color change spot on the inside , and you can see them . They look weird .	-1
Be warned , these are n't much good for more than one time use . They stretch and rip really fast .	-1
Wrong color came in the mail . Did not match the description that was on the site . Be careful . Great quality though .	-1
Cute colors but too tight around the thighs . If you have thin thighs , these might fit you . My thighs are squeezed to the point of uncomfortable.. I wear a size 8 in skinny jeans .	-1
I think these are girls Nylons instead of women 's . I 'm only 5'4 & # 34 ; and they were about 12 inches too short .	-1
Alrighty ... plus size/queen size people do n't always have thin , long legs ... I have thick legs and a smaller waist ... these stocking were so tight at the top of my thighs , it hurt . I have had this issue with leg avenue before . I think this company needs to research queen size . I am usually a size 1x ... these stockings should have fit .	-1
I agree with the person who said that they looked like regular pantyhose with holes cut out on the sides ... and I have long legs . They do n't look like garters at all .	-1
This is easily the lowest rating I 've ever given any item on Amazon . I can live with this product having been shipped 4 days later than estimated and it came packaged well except that I ordered them in BLACK and received them in WHITE . I have n't worn white stockings since I was in Catholic school . I also hate having to send things back and now I 've got to wait more than HALF OF THE TIME . I ordered these 2 weeks in advance than when I needed them and now with having to send them back because I was sent the wrong color I & # 8217 ; ll never have them for the event I & # 8217 ; m going to , despite planning in advance . So upset with this seller.Plus the white stockings are n't very nice , they 're cloudy and look cheap . If you 're looking for white stockings in this style then you should pass on these . If you 're looking for black , well - good luck getting the right color the first time .	-1
I just received this today and will say I 'm very disappointed . I got the outfit on and noticed that the black dye of the bodystocking was all over my hands and my skin . Not to mention I 'm 5'7 and very thin and it did n't fit me at all , I know these are suppose to fit tight on the body and mine I could pull away to at least fit another person in and was baggy .	-1
Depending on the brand sneaker I wear a 10.5 or an 11 . Based on the reviews I ordered a 11 wide 2 E. The sneaker is too narrow . I did not reordered a larger size as I did think the sneakers would be comfortable to wear . Returned .	-1
I do n't understand why there is so many sizing errors with shoes these days . I measured my foot , heel to toe and it 's 11 inches . That means I should get a size 11 shoe , right ? Well I ordered these in size 11 and when I FORCED them on , they were so tight I felt like the circulation of my foot would be cut off and my big toe was literally jammed into the end of the shoe . I 've decided not to buy reeboks ever again .	-1
I do n't know what 's wrong exactly with these shoes , but after trying to get used to them I finally chucked them to the trash .	-1
When I opened the box , I thought for sure I had received a narrow size by mistake . After examining them , they only had a `` 12 '' on the shoe and the box with no width designation , so I assume they are considered `` medium '' , but let me tell you , they are far from any medium I have worn . This is an obvious reason why one should try shoes on in a store before buying them on the internet - especially if it is something they have n't worn previously , or in a long time.The quality of the shoe is also sub-par in my opinion . On one shoe , the toe upper is sewn crooked and makes a strange folded crease in the leather when I wear it . After wearing New Balance for years , these simply seem cheap - and I do n't just mean inexpensive ( which they are ) .Bottom line for me is ill fitting , uncomfortable and inconsistent quality shoes equal a lesson learned in shoe buying .	-1
These were not the usual glove leather that I am used to in the Reebok princess sneakers . These are more like counterfeit knock off in a Reebok box . The material was hard , stiff , man made and cheap man made . The shoes that listed as wide were not even a medium . The price was comparable to market value but not quality . I bought a pair fory mom and me and they both went back . I wo n't be buying from this vender ever again . However I had no problem getting a return label or my money refunded . The star is for their customer service . The shoes get nothing .	-1
Too small and narrow and very disappointed , we have purchased before and this is totally different sizing . what is going on reebok ?	-1
I sent these back . They are PLASTIC ! They used to be leather , and their softness was one of their best features . My mother-in-law has bad bunions and these will NEVER stretch to her foot . A huge disappointment !	-1
This is NOT the former princess aerobic shoe . Firstly , it is not even made of leather like it used to be . Secondly , it in no way resembles the comfort that the princess shoe used to have . Thirdly , the fit is nothing like it used to be . I still have an old pair that I checked and they ARE made of leather and they are a half size smaller than this shoe . This shoe was about 3/4 inch shorter . These are made in Viet Nam . I am very disappointed in Reebok .	-1
The last Reebok Princess I bought had no arch support . What a disappointment . They just fit differently from my older two pair , same size , but not comfortable at all . I 'll never buy again at any price .	-1
Bring back the better quality materials and better fit . I agree with recent reviews : the material is a brittle , non breathable materials . Vinyl -- but not even any semblance of breathability or a material that will move with foot . These are listed as sneakers for aerobics . No ! They would kill your feet . I am very disappointed , as I 've used Reebok 's Princess for walking and exercise for a long , long time . I 'd gladly pay more for a better product . Returning same day I received them . Very disappointing , as these used to be a great product .	-1
The Princess Sneaker was one of my all time favorite shoe by Reebok . In my opinion , something has changed about this shoe , the leather does n't feel right . Something is off about it , the softness is n't there and the wide did n't feel like it normally would . I wonder if I got a rip-off version of this shoe ? Just speaking on my experience .	-1
I 've worn Reebok Princess tennis shoes for many years cause I found them to be very comfortable from the first day I put them on . However , this pair is very disappointing and I 'll have to return them . I ordered the same size as always but these are way too large . And , what happened to the awesome arch support in these shoes ? This pair did n't have it at all .	-1
This sneaker runs very small and had I known that it was n't leather like they used to be , I never would have ordered them .	-1
These are not as comfortable boat shoes as the other boat shoes I have purchased the leather is very stiff and hard the color is good but they did not soften like other shoes I have got	-1
They were somewhat snug but I felt they would stretch over time . The squeaky noise they made upon every step was very annoying . I returned them .	-1
It 's a nice , inexpensive watch . It 's Casio , so it 's gon na work & keep good time . Nice looking , easy to read , gives me time , day & date at a glance . Good night light . Manual was a bit tedious to follow at first , but once you get the gest of what 's going on , it 's not too difficult . If you have a large wrist ... forget it , though . I do n't have a very large wrist , yet I 'm using the next to last hole . Here 's my main problem with this watch . One of the reasons I bought it , is to have a second alarm ... my cell phone being the main alarm . BUT UNLESS THE WATCH IS WITHIN 4 INCHES OF YOUR EAR , YOU WILL NOT HEAR IT ! ! ! ! ! ! Obviously , this applies to the countdown alarm , as well . Other than that , I do like this watch ... LOL.UPDATE : Had this watch awhile now . Liking it less and less . Besides not being able to hear the alarm , I 'm disliking the band more & more . As I stated , I do n't have a large wrist , yet I 'm using the next to last hole . When the watch is centered on the front of my wrist , the buckle in the back is almost to the side of my wrist . The buckle wants to center itself , which moves the watch face to the side . Not liking this aspect . I gave downgraded it down to a 2 star .	-1
I wanted a watch that I did n't have to worry about what activities I was doing and be cautious about easily dinging it up . This is a very well built waterproof watch , but beyond basic timekeeping , the other features really seemed like an afterthought . The digital display is small and dim and in moderate to bright light , it is very difficult to read . The recessed buttons were a good idea , but actually using them is difficult ( keeping a button pressed down for any length of time kills your fingers ) . The watch face is small and barely luminous in the dark . I dread having to change the time back an hour for DST or when traveling because you have to hold down the buttons for a looong time until the hands make it all the way around again . It 's a decent rugged timepiece , but do n't get it for it 's bells and whistles .	-1
I loved the watch but it looks ridiculously small on my wrist that I had to give it to my son gladly . After measuring the dial I found out that it measures 29 mm and not 44 as advertised on Amazon . What a dissapointment for me and a delight for my son .	-1
Watch is almost too light . The digital window is only for those who can see well . I got tires of the buttons for setting the time and not a stem . If you use a cell phone to text and not to talk this watch may be fine for you . For the older user it may become a bother to use and reset . Others will speak of the plastic screen that scratches easily , but that wo n't be a problem for most . I jest got tired of keeping up with the manuels and the buttons to set time .	-1
i 'm returning these because , 1. they itch my skin , feet and ankle . 2. not warm enough . did not meet my needs . but the itching was enough to consider returning them .	-1
They are itchy at the end of the day . They do not wash well and & # 34 ; pill & # 34 ; . I bought a few different brands to try . I would not buy Wigwam again .	-1
I wore these socks ONCE and they developed a hole in the toe . I bought a few pairs , it happened with every pair . I DO cut my toenails . I DO wear good shoes ( Nike , Reebok ) , and I also bought two other brands of socks at the same time as these . ALL the other socks are still great after many wearing and washings . I am not exagerating when I tell you that ALL the pairs of these socks are in the garbage . They look sturdy , feel great ! One would NEVER imagine that each and every pair fell apart in ONE or two days in use.I have no idea how others gave these socks a good rating .	-1
I wanted some quality socks and these are , but they feel rough , too rough . I LOVE the Wigwam Cool-Lite Mid socks ( see my review ) , but these are not something I 'd recommend .	-1
purchased these four months ago and wear them a couple times a week , casual wear only.The front toe of one of the shoes is coming apart showing the material underneath.very disappointed in the life of these under relatively light wear.I Need a wide width and ordered wide but my feet swim in these shoes.. im tossing them and wont buy Skechers again ; After reading other reviews , both good and bad , Im thinking that some of these that fail quickly are probably knockoffs disguised as real ... I wont buy these online again ...	-1
I bought the correct size and I have several other Skechers shoes that I love . However , I could n't put the shoes on . I found them too tight around the top . THe idea of `` slip on '' is really not correct . I think making these shoes with a regular tongue and velcro straps would be a better idea . They would be easy to put on . I returned them the day after they arrived .	-1
I love Skechers shoes . In fact I have 2 pairs of the Skechers D'Lites Opal mules . I live in them and they are so comfortable . BUT thinking the D'lites were comfortable so should these slip on shoes . Boy was I wrong . I wear a medium size 6 . I ordered a size 6 for these shoes.My other Skechers are a size 6M . It was so painful trying to get them to slip on my feet . I have had other & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; slip on shoes that did not go on as tight as these . When I compared the front of this shoe to my other skechers shoes , my other shoes showed a wider appearance as compared to these . These were much narrower . I may try a & # 34 ; wide & # 34 ; version of this shoe but not sure . At any rate , I did not keep them and sent them back . The size is not true to fit in my opinion . Sorry Skechers you blew it on this style shoe for me . I 'll stick to your mules .	-1
I had owned Sketchers before but these just did n't feel right to me . I did order a wide and they just seemed not wide enough and hard on the sole	-1
These shoes run small . I have an 8C ( wide ) foot , and I bought a 9C/D ( wide ) and they were so tight/small that my toes went numb within a few minutes . I worked with them for a full shift , of which I had to remove them several times to let the feeling back into my feet ! No arch support at all . If you have narrow flat feet these will probably work for you . I 'm sending these back ... ..I would give 0 stars but I had to give one ... .	-1
these shoes were a huge let down . i work on concrete floors all day and these shoes from day one were the most uncomfortable shoes i would say ever but i had another pair of skechers that were like this also . the top of the shoes actually bruised the top of my feet . even with gel inserts these were very uncomfortable .	-1
My wife was tickled with the way this looked and felt until she tried to fasten it . She regularly wears a 36 but this one would not fasten by at least two inches . So beware and order the next larger band size .	-1
Nice style , good fit , terrible smell . I tried two different pair of the brown . Everything started out OK with each , but about a week into wearing them the musty smell of the leather became overwhelming . I do n't mean a new leather smell . I mean a bad , embarrassing , pungent smell that followed everywhere . My guess is something must have been wrong with the leather . But after two pairs of the same problem , I gave up .	-1
The fit is tight . I wear a size 10M but these are narrow . My big toe knuckle rubs the edge and becomes very sore . I have to were socks to prevent blisters making the fit much tighter . I sit driving all day so I just wear them when I need to walk . Cost too high for my amount of wear . I like this style of shoe for work . I had found the brown version at Payless Shoes three years ago ; that 's how long it took to wear that pair out . This year Payless did only the black , white , and some other bright colors . That made me sad . Then after my search for brown athletic mary janes I became sadder . Very hard to find ! Finally I found these .	-1
the back of shoe for me does not come up high enough to grip top of heel , so they just slipped really bad - the strap did not help keep them on - so returned	-1
These shoes were comfortable when I first tried them on , but when walking I noticed my right foot leaning inwards and upon closer inspection the right heel dips down slightly . Are they seconds or did I get a dud pair ? ? Also , I got blisters on each foot the first time I wore them , which was extremely painful walking back to my car 1.5 km away after work ! I did n't think I need to wear socks . I 'm keeping them as they 've been worn otherwise I would return them . I 'm hoping I 'll get used to the heel leaning part and the blisters wo n't be an issue once they 're worn in . They do look nice though and were initially very comfortable , hence the 2 stars .	-1
I normally love Sketchers but my daughter complained that the straps on this one made her feet hurt . Pity because they look so cute	-1
I bought these to wear on a trip . I wore them around the house first , and they seemed to be fine , but while traveling it quickly became apparent that both my feet were pronating in these shoes to the point I could barely walk in them . On top of that , no matter how tight I strapped them , the back was too wide and my heels moved around in them . I ordered 9 medium , which is my true size . I am returning them .	-1
One pair was fine ; the other had one normal leghole and one wide leghole that made the pair unwearable ( there was no support for your member , and your sack was banging against the skin of your thigh ! ) YUCK.I got a set last year and the legholes were symmetrical and the underwear , laying on your bed , was square-ish . These pairs are triangular with the circular legholes , like most other underwear.I do n't want other underwear , I want my comfy old Munsingwears ! I would not buy these again . ( I 'd return them if that wasnt gross . )	-1
When the shoes arrived , several of the waxed ends of stitches were sticking out sharply to poke me . I pushed them down , but a few still irritate after walking in these shoes for over an hour . The seams also pucker inwards and hurt.The dye on the leather still rubs off onto skin , and fibers come off the inside and off the laces , even though I have worn these several times , and worn them in water twice.There is no support or cushioning . The heel has a hard leather lining , but the front feels like there is nothing between your foot and the rubber outsole besides one sheet of leather . Did my pair just come with insoles missing or something ? The toebox is narrow.Around where the instep is , there is a noticeable odd step down to the front of the shoe from the heel.What attracted me to this shoe were the interesting colors and aesthetically pleasing shape , but I found that these were the only good things . The leather is of high quality , but who cares if it has been sewn together with careless stitching ? I will not wear them regularly ; hopefully they 'll at least last a long time to make up for the price . I 'm pretty surprised that anyone has found these comfortable enough for daily use , as they do n't have any more support or cushioning than sturdy rubber sandals . [ Edited on 2012-10-02 ] I wore them in salt water on the beach and they shrunk significantly and became stiff after being in the sun . Can no longer wear them comfortably , because rinsing with fresh water did not help . Now I wish I had gone a half size up .	-1
I bought these slippers when Amazon had them for less than $ 15 , so I probably should n't complain , BUT ... First , the size is quite small . I wear a 10 and ordered a 10 and an 11 , based apon others reviews . The 11 BARELY fits , and I can feel my toes bumping against the ends of the slippers when I walk.As far as quality goes , the slippers do look nice , but unlike other similar slippers I 've owned ( and paid a lot more for ) there is little to no cushioning inside the shoes . I 'm not just referring to the cushioning between your feet and the floor , but between your feet and the seams where the sole is sewn onto the bottom . I can feel the pronounced ridges of the seams all the way around the bottom of my foot , and they make standing in the slippers for more than a moment or two quite painful . If the slippers were bigger , maybe I would n't feel it , but I finally had to put in a pair of insoles , which did help a bit . All in all , I 'm pretty dissapointed .	-1
I bought these last year and tried them on - too small , but I thought perhaps they 'd stretch out a bit . WRONG ! I 've been wearing them now - still almost new - for a month now w/ no luck on any stretching . My toes are smushed all the way to the end and they hurt ! I even have a narrow foot , for what it 's worth - not that the width would affect much . Still - bummer..	-1
Another reviewer complained that seams caused discomfort . I carefully inspected mine and found that the sheepskin in the sole had been pieced together , sewn together so that there are ridges to be felt by the foot bottom . This is an absolute NO-NO in the manufacture of shoes . One does NOT utilize scraps of construction material in this manner . Someone needs to supervise this factory .	-1
I normally wear 10D in most shoes ; I ordered these in a men 's 10.They were far too narrow . I wound up giving them to an 11 year old girl and though they were a bit long they fit her ok.They were also remarkably heavy , which I suppose could be seen as a sign of quality but which I personally found annoying ; why would I want heavy slippers ? If you can find a size that fits you and do n't mind the weight you might like these as they seemed to be made well .	-1
At first these slippers seemed to be very nice . My husband wears a 10.5 shoe so I went with the 11s . They were still pretty tight across the top of his foot . After just a few days of wear the lining inside at the heal started separating . Definitely not the quality I expected from a slipper at this price range . Thanks Amazon for your great return policy : - )	-1
I searched all over to try to determine what the manufacturer was claiming in a description of a & # 34 ; warm , wooly lining. & # 34 ; I was fairly sure they were n't selling sheepskin , though sheepskin is available for around the same price . In one of the product photos taken looking down from overhead , the tag is clearly visible and the & # 34 ; warm wooly lining & # 34 ; is 100 % acrylic . It 's not surprising that some customers find it flying out of the slipper in clumps after brief use .	-1
I gave these to my husband as a Christmas gift and they were very small . I did not bother re-ordering but may have needed 2 sizes up , not sure .	-1
The slippers by Tamarac are very nice looking and comfortable ( as long as you buy a size or two bigger than you normally wear -- and for a short while , anyway ) . The lining is not genuine sheep skin . It is some crappy synthetic fiber that rolls into little balls and/or tubes and , after a month or so of wearing , it will rapidly disappear -- resulting in very cold and unhappy feet . I will never buy this product again .	-1
My teen son bought these for me at Christmas because of the affordable price . I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled , but there were also a couple other issues . First , the bottom was extremely slippery ( pun intended ) . Maybe this would improve with wear ( like outside on concrete ) , but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor . Second , the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe . I could feel it clearly , even with socks on . I would have needed to cut this tag out if I had not returned them due to the size problem .	-1
The interior quality of this set of slippers was n't very good & they did n't last but one winter . The interior started to fall apart .	-1
I bought these for my husband based on the good reviews here . He has a little bit of a wide foot , so I ordered a 10 wide , thinking he 'd be able to wear them with or without socks . Well , when they arrived , my husband could barely get his foot into it . Once he did ( without socks ) his foot looked like a sausage in a casing inside the slipper ! He said the bottoms were n't very well cushioned either , and the soles are not very flexible at all . We had to return them . I paid a bit more and ordered him some Uggs instead . Hopefully they 'll be a better fit and quality ...	-1
The good news ... these slippers look and fit great ! And they actually feel great -- keep my feet nice and warm , not to hot or cold -- until I actually stood and walked in them . The bad news ... WTF ! ! ! ! ... the feel on the sole of my heel is like something is protruding up from the slipper 's heel/sole ... both left and right slipper.How could this be ? ? ? I literally thought there was some kind of foreign object lodged in the slippers . Not so ... just feels like there is . Is this a manufacturing defect , or could these slippers actually be designed to be this uncomfortable ... and PAINFUL ! I really wanted to keep these slippers . Like I said they look and feel great as long as you never have to stand or walk in them . Sending them back tomorrow ... ..WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT ! ! ! !	-1
These look much uglier in person than in the photo..Even after deciding that I would put up with the looks , I quickly noticed that the entire stitching along the outside of one of the shoes was missing , and the sole was not attached to the upper.Poor build quality , and very clunky to wear .	-1
When I first bought these slippers for my husband , they looked and felt great . They were really warm and comfortable . My husband wore these around the house for just over a month and they are literally coming apart at the seams . What a waste of money ! For the price I paid it should last a lot longer .	-1
My only complaint is that they are really warm ... almost too warm sometimes = ) . But GREAT for stepping outside to grab the paper . Very comfortable and true to size ( I bought the size 15 and they fit me well . I wear a size 15 narrow and was bummed they do n't offer it in a narrow , but it 's only a little lose having ordered the Medium width . They leather looks very nice and overall the shoe appears to have good fit and finish -- I 'm very pleased with the purchase.EDIT : These slippers started to fall apart within 30 days of use . The stitching started coming off and then the rubber started to peel back from the leather . By month 5 , the sole completely slit away from the slipper . In this price range I expect the slippers to go a few years , not 5 months of LIGHT usage around the house . I had to change my star ratting to 1 start because if a product does n't hold up , it 's useless how comfortable it is .	-1
I bought these slippers for my husband the end of October 2012 and in 2 1/2 months they are totally worn out . The sole on the right foot cracked and split and the seams along the top part of the foot on both both feet have broken away from the sole ! I am very disappointed as I thought these sheepskin slippers would be durable . I would never recommend this brand again !	-1
I ordered these for my husband for a Christmas gift . He really liked them and wore them a lot . After about a month , the stitching started coming undone from the sole . These were not expensive , so I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
These slippers are definitely not worth the price . My husband has had a pair for only two months and they are falling apart . He barely wears them so I do not understand how they could possibly be falling apart already but they are . PLus he sayus there is a seam right down the middle of teh sole that makes them really uncomfortable .	-1
I 've been wearing dockers for a lot of years . I 've grown accustomed to the fact that eventually they begin to fray at the edges and repeated washings will accelerate that process . That 's fine . However , with this new batch of pants I 've noticed that after the very first washing there is fading at the bottom of the pant legs and along the waistband.That is too fast . I expect these pants to be able to stand up to many runs through the washer before the edges begin to fade . I did give two stars because they truly do n't wrinkle which is immensely helpful . But I 'm really disappointed how much of the color faded from the edges after just the first washing .	-1
Fit was way too tight , pinched and itched , and then broke into holes and ran before end of day . What a waste of $ 8.00 . I will not purchase this again . The size I ordered should have fit fine ( Queen ) . But they do look pretty and sexy when on ( I ordered sheer black ) .	-1
These slippers are blue and made of wool felt with suede trim . Deceiving ad.description . I returned them . Box they were shipped in says clearly wool ... .not ad on website it says suede.Very dissatisfied .	-1
I got these for my elderly father and they were way too tight for his swollen feet so I had to return them .	-1
These were a Christmas gift for my husband . Unfortunately Ugg took it upon themselves to send me a different style AND a different size than I ordered . Not sure what the point of that is . Next time I 'll order from Zappos as I normally do .	-1
Gave these as a gift and the recipient was surprised at how `` dainty '' they were . More importantly , they arrived broken , so she returned them and received credit because they were no longer in stock . I see that they are now available , but would not order them again because of the description I received from the recipient . She did love my 5x7mm swiss blue topaz earrings in white gold so I thought these would be an even more beautiful and elegant gift . I was wrong and wish I 'd sent her the same as mine .	-1
it is n't microfiber - something unpleased , hard , not soft and bad . looks like my grandmother underwear . lost of moneythis bra is horrible . I 'm not a fan of cone-shaped boobs that stick out in opposite directions .	-1
My fault as I accidently ordered the incorrect size and had to return it . Waiting until after the holidays to re-order the correct size . Pat	-1
I bought this and I had to return it right away ... I tried it on and it fits like I have 2 cones on my chest ( very unattractive ) then it just does not look like what the model has on . I guess that you get what you pay for ...	-1
if you look thru our reviews we bought and returned a bunch of bras , 19 of them and only one was good and this was not it ... .it would have been ok with about half as much material	-1
It 's a fine watch , but do n't rely too much on the `` water resistant '' label . I 've had similar Timex watches that had no trouble with leakage from being worn while swimming or kayaking . But as chance would have it , I got one that leaked ( badly ) from being worn in the water . ( No button pushes under water or any other action that would have increased chance of leakage ; it just leaked . ) Too late to return to Amazon , and Timex warranty coverage for this sort of thing is n't clear . ( Besides , shipping both ways would probably come up to half the cost of replacing with a new watch . ) Too bad , it 's otherwise a watch with a great feature set , maintains accuracy reasonably well , etc .	-1
I wore this watch for a couple of weeks . I never take my watches off , which has never been a problem with trusty ol ' Timex Expeditions . In truth , the band always wears out long before the watch does . In fact , I 've never had a watch wear out . And I wear them swimming , hot tubbing , showering , bathing , everything . But this one , the cheesy band broke in two weeks . I just ordered a new band for it for 13 dollars rather than return it and I got a good deal on the watch but it still peeves me .	-1
Not this one . It starts and stops so often that I do n't think it 's ever been right even once since I got it . I had to come back to read the description to be sure I had n't accidentally bought a self-winding watch and just was n't swinging my arm around energetically enough . Nope This one supposedly has a battery . I just needed something cheap for work . Well , if it does n't work , it is n't cheap . Of course , I threw the packaging and receipt away and never filled out the warranty , so it will just lie around in my junk drawer until the next time I do a purge . If Timex ca n't make a watch that runs , what can they do ? If it told time , it would have been just what I was looking for . Comfortable , not hideous , big numbers , and ... Indiglo . I 'm a sucker for Indiglo . But you do n't need Indiglo to find out what time it is n't .	-1
I loved this watch , and the previous one of the same design . In both cases , the strap caught on something while I was moving my arm , and it broke . Poor craftsmanship . So disappointed . Once I thought was a fluke , twice ?	-1
I bought this especially because it had a date window ( I never know what the date is ) but it 's too small to read . It also got stuck on the same number and would n't move . Because the watch was n't expensive I did n't want to spend another $ 6-7 to ship it back . but I would n't buy it again .	-1
3 Timex watches in the past year . All three were great for a week or to . this one the date did n't change properly . Every day or so I 'd have to correct the date . Pain in the but . Another of the Timex watches I purchased hour hand moves slightly to slow , after a few months when the minute hand was on 12 , the hour hand would be mid-way between two hours . The third Times simply broke , one of the band pins popped for no apparent reason and the watch fell to the ground , the back popped off and I could n't find it ... I used to , and now do again , use Fossil watches . Much finer quality at a fairly reasonable price ...	-1
Great classic design but low quality . Had to return it because it was impossible to get the time right . darn .	-1
I never intended to use the band that came with this watch , so I wo n't comment on that . The watch istelf was set to a date about 15 days away from actual , so I had to wind it for a long time to reach the right date . In the process , the winding stem came out . I was able to screw it back in . On an older Timex that would never happen . Timex used to be the go-to cheapie that still had reasonable quality ; great for people like me who are a bit hard on watches . Somehow , I do n't think this one will be around very long .	-1
As with all Seiko Watches this one keeps great time but it 's very hard to put on your wrist . The little prongy thing that goes through the holes in the band keeps going of the left or right and that makes it hard to clasp . In fact I just gave it away to Goodwill because I was tired fighting with it . If you buy it you may wish to think about replacing the band with something better . That being said it 's a bargain for the price .	-1
It 's a great looking watch . Clean design with an easy to read dial . I love that part . Plus , the indiglo really works well . However ... while it 's a great looking watch , sadly , this watch has been given away due to its LUDICROUS ticking . It may seem minor , but it drove me and anyone around me absolutely nuts . I work in a quiet environment and it 's absurd the amount of noise the movement makes . I have other inexpensive watches that are near silent , so it is n't an intrinsic value held by inexpensive watches . I left this watch on my kitchen counter and could hear it through the living room , down the hall and into my bedroom . This does n't exactly instill any notion of `` quality '' or give me any faith in the Timex brand . I can not recommend this item .	-1
I am a 40F and this bra although it is pretty does not hold or lift the girls up . I will be sticking with Goddess . This bra is good for night-time lounging around the house .	-1
For some reason my wife felt that these did not fit right as per their size . We returned them as she would not wear them .	-1
This was a very dissapointing purchase . This bra is not at all what it is glammed up to be . Material is cheap and the bra is not well constructed to support the full figured woman . Bought my usual size but it was a bit large . If you want a well constructed bra , good fit , lift and support buyer beware this bra wo n't do it . Do n't buy .	-1
Would not recommend runs small ... .stick uncomfortable pointy ... everything you do n't want in a bra ... ..it is not something I would ever buy again ! ~	-1
This bra may work for those of us with bullet or more pointy-shaped breats , but if your rounded , like me , this bra is ENTIRELY UNSUITABLE . Even ordering a cup size down , I would have had to stuff something in the nipple area just to fill out the pointed front of the cup . Weirdness ! And even if it had fit , the front seams are so obvious and unsightly that tee shirts are out of the question ! Let the Madonna jokes fly . This one went promptly back .	-1
This bra is pretty , but has very pointy cups ! The cups did not have much lining , and the center seam where the lace met the bottom solid portion seemed to contribute to the problem . It was not the look I wanted so I am returning . I did try the Glamorise Magiclift Seamless Support T-shirt soft cup bra , in the same size , with much better results . Just round curves with that bra , instead of sharp points . I will stick with seamless design and a little more lining in the future .	-1
The straps are not only too wide to be stylish ( imagine being a young person on a date and having THAT bra strap peek out ... ugh ) , but the coverage of the bra encroaches far too inward toward the neckline , making it impossible to wear a tank top or low-cut shirt . The lace is n't sexy , it 's just grandmotherly . And somehow , all the fabrics the whole bra is made of PILLS like mad . It 's cheap and ugly , and offers no more comfort than a more attractive bra .	-1
The lining falls apart too fast . The 'uplift ' band crumbles over time . I ended up cutting the material under the arm and trying to empty it out . The straps are too short for a tall person , so the back keeps riding up and the gel shoulder pads position in front of the shoulder , not on top . A lot of money for such a poor fit .	-1
This is a really nice brassiere . But it had to be returned because the cups were too pointy and my breasts are n't . So the thing puckered . It does n't take much error in stitching to produce this problem.How do I know there was a sewing mistake ? Well , first of all , I sew . I 've been making and altering my own clothes since girlhood , and that was a while ago . But even better evidence is that this was the second bra I ordered in exactly the same model and size ( 36D ) . The first one fits perfectly and this one simply did not . The first one , by the way , is a perfectly lovely soft purplish blue called blue ice . LOVE that one and plan to order yet another color despite hating to make returns . But Amazon 's policy on these that they sell directly is excellent and takes the curse out of mail order . Yea ! By the way , the description here says this is a `` minimizing '' bra . But I 'd say it is not . It puts my bosom right out there where I used to be shy to have it . The design of the garment is really full - how to describe that ? - there is a lot of bra so that it really encloses and holds the breasts , as opposed to ones that are skimpy .	-1
I need a wire-free bra right now due to costochondritis . This definitely has the support , but turns the girls into a cone shape . It looked absurd under a shirt , so had to end it back .	-1
the picture looks like it would be sexy but it is not ... the cup part fit well but the rest is just way too big	-1
My foot slipped right out of the shoe . The laces did n't go far enough to hold the shoe on .	-1
I bought these for my daughter ( 17 years old ) . She did n't like the creases that would be created when wearing the shoes and I ended up returning them .	-1
after about two weeks and not even an email in regards to my order I looked into what was going on . A week after that I got an email telling me my order could not be filled at this time , and a refund shortly after that . I went back to the sight and found that my shoe sie had been removed from the order form . I was greatly dis pointed	-1
They do n't stay on , make you trip all the time , are hard to walk in , you easily slip and lose your footing , like wearing a roller skate on your feet , the rubber dimples feel gross on your feet , and they break off and you find them all over the place . What more can you say ? A complete nightmare !	-1
I decided to try these slides because Amazon stopped carrying the Calissage style that I have worn for years . They are terribly uncomfortable . The little prongs or spikes ( or whatever you call them ) on the sole dig into your feet . They also break off and I wound up finding them all over the house . I threw them in the trash and bought 2 pairs of the Calissage from Adidas directly .	-1
These are the worst sandals . They made my feet hurt for at least 4 hours and I only wore them for like 30 minutes . The pain was so bad I had to buy a 99 cent pair of flip flops because I could not walk anymore . Do not buy these .	-1
This sneaker was exactly as I expected , in terms of appearance , but it was very small and narrow . I ordered the equivalent of a US men 's 8D ( I thought ) , but this shoe was more like a 7B . Could not get my foot into it . I think this will be the last time I try to buy a shoe online , because the last two times I tried , the sizing was off . Seems like the shoe makers could hold a meeting and agree on sizing standards , like is done with electric wire , light bulbs , etc .	-1
Onitsuka is in european sizes , but on the listing they show an inaccurate conversation into American sizes . A women 's 8.5 is a 39EU . I order a women 's 8.5 and they sent me a size 40 , which was way too large . This is why all the reviewers have sizing issues . It 's listed incorrectly and there 's no way to get a replacement in the correct size , because it the shoes are too big they consider it your mistake , and they only offer a refund . I own the Mexico 66 in 3 other colors all size 8.5 or 39 EU and they fit like a glove .	-1
They run small order up they would be good for leg days and Olympic lifts . They are flat and defiantly not made for running or cross training . I wish I would have known to order a size up I do n't use them . They a tight and hurt my feet .	-1
I have loved this sandal in the past so I re ordered . Ouch . Did they change it or something ? My pinky toe wont stay in and it hurts .	-1
I ordered the size that always fits me and this was not even close , it felt more like a narrow than a wide . Pretty flimsy for the price . It did have leather uppers but the leather was very stiff , more like what you would find on a belt , not shoes .	-1
I ordered this in a wide , and it 's still too tight around my the ball of my foot . I wear either medium or wide widths ( my foot 's not super wide ) . Glad I did n't try the medium width as I would n't have been able to fit my foot in . If you have a narrow foot , these shoes would be great . However , I returned !	-1
This is a nice looking casual shoe . Unfortunately , I have wide feet and bunions and these shoes simply were n't comfortable . They could work very well for someone else .	-1
This is an OK watch . The battery lasted for years . But when the battery wears out , you can not replace it yourself . They have the watch rigged so you need special tools and expertise to replace it . Sorry , but that 's a jerk thing to do , IMHO .	-1
great lookin watch , feels good , unreliable timekeeper.loses about an hour a day.watch is one month old.will have to send it back to timex.battery change did not help.beautiful watch but unreliable.the worst timex i have ever owned .	-1
I gave this watch to my husband as a Christmas gift . At first he really loved the watch . It looks sharp , is comfortable , and it looked like it would put up with years of use and abuse . Unfortunately , it stopped working 1.5 weeks after he took the watch out of the package . We hoped that it stopped working because the battery died , but no such luck . We replaced the battery and the watch still does not work . We are returning it to Amazon .	-1
For years I owned a Timex Alarm Chronograph watch . It was a great timepiece , all stainless steel ; it took a lot of hard use and still looked good . When it finally broke down Timex could n't fix it but only offered to replace it with a watch with fewer features.The only watch Timex offered like it iwith the same features , alarm chronograph , timer etc . was the Atlantis 100 . ( I would n't be surprised if it has the same electronics inside . ) However it is not nearly as good a watch . The body is made of plastic with a silver coating which wears off and looks shoddy . The LCD part is set deep into the watch , it is like looking into the bottom of a well , making the numbers hard to read . The clasp on the band has a way of becoming unhooked , just at the wrong times . I do n't know why they stopped making the better product ; I would buy it at event twice the original price .	-1
Timex has velcro straps and elastic straps ... please consider looking at the elastic straps instead . This was harder for my son to get on by himself , and the velcro was very sharp and cut his wrist the first time he wore it . My other son has the type with the elastic strap and it is soft and comfortable .	-1
the red button fell off . then the water got into it and the watch broke . i returned it . all of this happened again . i returned it and am done . this is the fourth model of the timex watch that I found to be critically design flawed . I grew up with timex watches and still have them ! Timex is losing it .	-1
The moment I picked up this product , I could tell it is of extremely low quality . The time is nearly impossible to change with its tiny nob for adjusting the time . The winding pin is supposed to have two settings but it is so cheap that I could n't find the second setting . The winding pin actually comes out if you pull it out too far , cant believe Timex could n't design it so that the pin wo n't come out . Piece of garbage .	-1
I really like the way this watch looked , and I am disappointed that I have n't been able to get one that was n't defective . So far , I have had three defective movements . The first one would lose an hour a week . The second one stopped randomly . The third one did not have a working Indiglo light . Seems like a nice watch , but with poor quality control .	-1
I was looking for a cool watch for camping and that it was good looking.Pros:1 . Gives a military look with 24hrs look and it glows in dark.Cons:1 . Not waterproof2 . Plastic material , the strap is not very resistant3 . They are much better watches at this price is more like a 10 $ watch top.Buy another watch I get dissapointed at this watch	-1
Well , upon getting this watch in the mail , I was surprised to find that it 's made of plastic , not metal . That means it 's light . Like , you can barely feel it in your hand.The watchband is thin and cheap , and the buckle is cheap , stamped metal . The watch face looks good , but also looks somewhat like it 's made of cardboard if you really inspect it.Also , it 's really more of a brown color than green or olive . And you ca n't wear brown with black clothes unless you want to look like a goober.This is a great watch for a little kid . It 's got a small dial , easy-to-read numbers , it 's light-weight , etc . But for an adult ? Get a real watch ! I 'm going to return mine .	-1
The straps on the watch are tiny , im 6'1 '' and i weigh 155 pounds so im not big by any means . The watch sits crooked on my wrist due to the straps not being long enough . The quality is sub-par , the long arm does not line up on the minute marks even when the seconds hand is exactly at 12 . Not a big issue but it 's definitely annoying , and i realize this is a budget watch . It keept time pretty well for the months ive had it . I work construction and i got this for work because it was cheap and i didnt want to destroy my more expensive watches . It regularly becomes unlatched from my arm because , again , the straps are not long enough . I would recommend this for children , but for an adult 's hand it is not suitable .	-1
These watch is not accurate , it runs very fast and they are all the same , finally SEIKO is going solar like CITIZEN did a long time ago , they are making a lot of solar models , i wish they could make this same model with solar power . Forget about automatics , they are in the past , only crazy collectors buy them .	-1
I bought this thinking that they would be like the old pair of Danskin microfiber skating tights that I had but I was SO wrong . These tights are literally comparable to a pair of $ 4.00 tights you can by at Walmart . They are not thick and sturdy like my old Danskin figure skating tights are , but rather thin and nothing special . I think this is the first purchase that I have ever made on Amazon where I actually felt ripped off for what I paid compared to what I got ( and I order a lot on Amazon ) . I ca n't believe these tights are selling for what they are when comparable tights are at Walmart for less then half the price .	-1
they are good but the real color looks nothing like the picture its a clear gray so if you want them because they are dark dont buy them	-1
It is way too tight ... I thought it was just me , but I let a couple friends try it and it was way to tight on them as well . It will smash your nose to your face and smear your lips across your face.Purchase this product if you want a flat face with a headache !	-1
I got it since winter is coming but it seems far too thin also the stitching was n't finished around nose area it unraveled so I had to sew it back together . I it got here really fast in two days but I doubt its gon na hold upto the winter time and it was delivered defective so.p.s . its falling apart everywhere . really crummy stitching . possibly because its made for a child not an adult .	-1
I thought for the extra money I 'd get 'WOW ! ! ' and I got bupkis ! ! As far as the sizing , it might fit a teen or little kid , but after that BEWARE ! ! ! ... and - of course - too cheap to bother returning at the P.O . Grrrr ... .I would have been better off buying one off the street in Times Square ! ! ! Boooo ! !	-1
It was really thin material . I like to wash all items before i wear them and threw it in the wash and dryer . It came out with threads loose on the edges and started unraveling .	-1
Purchased the pink pant and the gray pant with red stripes . The pink is really ugly . I bought it because it was on sale for about 60 % off . The gray is less ugly but not particularly attractive.The material is not up to par with the adidas pants of a decade ago . Then again , most things are not like they were a decade ago.Three stars for the downgrade on quality and the ugly color.Good pants , though , for lounging around the house and being lazy.UPDATE : October 2012 : I do a regular wash and dry cycle on these pants . I 've worn them for a while , they are my go to loungers . Sadly , they shrank in the wash -- lengthwise and widthwise along the waist and hips . Size up if you get a good deal on this . I 'm taking off another star for the inferior fabric . I still give it two stars because it 's not the end of the world if you anticipate the pants shrinking and you get a good deal on them .	-1
I 'm not sure what others see in this pant . It is not women 's sizing like the caption says . I ordered an XL which is the size I wear , and no part of it fit me . The waist was the right size , but the hips were too big and the inseam too long . And the leg length ! I could have cut off 10 inches and it still would have been long enough . I was going to return it but had my husband try them on and they fit him ! He is 6'2 '' and 240 lbs and they were too long on him ! They are definitely cut for a man 's shape .	-1
I purchased these for my husband , who unfortunately did n't like them . I love Keens , but he found the toe box too big and the heel slightly large .	-1
Bought 2 of these ( 44D ) . The quality is very good but I was stunned by how big the cups are . I mean ... . I 'm already big ( 44D ) but this size is more for a 46 or 48D . My puppies are drowning in these . LOL If you are going to buy , I would highly recommend that you get a size smaller than your usual one .	-1
I am a small woman with large breast , this thing makes me look like a football player all over padded I order a 36 DD they send it but there is so much padding I look like there even bigger~ now really at my size do I need padding ? NOif it was not such a big thing I would send it back , just as it is I will never order this or anything from these peoplethese people will not take it back since I washed it , I washed it since I am allergic to chemicals and would break out if this thing touched my bodyso FYI TRY IT ON OR BETTER YET DO NOT BUY IT ALL TOGETHER	-1
Bought to wear with halter dress . Used the invisible straps as the halter straps made the bra fit funny with gaps . Half way through the night the left strap snapped at the hook closure in the front . The band was uncomfortably tight and if you are buying would size up your band size . All in all not a good purchase .	-1
This item does what a bra is suppose to do . Within weeks of buying it - the wire on the underside broke in half and I got MAJOR poked .	-1
I have exceptionally large breasts and this bra was way too padded for me to try to use . I was excited because very few strapless bras are made in my size .	-1
The cups of this thing were so crushed that I ca n't seem to get them back into their proper shape . It also fits strangely . Tight , but the cups were just a tad large , and I wear a 42DDD in every brand I buy .	-1
You call this a DD cup ? ! Seriously ? ! I am a 34DD in multiple bras of all different brands . This is the only one that does n't have enough room for my girls . The fit would be amazing if the cups were only big enough .	-1
Pros : I love the line of 4 hook-and-eyes at the back - it 's really supportive and does n't pinch . I wish all bras were so well-constructed.Cons : The band runs a touch big and the cups are easily two sizes larger than expected . My 34DD - my typical size - was almost comical in size - the box in which it arrived was huge . The bra itself looked like a piece of furniture . Also , the cups pointed slightly outward - like chameleon eyes . This may have been a function of the poor fit .	-1
I was thrilled to find my size in this bra at a decent price , and if I was not allergic to latex it would be a great bra . Unfortunately , I am allergic to latex and this bra gave me blisters in my underarms after having it on for a couple of hours . I wish it had silicone but no , latex .	-1
I am normally a big fan of the UGGs product but this one didnt work . I bought this one for my mother for a Christmas gift but she said the soles of these slippers are too flat and gives her a leg ache . I have a pair of Ugg slippers but they are thicker soles . When I tried on hers , she was right that they did n't feel as comfortable . We ended up returning them . I would recommend the same design with thicker soles .	-1
I really should have known better . These are NOT suitable for use in winter conditions ; no traction at all , and standing at the bus stop = freezing feet . They are being returned .	-1
I was very excited to purchase the Dakota Slippers and was so dissapointed for the following reasons:1 . Ugg sizes are so unpredictable . I own a pair of ugg boots size 9 ( usually wear 8 1/2 ) and they fit pretty good . I read the reviews and decided to order a size 9 for this shoe , my feet barely fit and feel squeezed . I order a second pair of boots size 9 , they were big.2 . I tried to walk around with both shoes on and it was very uncomfortable , the sole seems too narrow for the width of the shoe ( plus the fur ) so it feels like my ankles were going to bend anytime.3 . The inside fur sole appears to be glued to the bottom of the shoe with very cheap glue , The sole from shoe I first tried on was starting to come off4 . The heel is very low so when you step forward it very easily slips off.I decided to return the slippers and probably will not purchase ugg shoes again , they are quite expensive for the quality I product .	-1
One shoe fits weird and wo n't stay on my daughters foot . Would send back but do n't wan na go through the hassle . Just take it as a loss . Sad I really wanted her to have these .	-1
Not only did it shrink to half the size when I washed it , but it came completely apart as well . Would not buy again under any circumstances . Poorly made and too tight for my head anyway	-1
I usually wear a large hat . Ordered a large/xl as reviews suggested and the hat is too big . May be hats should n't be bought on line .	-1
Shipping was quick and it was packaged in cute little round ring box with green bow.However , the color of the stone is a light yellow , not the honey champagne color depicted on the webpage . The size 5 I ordered is more like a 6.5 , way too big ! It 's too expensive to return because of shipping costs.Very disappointed .	-1
These boots were hard for me to tighten enough without feeling like I was doing damage to the bones in the top of my foot , but was too loose if I did n't tighten that tight . Maybe I ordered a half size to large , but that was to account for feet swelling during hikes . Boots felt great on flat surface , but my feet move around too much on ascents/descents .	-1
These hiking boots were too tight in the toe box for my medium width foot . They were returned for a prompt refund . I have bought Timberland before without this problem .	-1
wore them twice and sold them on ebay . left one fit and felt good but the right one was somewhat crooked .	-1
NB well designed , shoe contour is well shaped , the all black is very attractive . comfortable inside and luxury finished black.pls send another pair size 7.5 .	-1
Poor arch support . Did n't expect this from New balance . This is the worst shoe I ever bought . Hurts the feet after 20mins	-1
Got these for my daughter ; and nice of Amazon to ship them directly to her so she could get them quickly . She had this model several years ago , and they fit nice . She stated that they did n't fit the same ; were too tight ; she tried two sizes . Neither one fit her feet correctly . Too bad because she loves the look ; and is a teacher ; and needed black for work..	-1
This belt buckle was MUCH bigger than 1 & 1/2 & # 34 ; . It looked ridiculous on the person I bought it for and the belt barely fit through belt loops . I sent it back .	-1
While I 've been warned by other bikini competitors that these types of shoes will be tight at first until they stretch , these are not only way tight and uncomfortable ... the toe is shaped extremely odd and extends way out in a pointy fashion . The strap across the toes is even more odd and seems like the shoes are rejects ? ? ? Not pleased at all . And of course , I 'm expected to pay the return shipping .	-1
This shoe was sent back	-1
I 'm a minimalist wallet kind of guy . I was looking for something to hold about ten cards ( credit/ID/medical ) and a few bills . And I wanted them all to be easy to access . The wallets I 've found so far are either too bulky or require bills to be carefully folded . I love the feel of this wallet , but the extra pocket & # 34 ; flap & # 34 ; defeats the purpose of the slim profile.I designed and made my own duct-tape wallet which works perfectly and which will have to suffice until I can find a more durable ( and classy ... ) leather equivalent .	-1
this was a gift for my fiance and its a piece of crap . its very nice looking and slim ... . until everything starts ripping . i dont reccomend this to anybody .	-1
These felt very good at first , but by day two , they lost their fluffy sole & are more of a FLAT slipper . EXTREMELY painful if you need to have a padded sole for feet problems.I wont buy these again	-1
These slippers wear with comfort , but are not durable . I have washed them about 3 times and the soles have split the length of the slipper .	-1
I needed slippers because I have Fibromyalgia and spend most days indoors . Although I have bought Isotoner slippers within the past year and knew they would wear out within a month , I bought these anyway . During the first week they fit snug and with each passing day spread out more and more.Now after wearing daily , and I do not walk around alot , they are uncomfortable with lumps inside instead of a cushion they started out with . Will have to save my pennies to buy a quality pair of slippers but honestly do n't think I should have to pay $ 50.00 for slippers . Oh Isotoner or whoever you are owned by now - what have you done ? P.S . folks - same thing happened with the Dearfoam slippers I bought . Poor quality from those too . My slipper quest continues !	-1
they are ok for a day or two then they totally stretch out way to much . I did by a second pair and returned them with out even opening them . not worth the little amount of money they cost . wear socks	-1
The slipper is attractive and fits to size . However , the sole is very uncomfortable . It is squishy and does not provide enough support for walking . Would not recommend this to anyone with foot or hip problems since it could cause tripping .	-1
I wear a 8.5-9W and the large feels very small to me . They are narrow , shallow and short . They are pretty . If you have small , narrow feet , they should fit .	-1
RETURNING WITH GREAT JOY ABOUT GETTING MY MONEY BACK ! Note my reviews : I do not normally pan a product and try to look for the good , but ... Ordered with high hopes -- in `` D '' cup size . If this is a `` D '' , I would hate to see the smaller sizes . These barely covered a portion of a breast ; ladies , you 'll be better off with petals just to take care of `` headlights '' . There is no lift whatsoever and no way to make any `` lift '' for your twins . Removing them is PAINFUL ( yes , I know how to follow directions ) .To be fair : if you need cleavage , and are VERY small , these would likely work quite well if you could get them positioned correctly prior to snapping the two separate cups together.SUMMARY : pointless for larger than a `` B '' cup . Actually , they 're horrible and a waste of time/money .	-1
not very happy with this product , it fit as expected and I overall did not like this product , it was uncomfortable	-1
I was really excited to see a product that would fit a DD but I should have known better . There is no way these will fit a true DD . I 'm not happy with the fit at all . MAYBE they would be good for a C cup but that would be it .	-1
Indera has a similar item sold on this site for about the same cost . If you want a thermal top that will only be used on rare occasions ( for example , winter trips where you 'll be outdoors in the snow a lot ) then fine . Save the money , but do n't buy this . Buy the Indera.Essential Items ' product , which is after all labeled & # 34 ; Essential Apparel & # 34 ; , not & # 34 ; Occasional Apparel & # 34 ; , does not stand up well to daily use . My guy lives in them whenever he is not working . I hang my head in shame to have placed this in his stocking ( along with Indera 's , which merits one more star ) , when I should have shelled out for Ralph Lauren 's , which he deserves -- heavier weight ( and much warmer ) , closer threads , tight weave , well finished -- than this ridiculous thing , which is nearly ready for the rag bag.I should have known from the price not to have high expectations , but it was well rated on amazon.com , so I bought it . I left the tag in so I can avoid making the same mistake twice . Better still : for the man who asks for so very little and uses these so much , I will drive myself to Macy 's or go there online , and purchase Ralph Lauren thermals again . The one and only that he owns is in beautiful shape after YEARS of wear , and he gets cold easily . This was a stupid purchase , which wo n't be repeated.The seller was very prompt in delivery and should not be blamed .	-1
Not bad quality , but it is not showing in the images .	-1
Having bought these for work , I was initially very pleased with the look and comfort . Then , after about 2 months , the gel in the heel started leaking and the sole started peeling off from the shoe . It was out of amazons return policy window , so I just threw them in the trash . I would not buy these again and have switched to Ecco shoes . Although more than double the price , they are worth it and will probably last twice as long compared to the Dockers .	-1
I wear an 8.5 medium , ordered the 8-9 size - and wow - my feet were swimming in these slippers . Returned .	-1
Immediately after receiving these slippers I put them on . Then I went out into the back yard to play with our two Great Pyr pups ( 100 lb & 130 lbs ) . They heard a dog bark on the next property and went tearing off , with me in hot pursuit in my new slippers . I probably ran about 6 acres through Canada Thistle , sage brush , AND CACTI GALORE . My point in telling all of this is that these slippers held up great . After getting home 45 minutes later I pounded them together to get all the various pointy/sharp plant matter off and put them back on . Ahhh , comfort.UPDATE:6 months later and the left toe has ripped out . After my first `` run through the sagebrush '' I have largely worn these shoes inside , with brief trips out to the trash can , et cetera . I would not buy them again , as I expect a bit more than 6 months of life , even out of slippers .	-1
I purchased this visor because it looked really nice . But , buyer beware . Do n't be like me and wait until it 's too late to return it . When I got the visor I did n't put it on immediately . I recommend you do . When I finally did use it , I could n't wear it because it was made crooked . The visor was attached wrong to the band and blocked my left eye . Maybe this was just a one time happening and someone else who purchased it had no problem . But this was my experience . I wo n't buy another . I 'll quit being lazy and go to the store and try it on in person before I buy .	-1
I ordered this thinking it looked cute and it would help keep my face out of the sun . The plastic band-piece ( that wraps around the forehead ) is quite painful . The hat sits uncomfortably on the head and it 's an odd shape . I like that it has a large bill ... other than that I do n't like this hat . I 'll force myself to wear it while gardening ... if I can tolerate wearing it that long . Most likely I 'll get a headache after about 15 mins .	-1
I ordered this for my husband cause he needed a new BLACK polo . His was getting faded ( how black does after a while ) He wears a large in every shirt size . Ordered a large , which said it would fit his measurements and it was baggy . Not toooo bad , but i returned it because it was less black than the one we already had that was FADED . What the heck ? I wanted a black polo , not a faded black polo.Overall the quailty seemed nice , maybe in a different color would be ok. Would still be baggy though !	-1
First , this wallet is falling apart after virtually no use . Every time I pull out one of my cards , a leather flap pops out ( see product photo that I uploaded ) .Also , I was shipped a black leather wallet ( not dark brown -- black , and definitely different than the picture on the product page ) despite ordering a brown one , and they do n't even offer black wallets on this product page ( at least , not as I write this.Based on the many positive reviews , perhaps I just had bad luck , but at the very least it looks like quality control for these wallets sucks .	-1
These are not the docs I normally wear . They are not made in England . They are shaped like clown shoes the sole wears out and the leather rubs off IN LESS THAN A YEAR ! I did not wear these often due to the tackiness of the boots . This is just a low quality replica of what was once more than an icon . Very poor craftsmanship . Took the length of time to break them in as it did to wear them out . What a waste ! ! ! ! I will get the vintage 1460s from the DMs website instead next time around .	-1
These boots look like Dr martens but the are not the same as they were.To get the real quality dr martens make sure they are made in England.The ones that are not are not comfortable and easily broke apart in7-8 months of wear .	-1
Not easy to spread , making lumps on the bottom of the shoe . I would n't buy it again ; would just go to a cobbler .	-1
HiI ca n't say to much , but this feels like European sizing to me . Europe is generally one size lower so , what is l in Europe is an XL in the US ... .I bought several other sweatpants from several other makers ... none was as small . Quality seems to be in line with the price .	-1
I wear a lot of sweats and these were very disappointing . The 1 leg keep rising up even with the elastic . I have never had this happen before with any of the other products I ordered so , it is safe to say I will not order this brand again . Beautiful color though ( royal blue ) .	-1
It took more than 2 weeks to ship from the seller and arrived well after the original estimated ship date . Then , much too small . I bought Medium , which is what I wear all the time . I am a true 34 in waist , not a gut hanging over the belt 34. and these were at least a size to small . Also , there is NO pouch . The front is flat and even if they were the right size , I believe they would be very uncomfortable . The supplier accepted my return ( I paid the postage ) USPS First class mail using the supplied return label and put the RMA document inside the package as required . After 10 days and hearing nothing back about the return , I contacted the seller via email through the AMAZON website and was informed that they had received my returned items and would expedite the process . Another 4 or 5 days I received a credit to my AMAZON account for the initial amount but not the return postage . BOTTOM line , it took 5 weeks and $ 2.41 to receive and return a product that did not fit .	-1
This review is specific to the Small size . I wore these all the time in Medium size , and recommend those , but lost a little weight recently so they did n't fit and I ordered some Small sized ones as replacements . I 'm not going to go into details , but suffice to say that these fit in the waist but have too little coverage elsewhere -- very uncomfortably so . They are so tight as to be unwearable.Other Jockey offerings ( e.g. , Jockey Slim Fit Cotton Stretch Low-Rise Brief - 2 pack ) fit fine in the Small size , so I recommend those instead if that 's your size . If you 're medium or larger for the waist size , then these will likely fit well . The sizing chart seems accurate , maybe fitting about 1 '' larger than it says.The mediums that I had before lasted well and looked great , so overall I recommend these except for the limitation in the small size . Good luck !	-1
Returned this shirt because it was not fit to be worn . One shoulder was 2 & # 34 ; below the other , with excess material on that side of the shirt . The color and material was beautiful . It was exactly what I was looking for and I hated to send it back , but there was no way I could wear it .	-1
I ca n't find any slippers that fit . They are all too small . 12 is my shoe size but 12 slippers do n't fit .	-1
I like the colr . The material good and the cut was too close . I would buy a larger size next time .	-1
The bag seems to be well-made and durable , and the inside pockets are great for a tote bag- I can keep my phone and iTouch readily accessible , and they 're well-fitted in the pockets so as to not fall out easily . However , the straps on this bag are way too short . Do n't expect to be able to sling it over your shoulder and go . You 'll end up needing to carefully squeeze it all the way up over your shoulder , or just carry it in your hand the whole time . Pretty inconvenient , when I buy a tote bag I want to throw some things in it , throw it over my shoulder , and not think about it- but now I have to constantly be thinking about it because its uncomfortable to wear.If I 'd spent more than $ 6 I would 've returned it , but it was n't worth paying return shipping .	-1
I ordered 6 of these bags for my bridesmaids . Even though they shipped together in the same box , each one was charged $ 4 in shipping . So while the bag was only $ 4 , it was a total of $ 8 per bag . I did n't think that was a bad price until I received the bags and felt how cheap they are . Very thin . Will work for a beach bag and I am not returning them since they are gifts , but I would not buy more unless they get the shipping down to an acceptable level . $ 8 for this bag is WAYYYY too much for the quality delivered .	-1
If you do n't care about your looks , that 's the shirt for you ... It is very loosely stitched , the fabric is neither attractive nor comfortable ... ..not at all recommended !	-1
I do not expect a cotton turtleneck to retain its color for many washings but I do expect better than the one washing and faded new turtleneck which is what I got with these Port Authority shirts . With Landsend it takes 20 or more washings to get the fade I saw after one cold water washing of this shirt . Landsend is out of stock until July so I took a chance on this shirt in navy and it turned out to be a mistake .	-1
The description says navy blue . The picture is a very dark blue , so I ordered it . The vest arrived and is a smokey blue , not a dark blue . I shall return it because it is n't the color I need . The vest itself is a nice vest , just the wrong color .	-1
I do n't really know what to say about this night outfit except for as I said in the title , it just fits really weirdly . Perhaps I should have gotten a larger size , but I really do n't think even that would help . It just has a very strange cut to it & is not very comfortable .	-1
the size as expected but the color is deferent not the same as showing on the pictureit 's olive not brown , so make sure to choose the correct color .	-1
I was hoping these would fit and feel like the normal 511s , but they had awkwardly large back pockets and the material is really stiff and unflattering . I would n't buy these again .	-1
These are 'skinny ' jeans , not slim fit . In any other piece of clothing called 'slim-fit ' , there is a darting or a half-inch tighter cut . These pants are hilariously tight , so much so that I could n't ' get them around my calves . As a guy who works out , the size 38 I ordered fit at the waist fine but the rest was sausage casing . These would look great on an underweight teen , but not normal sized adult . Honestly , if these fit you , you should look into seeing a nutritionist .	-1
Firstly , these pants are a bit small in the crotch.If you wear pants and they are small in the crotch , then you know how that feels . I do n't have to explain , it is my disdain . Pants of quality that do n't fit right are a travesty . That is what these pants are like.Also , I would say do n't get the twill . The fabric is slim and the upper leg and crotch area do n't give much room , so no stretchiness . I feel a bit restricted . Wearing these in my chair at work I thought they were going to burst , leaving me exposed . I might break these in a bit , but first off they are uncomfortable.Had I been at the store and tried these on I might have passed , just a heads up.My Advice : Go to a retail and pick these up , they may fit better . Not for the winter months either , these are some thin cotton my friend.But they do look pretty okay ; however , they fall off my ass . I find that weird , especially since they are too tight in other places .	-1
The fit was n't great . I mean the waist section was spot on , but everything from there down was horrible.It was super tight around the thighs , but then as it got to the knees it loosened up and it looked like a pouch around the knees , and then tightens up again at the end of the calf muscle becoming choking-like tight around the ankle.If that 's how a skinny pants should fit , then this was definitely my first and last . I 've seen it on friends , and it fits well , and i 'm not large , in-fact my legs are muscular and toned , but this just made me look like a clown .	-1
I got confused with hybrid and twill , this hybrid is not becoming , the material is very hard , and the fit squishes your balls not good .	-1
Broke the buckle the first time I tried to put them on . But i guess thats what I get for buying cheap	-1
Overall materials are good quality and well put together , but the clips do not stay closed . Makes the whole think useless .	-1
I ordered these sweat pants for my 12-year old daughter to wear for PE class on cool days . They are a very generic ( unisex ) fit and absolutely unflattering . I realize sweat pants are not generally a fashion statement , but these sagged at the backside unless the waistband was pulled up to her chest . These went straight back to Amazon & we will be ordering a few more pairs of the Soffe Football capris . Much cuter & better fit for girls !	-1
I should have known that there was something wrong when there 's a leather jacket offered for $ 20 bucks . BUT I figured hey , this is Amazon , how bad could it be ? As soon as I opened the plastic wrap package , the entire house was filled with this toxic smell that was really sickening . We hung the jacket in the garage and it stunk up the garage . It 's hanging in the back yard right now , and when you go outside you can still smell it . It 's going back in plastic . This time a garbage bag . Trust your instincts !	-1
Just go to walmart and buy some reversible belts there for the same price . After wearing one for about 3 weeks the material began to flake off around the crease near the belt hole . It 's disappointing as I bought 3 of these . Alwell !	-1
This bra fits but does not control bounce for my DDs . I am not completely disappointed because it is comfortable but it is actually a & # 34 ; medium impact & # 34 ; bra according to the tags on it when it arrived . For activities such as & # 34 ; yoga and walking & # 34 ; Blah . I need something to really work out in . Oh well .	-1
I 'm only half kidding with that but it can only be used if you 're not doing high impact sports . Spinning would be OK if you 're not doing too many jumps	-1
The thin fabric insole comes unglued first and you get a waffled footbed that 's uncomfortable on the soles of your feet . Then the toe box comes unglued from the rubber outer sole . Since the toe and the sole separate , I get a scoop of sand in there when I walk across the beach . Worthless junk ! I bought four pair for the family and they 're all the same garbage .	-1
I was diappointed with this purchase . The inside sole of these shoes move all about and do not stay in place , so I have had to remove them . Instead , I have my own insoles for support , another thing this shoe did not have . I do hope the exterior of this shoe holds up . I expected so much more from a speedo product.Do n't waster your money or time on this product .	-1
I absolutely love how these look ( I got the light blue ones ) , and they fit really well . I 'd be delighted with them except that , having only worn them twice , the footpad in one has already come loose and bunches up in odd places under my foot . It 's pretty annoying . I spend a lot of time trying to tug the pad back into place , but that only works for a min or so . I 'm thinking of trying to reglue it , but I 'd have to figure out what type of glue to use.Such a shame because I really like these shoes otherwise .	-1
I really like the look of these 'water shoes ' . However after only wearing a couple of times they came un-sewed . I 'm suprised as you	-1
Bought these as a gift for my bf and he hated them . The insoles would keep slipping inside the shoe . He has barely used them because they were so dysfunctional .	-1
I do n't recommend these to anyone . Bought the correct size , tried them on my daughter , asked if they felt okay and she said yes . Took her to the beach and she wore them the whole time . Never complained about her feet once . When we got to the car I took them off , and saw two HUGE , angry , red , blisters on the inside arch of each foot . About the size of a quarter on a two year old 's foot . That 's a big blister for an adult foot . It took about 2 1/2 weeks of intense and careful treatment to heal them . She cried whenever we put her normal shoes on . I tossed the shoes out and never put them on her again .	-1
I 've been buying these for years , and the quality is all over the place . Sometimes they are thin ; sometimes they are thick . Sometimes the collar lays flat ; sometimes it looks awful.I finally got sick of them , and paid a little more and got the Dockers t-shirts . They are infinitely better and worth the extra cost .	-1
Once upon a time , Hanes was a maker of superior quality t-shirts . Sadly , that time has passed and Hanes is now dropped to be equal to Fruit of the Loom . The cotton material is thin and cheap , seemingly threadbare out of the package , where it was once bodied and warm . Hanes T-shirts shrink aggressively with each wash , even on cold.These shirts are good for a handful of washings , then must be tossed or used as rags .	-1
Besides buying a size too large , the leather is so soft that it looks lumpy on your feet . I did n't like how it looked . Very cushiony insole .	-1
I had a similar experience to another & # 34 ; poster & # 34 ; . I ordered a blue pair and a black pair . The blacks shoes fit well . The blue were small and tight . I measured them against each other and the blue was definitely smaller . Sadly Amazon would not let me exchange them and the price had increased significantly ... so I could not buy them again . One style . Two sizes for the supposed same size . Beware .	-1
I 'm a rather fit person , and my feet are definitely far from overweight , so I would love to know why they do n't fit into these socks . Oh , they 'll fit alright , but then at the end of the day , I have red marks from the circulation being cut off . No joke , sometimes purple if I 've been in them all day . It 's ridiculous . I 'm a size 10-11 . Sometimes 9 ( rarely ) depending on the shoemaker . How hard is it for Hanes to say 6-10 or 6-9 ? Of course it will cost them more , but they have lost my business . I wear nice clothes , watches , etc , and they surely are not cheap . Would I wear Hanes ? NO ! But , when it comes to socks , no one is going to see them , so as long as they 're comfortable , I 'm okay . Well , I like the texture of the sock , but the padding and size have sent me in the direction of another company .	-1
I bought the socks for my brother . He said that they looked nice but the material felt rough and uncomfortable on his feet even after washing them . He told me never to buy these socks again .	-1
My hubby wears a size 10.5. shoe and likes low socks and that is all I buy . I purchased these and he showed me that when he pulled the sock over his foot , it did not stretch enough to cover his heel . At first I thought maybe I had ordered women 's sized socks by mistake but I checked and saw that I did not . These run way too small for men whose shoe size is above 10.5 despite the description . If these fit a man 's foot , perhaps he wears a size 9 shoe.These are thick , nicely made socks but if you ca n't wear them , then they are useless socks .	-1
I reviewed another type of Hanes socks ( B002WTC6BIand those were much better . These socks just do n't fit well and do n't conform to my feet . It kind of feels like they are not shaped properly and the material does n't have enough stretch / elastic .	-1
Bought an XXL ( usually I am an XL but reviews said runs small , and I buy tank tops to sleep in so I like them to fit loosely ) . The XXL was about a Gap size Medium ! I was shocked ! Obviously I returned them , and wo n't be buying new ones . BEWARE - seller does n't pay for shipping on the returns either !	-1
The shoes are nice and good quality but the size is not at all as it suppose to be 7.5 ! If one insist to buy them u 've to order 2 sizes less ! Unfortunately am going to return them .	-1
I liked the styling of the shoe but it said that they were leather and they werent so I was very disappointed	-1
Necklace was really thin . Only lasted a month on my 12 yr olds neck .	-1
This was my son 's gift past November or December . Beautiful Angel but past January the chain was broken in five parts like a twig . I take care of all my jewerly and with this necklace especially . I 'm very disappointed because it 's not very cheap and I 've to buy another chain now . I do n't know how many stars gave my son to this purchase because I did n't make know him about this defective chain .	-1
No jeans fit right anymore . Trying to find a loose pair of jeans with decent pockets is next to impossible now . I have made the switch to cargo pants for life . Also , I wear a 36 in every brand I have tried , and these are goofy huge ! For a loose fit , they sure do have a fat waist and skinny thighs ...	-1
comfortable because it has absolutely no support at all . This bra only works if you are really wide in the back and very full busted . If not forget it..I tried it on at a dept . store , with the suggestion of a sales rep , it was horrid , so much for all lunaire bras , they are only made for very full busted women , and I am 36 DD . small around the back . I also tried a few other styles by Lunaire , same story , different style ... .I have to say , same goes for Wacoal , pricey , and do n't last , no support , and I paid $ 60.00..Sorry to all the Wacoal lovers , I wore the ultra suede full figure , no support , did n't last , not worth the money ... I also only hand washed all my lingerie , so , they need to come up with something better ...	-1
I 'm a Wacoal girl , and I found this Lunaire bra just way too stretchy and big . Comfortable , but it looked sloppy on me because the straps could n't be shortened enough ( so I was droopy ) and the sides had very little support , so I bulged out over the top of the sides . And the cups seemed to be quite far apart . I am a petite woman , a 34DD , and I think this would be a nice bra on a tall , slim woman . But not on someone like me who needs some shaping and support .	-1
Sizing is not consistent across different styles from the same brand . Do not appreciate this kind if inconsistency . Where have your standards gone , Lunaire ?	-1
As a femme crossdresser , I ca n't recommend these panties . They are n't sexy and they do n't have that silky feel to them to make me feel dainty . I guess its the small amount of spandex in these panties that ruin the feel . I like microfiber but these feel more like cotton . When I put on a pair of panties , I want that silky sissy feeling . Oh well I 've bought some other wonderful panties here .	-1
This brief creeps into a wedge . Fabric is very comfortable , bright color , and amazing stretch ! But it ca n't stretch enough .	-1
I have other size-30 shorts that fit comfortably , but these were too tight in the waist . I may buy the next larger size .	-1
These were itchy at the end of the day . They do not wash well and & # 34 ; pill & # 34 ; . They do not feel like Merino wool . I will not be getting anything more from wigwam .	-1
I compared this overshoe with the Totes Geometric Loafer , and after trying both on , bought the Totes instead . Here is why:1 . It is not that easy to tell from the pictures , but the Totes looks better and is more stylish than this product.2 . If you choose the proper Totes size , the overshoe fits like a glove and nicely blends in with your dress shoe . By contrast , the Tingley overshoe fits more loosely and gives more of the appearance that you are wearing a rubber overshoe . It has a & # 34 ; sloppy & # 34 ; feel and look rather than the sleek and snug fit of the Totes.Bottom line : This will work , but the Totes is more stylish .	-1
I ordered the bra in my regular size ( 34G ) and it 's far too tight . The bra really digs in on the sides and was extremely uncomfortable . My breasts also squeezed out of the top a bit creating the dreaded quadra-boob . The style is great if you 're looking for a t-shirt bra but that 's only true assuming you can guess the right size ...	-1
Due to my breast shape this bra did n't fit well . I have a more bottom heavy conical breast shape . Unfortunately this bra is for a more fuller busted person with more upper breast than I have .	-1
I tried this bra at a store in the Bahamas and was pleased with the way it looked and how comfortable it was , but the price was too steep . So I decided to buy it on Amazon and although it is the same bra name and number , the fit is totally different . This bra is so uncomfortable , the band of the bra digs into your entire chest after wearing for an hour . I would not recommend it .	-1
The underwire hits a little high in the area under the arm and causes rubbing and discomfort if worn for more than a few hours . THe fabric is very pretty though and the shoulder straps are comfy enough .	-1
I was very disappointed as I absolutely adored my old dearfoams-wore them literally until they fell apart ( about 4yrs ) , these are ok but dont match up at all , they got cheaper over the yrs-not BETTER . They 're no where near as comfy as my 1st pair . Not sure I 'll buy dearfoams again unless they go back to whatever they were doing before .	-1
These slippers are barely okay . Definitely not great . I wear slippers around the house whenever I 'm home , so I need something that provides arch support and stability on my hard wood floors . Also , I wanted something to replace my worn out memory foam slippers , these do not even compare in comfort . The soles are not very cushioned , and my feet stay tired . I feel my feet ache with every step . No arch support at all . I 've got them now so I 'll keep them , but I 'll mostly use them for running outside quickly and I 'll get something else for wearing inside . I gave these 2 stars instead of 1 because the material is soft , but the comfort stops there . Some reviewers complained about the tag , I found that the tag on the footbed is easy to remove with a seam ripper .	-1
Not only does it not look so good , but the order was 2 sizes larger than what I asked for . Still no refund	-1
Size inconsistencies . I ordered two different sizes to try . Was able to get the smaller one on , but could barely get the larger up past hips . Fabric appeared of high quality , but not very stretchable .	-1
This device works but it is very noisy . The part that secures the watch to the system is not well designed . If all you need is a device for keeping your watch wound then this machine does the job and the price is right .	-1
Forget about cheap winders and buy an inexpensive one . check the Internet like I did once mine broke after 10 days . I now have all sorts of winders and am grateful for the deals . And thanks Amazon.com for the speedy refund .	-1
This item is a cheap knock off of a US military Jeep Hat . The real hat is made in the US to a military specification by a military contractor . Do n't bother with this garbage and buy the real thing . They only come in black or drab green , made of 100 % wool . They 're warm as hell . If they are good enough for our military , they 're good enough for you . My local army / navy store sells them for $ 6.99 and that 's for the real thing . These seem like a first class POS judging from the other reviews .	-1
The seller is great , but this product is small , itchy , not warm . Totally synthetic - wool is so much better than this .	-1
Arrived fast . Very thin , very cheap , itchy , and too small . Looks like it could fit a kids head better . I would have paid a little more for a better quality beanie .	-1
because I figured I could wear one while the other one is being cleaned . Now that I have them I have worn them a few times but am afraid to wash them because I believe the bill is cardboard so not a very good rating .	-1
Arrived quickly , and in new condition . If you 're looking for a hat , here you go . I did n't know how cheap a beanie could be until I got this one . It 's very thin , very cheap , and too small to fit securely on a normal sized head . Given the choice , I would pay a little more for a better quality beanie . The call is yours .	-1
My head is not that big , and this hat was still a bit too small for me . It was very tight and I just did not care for it .	-1
This beanie is so small that it wont even fit on my 2 year olds head without some struggle.. Its baby size . I regret spending the few bucks on it that I did .	-1
These sandals are very comfortable around the house , but I really bought them for vacation on the beach and quickly found out that they can not get wet . Even the slightest bit of moisture gets quickly absorbed into the top layer which is like a soft memory foam type material . They can take up to a day or more to dry out , and they really ca n't be worn while wet unless you want to squish out slippery foam with every step you take . Very annoyed by that . They are great sandals if you keep them bone dry , otherwise - beware !	-1
Have you ever been to a yoga class and some moves you do on the bare floor because you ca n't be stable on the mat ? That 's what these shoes are like . They 're not supportive or stable , just overly smushy .	-1
Coming apart after a year , quality is waning .	-1
I 'm always a US size 7 , but these were too small for me . They are also really tight - which is weird because I have very narrow feet . They 're not as comfortable as other reviewers claim , at least to me . I would rather wear cheaper rubber flip flops than these .	-1
I have a similarly looking Clarks bought several years ago which is VERY comfortable . Being under the impression that this is the same model I 've purchased these . The outsole is identical to mine and they look almost the same , there 's a slight decorative difference but these are way too rigid , especially at the ball ( where toes join w/ the rest of foot ) . The impression is that your foot is in a cast w/ a pressure point at the ball . Because of the good outsole walking in them though is comfortable as Clarks usually are.So , if you do n't mind the pressure I described it 's not a bad shoe . I 've returned nevertheless .	-1
I bought a pair in brown , as I have a black pair that are great . The brown color of the pair I received is quite different than the pictures - a lot lighter , except for the center part of the toe which is the darker pictured color . So , I got a pair of light brown shoes with a big dark stripe down the middle . Ugly.As for this model of Clarks , they 're great , sturdy oxfords for work , can go either casual or fairly dressy with them . I 've had my black pair for years and they still wear great . Just do n't order them in brown .	-1
I had to return this shoe . If you ever have a problem with feeling that the top front of a clog shoe with this profile is tight , you may have a problem with this shoe . I have another pair of Easy Spirits that I really like so I was disappointed . I think with this style , the lower the back of the heel is , the longer and tighter the shoe is in the front to help keep it from slipping . If you have this problem like me , I think the styles of clogs with a slightly higher back could be your answer . The shoe was as pictured .	-1
I wear a 9 E and ordered 9.5 EE and could not get my foot in them ! They are also very very beautiful ! I ca n't afford to order another pair or send then back . I am stuck . It 's okay . I may find someone in the family who can fit them . Still I have no clogs .	-1
Make sure you really like this item , because I was charged $ 8 in restocking fees . Not sure where it 's mentioned in the product page ; I could n't find it anywhere .	-1
Horrible cheap flimsy material , irritating and scratchy on the breasts . The band width is a bit large for 36 ; the cups are sewn into a bullet bra formation that is like something out of the 1950 's with an unlined seam that runs right across sensitive nipples . I could n't stand to have it on my skin for more than 15 minutes . Tossed it in the trash ; a waste of 20 bucks and a lesson well-learned : cheap bras are awful !	-1
This is your typical no-wire support bra . The straps are comfortable and the support is just ok . The main problem I have is that the bottom edge rolls up on me making the bra uncomfortable . I 'm keeping mine only to wear as a backup .	-1
I like the way it fit around my body but the cup is too big . I ordered the same size I normally wear but the cup just does n't fit right . It is hard to fasten all the hooks too .	-1
This is horrible . You will have to wear a shirt under if you can get into it . Reviews are correct , this runs 1-2 sizes small . I am a 36C and I couldnt ever get it within 2 inches to close and I was using all my might to get it to this point.There is a REASON there is no description , so they dont need to be accountable as to the truth about this product . Dont like someone , order this for them : - )	-1
The fit was n't what I was expecting . Guess my body type and this bra just did n't see eye to eye .	-1
I bought this because it had good reviews but I regretted as soon as I put my stroller which by the record did not fit . I had a lightweight jeep stroller and I ca n't imagine how I would be able to fit the bigger one . I returned , needless to say .	-1
They fit way too big . I ordered a second pair in a smaller size and they were too big also . The material and print design is excellent .	-1
hated the fit of these . really not what I wanted but there was nothing wrong with them so I did n't return them .	-1
I bought these for my teenager , and he wore them to school for 2 weeks , when the sole began seperating from the shoe . I guess you get what you pay for - by the end of the 3rd week , they had to be thrown out - beyond salvage	-1
The boots arrived brand new however , the soles were cracked and were already separating from the shoe . Talk about shoddy workmanship ! And the faux leather material is rough as hell ! Sending them back asap ! Do n't waste your time or money on these boots , even if they will be just for casual hiking or work boots .	-1
Just save your money and get some altamas . These are cheap junk made out of stray cats and bubble gum .	-1
My son is in the junior marines and needs boots as would be expected . He has already worn out his first pair so I decided to purchase these . They arrived in a reasonable period of time however , in the words of my son , & # 34 ; they are way too big & # 34 ; . And that is saying something considering the fact that his shoe size is a 13 . Now I will have the hassle of returning them and finding a pair that fits .	-1
These things looked great at first but I have to wear 3 pairs of boot socks for them to fit and not give me blisters ( They do NOT have liners . ) that combined with the fact the sole started pealing off after only a few weeks of moderate use have ensure I never purchase these again .	-1
I ordered size 7 toddler for my daughter . When I got it , it looked very big . I compared it w/ my daughter 's other shoes ( size 7 ) , it almost a size bigger . I am very disappointed this product .	-1
The lining came out of place really fast , and the toe part just actually split into an upper and lower part and it is not a case that they were too tight for my son . I do n't know if they were too old or something . I am disappointed at the quality as I anticipated it would have lasted at least a year .	-1
I bought this bag based on the Amazon reviews and I completely disagree with most of them . This bag is bulky , and the lining is so thin between compartments that the bag has no structure . If you put something in the middle compartment , it sticks out in to the outer compartments and everything feels like a big mess . The bag is n't deep enough and feels bulky on my shoulder when filled ( not over-stuffed ) .Not a good bag .	-1
On the first day , after wearing her tights for an hour , my grand daughter dropped a pen on her lap and snagged her brand new tights . While it seems impossible , she got a hole in it the first day . I would have hoped that it would have lasted a little bit longer before ripping . Anyway , for little active girls , it must be much better made than these were .	-1
I have three other pairs and this is the worst . it 's called `` tall '' uggs . Oh , they 're unpleasantly short . mid calf . also , uncomfortable ! They bunch right around the ankle . Are these even real uggs ? I 'm going to have to check for authenticity . did n't like these .	-1
I ordered three pairs of Ugg 's from Amazon this winter . Two pairs that I received were authentic and one pair were fake . The fake Ugg 's had the holographic tag , came in a box with a holographic sticker , and with packing and materials identical to the authentic Ugg 's -- the only way I was able to tell the fakes were that they absolutely REEKED . The boot itself smelled fine , like sheepskin , but the soles smelled VERY strongly of new plastic or chemicals . I could smell it before I 'd even pulled them out of the box . Real Ugg 's do not have this smell . Go to any fine department store and smell for yourself . If you receive Ugg 's and the soles smell strongly of paint/chemicals/plastic ... return them , they are not authentic . If you are familiar with those foam rubber jigsaw puzzle pads they make for babies ... it 's that kind of smell.At the time I purchased the boots , Amazon was not an authorized seller of Uggs ( apparently they now are ) , however a number of the marketplace sellers on the site are . If you visit Ugg 's website , you can find a list of authorized sellers . Unfortunately , as I discovered , several sellers on Amazon are using names very similar to authorized vendors but are not actually that vendor . So be careful . Some of these folks selling the fakes are still charging $ 180 for the classic tall . You will not find authentic Ugg 's on sale , reduced , or anything like that at any authorized site . If you want real Ugg 's be prepared to pay full price for them or end up with fakes.The AUTHENTIC Ugg 's I received were both from Shoe Central out of Ashland , Oregon -- they ARE an authorized dealer . I love my Ugg 's . I waterproofed them and that worked well for walking in heavy snow . My toes were toasty warm . Very comfortable . I 'm very happy !	-1
My review is only about the boot itself , not the seller of this product . My main gripe is how terrible they are in the ice and snow . I live in Chicago , and we get about 4 months of horrible weather from Dec-March . It is icy , wet , slippery snowing , etc . almost every day . Last winter I fell on the ice in these boots about 5 times . The last time it happened , I tore a hamstring . It finally dawned on me that these boots have no traction whatsoever and they are not made for icy/snowy conditions . The bottom of these boots consists of a slick , waxy surface with no traction . So while they may be warm and fashionable , they are NOT made for people who have to walk in ice and snow . I am selling my boots on ebay and will NEVER buy Uggs again .	-1
Uggs in general are UGLY shoes , but for kids they are light weight and warm . These shoes are not the quality I expected for the money . It 's made of micro-fiber Suede with a small patch of suede leather at the heel . The shoe is flat without any arch support . It 's like wearing expensive slippers outdoors . By the look of them ... it 'll absorb any splash of water . I would highly recommend Bearpaw boots over these any day . At least Bearpaw is made of 100 % suede leather through out with soft sheep skin fur and the sole has better traction ... it 's half the price . I returned these and the seller was very responsive and helpful .	-1
These are cheaply made shoes , with no size markings anywhere except the outside of their box . I wear a size 11D shoe , ordered a size 12 after reading prior reviews . Did not even come close to fitting ; way too tight.Returned them for credit .	-1
Way too long for a 30 & # 34 ; inseam . Usually , the closed leg bottom takes care of a few extra inches , but not six extra inches . There was no indication that this was for tall man .	-1
The elastic around the legs does n't last so they get baggy and do n't contain the & # 34 ; contents ' very well . I love the soft waistband , but that also does n't last and the stitching comes loose . A good idea , poorly executed .	-1
I bought this bra along with three others ( same size , different companies ) . The others were fine , but the Olga was very small - as if it was sized incorrectly . I returned it immediately . Wish I had something better to say	-1
And the padding in the cups started to wrinkle . Would not buy this again .	-1
I am not very happy with the wax . When I received the product , it came damaged . The wax was already cracked and in pieces inside of the container . I am not sure if it was from amazon shipping or from ups . Either way , I was not very happy . The wax seemed like it was not that fresh as well .	-1
I use them as multi-purpose rags while hiking or camping . I do n't wear them , nor do I care if they keep color or look pretty . The price has gone up a little since the last ones I purchased , so I 'd look around . There are much better around for roughly the same price.PROS : . They cost next to nothing.. They work for wiping sweat , washing up at camp , cleaning equipment , wiping off bug repellent , ect ect ... . Oddly durable for the price.. 27 '' x 27 '' is massive.CONS : . Super thin ... you can literally see through them.. If you care about color , do n't get these . The color bled out with the first wash and they faded like they were a decade old.. The edges began to fray.. but hitting them with a lighter every once in a while extends the life.. Listing is incorrect . They are NOT 100 % Cotton.. They are NOT very absorbent.. Only one side of the bandanna is printed.. Very stiff and plastic feeling until it is washed a handful of times.. Made in China	-1
First wash the bandana began to unravel by itself . The quality just is n't there find something else maybe thicker than this item .	-1
We ordered several different colors and patterns , all by Rothco . The others were thin but serviceable , and we should have expected that the low price would reflect the quality ; but the black one is worthless . After being worn once , and washed once , the edges began to unravel . I suppose it is better than using , say , a paper towel or maybe a brown paper sack but never again will we order anything like this from Rothco .	-1
First wash ( gentle ) left them frayed on all 4 sides and stretched unevenly . I 've turned them into cleaning rags to use around the garage .	-1
I 've bought cheap paisley bandanas in various local stores for half my life , over 20 years . I wear them and wash them , and wash them and wear them , for years , until they 're threadbare and finally get holes in them ( unless I lose them first . ) I had to get a solid black one to wear at my new job and could n't find one in any local stores , where they have paisley and other patterns and colors , selling for a dollar a piece . My husband found this solid black one here on Amazon , and even though it was three times the price , he got it for me . For one thing , it is DEFINITELY NOT square . And for another , I wore it one week , just washed it today , and it 's already fraying . You 've got a lot of nerve selling this crap for three dollars ; it 's not even worth three cents !	-1
Thinner than expected , stiff and itchy even after washing , and all three that I ordered came out of the package with stains on them.If you want a cheap bandana , cut up an old t-shirt . These are n't worth the admittedly small cost .	-1
This bandanna is very large . Both the pattern and the color are printed , and only on one side . The fabric is fairly rough , and not particularly absorbent . Overall , disappointed .	-1
This is some kind of cheap material that is `` hard '' rather than soft and luxurious . It feels cheap but looks good . i would n't buy again .	-1
I bought this product to go with a subdued pink camouflage pants I bought and love . It was cheaply made and basically looks like a piece of cloth with the edges sewn . There is little pink in it and the pink is so light it is difficult to see .	-1
these coveralls are supposed to keep you warm and dry when riding a motorcycle . they do neither . they do not keep you warm and you will be soaking wet if you wear them in the rain while riding .	-1
I have always bought size large snowsuits and they have fit well . 6'2 , 190lbs 34 waist and inseam . This suit the legs and arms are 4 & # 34 ; short , tight around the waist . The zippers on the legs only go the knee .	-1
Do n't waste your money on this . The material is very cheap ( smells ) and its a very small bag . Cost to return is almost as much to buy so did n't bother to return ( why throw away more money ) . Maybe will find a use for it down the road	-1
I do not trust that the contents wo n't fall out of this bag . Its sloppy and unstructured and has a difficult to use closure mechanism . You have to weave the strap through a buckle ( or let the strap hang and look tacky and trust the bag not to come open ) . Who is going to do that in a hurry ? Even buckled , it never really feels closed , things can slip out the side . The material and sewing seem sturdy and sound enough , but I just do n't trust that I wo n't loose my smaller stuff out the cracks on the sides .	-1
Selected this bag in the 11x9 size , received a 10x8 bag . Waiting for UPS to pick it up for a return . Was very disappointed .	-1
Color was to bright and it was to small it only holds about 3 note books and a pencil case	-1
Cheap material and construction . I 'll be surprised to see it intact in more than a few weeks . Low price , lower quality .	-1
It 's much smaller than the photo suggests . Ca n't hold anything for a day trip of any sort , it 's just for going out for a few hours really . It 's also very feminine looking because of its shape and small size , which I did n't expect based on the photo . Comes in the same type of packaging used for cheap fireworks . Not impressed .	-1
The set was actually really nice looking . BUT , the center stone is tottally crooked ! It really throws off the look of the ring and the center diamond has no height to it at all . I really dont know how to feel about this set because its a really beautiful set . But it also has a really big flaw . 50 % good and 50 % bad . But otherwise nice and believable . Im returning my set that i just recieved today . Not happy about the center stone at all .	-1
They fit perfectly ... would be ashamed to mess up something so simple . I am not at all pleased with their customer service . The shipment was super delayed and they were not kind about resolving the problem at all . I thought they had just decided to drop the order altogether then randomly a month later I received a mysterious package and there they were . The case if the long lost gloves .	-1
I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type -- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures . These gloves seeemed perfect -- because many fingerless gloves- do n't have fingerless thumbs -- but these gloves do . The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves . I ordered the black pair . Well , the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers -- they snag easily . They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily . But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it 's a case of you get what you pay for .	-1
ITS NOT THE NORMAL XL , LOOK MORE A XXL . I HAVE TO GIVE TO A DIFFERENT PERSON BECAUSE OF THAT REASON .	-1
Cotton was not very smooth and soft , especially on my skin ! I believe that Hanes quality is not what it 's reputation demands . I do n't know if it has to do with the cotton being manufactured overseas or what , BUT I do n't think the quality control is as good as it has been in years past .	-1
nice shape to start but shrinks fast after washes . no longer tucks in and rides up over belt . only used warm cycles and never put into dryer , only hung out to dry .	-1
These shirts looked good out of the package , but once they were washed , it was a different story . The shirts shrunk up to almost a & # 34 ; belly shirt & # 34 ; , which is not attractive . The material is so thin you can see nipple through it . Once the shirt has been worn all day , the sleeves and bottom of the shirt become stretched out and misshapen . These were bought as undershirts under work shirts . I feel they are cheaply made and will not last for more than a month . Terrible shirts ! Will never buy these again .	-1
I just received my order and the shots are all stamped & # 34 ; irregular & # 34 ; in black ink ! I was a little annoyed because the website says nothing about them being anything less than standard quality new shirts . I opened the bag and some of the shirts actually had stains ! Disgusting ! I 'm really surprised with Amazon .	-1
I wanted to like these so bad , but unfortunately did n't . The legs were too snug on my baby , who is very thin and not chunky at ALL . It left red rings around her poor little thighs every time we used it . I like the idea of a snapped side , but think both sides snapping would be more functional . Do n't like that this is not an adjustable sizing product . It will either fit juuuuuust right , or be too big or too small .	-1
I have had a few swim diapers now and I would not recommend this particular one.PROS : Snaps on the right side make this SO much easier to put on , and more importantly , take off once it 's wet and clings to baby 's skin.It is made of a waterproof outer shell and a breathable inner shell that wicks moisture away from baby 's skin ( great for just hanging out pool/beach-side ; obviously does n't wick away moisture once baby 's submerged in the water , but I ca n't imagine any product that would be able to do so . ) CONS : The outer and inner materials I just mentioned above are extremely thin - not intended to hold or absorb any pee or poo . For that , there is an absorbent liner in between these two layers - but it does n't come up to the top of of the diaper in the front or the back - it just covers a small portion in the middle of the diaper . So , even the tiniest of bowel movements seem destined to immediately turn into blow-outs/accidents in this diaper due to this poor coverage.NOTE : This is very different from other iPlay swim diapers I 've had , where the entire product functions as a diaper with absorbent material throughout . I 'm not sure why this one is so shoddily made , but it does n't seem to be a one-off mistake , either - the first one of these I received actually had two little poo stains on it ( gross , of course - but Amazon 's fantastic customer service replaced it immediately ) . So , I 've now received two of these diapers and both of them are made in this shoddy way.Another possible con is that these seem to run very small : my 4 mo wears the 12 mo size . But if you 're careful about ordering , this is not necessarily a big deal - check the iPlay size chart and purchase based on their weight recommendations , not the age recommendations .	-1
I child is 2yrs old . 2T & 3T should fit well . I ordered a 2T , and it was too small . So I exchanged for a 4T , and that is still too small . Now the 2nd try , there 's no link to exchange . Very disappointing .	-1
I thought that since it `` claims '' to have a waterproof layer that prevents leakage and has a super absorbent layer to absorb wetness that my daughter would be safe wearing just that swim diaper while she waited to go swimming so I could put sunblock on her . Here is what the incorrect claim reads on the product description that you should be made aware of : -Waterproof layer prevents leakage-Super absorbent layer absorbs wetnessShe must have had it on for only a few minutes and peed because there was pee all over her and all over my lap . This diaper looked great and like another reviewer said , `` It seemed to have been made real well '' -- but it totally did not do what it claimed to do -- you 'd think if it had super absorbency then it would hold pee for a minute , right ? ! Since this is my first child , I guess you live and learn .	-1
I think it is meant for someone without hips . Which is not cool . I was dissatisfied . Also not a fan of the back , weird pattern/design .	-1
If I bought this I do n't know what happened to it . Did n't wear it .	-1
It s not really what i was expecting at all , it is to strechy and it s ommgg no no no	-1
My husband bought these shoes for an upcoming trip , but we 're having to return them.He has somewhat large feet at a size 11.5 , and usually wears a Wide . These shoes in an 11.5 fit fine and they were not narrow on him at all , but they bothered the inside of his feet near the ankles , like something was rubbing uncomfortably against them . He also says that they 're a lot heavier than he 's used to on his feet .	-1
this sneakers is lightweight BUT the width is narrow and the instep very tight ... New Balance usually makes a good shoe , but not this time	-1
Box and shoe state 9.5 2E but fit like a 9.5 D.I could n't get my foot in half way . Tbe material itself looks like it was worn out , faded . I am returning the shoes today for I 'll full refund .	-1
Disappointed with NB . I ordered a 7 4E ( wide ) but these fit like a 7 narrow . Back they went , thank goodness Amazon pays for return shipping . FYI NB customer service is not as good as they used to be when dealing with a warranty problem . New Balance customer service kept telling me `` you should have bought them direct from NB then we could honor your warranty '' . NB wants you to go to their web site and order shoes direct from them . However , the shoes are cheaper on Amazon .	-1
I was disappointed with this bra . It looked pretty and I was looking for a pink , lace bra ; however , this is difficult to hook ( has 4 or 5 hook and eyes - do n't remember exactly and I have since given it to a clothing drive since I only wore it a few times ) and no padding at all ( and I need it ! ) So , this was n't the bra for me . If you do n't need any padding or support and like all the hooks , then you might like it .	-1
The photos are great , but the product left me wishing for more . The straps have no adjustments and are too short and I am only 5'3 '' tall . Consequently the back rides up and the band doubles over . I feel Larger breasted women need adjustable straps and they cut corners in the wrong place.Bought 42C and the cups are more D sized . My best guess for sizing is to buy 1 size smaller than you normally do.The bra is very soft and comfortable . I do not use bras except with white or lightweight tops and this will do the job . I wo n't buy a second one .	-1
The soles of these sandals are wonderful -- the straps that go over the feet , not so much . No matter how I adjust them , they just are n't comfortable .	-1
All of the numbers fell offIt 's a stunning watch but not worth anything nowInvicta is very very very low in responding	-1
I loved the look of the shoe and the overall fit was very nice , but it has poor arch support . It also felt like there was not much & # 34 ; give & # 34 ; in the soles . It felt like I was walking in dress shoes . With athletic styles , usually there is a bit of bounce in the soles . Also , it felt like I was standing flat . I need a bit of lift in the heel because of heel spurs/plantar fasciitis . I sent these back .	-1
I really do not understand all the hype for these shoes . I guess to scuff around in they are ok but their almost flat contour has very minimal arch support . They also do nothing to correct common issues with arch and heel alignment which then allows the ankle to cant inward over time . SO not worth $ 70 and marginal even at the sale prices.I do n't care how many colors and textures you tart them up with , they are still the same kind of thing my GrandDad AND my Dad wore around the house . UGLY UGLY UGLY UGLYIt is n't easy but I have found other brands with similar slips ons which have a much better fit , more arch and inner heel support , and much nicer styling ... . especially those with the bungee lace ups which give enough to snug up to your foot with or without socks . AND as to pricing , more reasonable than these.The one pair I did buy , ( because many shoes can feel great at first ) now only see occasional use in the yard when I pull weeds .	-1
I bought these shoes for walking at work thinking I could just slip into them without ties to fuss with . But they have no arch support , the soles are flat and very uncomfortable to walk in . In addition they do n't really fit , they flop with every step like flip flops , not secure at all . I do n't like the way they look either . They have this quilted fabric that looks like bedroom slippers to me . I do n't really see the point of these shoes . They are n't attractive and are n't functional .	-1
purchase these sneakers for my mom who wears a size 9 ... ordered size 10W because she has fluid retention problem and they were very , very small ... she could not even get her instep into the sneaker ... not because of her foot but the sneaker is made very , very narrow ... sorry but these were a return !	-1
I normally like easy spirit products , but my pair was poorly sewn and within just a couple of days the fabric on the side had separated from the sole .	-1
I am returning the shoes as I did not like the fit . I also did not care for the material .	-1
I expected a lot from Docker for the price . After only being wore 2 times a month , holes wore through both pairs of Khaki pants in less than 9 months . I work in an office environment and do not subject my clothing to abuse . I will never buy Dockers again .	-1
For a big and tall pant , this is an awful fit . I wear a 44W x 34L , so I was glad to find that Amazon carried Docker 's in this size . Saves a trip to the mall . Price seemed good . When I got these pants I was very disappointed . While the fit in the waist and length were tight on , the butt and the thights were sized like a skinny jean a teenage boy might wear . Not at all the fit I was expecting . Very misleading . I have bought the `` signature '' khaki through JC Penney in their stores tons of times so I thought I was getting the same thing with a nice comfortable fit , you know , the things dockers are know for . I was really disappointed that amazon would not reimburse the shipping saying that incorrect fit is not their problem . I told them it was a case of incorrect descriptions , but they did n't care . How the hell did they win for best customer service a couple years ago ? I do n't see it . Do n't buy these unless you a tall fat guy who wants a really tight pair of pants .	-1
I bought this bra to be cool and comfortable in the Caribbean . The elastic and edges are so uncomfortable that I simply ca n't where it in the heat or otherwise .	-1
The bra fit me but it has extra material where the nipples are . I 've tried these kinds of bra 's before and they are not smooth in that area . I do n't get why they make bra 's like these .	-1
I liked these at first as they were inexpensive , fit well , are comfortable , and are thick enough to look and feel substantial . Unfortunately , after about 5 or 6 hourlong rides and two washes , tiny holes developed along and next to the seams in the seat . I have to throw these out since the holes will only get worse with wear or washes and since they 're not repairable due to the fabric and fit of the tights . I have a 25 '' waist and my tights were slightly large in a size 26 '' , so the issue was not that they were too small . Just a lack of quality , I guess . I 'm disappointed and am returning the second pair I bought .	-1
We plan to return them , the waistband is really odd and teenagers and elastic waist like this just is not fashionable enough , even at the barn .	-1
I normally wear a 10 or 12 . I ordered a size bigger since they look like a juniors cut . They were way to small . Cute though .	-1
My neighbor liked this shoe for Zumba , so I ordered a pair . The toe box was too narrow for me , and I would only be able to wear these shoes with very thin socks . The overall fit was odd , too , with no sole in the midfoot . I am afraid that they would be uncomfortable fo rme in the long run , so I sent them back .	-1
For $ 15.99 , I ca n't complain . You get what you pay for.Yeah , they 're cheap looking , but they serve their purpose.I wanted `` dangling '' pearl earrings , and that 's what I got.OBVIOUSLY , they 're not Tiffany , VanCleef-Arpels or BVlgari.If you like `` high-end '' jewelry , look elsewhere .	-1
The shoes are fine BUT they are not the color of the picture . The shoes are not brown in color , they are the off-white looking ones . I dont know if the picture is of the wrong shoes or if the company just messed up my order . I bought the shoes for my little sister 's birthday , thankfully she liked the off-white color better . That is why I only gave two stars , because I did not get what I thought I was ordering .	-1
Although these shoe covers look like all the others out there , as a Realtor , I 'd say this is false advertising to call them `` Large '' , and Amazon does n't seem to offer an `` Extra Large '' option . Mostly women and children were able to fit these on their shoes , but not men , so they are n't of much use at my open houses . Com'n Amazon ! Read all the reviews and amp up the sizing option .	-1
Very disappointed with these covers . They do not fit size 11 well . I previously purchased one pair of shoe covers at Lowes or Home Depot ( ca n't recall ) however they were a good fit especially for men with work boots . They lasted several months also until I decided to throw them out for looking really soiled . I 'll keep these but will need to purchase a larger size elsewhere . 50 pair under $ 11.00 is good , however the one pair I bought previously was about $ 2.00 + tax and was reused for a few months .	-1
This item was too long for me - I am about 5'0 & # 34 ; , 120lbs , and this item was way too long for my torso .	-1
I always make sure I read reviews before I buy & I saw that some stated these run small . I wear a size 7 So I bought a size 9 & they still was to small So I will be returning them . They are very pretty I wish they had fit : (	-1
I just did n't like it at all.Not comfortable and hurted my foot.very un happy with this product and it runs smaller that the original size .	-1
I have been wearing Reef 's since 2004 , specifically the Ginger style . I ordered a new pair of black ones and they are too small . I do n't know why Reef changed the sizing , but I am unhappy . I have several Ginger Reef flip flops all in size 5 and they fit perfectly ... I think a size 6 would be too big , so I am not risking ordering them online .	-1
Tow hangs off side and width is very narrow . I have skinny feet and it barely fit under the strap . Not comfortable the flip flip was very stiff	-1
I had to give these away because they were so narrow they would n't fit my feet comfortably ( and my feet are pretty darn narrow ) . Oh well !	-1
I have worn keds slip-ons like this for years and never had this problem before.I do n't know the technical names , but the height between the insole and the upper is so short I ca n't even get my foot in the thing ! If you look at the picture where the `` tongue '' part is raised , this pair is flat . I even tried putting powder in the shoe to force slip it on and I ca n't get my foot in at all.Very disappointed and I feel like this may be a `` second '' or `` irregular '' , not an actual Keds for retail , which would explain the lower cost as well.Very disappointed .	-1
Shoes are not like other Keds I 've worn in the past . They have little support , are flimsy , and look cheap .	-1
I liked the look of these shoes but they were too small . I considered a larger size but I could tell that the width would be too narrow . These would be terrible if you had bunyons . Do not buy if you have a wide foot .	-1
I had quality control issues on my last Citizen . Thought maybe it was a fluke and gave them another try . This one looks great for casual attire , but the crown has already stopped threading back into place . Not worth the effort to try and repair . I 'm done with Citizen .	-1
The watch was nice but the band was a strange color and design . Citzen makes a good watch it was a shame to return because of the band	-1
Good looking watch . Get lots of compliments . However within 4-5 weeks the crown is not locking into place any more . I also have one small stress crack on the face already , and I work in an office ! This was my first Citizen watch and likely my last . Will stick to my Swiss made watches from now on .	-1
Bought and then returned it ... The face of the watch is really small and almost looks like a womans watch . I like my watch faces over sized . This one just did n't do anything for me ...	-1
I am extremely upset with my new BM8180-03E because the second hand does not align with the marks around the dial , instead it lands in between the marks at .5 of every second.I bought this watch for the purpose of taking the pulse of my patients . I ca n't be bothered with trying to figure out if it was 59.5 seconds or 60.5 seconds when I started counting and then figure out if it 's 14.5 or 15.5 seconds later . I am truly upset it does n't live up to the Citizen reputation . The issues with the second hand are indicative of low quality control involved with mass-production . ( see below ) Other than the faulty second hand , the dial is clearly visible , and glow quite effectively in dark . ( Updated review to remove comment about day/date changing at 3pm due to setting it 12hrs off . ) This watch is smaller in diameter than I am accustomed to wearing and is suitable for a female.I will be returning this watch and will not purchase another Citizen watch due to the fact I need a watch that correctly aligns with the marks on the dial . I would not recommend this watch to anyone who cares about precision . Please reply if you know of a good watch for me to buy for around $ 100 . Thanks.Citizen replied to my inquiry within moments ! Here is their response/excuse : '' What you are seeing may be considered within factory specifications . This is due to gear play , dial imprinting and position of the watch . The actual specification is for the hands to hit dead on at 12:00 , but other alignment may be to one side or the other of the indice.There are a variety of factors that come into consideration when comparing hand to dial marker accuracy . While position of the watch has some affect on this , manufacturing tolerances in the various components play a greater role . There are acceptable tolerances within the gear mesh , dial imprinting/application , dial ring imprinting ( and mounting position ) as well as tolerances within the dial fitting to the movement itself.When all of these come into play , these tolerances can sometimes compliment each other and other times work against each other . It is for these reasons that there are some pieces within a series that are dead on , some that hit most marks , some that hit half the marks , some that hit some of the marks , etc.It is only when you get to the very high end of the product line ( aka Campanola and Exceed ) that the acceptable tolerances become `` tighter '' so to speak . ''	-1
Too small and hard to read for me and the crown is small and hard to set . I do not recommend , would not buy again and I hope this helps .	-1
I gave this watch a 2 after owning it for almost 2 years . The watch out of the box worked great for about 6-7 months then stopped running . I have always been careful to be sure the watch was in plenty of light to stay running . The watch has been in water but no deeper than 20 ft . If I hold the watch directly under a lamp the second hand will move but as soon as I remove from the direct light it stops . The watch is under warranty but when reading the warranty instructions I tried to contact one of the locations listed only to find out that it no longer serviced Citzen watches . I did find one location that would service but I had to pay shipping both ways and might have incurred a charge for any work not covered by the warranty . Additionally if the watch was unrepairable they would not send a replacement watch . It is a shame because I really like the watch but currently it is just sitting on my desk until I find a way to inexpensively get it repaired .	-1
very very small watch , not close to worth the money they charge for the watch . I returned the watch . thank you .	-1
I 've always considered myself mechanically adept but I had trouble using this tool . The instructions need a great deal of work . My advice to the manufacturer would be to develop a fixed device that I have seen work on jeweler 's benches . Also , to be more effective , the heads should consist of a two-sided static pieces and two sides that can be adjusted . Oh , and you will want to fix the base from up and down movement . Otherwise , the watch merely squirms away from the wrench , as it does now.I would not buy this wrench again.If this review was helpful , please add your vote .	-1
It 's really flimsy , which , of course , you can guess from the price and I thought I would n't care . But the fact that I 've used it only once tells me it was n't a wise purchase . I ride a motor scooter and a bicycle and I prefer white accessories for visibility , but this just does n't make the cut .	-1
After the anklet was not available in the size I needed , I decided to go ahead and order 1/2 inch shorter . When the anklet FINALLY arrived , the chain already looked TARNISHED ! There was NO shine and it had the yellow/gold tarnished look . I will try to clean when I get time and hopefully clean the anklet up . Will have to wait and see how well it 'll clean up with the silver cleaner . Will keep my fingers crossed .	-1
Ok . I used to love Rothco BDU 's . But they seem to have no quality control , as 3 out of the 4 I ordered in the last month are DEFECTIVE . Direct Premium Buys and Army Universe are no help either . DPB promised not to charge me a re-stock fee , then did anyway ( after sending me more defective pants , which I again had to pay to ship back to them ) . These companies keep charging me money , and I still do n't have my darn pants ! I will be ordering my BDU 's through LAPG from now on .	-1
These are falsely advertized as being BDU/ACU with a button fly . The ones I received have a zipper fly . The seat is not reinforced as is the norm with BDU/ACU . Dont waste your money or your time on these cheap imitations !	-1
The colors are alot brighter than the picture shows and they fall right off . I gave them to a friend	-1
Straps are very tight across . If you have narrow feet , this is the shoe for you . They do support the arch nicely but are not made for medium-width feet .	-1
I love the sandal and the length is just perfect for my foot , however , the straps are way too tight and I do n't think I 'm going to chance that they will stretch out .	-1
If you have wide feet , this is not the sandal for you . They are narrow and I ended up cutting off one of the straps which was completely unnecessary to the fit of this sandal . Should pass that on to teva who could save money from eliminating this one strap that digs into your little toe !	-1
What I received is cute , fur lined , well sewn . it is true to size . I wear 9.5 , and ordered 9 in these because the first pair really was WAY too long to be an accurate 9.5 . These are snug , but think they will stretch . I have narrow feet and they are good . I did not yet contact the company about this error , so I can not say as to how they would respond . They have a thin but firm man made sole . These will be good for keeping at work when I need to slip into something more comfortable or when I drive to work in my scrumptious ACORN chinchilla slippers and forget to bring a pair fo shoes to change into ( happened once ! ) . Minnetonka makes very high quality products - the low score is for sending me the wrong model - not even anything close . The delivery is fast and they have good packing .	-1
This type of moccasin used to be a favorite of mine . The style of the boot has changed . It runs very small and is very flimsy .	-1
Although the right size , they fit wrong and felt funny on my feet . I have always wanted a pair , but they just did not work for me . I will keep searching for the right pair .	-1
This wax definitely did not put a good shine on either my black or brown leather shoes . And on my black shoes it left behind a whitish residue in the 'stress points ' that absolutely would not buff out no matter what I tried . Definitely not impressed .	-1
Rockport is supposed to be known for comfort , but these bad boys do n't deliver . I suppose since Rockport got taken over by New Balance and then Adidas , quality is being sacrificed to boost the bottom-line.If you lift up the insole you will feel underneath it is like a piece of steel . There is literally no give to the shoe . I bought them thinking they were Rockports -- known for quality -- however Rockport is n't the same compnay today . I probably could get more comfort from a $ 30 pair of shoes in a baragin bin , then these overpriced clunkers !	-1
I have been buying this model for more than a decade because of its durability and comfort as a semi-dress , non-formal work shoe . I currently have two pairs that I was seeking to replace because of heel wear.The new shoes were not at all like my previous pairs . The lasts are too stiff , and the soles are made of cheap plastic rather than very durable rubber ( I think my first pairs of these had vibram soles ) .I decided to send them back . Amazon declined to pay shipping because I said it was an `` unexpected style '' issue . I would like to dispute this , but I do n't know where to do that .	-1
I bought a & # 34 ; black & # 34 ; pair of these shoes at Nordstrum where they are 30 % more expensive , and I found this pair to be comfortable from the start.I bought a brown pair of this same shoe through Amazon at the cheaper price and found them to be uncomfortable because their inner sole insert was irregular and not flat . I returned them to Amazon .	-1
I walk a lot and this shoe was not good for me . I love Rockports but the heel of this show is really hard and never loosened up . Would not buy again .	-1
Purchased for father and ordered his normal size . His worn this same shoe for 25 years . The fit was totally off and they had to be returned , sadly . Guess he will go to an actual store for his next pair .	-1
this shoe is not comfortable like running shoe , the sole is hard , and flat , and little heavy .	-1
No support to speak of and not all that comfortable . Bought some Asics to walk in they are lighter and a more comfortable shoe for me to walk in . Will not buy another pair of these as they are sitting in my closet . A waste of money for what they advertise as a `` pro walker '' .	-1
i used to buy rockport shoes exclusively but not anymore . when these shoes were made in the united states they were some of the best shoes around . not anymore . its a shame , shame , shame .	-1
I tried these on in a local store and they had the appropriate High Arch . But these ones had no Arch . I sent them back and was very disappointed .	-1
I 've had real Ray-Bans with the wrap around earpieces and they were not uncomfortable like this . Also , they scratch very easily and the marks are very noticeable on the mirror lens . I would not recommend these glasses . Spend a little more and get a quality product .	-1
these are waaaay to big . Model makes them appear sexy with the lace touch , but these panties are huge.i usually wear a five or six and i do n't think a 3 wouldhave worked . To much fabric .	-1
No padding inside box . Just the sunglasses and a lot of box to tumble against Asinine packaging ! Sunglasses were very warped and could not be bent back into shape .	-1
My head is average but this fits a bit big . It 's comfortable though . They claim it 's polarized but I don not get that impression .	-1
These are very lightweight . The center nose piece blocks a portion of my view . The center nose support is so large that you see it when wearing the sunglasses .	-1
the jeans are not what I expected they do not fit good at all	-1
I bought three jeans from you . The first one was very good but the last two , the loops are off and that over a period of two months from the day Ireceived them . I can not give a good rating because the product was perverted . Sorry.And sorry for my english too .	-1
All my life I have thought of Wrangler as being Levi 's main competitor for durability and quality construction.These jeans end that image of Wrangler in my mind . Dollar store specials would be more appropriate .	-1
this trousers size too large ! it does n't fit ! this trousers size too large ! it does n't fit ! this trousers size too large ! it does n't fit ! this trousers size too large ! it does n't fit	-1
I just threw away these pants that I bought 6 months ago . The black faded to a dark grey , with lighter grey wear around the edges . The fade would look fashionable for jeans , but not for dress pants . Next time I will stay away from cotton for dress pants and stick to the synthetics , or washable synthetic wool blends . Those other materials hold their deep black color nicely for years .	-1
This thong style did n't work for me . Inexpensive flip flops have a more comfortable toe dividers than these shoes do ! I 'll stick to the ARIZONA or Madrid styles from now on . Thankfully , Amazon has an easy return process .	-1
It was way too narrow and the model I actually do n't like ... it 's really more for petit feet , besides that it is more narrow than other birks .	-1
I 'm a large size ( 34 E ) and have a Panache sports bra that I absolutely love , so I was surprised to find that I did n't care for this bra at all.The band is not large enough to support a larger bust , the straps offer no help either ( although the band should do the work anyway . ) The cups themselves had a strange shape , shallow but large , sort of pushing things down on your chest . This actually worked as a minimizer , so in that way it could be beneficial . But with the poor support , I would n't want to wear this bra in public.It was comfortable -- that and the minimizing were it 's good points . Other than that , a waste of money for me . It would probably work well for a C-D cup or smaller .	-1
I rec 'd this Kenneth Cole wallet , had about a month now and the stitching is coming out already . I have almost nothing in it so its not like its stretched out causing alot of pressure .	-1
I 've had this watch for five years and was lured by the & # 34 ; Navy Seal & # 34 ; mystique . In that time period , it 's gone through numerous batteries while the watch sat in watchbox most of the time . This watch uses about three batteries a year on average . I use excellent quality batteries that last two to three years on other watches . I wear the watch maybe 10 times a year and do n't abuse it . The second hand fell off once and rotating dial came loose in the first six months . The case back screws rusted after three years.Trying to deal with Luminox was maddening and they wanted $ 130 to repair the watch with a three month turn-around . I took it to a local watchmaker ( has worked on my watches for 20 years ) who made it better than new for $ 60 . The watchmaker said not to take this into the water because he questioned the watch being & # 34 ; water resistant & # 34 ; because the original factory seal ( no pun intended ) was so poor . I 've had Timex watches that are far better quality than this . My far less expensive Casio G Shock feels like far better quality . The stainless steel caseback is the best made part of this watch . It 's sturdy . The rest of the watch is cheap plastic . I 'd like to see better build quality , more metal/less plastic a better water resistant seal.Now onto the case : it 's not much better . While it 's hard and protects the watch because it has a soft foam inside , the zipper broke after three months . The red rivets on the zipper fall out of the case . Again , dealing with Luminox was unsuccessful.Advice : Do n't be lured by the mystique of a & # 34 ; Navy Seal & # 34 ; watch . Spend your hard-earned money on something else .	-1
This got bent out of shape really quickly after buying it . I still use it with one part bent down but only because I do n't want to spend money for another one . Probably would not buy again .	-1
It arived and does not work , at all . Maybe yours will but my order came new and does n't work . Also , now that I see it I have a collapsible umbrella already that is nicer and has an extending handle . This one has a VERY short handle . You would have to hold it on top of your head ! Kind of weird actually .	-1
Just as advertised / regular dish soap works just as well .	-1
This is the first of its kind that I have tried , so I guess it 's ok it cleaned my jewelry just fine.would recommend .	-1
I used this product per the directions exactly -- -Not a good investment for me ... it did nothing to clean or improve the appearance of my jewelry	-1
It oxidizes my jewelry pieces so I do n't like it ! ! All my Jewelry were stained with this product ... I was really mad	-1
Wanted to like this robe , but it 's a big disappointment . It does n't drape well on me and hangs badly in places . I 'm 5'5 and 118 , and the small size should have fit better . I 'd prefer it longer than reaching the top of my calves , and it 's awkward to reach up high for anything because of the constricted way the sleeves are cut.For the price , I was hoping for a robe that looked becoming . It just looks dowdy and sloppy -- not classy as I 'd expected . On the other hand , a fun robe I bought from Kmart 's site on a lark for only $ 18 looks much better . I 'm returning the Shangri-la robe . For the same money I can buy something I 'll actually use .	-1
The Heather Latte in Large looked like a baggy paper bag . I wear a Woman 's 10/12 . The Large was oversized in an unflattering way . The sleeves are VERY wide . You do n't get much coverage at the bottom , even though the robe runs large . It will `` gap '' along the legs . I am 5 ' 10 '' and the length was just below the knee ( not a plus as far as I 'm concerned ) . As another reviewer noted , the fabric is almost translucent . It DOES cling . Okay if you want something to travel with that does n't take up a lot of space and is very light-weight . It IS warm given the weight . I tried hard to like this robe ( given the very positive reviews other buyers had given it ) , but gave up in the end and returned it .	-1
I did read the review they were mix reveiws some say great some say not so great.well I took a chance price was good but once here I was like no way that is going to work out , I am 160-165 pounds and a 42 D cup and it fix well but the stupied foam things in the bra u can see them when u wear a shirt.If it did not have that myb it be ok.would not wear it out in public cause it is not even 50 persent soported .	-1
The cups were larger than expected , and the padding wouldnt stay in place . They kept sliding into my arm pits . I tried to remove them , but then there was to much material and it was very wrinkly under my clothes . Not satisfied . I would prefer a thinner more beathable cotton bandeau . This material did not breath well at all . I was sweating in this all day . Will not wear again .	-1
I 've worn this a few times , out of desperation . I 'd rather go braless than wear it again , however . I washed it , along with the passing inside , making the padding no longer no longer useful . The top digs in to my chest giving a strange deep indent if wearing a tank top of strapless dress . I ordered an X-Large hoping to avoid the indent from the band , but going up a size did n't help .	-1
I shopped for a backpack/bag that I could use while site seeing in DC this spring . I thought a shoulder tote would be too heavy and one-sided to serve my purpose but I wanted something that did n't look like I was trekking through the mountains . I needed it to be big enough to hold sweaters , water , snacks , cameras and purse contents since we would be gone for the entire day.It held a good amount of stuff I will say that . And I loved the turquoise color but it was n't as comfortable as I had hoped ( it kinda smashed my boob ) forcing me to constantly adjust it . The phone holder on the strap is a total waste ( I 'd never put my phone in there and could n't think of what would fit in the little space -- gum ? ) it actually gets in the way . By day 3 it was coming apart at the strap so I bought an $ 8.99 Washington DC zippered tote at a souvenir shop and left the backpack behind for someone desperate or a homeless person to use .	-1
Just requested shipping label . Although nice in appearance it it is flawedThe strap is velcro attached with a weird huge heavy buckle that holds thethe short straps together when an adult tries to use it and the ends do n't meet.Nice color and all but useless even for very light loads.What angers me is this is the perfect size for me and the light sketching stuff I carry around except for the 2 or 3 inch too short strap.Also not waterproof or water resistant.I like the makers style , so I hope they read and learn cause I think they would hit pay dirt with a few changes	-1
way too small for an adult . in an XL ! what did they think they were selling ? ? This probably would fit my 7 year old niece .	-1
They are nice , but too small even for the price . If you are looking for gold earrings you better paid more for a bigger pair .	-1
This bag could be perfect if it had longer straps . When it 's stuffed full , the straps are nearly impossible to get over my shoulders . And I 'm a very petite person . I can only imagine the difficulty a larger person might experience trying to shoulder the straps when the bag is full .	-1
I love the quality , love the space . But for some reason the bag slides around and always ends up resting on my hip . Two other family members had the same issue . And the thick strap around the front is not flattering .	-1
I wanted to love this bag- it seems perfect ... .until you use it . Everything is just not quite what it needs to be . 1st- the fabric is wonderfully lightweight , but then the zippers fobs are all ( there are a LOT of them ) so heavy that it makes the bag about twice as heavy as it needed to be . Then , the inside is so odd : it looks like you have great sections and separated areas- but they are n't really separate or fully enclosed . The two sections with zippers are not sewn to the bottom of the bag , meaning that anything small you think you have placed in one of the open sections is free to slide under the zippered pouch to another section . Even weirder- the sides are also not secured to the bottom of the purse , so if you unzip the sides all the way down stuff can slide out the edges too . You are n't going to lose anything large- but do n't expect pens , change , or anything smaller than a marble to stay inside if you are n't diligent . The final issue is the strap- it is slippery , so I found I had to wear it cross-body all the time or it would slide off of my shoulder . It is such a shame , because I love the size of this purse and had high hopes for it- but in actual use it is too high maintenance .	-1
Just okay . I wanted a really small nose ring that I could wear to work . I had to cut the bar because it was too long and you obviously can not wear the back in your nose . It only stayed in for a few days because the ball is so small that it can be pulled through the piercing . I would n't recommend .	-1
The balls on these earrings are too small . They are barely larger than the posts , so as a result , the earrings pull through the ears and fall out the back .	-1
I 'm used to Ray Bans but kept scratching the lenses and got sick and tired of spending $ 70 each time I needed a new pair of sunglasses . Bought these and wore them for about one day . Too tight , too flimsy , lenses look weird , things are distorted . They probably are great glasses for someone , just not me .	-1
I do n't like , to small for my head , and no I do not have a big head it is average ... ..ly larger but not as big as you think .	-1
I agree with a previous reviewer . It did not fit my 18 month old 's head . Granted , he has a rather big head , but as one of the previous reviewers stated , it wo n't fit a 3 yr old with a head circumference in the 50th percentile range ( which is where my kid 's head is if you went across the growth chart ) . I bought it because it said it was for kids 3 and up , so I thought it would fit my son 's head . Oh well . The search continues . In terms of durability , it seems rather sturdy and heavy , so I 'd imagine it would last quite a while . It 's made out of hard plastic .	-1
1st of all it came folded over several times which left un-removable creases in the material . 2nd the tops of the & # 34 ; boots & # 34 ; were large enough to fit around my WAIST which looked ridiculous around my legs . 3rd . the elastic straps on the bottom that are designed to wrap around your shoes are SO short that when I wrapped them under my foot- NO SHOE ON- they scrunched up my foot and it started to fall asleep . No way that would EVER fit over ANY pair of shows I own . Very poorly made .	-1
I 'm a fairly big man with thick calves and despite trying to get the laces as tight as possible I could n't keeps these up on my legs . They looked good , but I finally had to do what many others did and pin them to my pants .	-1
So it seemed like such a good idea , but if you try to slip this over a zip-up boot , there 's no way to either get it over the boot once it 's on , or zip up the boot if you try to put it on the boot before putting it onto your foot . Sad and disappointed pirates , we were : ( It *might* work over a shoe . Dunno .	-1
I 've heard/read so many great things over the years about Easy Spirit and really liked the idea that this walking shoe was available in C/D width.For me , however , the Avia walker is better simply because the sole has more cushion . On my feet for hours at a clip , I also added my usual tri-comfort and ball of foot inserts just because . So far , my feet are much happier.I could have saved these Easy Spirit 's as a secondary pair , but the Avia 's also cost a couple of bucks less . I 'll give the Avia 's a couple more weeks before deciding on whether or not they are my `` new '' shoe .	-1
I have several Easy Spirit shoes ordered in past few years . This shoe does not have the quality that my older ones have . I think it may have been made in China . Runs smaller than my other ES shoes , returned	-1
I had these in a dark red patent . They were oh-so-cute . Comfortable fit , nice insole , just perfect ... or so I thought.The extra pleather across the toe , plus the buckles are problematic . Although they feel good on and standing , they are torture after walking for any length of time . The extra pleather binds the foot when walking and the buckle digs into the foot . If these were leather , not synthetic , they might give a bit.They might work for some but definitely walk in these a bit for making a decision . I wish I did . I purchased based on comfort and fit , not walkability . As a result , my shoes ended up in the charity pile .	-1
It 's hard to have it stay on . It 's a bit heavy so it did n't help when its a bit big	-1
I purchased 3 pairs of KEEN sandals , all 3 different styles . Of the three , this is the only one I must return . I hesitate to evaluate shoes for anyone else unless I 'm talking about quality because I have lots of foot problems and very difficult to fit feet . I have plantar fasciitis , get cramps in my legs , feet and toes , have a narrow heel , bunions and hammertoes . The arch in the shoe , for me , seemed misplaced -- it was more forward , toward my toes and uncomfortable . Also the top was a little tight for me . Sometimes my foot swims in a medium width shoe , but not this one . Since I did n't wear it , I can not talk about the quality . I 'm enjoying the other pairs and can tell that they are more comfortable than the tennis shoes or clogs I usually wear . I 'm happy I finally found this brand !	-1
I live in a hot climate and I found the footbed makes my feet sweat also got painful blisters on the back of my heel from the strap rubbing . This is my firt pair of Keen and this style seems to run a half size small I needed a 9.5 in venice , I normally wear a 9 in other brand shoes . These make your feet look like boats , not at all attractive especially with socks which is the only way I find them comfortable . I will use them on my kayak where nobody will see my ugly giant boat shoes . Not a big fan of these .	-1
Do not buy these , I wish I had not thrown the money away on these . Originally when I bought these for my husband he really enjoyed them . I even went so far as to order a second package of 4 , especially when I saw the price decrease . SO SORRY I DID . Original purchases early 2012 - it is now August . He absolutely can not ( not to be confused with will not ) wear these any more . The first 2 months were fine - he really liked them a lot ; very comfortable and glad he changed from the regular briefs he had been wearing for years , usually Hanes brand . I followed washing instructions to the letter . He said after a couple months the elastic was no longer holding up . First : around the waistband was no longer holding up - no weight change , actually I purchased because he had lost weight but now has maintained . Second : the worst part - he says the elastic around the legs is completely non-existant . In other words does not hold him at all . We have thrown them all out . This is the first time he has insisted I go on Amazon & warn other people like we 've relied on reviewers before us . Thanks to the reviewer who gave me a place to start to purchase different brands ( 2xist , C-in2 , Calvin Klein , Puma ) to see what he likes . So disappointed in the Hanes brand overall will not consider any more of their products for men or women ever .	-1
I have in my drawer a pair of Hanes Comfort Soft underwear I bought from a local big box store about 3 years ago . They are soft , comfortable , and breathe fairly well . Unfortunately , these new Hanes `` Comfort Soft '' [ NOT ! ! } underwear may resemble the old ones in a picture , and both are called Comfort Soft , but in real life they are simply HORRID . The material is so rough I feel I could use them to hand scrub heavily stained pots and pans . The problem is they are using such a rough fabric , that it is extremely irritating to my skin . In addition , this product does NOT breath at all . I found myself waking up with so much sweat in all the wrong places , that I had to slip off my underwear in the middle of the night and fling them across the room . In addition , because they use such crappy material for the body , the wrap around on the waistband is just about as rough as any waist band I have ever felt . There was no point in even wrapping these waist bands.I will NEVER buy a Hanes product again ! After having tried several brands that are being sold today , I have finally found underwear that IS good . If you want soft , comfortable underwear that breathes properly , you want Stacy Adams underwear . It is my # 1 choice . Eddie Bauer is n't too bad either , but if I could give Stacy Adams underwear a 10 star rating , I would give Eddie Bauer underwear probably a 7 or 8 star rating , depending on the particular item selected . And , of course , Hanes underwear deserves a ZERO star rating , in my opinion . ( Fruit of the Loom = 1 Star , just in case somebody is wondering ... Merona USED to sell underwear my size , but stopped . The Merona underwear I have left would get about a 4 or 5 star rating . I 've checked out Merona underwear at Target , and it still feels like the stuff I bought when it was available .	-1
the band is narrow and poorly finished so it rubs against the skin uncomfortably - these had to be Hanes REJECTS - could n't return them so I toss them out - total loss stay away from these crappy , uncomfortable underwear	-1
Arrived on schedule . Well packaged.The fabric is very stiff . I thought I could soften them up by washing several times with softener but not the case . The fabric is so stiff , that after washing I tossed it on my ironing board and it was partially standing . The peak was higher than my iron.The texture and feel of the fabric is scratchy and somewhat harsh.The sizes are way off . A medium engulfs me . They do not shrink after hot water washings.The tops have a slit up the side and appear very feminine.I have never worn Dickies before and I really regret ordering these . Since I washed them I can not return them , so I am going to give them away.As a guy , there is nothing I like about this product.============================I gave these away . The lady that took them agreed the fabric was `` stiff and scratchy '' . However , her biggest complaint was that after removing from the dryer , the amount of lint on the scrubs . She had to use 2-3 sticky roller sheets per side of the tops and bottoms to remove the lint . The scrubs are dark blue.I ordered Landau . Their products are much better suited for my needs . I can wash and dry without doing anything else . They do not look feminine and the fabric does not feel like a toe sack .	-1
True to size , but , very boxy and stiff . Not a comfortable wear , equivalent to buying from local Walmart or thrift store	-1
Itchy , stiff fabric . I normally buy another brand but I tried dickies because they have a good name . I personally do not care for them , and will return to buying my normal brand .	-1
They were too tight at the waist and the legs are too big . When I tried them on I looked terrible ! Even though it says elastic waist they do n't give at all and the waist band is wide so it actually hurts to wear them .	-1
The size on these pants was not the normal 4X . I would guess them to be more like 6X . They are way too long and on the pocket that is on the right leg just above the knee is a bright red Dickies tag . I really do n't want to wear pants with a tag on the middle of my leg . They wrinkled when they were washed . ( Hot water did not shrink them . ) Maybe if they actually fit , I might be happier .	-1
Bought these for work as I need to wear khakis ! These where the worst ! Fell off my butt all day ! Waste of money ! Im buying scrubs from Wal-Mart !	-1
I ordered a 5x just incase they shrank when washed . What I got were a 5x top and a 4x bottom . The bottoms were too long and the top just fit snuggly . Good thing I ordered a size or two up . In other brands I get a 3x . You can tell these are their lower end products . They are okay in a pinch but I would not order again	-1
I have purchased 2 of these through Amazon . At an average cost of $ 90.00 I would have expected quality.The plastic is light and creeks when you open that glasses . You get the distinct feeling that it is not very flexibleand will snap.It is said to be made in Italy ! ! ! I really doubt it . If it is authentic , I really feel for Rayban falling so far below standard.My advise to you , is to pay more , go to a shop and feel the quality before you buy . You are not getting a bargain from thisAmazon seller .	-1
I bought these ignoring the poor reviews since they were sold by Amazon but the negative reviews were true . I do n't know if they 're fake , everything checked out , but they felt cheap , the arms creaked , and the lenses felt loose . I even went to sunglass hut to double check and they are definitely lower quality . They 've been returned .	-1
Having owned B & L ; Ray Ban sunglasses for D E C A D E S ( still own them and actually worth crazy dollars ) and purchased knock offs at flea markets ( BETTER than whatever is passing as $ 100 sunglasses now ) I will tell you that the only other weaker thing is the case they come in . whew what happened to quality . wish I would have thought about weighing them before I sent them back . needless to say , here are MY glasses which have lasted decades , something these would NEVER do.http : //www.etsy.com/listing/110895449/vintage-ray-ban-bausch-and-lomb-diamond ? ref=similar_items_sashpurchased at a sunglasses hut kiosk in 1991 for $ 125 , and my wayfarer 5024s I purchased in the 90 's at drug emporium for $ 45 which are $ 100 used today ! just watch a few you tube vids on people getting shanked before you buy these.it makes one wonder , if they can actually produce counterfeits so cheaply what are you paying for when you get the original ? do your homework or know what you are buying . they were in a ups drop box the NEXT day.13JUNE13apparently B & L ; now make junk . this have not be confirmed by ME , but my girl ( who I purchased these for on amazon ) was in a sunglasses store , and while she was speaking with the owner about returning the pair HE had for $ 180 , he confirmed that this is the `` new '' composite materials they NOW use . I will NEVER buy ray ban again , or recommend them.I will however continue to take wonderful care of my existing ones that were made with quality materials over 2 decades ago.if I get in a store and remember I will post my findings .	-1
I Really Wanted to Like These , but ... you should try them on in the store first unless you 've worn them before . I bought the large and they were still too small for my face . The ear pieces do not flex much -- there is no spring in the hinge area . And if you 've been wearing aviator styles with thin frames around the lenses these will be a shock . The thick lens frames will feel like you are trying to look around the center post that separates the windows in your car . They create a blind spot of sorts . If you can live with that -- no worries . They are a great traditional style . Just be sure the size fits you as to width across the face .	-1
I had to return these Ray-Ban sunglasses , they were way to big for my small face . I reordered a different pair .	-1
The pants are pretty good by itself , unfortunately , the size chart was not clear enough and I bought one WAY too big , I can not wear like it is , and have it tailored will cost me more than the scrub itself . There it goes my 18 bucks + S & H ... damn it !	-1
I was hoping these would soften up in the wash but so far they have not . I do n't wear them but since I washed them , I ca n't return . I would if I could .	-1
I have been on a mission to find scrubs that are durable , comfortable , and fit in an aesthetically pleasing manner ! These scrubs do not encompass most of these features . They are durable , but the fit is not ideal . They are too loose , around the waste , but they have the right length . As a result , I am constantly needing to retie the drawstring , since my pants are always falling down , which is not ideal in clinic . The cut is also not flattering . The material is not soft , and it can be irritating at the end of a long day . I have found other scrubs that I prefer ( greys anatomy scrubs by Barco ) , so I wo n't be buying these again . They are generic and inexpensive , so they do their job , but I want scrubs that are more comfortable and fit better .	-1
Merchandise was shipped on a timely basis . The fabric of these pajamas is very flimsy , and the buttons were barely on the shirt . Had to sew all the buttons on before my husband could wear them . Do not recommend	-1
The medium size costume is supposed to fit a child 50-54 '' tall . My daughter is 50 '' tall and the costume is extremely short , probably more appropriate for a size small or x-small . The headband was also extremely small , it could n't even fit my shitzu puppy 's head . The belt was way too small . The boots appeared to be appropriately sized . I sewed elastic to the headband and the belt and they now fit correctly . However , the skirt on the costume can not be altered and my daughter will need to wear shorts under it . I think someone tossed different sized parts of the costume into one package and sold it as a size medium .	-1
My boys were batman and robin for this Halloween . My oldest wore this costume ( 3.5 years old ) . It fit him perfectly and was ALMOST too small . The construction was very poor of this costume . Loose strings and threads . I love that the mask and cape were one piece but the closure was really itchy on my son and he kept saying it `` hurt '' he also wore this once without a shirt on and his skin was very red like after he did . Almost chemical burn like ? it healed up in a few days . It was very odd.It looked adorable but was not at all well made and I 'm still concerned about my sons skin turning red .	-1
It feels as if you were sitting on a cloud ! These are so lightweight and comfy ! ! I ordered both , this version , and the low rise version . Overall , I like this model better . The low rise version tends to be a little tighter in my opinion . It is expensive , but it is worth it . Just like what they say : `` You get what you paid for . '' I will definitely order more.EDIT : After a couple hours walking with them , these tend to ride up from the back . I am going to try to go a little smaller to see if they will hold in place , but other than that , they are really comfy ! EDIT AGAIN : Okay , after a while , these do not hold place and start to become baggy . I do not know if the product I received is not good , but these do not hold place . I will order another to see if it is a quality issue .	-1
These are classic fake black market CK underwear . The label was really crude and they were incredibly small for a medium US size . Very thin material as well . Do not buy . You will be disappointed . I will never buy clothing again on Amazon . Plus 22 bucks for one pair ! ! ! ! Zero stars ! ! !	-1
Based on other reviewers I made my purchase , the fit was great but these hold in heat and by the end of the day ... let 's just say they were funky smelling . I still have them but only wear them to the gym still having the same results . Wash and hang dry , a hot dryer will ruin the material .	-1
Purchased these for my son for swim team based on the reviews . Yes , the fabric is nice and it fit him perfectly , but after one wearing and swim meet the hole where the tie goes has already started to rip . Not a small rip but at least an inch . I am going to try and sew as he needs it on a daily basis . I am not sure if it was a defective suit to begin with , but I will tell you , when we received it the box was crushed . It may have been returned and re-sold . From now on this is something i will go to a store to purchase .	-1
If I could give zero stars i would . I have ordered cheap watch products made in China for the last time . These tools were so bad , and cheaply made , there was no way I would even attempt to use . There were rough edges on every piece and fit and finish was none existent . I do n't recommend , spend more for higher quality .	-1
Too small and wo n't stay up . Nothing more to say , but I have to write twenty or more wrods to publish this .	-1
My daughter gave me this , and so I 'd never tell her ( but she does frequently comment that she can not see the stones ) .1 . You can not see the stones inside when you 're wearing it .. ... I guess you just have to enjoy knowing that they 're there . ..2 . The clasp is very tiny and cheap.3 . The loop that the chain passes through is .. in a very odd place . on the BACK side of the pendant , so it 's just oddly lumpy and hangs awkwardly . . . I do n't quite understand why it was designed this way.Not something I enjoy wearing , except that my dear daughter got it for me ..I can fix that clasp problem .and I guess a jewelry could redesign the loop a bit , for me . but . .you still couldnt see the stones .. .a lot of fixing to do here , such a shame .	-1
It 's very beautiful and arrived very quick , the packaging was very nice . But , I do n't know if it 's a one time defect or if it 's the workmanship . On the front right side of the heart , it has an opening all the way through . It does n't look like it 's broken , just seems like it was n't welded together as it should 've been . It does n't affect how it works ( open or closing ) , just irritates me . Gives a perfect heart a flaw . Forgot to mention , I bought it as a gift to give my mother.I gave it two stars because it 's still pretty nonetheless , but it 's not worth that price . The most I believe it 's worth is $ 25 .	-1
My 11yo DIL hated this . Why ? I think packaging . When you package something cheap then it feels cheap . The actual product is n't bad , just poorly presented .	-1
Fit poorly and made me feel like Madonna in her cone bra ! sent this one back !	-1
The bra did not fit the description . No lift or good support . Also the bra is so thin that you can totally when your nipping . I do n't recommend this bra .	-1
I always wear Bali bras . But this one is terrible ! The underwire painfully poked me in the underarm area , the entire bra felt abrasive on my skin ( very itchy ) , and the cups are very sheer ( no & # 34 ; highbeam & # 34 ; coverage ) .	-1
Please note : the watch is fantastic . It 's the description of the size that is the problem . As I now see another reviewer mentioned , the watch should be advertised as Women 's not Unisex.I have subsequently purchased the Men 's version of this watch , the Timex Men 's T5E901 . I absolutely love the watch . The functionality is the same as the & # 34 ; Unisex & # 34 ; ( Women 's ) , but the strap and face on the 901 are larger.This is the perfect workout watch , especially if you swim as well . It 's low profile but very functional . Ladies , this 961 is the right size for you . Gents , I 'd suggest considering the 901 .	-1
I love the looks of this watch , but it 's a terrible design.The wrist band did fit my large arm.Timex makes a watch I love - the Expedition Indigo with a alarm that has two stems and it 's all analog.It is also discontinued , so I bought the last one I could find.This watch was supposed to replace my favorite , but it 's a poor alternative , despite the title.This watch glows , but it 's hard to find the right button ( there are 5 to fumble with ) .The indigo lighted dial is much dimmer and nearly useless to me.The digital part of this watch is hard to program and not very useful for it 's stated purpose.I hate what you have to do to set an alarm or to monitor it.The date display is hard to read and poorly designed .	-1
The box looks quite charming on-line . The reality is that it is a small cheap looking item . The drawers are tiny . It will be very difficult to get anything out of the side drawers unless you use tweezers .	-1
This hat was not quite what I expected . I noticed that when I put it on it did not look right . The top portion was too soft , and kind of `` mushroomed '' out when I put it on my head , making it kind of silly looking . I returned it . At least that was easy .	-1
They sent me a youth large , I assumed this hat was an ADULT one size fits most not a CHILD 'S ! I bought this as a birthday gift for my husband but instead gave it to my 4 year old son . Definitely not what I intended .	-1
firstly I am sorry I purchased it , the strap part is sort of tight with one side tighter than the other I am thoroughly disappointed , you need tiny slim feet to probably feel comfy in this I an true 6 size but this has a funny feel , waste of money , no I want my money back !	-1
They were cushy which was why I bought them . The fabric straps were a little flimsy but workable.The black foam rubber though was a deal breaker . Not only will it make your feet black but itabsorbs water and squish squishes and gets slippery.Gave them to the Goodwill .	-1
Extremely comfortable , and an attractive flip flop . But , the soles of my feet are stained black every day ! I started noticing black foot prints in the tub . Quit wearing the reef , and the footprints are gone !	-1
First off its Not attractive looking . and it feels stiff and bulky and FLAT . Arch support really ? I do n't feel it at all.It hurt my foot after I wore it a little in the house ( did n't even walk around whole much ) . Very uncomfortable . Ca n't believe the price ! ! ! If this is what Reef offers for all other sandals and it 's considered one of the best ones they have , I say REEF SUCKS .	-1
I normally wear size 7 , and I have wide feet ( D ) . I ordered this style ( Sandy Flip Flop ) specifically , because many reviewers have mentioned these flip flips are wider than other styles from Reef . It turned out to be very true - they are wide enough that my little toe rest comfortably on the rubber sole instead of hanging out . The stretchy straps also make them more comfortable to wear . However , I do find out after a short walk to the gym , the straps still hurt my feet and left red marks as some of the rubber straps did to my feet . That was disappointing.The most unforgivable thing about these flip flops is the sizing problem . The sole is indeed the size that I ordered , but because these straps are pushing my feet to the back , both my heels do not rest entirely on the sole , instead , they hang outside of the sole about 1/2 inch . The improper fit also causes pain at my achilles tendons . I would definitely recommend to order at least one size larger . I am not the only one who complains about the incorrect sizing . Later on I found numerous reviews , based on this and other Reef flip flops , point out the same problem - they are really one size too small . Anyway , I am not that impressed with these flip flops , as they are neither comfortable or visually appealing . Wo n't buy them again .	-1
Due to a recent injury , and a very swollen foot , I ordered WW width . I was hoping to have something that I could get on my foot , since this will take a long time to heal . The slippers that came are actually more narrow than a regular width ! The box label says WW but they are FAR far from it . I am NOT impressed . BEWARE !	-1
This shoe seems to run small and I first got a 9.5 and exchanged for a 10.0 but disappointed that I did n't return for a 10.5 because it would have been more comfortable .	-1
The watch is beautiful and I loved it . I wore it sparingly so it would stay nice , using an older watch for everyday use . In spite of that 10 months after I got it it no longer works and the metal that surrounds the date window has fallen off and is loose in the case.I think there are some quality issues at Bulova . Be careful .	-1
I do not recommend . Silver foam and creams work MUCH better than this polishing cloth .	-1
Nice cloths , but not needed . Turns out just regular rags worked just fine . I regretted the purchase ... size is okay though .	-1
I could of polish my jewelry with a wash cloth and get better results then this expensive cloth . I do not recommend this !	-1
Originally , I ordered a size 13 , but it was way too small . Nicely , Amazon replaced them with Size 14 's as it was n't my fault that the slippers are undersized . The new ones fit fine and were quite comfy.After I wore them for about 2 months , I noticed a gap along the seam formed by the top and the sides of one of the slippers . The gap was caused by the leather ripping apart where the lacing goes . The gap continued to spread . Then the second slipper did the same.From the past reviews , it looks like its hit-or-miss whether you get a good pair or not . Definitely a miss for me .	-1
I 'm a C width . Wanted something with some level of support/arch and not too wide.This provided neither . Returned and went back to LLBean .	-1
Way to small , could not get them on with a shoe horn . That being said they are a very good. , quality shoe/slipper . I am returning and will find a larger size .	-1
No fault of the company , bought them for my brother with feet issues and even went a size larger but that did not help him . overall they look and felt like a well made shoe and would have loved them to fit him	-1
I have a wide foot size 9 with a very high instep and flat foot.I did order these one size up on the advice of many reviews on here . Putting them on for the first time , it was a very snug fit due to my high instep and the fact that the strap is rigid without any give to it . Width wise they would have been fine but if they were to fit my instep , the length by ordering one size up would have been too long . If you have a narrower foot with regular or low instep then I would say to order your true size . Being that I have a flat foot , the instep was very uncomfortable and the foot bed feels very rigid ( I prefer a bit more 'cush ' in my flip flops ) . I have now worn them several times a week and while I feel they have stretched or adjusted a bit to my foot , they are still by no means anything I would consider comfortable . For comparison , so far the most comfortable flip flop I have worn is an Adidas Raggmo .	-1
Normally I 've always liked all my reef sandals , but these were just too small and rubbed wrong in places that normal sandals did n't rub me . I sent them back and got a different style and they fit better .	-1
I have owned the same exact model of Reef sandals in previous years and they were great . My last pair of Reefs broke a while back , so I wanted to replace them . I wanted to have the same Reef sandals , since the previous pair was so comfortable . I ordered these and expected the same experience , but was heavily disappointed.The sandals are very comfortable , but I think that Reef have changed their formula for their materials recently , because they squeak as I walk . Within the first 20 minutes of using these sandals , I noticed a horrible squeaking noise . I had my headphones in at the time and was still able to hear the squeaking noise over my music . The squeaking noise continued so I went home and washed them , thinking that it might be a residue from the factory or that it was my feet . I tired many things , but all failed to stop the noise , so I scratched the soles with sandpaper . It stopped for a while , but continued a few days later and still has n't stopped .	-1
I wear size 10 1/2 to size 11 shoe . I have never had a size 11 in any type of shoe be to small . It is to small in this case.I have to eat a $ 6.00 return fee in this case . Otherwise it seemed like a nice enough sandal , it just cut off the circulation in my foot or I would have kept it .	-1
I am a long-time fan of Reef sandals ; however , with very little use ( not even a mile ) the strap on the right side of my right sandal pulled out of bottom . I 'm very disappointed , especially since they are not inexpensive .	-1
I really cant speak to how comfortable or uncomfortable these are because they were way to tight to even have on for any longer than to determine there was no way in hell they would fit ( which was apparent instantly ) . I would suggest getting these in a store where you can try them on first and see how they fit you .	-1
Nice camo pattern and style of shorts.Size was way out of normal range so pay attention to the sizing chart.I had to return mine due to size abnormality . My hips would n't fit in a smaller small waist size .	-1
the size was big , i must buy a smaller size to have a good fitting next time . a like the color and design .	-1
I returned the shorts . They were definitely small to size . I was quite disappointed in them . Can not recommend based on my experience .	-1
These hats are ridiculously cheap though as it turns out not in price ! Nearly transparent , stiff acrylic material , lousy stitching that is coming apart , ridiculous semi structured shape . After I returned the 25 I ordered , I went to WHOLESALEHATS.COM.Great selection . wholesale prices so you buy by the dozen - which was perfect for me as I needed two dozen.I learned what to look for- 100 % cotton , brass clasp adjuster rather than Velcro , unstructured shape.I received , for half the price , ( $ 3.50 per hat ) a very decent product . Not top of the line , but really decent heavy brushed cotton , great unstructured shape , good bill length , and perfect to put the logo on .	-1
I have been ordering these hats for a few 3 years . In the past I have been happy , but this time the product was made super cheap . Not that they were of the highest quality , but I got what I expected before , now it seems like they skimped on fabric . I can see the brim through the fabric on the bill , and the stitches are not even . If all that was not enough , the hat has a permenent crease where it was folded , and is generally flimsy . What a peace of junk , especially since the price has gone up !	-1
I order from Amazon all the time and make it a point to read the customer reviews . I had never been disappointed till now . I had been looking for larger sized sunglasses , like all the female stars seem to have . But nothing in the stores seemed to fit the bill . So when I saw so many positive reviews for this item and they were described as `` seriously over sized '' and `` my grandson says I look like a movie star '' , and `` they look fabulous '' I thought my search was over.These ARE larger than many . But the style is ... well , there is no style . I got the tortoise brown with smoke lenses . The lenses ARE dark as many said and that 's a good thing but the frames are so dark that the print barely shows . Instead of looking like a movie star , these make me look like a very large fly . They are awful . I would send them back but it 's not worth the return postage for a $ 12 item .	-1
Buyer , beware , these are not oversized sunglasses . They are quite regular size , any smaller sunglasses would be called tiny or undersized . I am very disappointed with this purchase .	-1
These glasses are not oversized and would not buy them again . They are the color they say although the size is not what one wou ; d consider near oversize .	-1
Received the sunglasses two days before the estimated scheduling date . Looking at the picture , the lenses are a smoky black , but the sunglasses that I received are a rose color so I sent them back .	-1
Flimsy Garbage . Thinner materials and build than the photo would let on . Chinese-made . I got this because it looked like a nice overnight bag . It resides in my car trunk holding jumper cables and crap now . Not happy with it .	-1
... but you get what you pay for , no ? This item came quickly enough , faster than expected to be honest , but I was disappointed when I opened the package as the quality of the locket seemed cheap and a little on the flimsy side . I was looking for a locket with a little more substance to it , a little more weight . This locket definitely is NOT heirloom quality ; it would never last long enough to be passed down to anyone.I have been wanting a locket for some time and spent much time pouring over reviews , comparing items and prices and trying to reach a conclusion as to which to buy . I finally settled on this one because of the price ... if it was n't quite what I was looking for ( size-wise and quality ) , then for the price no harm , no foul . I got what I paid for.The locket is on the small side , thin and difficult to open and I 'm afraid that too many repeated openings will break it because the metal seems so thin . The etched design on the front is slightly rough to the touch as well , though not enough to be annoying while worn . I only received it this afternoon and have been wearing it ever since , trying to make up my mind whether to keep it or return it . While the locket is large enough to put pictures in , the pictures would end up being so small it really would n't be worth the fight to get them set.The only good point of this is the chain , it seems sturdy and I like the fact that it 's a rolo chain . However , at 18 '' , it sits way to high on me ( the heart sits just below the base of my throat ) . I should have purchased a longer chain.Like I said , for the price , it 's okay , but it definitely is n't what I was looking for .	-1
I asked for this as a Christmas gift and will already be replacing it , because the clasp on the coin purse does not stay closed . I just have to look at it the wrong way and it pops open , spilling coins into my purse . The slots for credit cards open to the left , so if you are right handed you have to turn the wallet upside down to slide them out ... another huge problem . It is cute , nice leather , but totally useless !	-1
I am beyond disappointed by this wallet . I specifically looked for one that held a checkbook . This one has a checkbook holder , but it does n't fit in the wallet once you actually put the checkbook in . Also , there is no plastic film , how in gods name should I write my checks ? Once the checkbook is added , you ca n't close the wallet.In addition , the credit card slots - are n't even and not all hold the credit cards . REALLY ? ! What a waste of money , I 'm sorry I ever bought it	-1
Buy this wallet but when I received it was not what I expected totally different from what you see in the pictures of the publication , is of very poor quality I get broken in several pieces removed and a line as if it was cut into the top purse besides this came with a smelly material seems old walletThe good news was that I did receive a complaint about this purse in these conditions it was not what I expected and the Amazon store I solved the problem thanks to Amazon	-1
I have small shoulders and these straps were only halfway adjustable so I could not make the straps small enough to stay on . I returned it .	-1
no part of this bra worked my wife said it was too small , scratch , poky and just a bad bra ... It would be nice if all the manufacturers could get together and have standard sizes ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
A total waste of money , does not look appealing and does not cover much . Regret buying it , but it was not misrepresented .	-1
I like the dress itself . I have got a plus size , and was highly disappointed . The open front tries to run back to my butt making a huge very ugly whole in the front . Yes , I have a big butt , but it 's not AS big - size 16 . And advertised PLUS size will , perhaps , only look good on 8-10 butt size . But PLUS means up to 1-3X ! It will perhaps stretch on to a girl of 3x on the top , but the open front will look ugly . I am returning the item , cause for 17 dollars it 's too bad-looking on big girls . Do not purchase plus size if you are more than size 12 , it will not look good on you . Especially if you are also tall .	-1
The watch looks great . It could take a pounding and keep going . Price is Okay and it got here in good time . It has 5 alarms , hourly chime , and other sounds if only you could hear it . I 'm not kidding that Casio has messed up on just about every new watch that is coming out . You have to have the thing next to your ear to even hear it . I have an old watch which sits on the table about 20 feet from me . I lost the instructions , so now every day at 3:20 pm the damn thing goes off . Loud and clear for about 2 1/2 minutes unless I get my lazy butt up and push a button . Anyway , if you do n't need the alarm , then go for it . The buttons that are hard to push was not a big deal for me .	-1
I purchased this watch after wanting a G-Shock . Well , it just so happened that time changed back an hour right after I purchased the watch . No problem , right ? I try to change the time ... and the upper left button no longer works . So as long as I wear the watch during the summer , I 'll have the right time . The rubber strap is not very comfortable either . It should be more flexible.Very frustrated . I 'm still just sitting on the watch because I 'm too aggravated to take the time to actually send the stupid thing in . I wo n't be purchasing another G-Shock for a while . I 'll stick with Suunto .	-1
I received this watch from my girlfriend for my birthday and was very impressed with it straight out of the box ( before trying it on , more on that later ) . It was in my top three G-Shocks that I was considering so I was thrilled that I got it.It is VERY sturdy and well constructed . The digits are easy to read and the back light is very bright and it allows you to read all functions in low light conditions . It has some very useful features and multiple alarms with a snooze features.When I put it on this is where things came apart , and I have the same complaints as many others on here . The textured `` nubs '' on the back of the watch are AWFUL . I have thick skin and it is in no way sensitive , but those textured nubs will rub your skin raw . What an awful idea ! If they were smooth , they would still be bad but the fact that they are textured will grate your skin . Also , the buttons have far too much resistance . If you need to navigate through some of the functions , it will leave indentations on your finger because you have to press the buttons so hard . Not practical.To summarize , the watch was returned within 24 hours for those two cons . They were so bad that it completely ruined the watch for me.Pros : - Attractive- Relatively lightweight- Sturdy- Legible displayCons : - Horribly uncomfortable- Buttons are too difficult to press	-1
Very cheaply made with a thin covering of leather over padding to add substance . A disappointing product . Older versions of the same shoe were made much better .	-1
They look like something made by a 7 year old Taiwanese kid ... who just stared making boots . The material looks cheap and feels cheap ( the black is not as glossy as in the pictures of them online ) . I sent mine back and paid a few dollars more for a super sweet Burberry boot . I can not tell you how cheap they look and feel to the touch !	-1
These glasses are huge & nearly blackout glasses . If you have a large head and do n't need to see where you are going this product is for you .	-1
I received these and was excited until I put them on . The bridge connecting the lenses was not bent , and as a result the glasses were very lopsided when put on . I looked ridiculous ! I was really upset because this happened to another pair of mirrored aviators I got from Amazon . They are cheap glasses , so I am not too surprised about this , but I am upset it happened with two different pairs from two different sellers : (	-1
First I rated this item one star because the glasses I received were damaged . No , not damaged en route . These looked like they were damaged before and probably during the packaging . There were scratches all over the lenses , nicks in the frame , and the frame itself was bent like a pretzel but , that was easily fixed . Now for the lying . I received a message after rating this product one star that if I changed it to five stars , I would receive a new pair free of charge . So I did and almost half a year later , nothing .	-1
I found these shoes to be a tad to small for their sizing an they are hard an uncomfortabl , should have sent them back but after what I paid in shipping an what I 'd have to pay to send them back I would be out alot of money with nothing to show for it :0 (	-1
Reviewer By Jen , William 's Wife : Okay , I did n't have the highest expectations for these shoes . I would never workout in anything besides the best athletic shoes no matter how tall or cute these might make me look . I simply wanted a tennis shoe with some height that I could wear walking about the mall or the supermarket that would n't look ridiculous and would be comfortable . These disappointed me immensely . They are only about an inch higher than normal athletic shoes , and while they are cute and look very nice , are made of a very stiff material that does not bend with the natural toe action . The problem is not in the sole padding but in the upper toe area , and this can not be alleviated by adding foot pads . I used these to simply walk about Circuit City for a few hours and my feet were purple afterwards . I hate to leave the house in anything lower than four inch heels , and most of them are much more comfortable than these shoes . I plan to give mine to Goodwill ; they are that painful .	-1
This set is pretty flimsy . The garter especially has weak elastics and an & # 34 ; S & # 34 ; style clasp . The result is a belt that constantly slides down due to the tug of stockings . The clasp seems to because easily unhooked . Moreover , after just a few washings the material started pilling . I purchased it mostly as this was the only option ordered in this color and it was inexpensive .	-1
for what the size was it was much too small . did not fit at all and is extremely cheap material .	-1
These are not sized right . A 3x is always big on me and these r cut wrong ! I 'm returning them . I think they are darling but they are just cut wrong . I got them in a timely fashion . There was NO problem with the seller . Just an issue with sizing .	-1
This watch looked good in the pictures , the dial is slim , and it is perfectly adequate , but the strap is short and looked cheap upon arrival . Not a bad watch , but not great . I ended up returning mine . I would recommend viewing this model in person before buying to make sure you like it . Thank god Amazon makes returns easy .	-1
This might be ok for junk collectors , but if you are a diver or if you want this watch for everyday use , forget about this , this is Chinese junk with a Swiss name and believe me not even for 100 dollars or even 20 dollars this piece of junk is worth the money .	-1
Ok , so a foot fetishist designed this , yes ? I just could not get them to stay on my feet , but I should have known that before I bought them . I believe they are in the trash now , but I should point out , I have big ole feet , and if yours are not , perhaps these will be just the ticket .	-1
Even with the belt thing the thigh highs were like knee highs . I was constantly pulling them up , which of course gave then a big fat run from top on to toes . Probably be fine for a night in but not a night out .	-1
My girlfriend wore them once , although they were flattering they stretched out and became loose around the lace top . She threw them away . As they were cheep i 'm not disappointed but my girlfriend was	-1
I ordered these coveralls in black , 52X34 . When I received them , they were 52X30 . I thought I had made a mistake and had to eat the $ 17 return postage . I reordered the same item . I made sure of the size . When I checked the order it was listed as 52X30 again . I tried to cancel , but I was too late . I notified the seller with email . The seller called me back pretty quickly and told me that there was nothing they could do about it because it was Amazon 's fault for not removing the 34 inch length option . I asked him how that helps me and why would I do business with them again . He said , and I quote , `` Well , what am I supposed to do about it ? '' . Now , in order to get my refund I again have to eat $ 17 shipping . The guy that called did n't understand why that was a problem . NEVER AGAIN ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The quality of the shirt is rather good but the sizing is way off . I read this comment from other reviews but decided to take a chance as there were sufficient positive reviews to substantiate making the purchase . This is something which I believe the seller can easily correct . It was a bit frustrating to have to go through the process of doing the return and having to go out and look for another shirt at the mall .	-1
I purchased these after researching closed toe hiking sandals for one that would provide the strong arch support that I need ( for pronation issues with one foot . ) Although I loved the look and design of the shoe , it simply did not have much arch support . So I returned the shoe and , instead , ordered a pair of open-toed Orthaheel hiking sandals - which did provide the excellent arch support that Orthaheel does so well .	-1
The waistline ( size 14 ) berely fits - it 's too tight and very uncomfortable . Do n't know what kind of elastic they used but it is not stretchy at all . But below the waist because of the pleats those pants really balloon out so the front looks rather ugly.It is a total enigma why they called them Relaxed Fit - if I buy size 16 to feel comfortable at waistline - below the waist I 'll look like a circus clown . And I have n't even washed them yet.Possible to wear with smth long over them to cover the ugly puffed front , but otherwise not.So no , definitely not buying this model again .	-1
I am keeping these reluctantly as the legs and thighs fit OK but wo n't buy any plus size pants online again given this new `` make these ladies have an hour glass figure with a thick tight elastic waist '' trend . The pants hurt around the waist if I button them up also given I have GI issues like surgical adhesions pressing on my organs . I do n't need a girdle tight elastic waist pressing on them as well . I have another pair of Lees relaxed fit jeans from a year ago I will wear when I need to button up my pants in company . These are just for shopping with a coat over them or the like.But then I got creative and made two slight nicks in the waist band where the elastic is and Removed part of it . Ah no pain , I 've more to do all without ruining the waistband -- just a little nick that will help me cut and remove the elastic is what I needed to do . But never again will I buy plus size pants online again -- I found the same girdle pain waistband on a pair of capris .	-1
I checked size 18 , which was the only size left , and got a 24 . I can not wear these but the hassle of returning them is n't worth it . Please correct the sizing info on this item .	-1
They did n't turn me off , either , and I was kind of wrong.Do n't misunderstand : this bra is great . It 's an awesome T-shirt bra , it 's comfortable , it 's well made , and if you do n't mind the coning , definitely go for it.However , if you 're thinking it 'll give you the same kind of coning retro lingerie will give you , you 'll be disappointed . The retro coning has an almost pyramid shape to it ; your breasts come to a point . A dull one , sure , but there 's an implied sharpness underneath it . This coning is somewhere *between* that coning and no coning at all . Too pointed to be modern , too dull to be vintage . If you 're over a D cup ( as I am ) , it 's just gon na look a little weird in a T-shirt . But if you 've got anything up to and including a D cup , you probably would n't notice it .	-1
Based on how this bra looks in the picture , I thought it would be great for shallow breasts . It 's not at all . The cups were really really deep , and just huge in general .	-1
The bra itself is a lovely material , appears well made , etc . However , once it 's on , it 's stiff and uncomfortable and creates an awkward pointy profile typically seen in the 60 's . I returned it and got a swift refund .	-1
It is a weird fitting bra . I am 50 years old and have ALWAYS worn a D cup since I was 15 years old..and these cups are a tad big ... and pointy ... very pointy..push the point and they collapse in . I have many & # 34 ; shelf & # 34 ; or & # 34 ; balcony & # 34 ; bras..none fit like this.I waited 10 days for this bra from the day I ordered it , and it was supposed to be PRIME ? Awaiting the paperwork to return this .	-1
I just double checked the style number now to make sure I had the right bra because I ca n't believe all of the positive reviews . I am a 34DDD in nearly every size but apparently I am not in this one . I had muffin tops where my boobs were overflowing the cups and the straps were thin and very elasticy . I ca n't imagine feeling support even if I bought a cup size up . If felt like most Victoria Secret bra 's for me where I have to re-adjust the straps three times a day because the metal thing keeps sliding down . I am glad it is doing it 's job for so many other women out there but sadly it did not work for me .	-1
I bought these crocs for my granddaughter and was very dissapointed that they were too big for her . The sizing is odd so I had to return them	-1
I received a pair made in Mexico . One shoe had weird shape ( pinky toe area was wider than the sole ) . It looked like my kid can slide her foot from side to side and can easily trip over . Returned and ordered another pair ( Red ) . This pair was made in China and looks fine .	-1
The strap came off the first day of wearing . I know they come off sometimes but I 've not had them come off while still new . It comes off all the time now . I 'm keeping them and will try glueing the strap on , but am not pleased with the quality at all . I could have done better going to Walmart and paying less .	-1
sending it back . Getting a refund which is a plus . A little small for me . I kept losing things out of it such as money .	-1
I received these Timberland boots as a replacement for another style that I returned to the company which were found to be defective . I should have returned these as well but it costs too much to keep sending boots back . These boots have no padding nor arch support at all ! The soles wore out super fast . I 'm not sure they lasted 2 months . Of all of the Timberland Boots that I have owned these are the lousiest .	-1
These shoes cost about $ 90 and Timberland can not even cough up the $ 2 to waterproof them . To add insult to injury , the footbeds are as thin as a piece of paper.One could buy Rockport , Nunn Bush , Florsheim , Deer Stags , etc . all for a lower price and all of them would be more comfortable and waterproofed !	-1
A 10 M should fit me , but it was so long my heels came up in the back..trying to decide whether or not to reorder it in a smaller/wider size and how far down to go..maybe I 'll go to a shoe store and find the right size when the snow stops !	-1
I ordered a 14B or narrow shoe . When I received them they felt too big . I looked at the shoe box and it said they were 14B and I looked at the label on the shoes and it said 14B . I can tell you after wearing 14B for most of my life these shoes are not 14B but 14D . I really like the shoes and was not happy sending them back .	-1
Nicely constructed , however very low-cut . When walking , each step causes them to flex in a way the makes them feel loose and uncomfortable . Prefer a moccasin that snugly wraps around my foot with laces or a boat shoe . Amazon paid for the return , thanks .	-1
I must say I am not very happy with these boots at all . I am surprised considering all the good reviews . The boots are way too big in the heel and very wide around my ankle . When I walk in these the extra material in front pushes inward and pokes my ankle . I could only wear for moments ... these will be returned A.S.A.P .	-1
I have a wide foot and these were tight ; I returned them .	-1
These were very poorly packaged and were a little damaged when I got them . They look really cheap in person . Mine were missing the zipper pull on one side , and the insoles were too large for the boots so that they buckled up . I returned them immediately . The return process was somewhat convoluted , but I did get my money back about a week later .	-1
I loved this watch . I bought it because I wanted an automatic , durable watch that I could wear forever . It looked great . Unfortunately , it just stopped working after several months . That happened to a Seiko diver 's watch I bought several years ago , too.As two Seiko automatic watches have failed on me , I wo n't ever go back to that brand again . My Citizen quartz watches , with solar energy collection , are great & # 34 ; automatic & # 34 ; alternatives that are much more reliable .	-1
I recently got my first pair of Birkenstocks with the soft footbed . Previously , I only had the original footbed and broke the original in quickly , with no pain at all . I have plantar fasciitis and was excited to try the softbed out and break them in . I had actually gotten sized in a store to ensure the right fit and the softbed was highly encouraged by the salespeople.I know many people love the softbed and I do n't know what the problem is for me . I have been wearing them for a few weeks now and they are painful ( right where the plantars is ) . They are the right size . I obviously ca n't return them but I will be ordering another pair with the original footbed . The price was right for these however.By the way , I know many people dislike Betula by Birkenstock since they do n't use real leather and are supposedly lower end , but I never had a problem with them . They lasted 8 years with no re-soling . I bought them by accident since I wanted a second pair of Bostons and I thought they were the same . No pain at all with my plantars and quick break in period . In fact , they were exactly like the regular footbed Boston Birkenstock and I could n't tell the difference when wearing them or my Bostons.I will update my review in a few months to see if they will break in more and give me the comfort I have come to expect from Birkenstock .	-1
Much too large and too wide . Returned last week . Will order again after I try them on in a store and find the right size .	-1
As with all Carhartt products this is very well made . The problem is it is stiff as a board in back . You sit down and there 's no flex . It just rides right up your neck . I tried washing mine to soften it and that did n't work . It 's fine if your on your feet but when you sit down it rides right up the back of your head .	-1
I just bought this vest in black from a local store today . Took the tags off and threw it in the wash , as I do with most new garments ( and especially Carhartt stuff , which always needs breaking-in ) .When I took it out of the dryer , the inner lining had already started to disintegrate in one spot , with the insulating material showing through.I do n't know if I got a faulty product or what , but I expect my workwear to hold up to a lot worse than a single wash . It 's going back to the store tomorrow . This is my first disappointment from Carhartt . [ Edit ] I exchanged the black one for the Carhartt brown one . The brown one has been great , no problems with wear and tear . Hopefully the problem I had with the black one was just an isolated issue .	-1
I ordered a s , btut it is tight and feels like an extra small and it cuts off your throat .	-1
This the second package of these socks I received . Please note the size . First order I called and told Amazon I got the wrong size . The second order came and they are also the wrong size . I did not call the second time because it is not worth the hassle . I figured out that I would keep getting the wrong ones . What they are sending is shoe size 6-12 which is a sock size 10-13 . I was ordering these for myself , but they ended up going in my husband 's sock drawer . At the same time I ordered him a package of white ones in the larger size . They were the correct size . What I think happened is the packages are mismarked , listing shoe instead of sock size . That would be fine if you could tell before you order . Still love the socks , they are so soft and cushiony , just wish I could get in my size .	-1
When Champion used to make socks for Costco ( `` Elite '' ) they were the best , most comfortable socks I had ever owned . They made my feet so comfortable I 'm sure I could have worn my boots to bed . But Costco switched to a sock made by somebody else , and Champion dropped the `` Elite '' line . The ones I just bought ( just like another reviewer said ) are thin . Too thin . They might be O.K . for a tennis shoe , but never for a work boot . I did get excellent customer service from Champion , and they even sent me a check for 10 bucks as a sort of refund . By the way , the Kirkland sock from Costco is terrible , but that 's another story .	-1
Let me be clear ; i 'm a 2m guy , having no problems to wear american XL sizes . Own a Champion 1780 XL Sweat Ash and 3 other colors XL 's too , i like and use Ash so much that i ordered one more , at under moments . To order only one more was the only luck at this purchase . Got a clear oversized like-item as i compared the size and the ( at this item ) very weak unelastic head opening . This is like a sloppy copy , additional the weak fit on the shoulders is not usable or look acceptable and cuffs are to turn out . To control if the manufacturer had made a hidden upsizing i ordered from another seller deal rack a same style L size sweat and did'nt got my accustomated XL cause i got an accurate L size which i ca n't wear like this oversized too . For living in Germany return is impossible i avoid the first mentioned seller furthermore .	-1
I not agree that this product is for big and tall guys . How often you see tall guys with these measurements ? Never.This is not for tall , excuse my language , but for people who have to start thinking about some exercises .	-1
I received the boots and tried them on . They were comfortable in the feet , but unfortunately I have very muscular calves , and was not able to zip it up all the way .	-1
I bought this because I am rough on my watches . This is cheap and I figured if I got a year out of it it was worth the price I paid . The band is very cheap everything scratches . Pay a little more and get a Casio Pathfinder fish or hunting model they take all you can throw at them . ( Usually about $ 30 . on Amazon )	-1
Not as good as I thought it would be , it was expensive but had none of the options that I thought were advertized .	-1
I bought this based on reviews that it is very OPERATOR and has good battery life . I got it and it feels like a ladies watch . Its just too thin and light compared to the G Shocks I prefer . If you want to be a Tier 1 Operator look for a more substantial watch .	-1
The band is very short . It is probably ok for kids or women , but a guy will have difficulty even putting the watch on . I say this as a guy with fairly thin wrists too . I was also dismayed to find that it does not display the month , only the day . Typically not an issue , but still , cheesy .	-1
This watch did not last long at all . The watch band ripped off within a week , then the whole thing began to glitch out . Was in the trash can , sadly enough after 2 weeks of attempting to get it fixed , nearly paying WAY more than what I paid for it to begin with !	-1
It is impossible to pull the band back to get the peg out and take the watch off . I think the band will be gone in a few months because of how hard I have to pull to get it off . Also , the & # 34 ; night light & # 34 ; is terrible and does n't illuminate well at all . And the main ink display is n't dark enough . Sometimes I have to squint in broad daylight to see the timeTwo stars for being nonetheless inexpensive and disposable .	-1
I have had this watch for about 3 months as a replacement for another brand that finally malfunctioned after many years of frequent wear.This watch simply does n't keep the right day and date . It reverts to Jan. 1 and Friday . I have been wearing watches for decades and this is the worst watch I 've ever had.The watch 's crystal somehow got dry paint on it within a week , and I did n't treat it harshly.The paint eventually came off.I 've had the problem that some reviewers mentioned of previous watches breaking where the metal pin connects to the main ( round ) part of the watch , but I do n't remember what brand they were , maybe this one.Next time I buy a watch I 'll ensure the crystal ( clear window ) of the watch is recessed below the rest of the watch so if I put it face down somewhere the crystal wo n't get scratched . Otherwise the watch is fine but the scratches are disappointing .	-1
I got this watch almost exactly a year ago . The metal parts are sturdy and dependable , but the plastic joints were what let me down . After a while one of the hinges snapped off and rendered the watch useless as there are no replacement bands for that . Also , I am still unsure how to get the analog interface to line up with the actual digital time . I read the directions several times . Perhaps the error occurred when I set the watch to NYC time , however they still get no points for ease of use.As for the people complaining that the watch is too big , you 're either going to have to get a remover tool or take it to a jeweler and pay the $ 10 or so for the service . I 'd honestly recommend something with all metal parts . I work my tools pretty hard , but I almost never blow out a watch in a year . My Timex Iron Mans always lasted 2-3 years before their bands blew out .	-1
Now aI am doing this reviwing and I never have this wacth in my habd NEVER ARRIBED i do n't remembre is too late to reclaimed . I am telling I never had this watch in my hands I forgot to fill a reclamation and this was 2 years ago , I now maybe to late to this is only a commentary to the seller .	-1
Have had many good Casio watches . Even the $ 20 watches are great . However , when I received this watch the digital display is too faint . In order to read it it clearly , I have to turn the watch to the side . Perhaps it languished in a warehouse too long and battery is dying . Will send it back and try to get refund . Had the display been better I would have kept this watch and probably given it a good review . Update 9.18.11 : I sent watch back to seller who credited my credit card with purchase amount and shipping . I have since bought another G-Shock on Amazon and am awaiting its arrival .	-1
It looks really nice in the photos , but in real life it is rather cheap . The plastic where the band connects seems like it will break . The worst part is the stiffness of the velcro band . It does n't lie flat around your arm . It is convoluted instead of a real circle .	-1
this is a nice watch But be prepared to go by a good jeweler to work magic ! this watch was like a swing on my hand and I still have not been able to get the band adjusted because one jeweler said that the links are like welded on so its cant be adjusted , I just put in a box , what a waste ! do n't buy this unless u have real fat or big wrist	-1
I was so dissappointed to see how cheap this watch looks after it arrived . I have worn it only once and will probably give it away . If you do not adjust the band to fit the watch will spin around your wrist as the watch itself is top heavy . The watch stem looked tarnished when it arrived and the band is very dull . I have seen $ 10 watches at Wal Mart that are better looking .	-1
Quite a disappointment , although I will say some of the problems may be my own fault . I did n't read the description carefully enough , and did n't choose well . Eventually I found paying to have my old watch repaired was more worthwhile .	-1
This was a watch I dearly wanted to like . It looked like it had it all . A FULL analog display , with the digital display BELOW it , instead of hidden underneath the analog hands for 4 hours every day . Design was nice , simple , neutral colors , and the watch itself is not too large to fit on smaller wrists.Perfection ? well ... not quite ! I do n't know how Casio 's engineers did it , but it is almost as if they purposefully designed the plastic cover of the digital display to catch nearly all angles of light . Then they recessed the display DEEPLY back into the watch face , so if your angle gets too sharp , you ca n't read it ... . But you also ca n't read it head-on due to glare ! You end up having to play hide-and-go-seek anytime you want to read the digital display , carefully angling your wrist until you find the sweet spot . You end up doing that instead of the simple action of just looking at your wrist , noting the time , and moving on with your day . I returned it after less than two days .	-1
In my opinion , it is hard to operate . Analog hands must be set independently from time on watch . You can not run the hands backwards , so you potentially have to hold the button down for several minutes to get to where you need to be.Much bulkier than it appears .	-1
Just arrived , here are some quick thoughts . Most of this is off top of my head as I set it up . Might be a bit random . More later when I get to know this thing . The watch 's face is far too shiny , ca n't see anything if there is overhead fluorescent lighting . Amazing . I 've used several generations of these Casios and know the UI pretty well . It is improving but still a pain in the ass to setup . The hand setting is still pathetic , takes forever to go ahead on the analog side by 11 hours and god forbid if you miss . Oh did I mention there are no analog numbers on the face ( 1,2,3 ... ) . Unbelievable . We have 5 , 10 , 15 , why ? Is this because people ca n't read the time any more and they need the numbers ? The big display is the digital time , I somehow thought it would be the date which is why I bought this cause the other casios hide the date in small unreadable displays . Looks like the watch design is so tied to the band that replacing the band is going to be impossible.Initial rating is 3 stars , I 'm using it reluctantly while thoroughly disappointed.Update on 2013-05-25I return here while shopping for a new watch . I have used this for over 1.5 years . I finally have given up . It is hard to read , the face is unreadable as it reflects light in any indoor setting . The lighting is OK at night , worthless in the . The feature to turn on the light when you move your wrist works occasionally . Worthless . The face scratches far easier than any watch I have ever used . The date is obscured by the minute had every hour when I look for the date when taking notes . The functionaly for timing all over the world is a mess and gets in the way of doing anything else with the digital portion of this watch.I give up , I 'm moving on . Downgrading to 2 stars . Ca n't believe I used this for so long .	-1
The Casio Men 's World Time Watch ( Model AW80-7AV ) has a couple of compelling good points : first , it is very cheap and does have numerous features ( though many of them are of questionable value ) ; second , it seems to be reasonably accurate . If this is all you care about , this could be a good watch for you.The watch has several cons to be wary of , however . It is very light ( which is actually a plus ) but the band is extremely thin and flimsy . In other words , it is cheap and looks it . More annoying though is the very dim light for use in low light : it is completely inadequate and makes the functionality in the inset digital portion of the face next to worthless ; the lack of contrast between the hands and watch face also contribute to the legibility issue . Most irritatingly , though , is that it does n't have a set knob , even for the analog hands . I fly for a living and frequently cross back and forth between time zones . I had read that the watch could only be set in a forward direction , which was annoying but not a deal breaker . What is not evident is the lack of a setting knob , which means that each time you need to change the time ( or do anything else , for that matter ) you have to use an array of complex inputs with the four buttons which is not only very time consuming ( the watch advances in 20 second increments ) , but also requires consultation with the ridiculously complex and thick instruction manual.While this watch may be suitable for people who do n't cross time zones frequently , use it in daylight , and do n't mind referring to the manual frequently ( or memorizing a huge quantity of mundane , unintuitive minutiae ) , for anyone else , and especially for frequent travelers , I recommend finding another watch .	-1
Chinese nockoffI smelled Chineese dung but I bought it anywaywe send our dollars to the billion that hate usbut we employ them in nuclear facilities and they spy on us ! ! ! ! I smell Chineese junk ... not the boat that floats butthe other stuff that we flush down the toilet.I know that stuff floats too ... junD-k is junkbut some stuff smells like AWDAV ( not Japanese )	-1
Bought this watch for my husband , one year and two weeks ago . The 10 year battery died 10 days ago . No special use . No underwater use , just normal wear and tear . I bought this watch thinking it would not need a battery change as often..and replaced his old watch that got about 2 years per battery..and this one got one year and four days . Would n't recommend it because that is a very misleading statement about this watch !	-1
I have been having bad luck with certain Casio watches . This one broke after only a few months of use . It broke right in the area where the watch band pins are inserted so now it is a pocket watch . I have 3 other Casio watches that broke in this same area . It was also hard to get the analog time in sync with the digital time . It might be a good casual watch for people if they are careful with it and the green color is pretty cool .	-1
This watch does n't look nearly as good on my wrist as it did in the photo on the Amazon page . I should have known not to expect much from a $ 20 watch .	-1
It loses 5 minutes a month -- -unheard of for a `` digital '' watch ! ! ! Tons of `` special '' features -- -but all are displayed too small for ANYONE to see ! The manual is about 200 tiny pages -- -with even smaller print . You have to study it for at least an hour , just to set the time ! GARBAGE do n't buy !	-1
This watch looks really slick and I liked it a lot . However , there are problems . The surface scratches very very easily . I once had a minor incident whereby another persons jade just lightly touched my watch , so trivial I did n't think anything would scratch . When I had a look , I had a scratch on the watch.Another problem is with the resin strap . It cracked after a year usage and it broke within less than 2yr usage . Now I ca n't wear it . Not worth buying the strap ( ca n't use non propriety ones ) .	-1
The watch 's band is so stiff that it keeps sliding around to the side of my wrist and I have to struggle to get the watch face back so I can read it . If I tighten the band so it wo n't twist it is too uncomfortable . The watch itself is attractive but I was unable to set the small hands because I could n't feel the double click on the winder stem as described in the instructions . All in all I just gave up and after a few days went back to my trusty Timex .	-1
i like many of you dont like a watch thats all plastic . and amazon needs to come up with better filtered search results . i searched through almost five thousand watches to find one that had an all metal stainless steel case . this one looked nice and what attracted me to it was the fancy extra dials . i wanted a watch that looked like it was expensive . a watch for dress occasions . the watch does not have a light to see it in the dark . which i believe it should have , the smaller dials are extremely hard to read , you almost need a magnifying glass to read them.5 stars for the fact that its all metal . 2 stars for the fact that it badly needs a light and the smaller dials are hard to see.overall , its a good analogue watch to have . and its metal , not resin plastic that the majority of watches are made of .	-1
I bought this watch and worked through the instructions on how to set all the wonderful features . It was a bit complex but doable.Then I tried to put it on and of course it was too big . The clasp was a bit weird but I figured that out . Then I tried to shorten the band by sliding the clasp up an inch or so . There were no instructions for how to do it . I even emailed Casio and asked but then I tried to do it myself . After an hour of fussing : my eyes hurt , my finger was bleeding and the watch band clasp had disintergrated into two separate pieces that slid ever so easily on the band - there was no hope.I suspect I would have liked the watch , it 's pretty and extremely useful , but if I ca n't wear it , it has no function . I 'll be returning it if Casio does not answer my email by tomorrow night with instructions I can follow.I am very sad indeed .	-1
I was ready for something a little different from my trusty Timex whose battery had died so I decided on this watch . I do like the look but functionality was lacking.It fit me OK but as others have said , it 's only for smaller wrists . My wrist measures 6 inches.As others have also said , the end of the band does not want to stay in the keeper and when it escapes , it pokes straight out.The ultimate reason why I sent it back : on the very first day of wearing it , I found it on the floor without even noticing it was off my wrist . Luckily this happened at home but I sure would not keep a watch that can just jump off your wrist.I suppose that the end of the band got loose and then was able to work all the way loose . I was just at home doing regular stuff like opening the mail , checking email , etc . The watch is very light and comfortable so its absence from my wrist was not felt . I was very surprised to start to walk into another room and find my new watch laying on the carpet .	-1
It 's really small and the material is thin , overall , it 's flimsy . It also seems like a watch for a child .	-1
The strap is so tiny..jeez..i dont even know why i expected it to be reasonably ok ... i had to give out out to smeone immediately i saw it..i hate it	-1
I know that picture shows the image how 'big ' it is but it is way too small . I 'm mid 20th and really not considered fat but this watch is soo small barely fit my wrist . First when I opened I thought that I made a mistake and I bought little girl 's watch but when I doubled check and it said women I was really disappointing ! Cute watch for children and teenagers maybe	-1
I thought this was a cheap but fine little every day watch - but the plastic is so smooth it slides when it slides against the opposing side of the band.. In short - it slid out of the & # 34 ; clasped & # 34 ; position and dropped quietly off my wrist while i was out in the world . Hope whoever picks it up has better luck than I did .	-1
Very tiny , I returned it . Although it appears a tad larger in the picture , it was not . Maybe for a teenager .	-1
I personally love this watch , it is so light , simple and cheap.The battery only lasts about 18 months which is why I give it only 2 stars ... ... if it lasted longer I would give 5.Keeps good time . I have owned 3 of these so in the end I really like it , just do n't like always having to buy a new one.super light , super thin , super easy to readdisposable	-1
I purchased this watch to replace another that i had for several years but it stopped working . This watch looks nice but it is made cheap ( that 's why we pay about 18 dollars in Amazon ) . Well it was fine but quickly got scratches on the glass and the worse thing was moisture on the glass . I sent it to Casio and they returned very quickly but i have n't had the chance to test it . If this happens again probably i will throw away and purchase a Timex.I updated my review to one since zero star is not allowed . I went to the pool and the watch got moisture in the glass again . So I do not know what they repaired because it is worse than before .	-1
I purchased this product based on the image shown ... I found the quality is compromised and for the same price , a better watch can be purchased ... .	-1
Not a mens watch unless you have little girl arms . Dial is very hard to see . Did not work for me .	-1
this shoes has a decent appearance ( a little cheap looking , but it 's a cheap shoe ) but is so clunky that I felt like I 'd be causing my toddler to trip all day long . He actually started limping when I put them on , despite them fitting . We returned the shoe .	-1
Very cheapy looking . One of my worse choices . Definitely returning these . The picture did them way more justice then in person .	-1
Purchased after reading the reviews and viewing the pics of the gold boots . Thought they would be the thigh highs I was looking for , just for casual wear . They were very large on my leg , and loose from bottom to top . Just did n't look right . They were also stiff and difficult to sit down while wearing . I tried them on several times with different looks but could n't find a reason to like them . So , back they went . The shoe part also looked very wide with a pointed toe that was huge . Not a good looking boot , and I would n't even wear them for costume since they just did n't look right . Glad that others found them acceptable and that 's all that matters . The silver ones appear to look great , but I now know how they look . Too bad ... .	-1
The bra is scratchy and actually fits a little weird . It does n't fit like the Wocoal or Natori 32DDD bras I purchased at Nordstrom . Seems to be inferior quality .	-1
I wore this bra and then cleaned it per the instructions . The bra warped almost beyond recognition . Not worth the money , in my opinion .	-1
Uncomfortable -- band very small . When closed on last hooks metal against skin . Jeeze , another 1/8 '' of fabric too costly ? Cup size fine . Straps so narrow/skimpy they dug in . That 's a first . Pretty on the outside -- itchy on the inside . Must return .	-1
These socks did fit well , but after washing they did n't stay smooth and attracted every piece of lint , etc . I expected better for the price !	-1
After reading all the great reviews on Amazon I was so excited to get these shoes . I have Amazon Prime and paid the extra $ 3.99 to have these shoes shipped quickly.I received the shoes and found them very painful . They look like men 's flip flops , very clunky looking . I decided to work through the pain and ugliness and give the shoes at least a two day trial . I failed . When I woke up the next morning I put these shoes on and they were even more painful than the day before.I have a daughter that wears the same shoe size as I do , so I decided that I 'd give the shoes to her . She tried the shoes on and could n't stand wearing them for even a minute . She said the shoes were trying to roll her feet out which is exactly how the sandals made my feet feel x10.My daughter and I both wear Oasics running shoes everyday , and we both have fairly flat feet . I had high hopes for Montrail Women 's Molokini Sandals , but these shoes are too painful to wear . I live in a very rural area and have purchased from Amazon bi-weekly for over 10 years . I 've only returned one item to amazon in that time span , but I will be returning these shoes .	-1
These shoes were not that comfortable . They have no arch support . I did not think they were made very well . I returned them . Don ' think I will buy shoes online again	-1
My `` tween '' daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes.They are comfortable and stylish.This is her 3rd pair.I 'm glad that I found them online.They are both old-school and stylish/	-1
I bought this pack for my high-school-age son to use for school . After a month of regular use carrying his textbooks and supplies , fabric of the pack ripped along the zipper for the largest compartment , not mendable because the fabric was raveling . I noticed that other parts of the fabric were showing similar signs of failing . The great price was too good to be true .	-1
Purchased this for my 15 year old son . The bag was in the garbage . It ripped in the bottom corner , and the hole proceeded to get bigger and bigger rather quickly . it was used to transport school books . Disappointed.My son pulled out a Jansport he has had for several years . I should 've stuck with that brand .	-1
I bought this for my 10 year old son as a backpack for school . The only thing he keeps in his backpack is a small 3 ring binder and occasionally he 'll shove his sweatshirt in it . There are 2 zippers on the big main pocket and within the first 3 weeks of school the zipper broke . I do n't have much use for a backpack that wo n't close . Wo n't be buying another K-Cliffs backpack .	-1
After returning the watch that I bought I confirmed with Victorinox by email that this watch has been discontinued . I may know the reason . There are two manufacturing contact points at the base of the buckle . They cause irritation on the wrist with the slightest pressure such as placing the hand on a table . This used to be a wonderful watch . I owned one for many years and gave it to a friend who was in need . Now , a few years later , I bought another one and promptly returned it when I saw that it was turning my wrist red from irritation . The one I bought online from a major retailer arrived running with the time and date set . I presume it was a return . This is sad .	-1
for the first I wear this shoes , after walking no more than 1000m , the heel port srubbed my heel , and get my heel peeling .	-1
Here 's how they get you : The appearance , the look , the color and the price are great , right ? But the actual shoes suck . Not leather , cheap Chinese crap for amateur shoe-wearing men . If this is going to be your first pair of dress shoes , I feel sorry for you . These are what some high school math teacher pedophile would wear , seriously . Very dated style . Like a nightmare out of the '90 's . Boring as hell . Terrible . I totally regret buying dress shoes online . What the hell was I thinking .	-1
The style is very large and pointy -- my poor husband was tripping on them !	-1
I work as an engineer for a general contractor in California and duck Carhartt 's are too hot , so I wanted something lighter but still as durable . They 're definitely lighter - the canvas breathes much easier and I can wear them in 90+ weather without dying , but the sacrifice for durability is awful . I 've had them for ~2 months and I 've already torn one pocket completely off , have holes in the knees and the crotch seam is starting to wear . The thin fabric also means you can feel everything - kneeling on anything is painful . Definitely will not be buying these again , I ca n't afford to replace them every few months . I 'm honestly extremely disappointed because this is the first time a Carhartt product has let me down .	-1
mens size is not accurate . Waist was small , the fit was not at all right . I would not recommend these pants .	-1
First-these pants do not even come close to the Carhartt 's I have purchased in the past . It really makes me wonder if they are real Carhartts . Second the sizing is not even close ! If you take a 36 waist and you order a 36 be prepared to send them back . Even though they will be marked as a 36 they will seem more like a 32 waist	-1
POOR QUALITY , NOT RUGGED ENOUGH FOR TODAYS WORK PROJECTS AND CAN NOT STAND UP TO THE CARHART NAME BRAND I KNOW SO WELL	-1
I could n't believe this . It 's so small in size and there is no give to the elasticity in it at all . Going back . I ordered the biggest size and I 'm not sure even a stick figure could fit into it . It 's sooooo tiny .	-1
I really liked this garter at first , but it did n't hold up . first the little thing that allows you to adjust the size broke , and then one of the straps came off , on the day of a photo shoot , and I had to pin it and fake it . too bad , cuz it was a cute belt . I guess I 'll replace the hardware , but it will cost me more than the garter in the long run .	-1
This scarf is cheap and that is its best attribute . It is absolutely useless for any form of protection . In fact , it is so thin that is practically thread bare . You can actually see through it . The Sellers markup on this product must be tremendous . I would have returned it but in addition to the return postage they have the nerve to charge you a 15 % restocking fee ( as if to throw this piece rubbish back on the shelf is worth a couple of bucks ) . Like most foreign products this scarf is not only a waste of money but also a piece of trash - you get what you pay for . BUY U.S.A. - you may pay a bit more but you get a reliable & substantial product . Colonel	-1
I am 5'6 & # 34 ; and weigh 118 lbs . These make my legs look absolutely terrible . I actually was so frustrated in them that I threw them away . These were the first pair of stockings that I purchased and I will probably not buy another pair . I wear a size 0-2 pants and these squeezed my legs so tight and made my thighs look like I had huge amounts of cellulite . I DO NOT recommend this product .	-1
nice quality but did not stay up keeps sliding down kind of annoying , just sitting in my closet , consider that	-1
I thought I was getting a bodysuit without the arms but I got a full bodysuit instead . I dont know why but this is not what i ordered . It was the same red color and I am just going to keep it since it was only like $ 6 but I was kinda upset to not get what we wanted .	-1
got ta cut the crotch part bigger other wise you cant get in ... if you know what i mean ... ok product .	-1
they are strong material , but they slip and roll at the top which is very uncomfortable while wearing them.the seam at the toes is nice but i ca n't wear these for very long because they 're very uncomfortable when they roll up slide down my thighs , they are tight on me and I have very nice legs_ mrs. bot	-1
Boot fits better without socks ; however , after I took them off my baby , there was a ring around her leg . So obviosuly they must of been too tight .	-1
You get what you paid for . I wanted a couple of light sabers to duel with so I ordered two . I was disappointed with their cheapness but for $ 10 I ca n't expect it to be too sturdy . My husband ended up getting me a couple of new sabers that were 3 times as expensive but are so much better . Now I 'm not too worried about dueling with these and having them break but do n't order this if you 're wanting a durable product . You might as well shell out the money for a better product .	-1
we have this light saber and theStar Wars E3 BASIC LIGHTSABER BL01 GREEN . this lightsaber was broken after the very first battle ! i could n't believe this light saber was such a flimsy piece of junk that a kid ca n't even pretend to duel with it . what 's the point ? ? my son was very disappointed , but thankfully my son also has the basic light saber , which has survived the usual 6yo abuse .	-1
Do not expect much of disguise , because almost all of your kind are above $ 100 . If you want something simple and have fun , not so bad . i am 5 8 '' and the sleeves fit me . The crotch is very fair to me . If you want to have a party where everyone will look at the genital area , I suggest you buy a larger size . As data , the mask has only the back half is uncovered .	-1
It is really flimsy ! it is also curved to one side . button to turn it on is tiny and requires quite an effort to slide.Save your money !	-1
We had a family pirate theme this year , and my husband said the costume was overall itchy and uncomfortable . It also looked much more cheesy and cheap in person than it did in the pictures .	-1
i am not sure why but this pair fit me great and looked good in a retail store but upon delivery these did not fit right and looked different , i retuned this pair no problems . these might be good for someone with a larger face.rayban 3179 fit me .	-1
AWFUL ! ! ! I Purchased this in JAN/FEB2013 , return date ends as of 05MAR2013 and the battery is already dead . This watch lasted less than 6 weeks , I suggest you buy from someone else . 1 ) Why would a company have a return policy of less than 6 weeks if they were not selling faulty items ? 2 ) It took darn near 4 weeks for me to receive the item to begin with . I attempted to contact the company before placing a bad review , but their return policy prevented me from doing so , so here it is a bad review . A great watch sold by a awful vendor .	-1
I also have now owned 4 or 5 of these and they just get worse as time goes on . First one lasted a couple years and band finally broke and it fell a long ways and it was pretty rough looking . I am oilfield and do n't take them off much . They lived as I lived . The second one lasted couple of years and quit working and a new battery did not last 2 weeks . The third one died and a new battery for it did n't last . This last one has been treated better , no shower , no pool , I am older and working in office now so it does n't see sledge hammers and wrench marks.Reading the reviews I find I am not alone here , it appears the quality has dropped over the years . Not sure but for what they cost one year is about all you going to get out of them . Better with a Timex ...	-1
Ordered these as a deal buy . The pictures do not show the distressed look on the front and back and as I ordered them for work , can not wear these . Plus they are too loose for a straight fit . My first purchase with amazon that I will be returning .	-1
Ladies with Kardashian sized behinds or Jennifer Lopez sized backside , listen up ! This is the boyfriend jeans you 've been waiting for . The legs are slim enough but not tight ( so it fits your outlandish man-sized thighs ) but the seat of the pants are large enough to fit Arsenio Hall 's famous buttocks . It may even fit the muscular physiques of the Williams sisters and a couple of tennis balls in the back pockets . In fact , I put a small phone book in the rear while the waist button was closed and I could still stick my full hands in the back pockets . Mind you , everything else fit just fine . The legs are slim but not skinny and the waist , while sitting on the hips . were snug enough to hold the pants up . I guess the foreign pattern makers who work Levi 's jeans these days watch too many American TV shows and think that this is the land of the unfit lard behinds . To top it off , the fabric quality is atrociously bad . I 'm going back to the 501s .	-1
How can Levis give four completely different pants the same model number ? It is a joke of the first order . How are you supposed to ever find the jeans you like when you can *NEVER* count on getting them twice in a row using the same model number ? Who is the genius who decided that '514 ' should be applied to all manner of totally different pants ? Who decided they should be made in disparate countries from production run to run ? I will never patronize Levis again - number one they are made in Bangladesh or Columbia , number two they are literally morons at Levis , and morons do n't deserve our business .	-1
These jeans feel like they 're made from paper . Also , because I thought they would shrink if I washed them in my washing machine , I used Dryel . But they still shrank !	-1
I recently received a pair of Levi 514s for Christmas from a from a friend and I found the fit to be absolutely horrible . As a preface , I 've been wearing Levis jeans pretty much exclusively for over five years . I own several pairs of 501s 514s 529 and 539 . Until now I was 100 % satisfied with the product which I was getting however Levis was sneaky and changed the cut and sizing of this 514 . I have always worn 32 waist on all of my Levis with room to spare . I put on these new 514s and they were practically painted on , much to my suprise . The cut is not a straight cut as you would expect but is a rather fitted tapered cut which is tapered in at the thigh and knee area . If you plan on buying these you better expect that the sizing will not be as you expected . I get adding new styles to the lineup of jeans but do that , add new styles , do n't destroy the great styles that made people want to buy Levis in the first place . So now I am stuck because I do n't know what Levis I ll be able to get a propper fit with . I may have to move on to something else entirely and cherish my now vintage Levis that I already have . I am so dissapointed with the lack of consistency with the Levis product line now . BEWARE .	-1
The label on the pair of jeans I received said 36x32 ( waist 36 & # 34 ; , leg 32 & # 34 ; ) , but when I wore it , It had plenty of room to spare on my waist ! I was delighted , thinking that my diet had been successful . I then made a measurement the waist of the jeans to confirm , and the measurement read 38 & # 34 ; . No thanks for cheating my feelings AND giving me the wrong sizes on my pair of jeans , Levis .	-1
The fit was just off for my body type . It fit ok at the waist , but way overly baggy in the seat and thigh .	-1
I like the fit of these . I have muscular legs and a narrow waist , and I can actually get the legs of these over my thighs and calves without a struggle unlike the 505 's . But they are badly mislabeled . I ordered a 31 inch waist/30 inch inseam . The product I received was labeled as such . The actual inseam measured with a tape measure was almost 32 inches , way too long for me to wear . I do n't understand how such a basic failure in quality control can be allowed to happen .	-1
this is an update , one wash , count that..one wash and they shrunk 1 '' in length . I have the same exact jeans in the inky blue from Costco and washed both for the first time together . The inky blue did NOT shrink but this kale , did shrink and one inch makes the difference between fitting perfectly and being almost `` high water '' . I frankly was shocked to have them shrink let alone shrink an inch . I know it may be quibbling but you expect more from Levi and face it you pay more for Levi . Disappointed ! and yes , cold water wash and rinse , no hot water whatsoever was involved . Grrr ! The jeans fit exactly how I expected . I had purchased what I thought was the same pair of jeans at Costco for ten dollars more than the price I got here at Amazon . I tried to get all the correct numbers off of the label and order the exact same thing here at Amazon . Levi has a very difficult to decipher part number . They also have a wide range of colors . If I am buying a new pair of jeans , I prefer them looking like new jeans , I will add the wear as I wear them . The one I got from Amazon are the same color every where but on the thighs which have that slightly faded look . Since they fit so well I kept them but I was disappointed that they were not exactly what I wanted . However at the price I could n't turn them down .	-1
The small clamps on the front ( right above the cup ) that allows you to unhook the cup has rough spots on it . It rubs my skin too much and actually left little scratches/thin scabs from wearing two days in a row . Had a nice fit and did n't really notice the rubbing too much during the day , but definitely not going to wear it again after noticing the marks left behind . What a bummer .	-1
Do n't waste your money . Terrible fit and low quality . I have to ask & # 34 ; Did a man design this bra ? & # 34 ; lol	-1
I returned this bra because it was smaller than expected around the band . And i will say the quality was n't really all that great	-1
I am an average 36 D and this bra was so tight I could n't breathe . The cups look nice , soft and smooth , but they run too small and my girls were spilling on all sides .	-1
for One size , it does not really fit on someone like me though I fall in the category well . The thigh highs are too tight on top , and the top comes down too low , so the garters are too long . This would be good on a woman who is 5'10 & # 34 ; & up weighing 125 lbs . Waste of my money ! : - (	-1
This product is well made but one size do not fit most . It would to big for someone small not bad on an average person and not pretty on someone large . Then wash it , see who all could fit in it now , I mean how many of us at once . Waste of money .	-1
Perhaps the pair that I received were incorrectly marked . They clearly said 13 2E , yet they were 1/2 & # 34 ; shorter than other New Balance shoes I own . The toe box was narrower as well . I was very disappointed .	-1
It looked good , I like design too . But after 2 month it became junk . the color went there I do not know .	-1
Be sure to buy wider than you usually wear , they are quite snug , I 've never needed a wide shoe , but in this case it would have mad for a much more comfortable sneaker .	-1
Both of these were smaller than any 13 shoe I 've ever worn , especially the right shoe , which is too small to even wear . The silver finish is worn off around the edge like they 'd already been used . Not a good purchase	-1
I have a couple NB shoes now and really like my others . This pair is not a made in USA pair , and it runs a bit small . A 9.5 for me in my USA pair was perfect , but i would need a 10 in this to make it work . Also , I was n't a huge fan of the design so I returned it and got a pair in grey instead .	-1
I have been buying the New Balance 993 for years . I was expecting a little better quality out of this shoe , even at the cheaper price . I ended up returning them . No problem with delivery or packaging . Just did n't love the shoe .	-1
I like the look of this chain but had to return , it was yanking my hair out in chunks within 15 minutes of putting it on . Would never buy again .	-1
I am extremely disappointed with this wallet . Yes , it 's big . Yes , it 's fat . But it does n't take much of anything.If you put a checkbook into the checkbook slot , you ca n't close this wallet . No way , no how . Yes , it has room for eight credit cards , but can you close it with eight credit cards in it ? Nope . Yes , it has a zippered compartment on the outside , but it 's not big enough for keys or pretty much anything at all . The only useful section is the zippered one with the two pockets on the inside , so basically you have this one tiny useful section surrounded by a big , bulky , useless outer shell . Oh , and even with practically nothing in it , the flap in front ( barely ) snaps shut sideways . Sideways ! Can you believe I have to have a separate purse in my bag just for my keys , key ring with all my store cards , and my cell phone ? It 's insane . And what 's this & # 34 ; w/ Calculator & # 34 ; nonsense ? There 's no calculator ! I 'm really mad at myself for spending money on this useless piece of rubbish .	-1
got this for my wife and she was fine with it for about a week , then the zipper broke , then it ripped .	-1
The watch does not have the tighten crown to make water resistant and the dial is extremely hard to see in dim light . I wound not recommend this watch . Some of the other styles may be fine , but , stay away from the black face .	-1
the battery stopped after only a few months and time and date is off . face is small but heavier than it looks	-1
I did n't like the black face and found the time too difficult to read . The size is excellent for a women 's watch , but I thought the gold accents looked tacky and some users said they scratched off . It does have the moveable outer ring for timing dives .	-1
They came broken . First of all they were always going late . And in one week they stopped forever . We even changed the battery it did n't work . It was waste of money . And it was a gift , so i did feel myself very bad .	-1
This watch does not have an expensive feel to the pushers and the movement does not have an exacting appearance . It has a less expensive dispostion about it . But , it is a less expensive timepiece . For the money it is a great purchase . The only real dislike is that some of the chrono hands are brushed metalic and it almost looks like foil - sort of cheese looking . To have held the watch in my own hand , I probably would not have purchased it . However , the band was exceptional in fine leather .	-1
Cheap watch for a cheap price . Very tiny case and dial that is hard to read . Would probably not make for a good actual diver watch if used that way .	-1
Edit- you can see my previous review below.When the watch arrived the movement was not working . I went out and paid $ 15 to get the battery replaced and the watch started working . It periodically would be 3-4 minutes off but I would adjust it and move on with my life.Then it really started getting bad , it would be off my 15-45 minutes and finally completely quit . I thought , `` no problem '' I 'll just return it to Amazon ! However , I looked and saw that I was 48 hours past the return date . `` Ok , '' I thought ... .no problem , I 'll just return it to Invicta ! Then I looked and saw that there is a $ 28 shipping charge for warranty service.So I bought a $ 50 watch , replaced the $ 15 battery and am now expected to pay $ 28 to get it fixed . No thanks . I 'm done throwing good money after bad . The watch is trash , do not buy it ! ! ! ! ! ! ! *******************************************************************The watch looks great , and that 's all that I really cared about.However , the watch arrived with a dead battery which required me to spend $ 15 at a jewelry store to get it replaced . When you 're buying a watch this inexpensive that 's a huge negative.It also does n't actually have a rotating dial for diving , which many of the other reviews have noted . Which begs the question , why doesn ' the seller just change the description ?	-1
Sadly , the markers inside the watch , came lose and stopped the watch cold . The Invicta company only covers the watch for a year , and it makes no sense to send it back . Besides having to keep it wound all the time , my husband stated that the band was very unforgiving and uncomfortable . This is the third Invicta watch that I have had , and two of them are now no longer worth what they were paid for . It is very unfortunate because , the Invicta watches actually look so nice , but unfortunately , they just do n't stand the test of time ! ( Pun intended ) . However , we also purchased a Citizen Eco Drive watch on the same day , and these watches are PHENOMENAL . They look great , and stand up to daily wearing , without losing time .	-1
I love the `` Garden Shoe '' that I purchased a couple of years ago but they needed replacing due to the fact that they stretched a bit and the footbed has some holes from wear . I purchased the `` clog '' in the same size but they clearly fit differently than the `` shoe . '' They are wider and longer . I would not get the clog again . I 'm sorry that I did n't stick to what I know and like .	-1
I love this tshirt . The fit is good . My gripe is the fabric developed a hole ( not near any seams ) after just one wash before I even wore the shirt . I 'll darn the hole but while I like the Bella shirts ( I have a few of them ) , the fabric quality seems to be consistently not up to my reasonable expectations . Really , fabric should n't develop holes from just one wash .	-1
2 problems with this costume . 1 . The mess in one of the eye openings in the mask was not attached . Had to get the hot glue gun out and do some repairs . 2 . The sash that came with it is only 26 & # 34 ; long . Fortunately my grandson is slim but we did n't have much sash to work with . I think he will wear the costume without it . I guess for $ 11 you ca n't expect much .	-1
I purchased this after christmas so I know that I got a great deal on it , but if you are paying more than $ 5 for it , you are WASTING your money . The fabric is very thin and cheap . If you were to spend 25 , I 'd say spend 40 and get it directly from disney where it 's actually a much heavier robe .	-1
These shoes are cute except when I went to put them on the right shoe was a little smaller than the left and felt uncomfortable . Hence , I had to return .	-1
I am furious ! ! I ca n't even get a hold of a live person to take care of this matter ! I am totally pist off . I am so tired of being ripped off ! I want my money credited back to my account . I did what I was supposed to do , now it 's your turn ! !	-1
First of all , there is zero flexibility when walking . Secondly , they are too heavy to not have flexibility . Finally , there is zero cushioning . I ca n't see what anyone likes about this shoe except its looks ( which is why I gave it 2 stars ) . I would definitely buy this shoe in the future if Skechers made them more comfortable and flexible . I hope to see this change as I really think they are cute . Please , Skechers ! Improve this product !	-1
I have very wide feet and was n't sure about the length and width of these shoes . I ordered my size and a size bigger and to my surprise my size was roomy enough . My heels cover the trim a little but the trim crushes down and it is n't a bother to walk on . After wearing them twice I 've noticed they have given already so that 's even better . I chose chestnut because I thought they would be more practical and the color is beautiful . I gave it three stars because I think the fur trim is too fluffy and the weight of the shoe makes them a little difficult to keep on while walking . I do n't hate the trim but I 'm glad that most of my pants cover that part and I think thicker socks could solve the sliding problem . Overall , they 're nice looking , warm and will help me get through the rest of my pregnancy without having to put big boots on my swollen feet this winter.UPDATE : I wore these shoes for one winter season and ended up getting rid of them . They gave so much in width that the only way they would stay on my feet was if I walked like a snail . My ankle turned a few times , once resulting in a pretty bad fall . Wearing them without socks helped to prevent the shoe from sliding off a little but not much . If you size down , they 'll be too short so I think that either way , these shoes just stretch out way too much . They were cute and I received many compliments but very heavy and clunky . I believe the sole is just too much . I had to get rid of them because they were hazardous to my health .	-1
I generally love Skechers sandals ; I have a pair from 3 years ago that are still one of the most comfortable pairs of shoes I own . It 's a shame that they do n't sell them anymore . In fact , Skechers seems to be focusing on flip flops which are terrible for your feet.I was hoping these sandals would be comfortable , but they are n't at all . there is no support near the ball of the foot . I think these would be okay for running errands or for bicycling , but not for hiking/walking .	-1
I had a pair just like this and loved them , so I ordered another pair when mine wore out . Sadly , the sole in the right shoe is glued in crooked , which throws my gait off . There is no way to remove it in order to glue it in straight without tearing it all apart . I had already thrown the box away , so I ca n't send them back .	-1
After having these as long as I have , I got 2 pairs expecting something more . They are not as comfortable & the elastic over the ball of the shoe does n't have much give .	-1
Got these as a present , they were bought from Amazon . Look-wise , exactly as the picture shows . They come up to about mid-calf and look okay with skinny jeans tucked in or leggings.The bad- size runs big , get 1/2 size smaller . I normally wear an 8 , but these are about 1/2 size to big . The inner boot is not lined , only the shaft is . On a cold day , you would need to wear some thick socks- maybe that 's where the 1/2 size extra room would come into play . Foot bed is not very comfortable , might as well be walking on a wood sole . The top of the boot is floppy . even all the way laced , zipped , and buckled ( actually velcro but will come back to that ) the boot is floppy . There is a small , very slender , `` buckle '' that is actually velcro . It does not do anything but be annoying since the area underneath bulges if you velcro too tight , and the side of the boot is floppy if too loose.Overall , the boot is just okay . Not my favorite and wo n't be wearing it a whole lot . Moot point since I bought them for cold , snowy winters , and the foot of the boot is not warm but actually quite thin .	-1
Returned boots . Not quite what I expected . I did not care for lacing boot up . Although , the boot was quite comfortable .	-1
I have been searching for the right size bra for myself because i had gotten breast enhancement surgery a while back . I saw this bra and thought it would be perfect because in the picture it doesnt look as if it is complete coverage and cute enough to wear out . wrong . this bra ( in a 34 G ) is full coverage . im taking even when i wear a tank top ( thick strapped ) it is sticking out over my shirt . keep in mind that i dont dress trampy in anyway at all . there is o way i can wear this bra out and can only wear it to work when i have a shirt that goes all the way up to my neck.. V necks , forget about it . i am so disappointed . very very bad purchase .	-1
The band is too tight , and I wore it for weeks in hopes it would stretch out.The outside edge of the underwires are curved too much toward the center of the chest . This pulls the breast away from the stays , and it does make them look perky but makes one feel so bound it 's difficult to breathe . I had to bend the underwires just to be able to wear the bra.The adjustable straps do not have enough length to adjust for me , so I suffer dig-in , and this is the worst of all . Every day my shoulders and the tops of my breasts where the straps meet the cups were red from pulling and irritation.The bra simply fits too small.And that lace cami part ? It shows as little bumps through every garment except a Fair Isle sweater.I would have returned it , but it was too late by the time I was finished with trying to make it work .	-1
Ok I bought 2 Le Mystere bras and I loved them both , then I wanted to get another one and decided to try this one with the lace . I thought it would be nice with lower cut shirt or if the strap were showing it would look pretty . The bra fit good 34E ( 34dd ) But it was very itchy , the back and the arm straps . It also seemed to rub in the armpit area . I loved the tisha and the techfit so much better # 1 techfit !	-1
This fit terribly . I think it ran small in the cup and small in the band . Seriously , it looked so atrocious when I put it on , did n't tack at the gore at all ... blegh .	-1
I thought I would like this bra due to the zillion positive reviews , but it looked awkward on . While it mostly fit , it pushed my bust together and sort of looked like ... Well , a sports bra . I also thought the lace trim was itchy . Not flattering ( I 'm a 32-34 FF-G ) , so it went back .	-1
Despite having great reviews and promise , this bra was not the one for me . The cup shape was terribly pointy and un-natural looking . I have returned it and hope this review alerts you to the awkward side-profile of this lacey bra .	-1
I was n't expecting super quality but these are below par . The & # 34 ; belt & # 34 ; is too flimsy , I took the accessories off and put them on one of my child 's dress belts just so it 'd be more stable . Overall he is having fun with it but I do n't expect that it will last long .	-1
These gloves were very cheaply made . Disappointed with this purchase . The material was so thin . It was not worth the price	-1
These shoes were not dark brown as I thought they were going to be so I sent them back and also they scuffed up very easily . I SENT THESE SHOES BACK ! ! ! ! !	-1
I received a pair of Havianas ( did n't know they were so famos ) and i had them for years . I now had to purchase a new pair , but this ones are not at all as mine were . they are too thin , i can feel the floor , and when wearing for long periods my back hurts . Kept the ones that i had already used , and reurned the rest .	-1
Very very loose very large . Only for extremely puffy or supper high arch feet . Let Oprah have them ... and I love our Oprah . Do n't buy these ,	-1
Poor fit , poor quality , non-existent insulation . This item was to be used for the purpose of skiing . I can only imagine it now used to scare the neighbors throwing out the trash with this item included in it .	-1
Not as well made as I thought it would be and the color was off some minor pulls in the material	-1
So did a lot of research to make sure I correctly measured and such , turns out the cup size was too big . The band fit fine , so on to find the right cup size . The Natori I have purchased in the past tended toward smaller cups that was not the case with this purchase . The product was sent back the next day.It appeared to be well made and the material felt nice but as I stated it was the wrong size in the cup .	-1
This bra seems very high quality and looks great in the pics but creates a pointy 1950's-esqe silhouette . If that does n't bother you than I think you would find it a great bra , comfortable but still including pretty details ( the straps are very flattering ) . And , just because I find it helpful in reviews- I 'm 5'6 and a 34 DDD .	-1
Bad wig , horrible quality . I mean , what do you expect for the price ... still it was way crappier than I thought it would be , even though my expectations were low . Unless you 're going as a hill-billy for halloween I would pay an extra $ 5 and get a better wig .	-1
I never did figure out how to set this and neither has anyone else I 've asked . The time is correct twice a day , though .	-1
Watch face too small , ca n't see a thing . I ended up giving this away . There are better choices , thank you	-1
I used to buy these all the time but I think I 'm done . The point of manufacture keeps changing ( India , Pakistan and who knows where ) . The quality of stitching and even the material itself is not as good as before . You may or may not get a decent quality pair . The quality control is definitely hit or miss .	-1
I bought these based on the 4 & 5 star reviews . However , they are not thick & warm like some people say they are , 11oz & up are thicker & warmer.These look like I could buy them at a local discount retail store . I turn these inside out when I wash but after a 4-washes , I noticed they started pilling.These are not & # 34 ; high & # 34 ; quality & are made of a cheap cotton base . If you do n't care about the pilling & just using them around the house or in the yard , I 'd say go for it . However , I can get the same ones , different brand that will pill at my local retail stores for less $ $ .The elastic waist fits as expected . The bottom of the legs are also elastic & are comfortable around the ankles . One other thing that I do like , is the pockets are actually deep & come partially up my arm , about a third of the way .	-1
These pants must have looked great since they were stolen from my gym locker less than 20 minutes after opening the package and trying them on ... .Love the product , Hate the thief	-1
I 've owned 10 Timex IronMan watches since 1987 , and recently experienced a failure with a gift I gave my wife - the `` custom '' timex watchband DROPPED THE watch and she looked down only 4 months after receiving her christmas present and it was GONE FOREVER ! ! Since I 've owned so many of these watches I 've watched over the years as they made changes , but this generation of watches is a HORRIBLE MISTAKE . First of all , it 's been true that since the beginning of time , the cheap resin watchbands have been uncomfortable so everyone knows that when they break ( and they DO break , after about 1 year , in general ) , you must purchase an aftermarket velcro watch band , or a leather band , or whatever blows your skirt up ... I went to WalMart last week looking to pick up 2 of these watches and demo'ed them extensively ( one for my self and one for my poor watch-less wife ) , but then realized , WHAT WILL I DO WHEN THE WATCH BAND FAILS ? ? And the answer is : I 'll be stuck paying $ 12 for another crappy resin proprietary band that TIMEX ships with this watch . Look at the photo . THIS WATCH DOES N'T USE STANDARD PINS TO MOUNT THE BAND . THE SPACE BETWEEN THE PINS IS TOO NARROW.It 's apparent to me that Timex is trying to become the Microsoft of watches ! I bought my wife a TIMEX Atlantis , and I recommend it highly to everyone . It has all the features of the Ironman , and none of this B.S . about proprietary bands and watch faces that fall out ...	-1
I got this for my son . Of all ~12 timex ironman watches I have owned in my lifetime , this has the very stiffest buttons . They leave a red mark on your fingers when you finally push hard enough to operate them ! ! ! I wo n't even bother to set this watch for my son , i 'll only touch it if I need to turn off the alarm at 4:00 AM . THE WORST USER INTERFACE OF ALL MY TIMEX WATCHES.It 's good if you do n't plan to push the buttons ! ! !	-1
The price and some nice , but `` temporary '' features is what gives this watch 2 stars . Other than that it would have to be `` 0 '' . I know for $ 12.92 what can one expect in a watch , but after having and wearing this watch for 3 months , the display went totally bye-bye ! Totally gone , totally useless ! It is suppose to be water-resistant , but apparently not fog-resistant . This watch was never under water in any way , in the bathtub or shower , but it would fog under the crystal display when in high humidity weather or from hanging over the kitchen sink while doing dishes , etc. , and I mean well above the sink and it would still fog considerably under the crystal display . So , I 'm not sure what they mean by water-resistant , because it is not . Ca n't imagine how long it would have lasted if I actually had it under water . So , this has been my second Timex sports watch in less than a year , and both have given up electronically . Not a good track record in my book , and definitely not even worth the $ 12.95 . I guess unless Timex feels $ 12.92 and three months to disposal , which is the case with this watch .	-1
I apparently ca n't wear Keens anymore . The width in the toe-box is good , but the heel was sloppy-loose and they slipped something awful . I did n't used to think I had narrow heels , but maybe I do .	-1
I love my Keen 's sandals but ca n't quite wear them in winter , so I ordered the Presidio shoe based on the reviews . They went back almost right away ... they seriously hurt my feet ! I wore them around the house for a little while but found them rubbing my left foot just below the ankle , and they had TOO MUCH support for the metatarsal area . Way too stiff with a very hard insole . My feet were aching badly . It felt like I 'd been wearing those Dr. School 's wooden clog/sandals we all used to wear in the 1970s ! ! I swapped out the insole with a gel insole to get some cushioning , and that did n't help . Then I ordered the PowerStep inserts that I have used in less supportive sneakers , and they did not work at all . Four different insoles and my feet ached every time.If you do n't have problem feet , these may be fine for you , but if you need firm but gentle support , I would n't recommend them . My Clark 's mules and clogs are considerably more comfortable and supportive .	-1
This bag did n't last me a month . So floppy and felt like a school kid really . It 's huge , so I will give it that . But otherwise , the straps are twisted and mangled , in the first use . The velcro is a large strip and attracts , a pile of hair , lint , ect . and before you know it does n't serve a purpose anymore . If you are have tons to carry , and just want a massive shoulder crusher this bag will do .	-1
Lasted one day into the school year before a zipper gave way at the closed end . Rezipping would n't reclose so back it went . Kudos to Amazon for a usual painless return . It had not been overpacked to my eye and the replacement pack of another brand has worked out just fine with the same load of books ...	-1
I bought this pack from Amazon mid Feb this year , used it moderately for about 3 months , and the seam split on the right side of the second pocket 2 weeks ago and the zipper broke today on the back large pocket ( the zipper has come undone on both sides and wont correct itself ) . Also , even when the zippers do work , they tend to unzip while walking without you knowing until you hear something fall out of it behind you . I do n't recommend this pack . Spend a little more and get something well made .	-1
have n't had enough time with this yet , sorry to be iffy but I really wan na see where this bag goes , ya know . . .	-1
I would actually give this backpack 5 stars if the zipper had n't fallen off ( on two of their backpacks ) . I love High Sierra 's backpacks and feel they offer an excellent price/quality ratio , in most respects . However , QC seems to have & # 34 ; dropped the ball & # 34 ; on their zipper checks . This is a problem because an otherwise good backpack can become quite useless if the zippers fall off ( rendering a portion of the backpack nonfunctional ) . In my experience , this was not due to weak or broken metal , it was merely due to the zipper attachment piece not being & # 34 ; clamped & # 34 ; down securely enough around the zipper , allowing a gap in the metal , large enough that the original zipper can easily & # 34 ; fall off & # 34 ; the backpack ( never to be seen again ) . I was able to attach another zipper ... using a pair of pliers to clamp it to the attachment piece to render the backpack functional again . However , the zipper does not match the backpack and I should not have needed to do this . : ( If you purchase one of these backpacks , be sure to check all zippers for these gaps ( and clamp them down securely ) before using .	-1
Not waterproof/ resistant.. very thin fabric , uncomfortable neck ( pad ) . Very easy to rip and not much good for anything . Nope	-1
Poorly constructed with thin material on the inside pouches . This pack will not last long under repeated use . Looks better in the photo	-1
The beads were not the length and the quality I expected . I would not recommend the product to others . I found it to be something for little girls to play with not something an adult would wear to a speakeasy party	-1
Was too small and looked very cheap	-1
Cheaply made product that is over priced . Would not buy this item again . We actually bought something a medical supply store that was cheaper and more authentic .	-1
I knew they were cheap , but they should have been made much smaller . I wear size 12 , and they fell off my shoes and looked bad . After two uses , I threw them away . The company did a very poor design job . Do n't buy them .	-1
First impressions : THESE LOOK AWESOME ! The Pros : Cheap & # 34 ; ish & # 34 ; The Cons : These things provide NO ankle support.. just walking around with these for a few minutes and I almost rolled my ankle ( walking on FLAT ground ) -- I could n't imagine actually wearing these in any kind of actual combat sim.Returned right awayWorth the Money / Would I buy this item again ? : No	-1
The Amazon page says to buy a size below your normal size . My running shoe size is 12 . I have black Rothco ripple sole jungle boots in 11 and they fit perfect.I just paid $ 20 to send back these tan boots in size 11 . They may have resized ( re-lasted ) these because a size 11 , for me , is a size 11.So , do they have a mixture of old over sized and new correctly sized boots . Good luck .	-1
I get that I 'm on the more plus size of normal BUT at all of the local bridal stores , the & # 34 ; one size fits all & # 34 ; petticoat is just fine . This honestly did n't come close to fitting ... not . I 'm confused as to why I fit in a regular sized slip in stores but not here . ( Not even close. ) HOWEVER ... if it would have fit , the quality seems good enough for me !	-1
I like the boot but I have to send it back . I tried a 7 and my toe rubbed the tip of the boot , but the rest of the boot fit my foot nicely . I tried a 7.5 and it is too sloppy on my foot . The boot does not fit well enough for hiking , even with a thick sock .	-1
This nursing top looks homely . It 's tight around my rib cage , but lose up top , and I am not small busted or overweight . It 's just an unattractive fit . It also has a bra hook style that 's hard to manage .	-1
Too long in the arms and length for my 8 year old ( she wears an 8-10 girls ) and for $ 40 the seams should be finished ! I had to do it by hand since the fabric was so thin my sewing machine kept & # 34 ; eating & # 34 ; it . The & # 34 ; belt & # 34 ; is printed piece of cut fabric that ties in the back and the wig had hardly any hair on the top . My daughter loves it , so we are keeping it ... but I would recommend you try a different brand of higher quality !	-1
I was so glad when these finally arrived , but I could n't keep them . : ( I do n't know how folks do it , but these were impossible for me to get closed right . I bought them to go in my top piercing ( cartilage ) and they were the perfect size and so cute and dainty . I was so determined to get them in , but it just was n't happening . The rod kept going just to the outside of the earring hole , never straight into it . Near miss each and every time and it was so hard to see the back of my ear . lol . I even tried what one reviewer suggested , putting them in from the back first , nope . I got so frustrated and my ear was so sore by then , I had had enough . If you can get these in and closed on the first try , I highly commend you ! : )	-1
I got these for a pair of boots that I had heel slip in . These didnt help at all . I wish I had returned them . Its a great concept , but this product doesnt work with my foot . I have a skinny ankle with a wide toe box , so any of these types of products arent going to work for me .	-1
