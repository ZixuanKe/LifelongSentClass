The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic , it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses , I guess it 's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis , and two more occasionally , which is the only reason I 'm giving it for stars , I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me , but the product itself is wonderful , it 's not cakey , gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections , therefore I highly recommend it : )	1
I was very happy to get this palette , now I wish it was offered in subscription form like some of the makeup we use daily is . In this unnamed set you can do a lot of blending , sculpting , highlighting and concealing . The product is nicely pigmented , it 's smooth and applies well then blends out beautifully . I have normal to dry skin as I 'm 59 years , this works wonderfully under my foundation . I also use a silicone based primer , which works well for my skin type to give me the fresh , dewy look I love.You get a good amount of product for your money here , so this is well worth the cost . What more can you say , if one is willing to repurchase a product then that says more than mere words .	1
I bought this product about 3 months ago , I finished my tube of xtreme brite , as soon as I was almost done with the product I started seeing results . As I applied the gel in a circular motion i was doing so , I started to see dirt like skin come off . It was incredible : ) as of today my arm pits are still white , well as they should look .	1
i got this to get rid of a scar and it did just that , if you are looking to remove any discoloration ( spot ) this will get rid of it , i dont know about putting it all over your face but it def work for a spot	1
I order this cream along with their soap . It actually worked for me but after I finished the tube , I ordered different brand just to get quicker results ( BAD IDEA ) . I am definitely ordering 3 more tubes so that my underarm pigment gets treated completely .	1
Good product . Use a little bit on your spot and the next day its already shedding the first layer of skin . By the 3 rd day the spot is almost gone . Cant get these results from the most expensive products	1
I have n't been a big fan of Prada 's fragrances over the years but absolutely fell in love with the sweetness and candy-like scent of this perfume ! This smells like a sweet , decadent caramel with tones of vanilla and I 'm not sure what else , but it smells great ! Although , I must say that this seller is asking for WAY too high a price for this bottle ! You could get the 2.7 oz bottle for around the same price at Neiman Marcus ( the 1.7 oz for around $ 80 if you prefer a smaller bottle ) !	1
We gave these as gifts and everyone that received this screamed after they put it on . Talk about happy campers . This stuff is great ! ! !	1
This is the first fragrance by Prada that I love , I think its perfect and I cant wait to see it in a gift set .	1
So I got this about a month ago . I had no plans of buying anything that day , but I ended up getting it . I absolutely love Prada Candy , I have worn it everyday since I bought it- I practically ditched all my other fragrances ! ! ! It is a far cry from the Prada infusion d'Iris ... and all the other Prada fragrances . They got it right this time ... .. Like everyone has said , it 's a warm and sweet smell but it does n't last long ... I practically douse myself in it ! ! I guess the only solution is to spritz this over and over ( rather cumbersome ! ! I know , but hey , no other solution in sight ) , or better-still layer it if they decide to introduce its body lotion or body cream into the market . One other thing that I wish they 'd change is the spritzer thingy ( I do n't know what it 's called ) - it 's not very reliable in my opinion as you could easily pull it off in trying to figure out how it 's used . Otherwise , it 's a great fragrance and I love it .	1
This product has a very fruity scent which is great for the spring . I love it . I will be switching to this product this coming spring .	1
I 'm very picky when it comes to fragrance . I love to wear it , but I do n't want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug . My fragrance needs to be subtle.I sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now , BRIGHT CRYSTAL is what I put on each morning.BRIGHT CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden 's aroma in your direction.I put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.I ca n't fully describe a fragrance without including a very important aspect of the product -- the bottle . BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut & # 8220 ; crystal & # 8221 ; stopper . It looks nice on the counter.If you enjoy a light floral scent , I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace .	1
Got this product and I never heard of this so I took a chance and when I got it I fell head over heels for this new smell I wo n't let anybody use this perfume but me sounds selfish but its my favorite now so thanks for selling a wonderful perfume I will be stocking up on this product	1
This is a beautiful perfume ! Nice , clean scent ! Perfect for day or night and never gets old . I ordered this perfume ( and this was the best price offered ) , and it came with a lotion too ! That was a nice unexpected surprise ! : )	1
This is the real Versace Bright Crystal fragrance . My bottle was not open , tampered with , or have a strong alcohol smell . I love how clean this perfume smells . I tried it out at Macy 's . I wanted to try a fendi scent , but the salesman asked me to try Bright Crystal and another Versace scent . I smelled the other first and then Bright Crystal . I was instantly sold on the Bright Crystal . I sprayed it on myself and then came straight to amazon to get it at a fraction of the price . The bottle is huge ! I 'll be wearing this everyday to the office , I 'm sure I 'll receive tons of compliments . Because the scent is not overpowering and very clean , I do n't have to worry about it being too loud in an office setting . Thanks amazon !	1
This is a very unique scent ! It 's deep and mysterious and light and floral at the same time . The deep purple bottle is so fitting for the scent- it 's dusky , smoky ( it does n't smell like smoke , but it gives off that vibe ) , with a hint of feminine innocence . This is a hard scent to describe , one that invokes images rather than particular notes . I 've not smelled anything like this anywhere else .	1
Sorry about the title . . . I could n't help myself . . . . Anyways , Let me begin by saying there are few things more subjective than a fragrance , especially a woman 's fragrance . I 'm a woman ( and proud ) and I know how finicky we can be . But that 's besides the point , let 's focus on Stella.Instead of expressing a biased opinion I 'm going take a objective POV . I 'm going to explain the ingredients . . .Yes you heard me . .the ingredients . . .Sure . .The /are/ listed here , but do you really know what they are . . .I 'm not going to explain them all , but hopefully enough to help you understand the science of the scent as well as the actually scent itself . H'okay , here we go ! *Centaurea Cyanus = the common Cornflower aka `` bluebottle '' aka the Buttonierre Flower*Squalene ( which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark { most likely its just synthetically created now } ) = a natural moisturizer . It penetrates the skin quickly , but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling ( not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins ) *Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs ( aka the flowers ) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent . *Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka `` Sweet Almond '' ( think Amaretto ) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance ( durrr ) *Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . . *Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It 's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils ( I 'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . ) *Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . . *As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a `` skin protectant '' whatever that means . . . . *Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly , it 's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil ( some scientists even claim it 's superior to whale oil ) *Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin : - ) *shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . . *Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer ( makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever is n't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . . *Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander . it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . . *rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon ; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I 'd say it 's of moderate strength , it lasts around 8 hours or so , it 's a casual scent . .not to fancy , but definitely far from plain ; and I 'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent . It takes a mature nose to adjust to the kalaedoscope ( sp ? ) of smells that is STELLA .	1
Love the way this parfum smells . It is the best and this is the best deal on amazon . This is the only place I will buy parfume from .	1
My hair is fine like a baby 's and rather thin . This conditioner gives it fullness and thickness I 've never had before . I will be buying more.Update 4/17/14 : I was about to purchase another bottle of this for someone else and noticed the price has more than doubled since I first purchased it a month or two ago . I will NOT be buying more , and I 'm outraged ! It 's good , but NOT worth $ 20+ !	1
Another great product . Just love this Biotin B-complex thickening conditioner . It really helps the hair to look fuller and to grow .	1
best conditioner ever- better than most shampoos and conditioners ( salon brand included ) out there in the market . Love the aveda-ish ajurvedic smell . Highly recommended .	1
So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now . I have seen a pretty good result . My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger . I notice less hair falling out . I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both , but improvement is there . My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft . In conclusion , if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin .	1
I have changed an earlier review on this product . My fault , I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing . 160 reviews later I get it . It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month . V shaped hairline . Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through , usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo . The Shampoo is harsh but effective . It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart . When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced ( seeing your scalp through the hair ) . Also , my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking ( messy and pushed up in the front ) .Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two . I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair . This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste . The appearance of thickness is all I really care about . I know i 'll go bald eventually which is why i 'm putting the work in the gym now . You have to be in shape if you 're bald : )	1
With the inevitable hormonal changes , my hair started falling out ... . A LOT . This line of shampoo and conditioner was one of the ways I began to tackle this problem.I really , really , really like everything about it ... the no chemicals , the smell , the texture , the price , oh and IT WORKS ! I highly recommend .	1
6/8/2013 , first review : I thought to review this product as time goes on . I 've only been using it for a week , so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point . It 's good to note that I 'm 42 years old , w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I 'm not using it carelessly . The smell is not flowery & fun , but it 's more medicinal in scent , not overpowering . The shampoo lathers if you work at it , & it 's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one . I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair . If scrub too hard , I 'll lose MORE HAIR . : ( I am washing my hair every day , where I used to wash every other day . The conditioner does not lather . It 's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair . My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I 'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me , but after styling , it 's actually soft , manageable , not weighty ! After washing , I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes , apply FINESSE styling mousse , let my brown curls air dry . Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days , not . With the thick feel in the shower , I am surprised that it 's not weighted down after styling . SO , I 'll keep on trying this for 3 months . I 'll try to remember to update if I see a difference . Feel free to ask me questions . **IT 'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER , I 'M TAKING , MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS . My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp , cond AND supplements . I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3 . ( As per Dr ) . **6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth , I 've noticed that I 'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style ! It 's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial . 19 days in , w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair , my hair is smoother , softer , shinier stronger , does n't have a bad smell , still not weighty & continues to be manageable . I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out . My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe , just maybe , I 'll see some new sprouts . A girl can dream . : ) 6/30/2013 - Could it be ? New hair ? Will keep you posted . I see three short hairs poking through ! I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever , and I have to shave , ( legs , underarms ) , more frequently ! I suspect this would be from the internal good I 'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES ! Still losing less hair , AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots . My nails , which I keep short , need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks ! I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week , about how shiny & healthy ; it looks ! I remain faithful to the products , using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE . It seems that with months of use , this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp , BUT it is drying out my hair . I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner . It 's stripping the oils from my hair . I will still use the shampoo and conditioner , but may just use it once a week . WIll keep updating . I did notice that for the past two weeks , when I use the products , my scalp gets just a little itchy . That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up ! That is the good part ! SO , I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends , but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner .	1
I bought this along with the shampoo because my previous shampoo was making my hair fall . After some months of usage I ca n't say for sure if it thickened my hair but at least it helped stop the loss . It leaves my hair very manageable as well . This conditioner is very thick and it did n't take a lot to detangle my hair . Will buy again .	1
I love it . Will buy again ! although it is a bit drying . it might not be a good everyday use .	1
I got this conditioner to go with the shampoo they make . I do like the fragrance . Fresh . This conditioner does not make my hair smooth enough to get my tangle out . I use it first and then use a bit of my usual conditioner so that I am not tearing out my highlights after washing . I did notice a bit of thickening of my hair shafts . My hair did seem a bit fuller .	1
I ca n't say that I noticed any difference with thickening between this conditioner and any other that I used , but it 's a good conditioner . It has a good texture and consistency and does moisturize and make the hair feel stronger . However , I ca n't say that I noticed any thickening . My four stars is based solely on the fact that it 's a good conditioner and not that it created extra thickness .	1
This is a nice finishing touch to your bath . I think it leaves my hair feeling fresh and clean . I still have n't noticed the thickening effect it promises but I think I still can wait a month more for it .	1
We had a bunch of bottles that were always being knocked over . It was also annoying to move them all for cleaning under . Now we just have this mounted on the shower stall wall . It is easy to keep clean and operates well . The only difficult thing is that you have to pour products from one container to another , an extra chore , but worth it to me .	1
Works great . Wish it had 6dispensers then I and my hubbycould use it with all our products.Probably will just add the 2 chamberone also . We stuck this one on withthe enclosed caulk and left it 24hours before filling . Stuck on great.I put soap , lotion , shampoo , andconditioner in . It primed easy , and isa solid piece ... and I 'm picky ... .Great ! !	1
I bought this for my husband 's bathroom and he just loved it . Less shampoo bottles in his way , get the right amount of shampoo all the time ... Now we 'll get another one for our boat . Very practical . Excelent !	1
No more bottles all around the bathtub , on bath supports , etc . Great idea . Easy to refill , sturdy enough to hold the amount of liquid . I recommend it . It is important that you glue it on a perfectly dry surface , and wait for 24 hrs before you fill the containers .	1
I put in my sons bathroom & he 's as picky as me . This does n't leak out all over the tub like I thought it would . I just knew when I hung it & went to clean his bathroom , there would be residue from whatever was coming out of this dripping on to the tub underneath it . I am happy to say , there is NONE ! Easy to install & this thing is n't moving , installed with silicone which I love . Easy to refill as well . A+ for this little mechanism !	1
Bought this because my shower was getting cluttered with different kind of soap , shampoo , face wash and etc . After receiving this and putting it up on my shower wall , no more bottles ! Pros : Each bottle holds a lot of liquid.Each to use buttons.Clean design.Comes with waterproof adhesive and it 's stick as hell.Durable - I 've dropped the bottles over and over again when I was clumsily trying to shampoo inside and it still works.Cons : The adhesive stinks when you first place it on but that 's a given and does not take away rating for this product .	1
I bought 2 of these in October 2011 and they are still working perfectly . When I have a need for another one , I naturally come back to the same brand , same style - the Classic - and ship and sold by amazon.I like the fact that when I need to refill , I can take each container out individually , plus the fact that there is one cover on the outside making it easy to keep it clean.Some other dispensers have 2 or 3 chambers and the chambers are all in one piece . http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD3T2U/ref=wms_ohs_product ? ie=UTF8 & psc ; =1You have to slide the whole thing out even if you only need to fill one chamber when others are still full . In addition , the others not having a one-piece cover on the outside , water tends to get inside the chamber holding mechanism and mold can develop inside that you ca n't see without taking the chambers out . I have a couple of those that came with a house I bought . This also reinforces my decision in going back to the 4-chamber Classic one .	1
If you share your shower with a spouse and of course do not use the same products there is n't a cleaner looking way to unclutter the look .	1
Works as said . Bought to replace one we had used in our trailer . This was about the same so had no trouble	1
I have a disability which causes me to drop things often . I wanted to get rid of all the bottles and tubes in my tub as they were forever landing by my feet causing a risk for me to fall . This unit is superb . It was easy to install if you follow the clear instructions . Once up it takes 24 hours for the glue to cure and then you can fill the pumps . The bottles are quite large so you do not have to refill to often . Included in the package are labels so you can choose which pump goes for shampoo or shower gel or soap . I do not use conditioner so I used 3 pumps for shower gels and 1 for my shampoo . The products flow freely once you prime the pumps and so far there has not been a problem in pumping out generous amounts of gel and shampoo . It looks neat and clean in the tub and shower . It can be removed safely by sliding a knife down the back of the unit to disengage the silicone glue strips . It does not come with extra glue so if you were to move it you would have to purchase some silicone glue and about 4 contact strips which can easily be obtained in any store with hardware . I recommend this product highly .	1
I bought this because I was sick of tripping over all the different shampoos and conditioners that I like to trade off and on with . I like being able to switch back and forth , but hated having to pick which ones would be the `` lucky '' shower versions , and which would be put under the sink . It always turned out I 'd have way too many bottles in the shower and then I found this ! What a perfect solution . Not only does it store all of what I 'm using , but if you 're one of those parents who always find yourself saying to your children , `` What are you doing ... . DRINKING THE SHAMPOO ? ? ? `` .It dispenses the perfect amount , and though I paid twice this much somewhere else , I 'd do it again in a heart beat.Its neat , its compact , and it works perfectly . I 'm frankly thinking of giving it as a gift for those up and coming events that I 'm not sure what they need or want.Update : I 've had this for a few months now , and the savings in shampoo has more than paid for it . It dispenses just the right amount , and results in big savings .	1
I have the smallest bathroom known to man . It 's so nice not to have shampoo , conditioner , and body wash bottles sitting around the tub . This dispenser was super easy to assemble , and the chambers never clog up . I 've had to refill a couple of the containers , and pulling out the chambers is very easy . I love this thing ; it looks nice , too . Plus the chambers are a good size , so I do n't have to be constantly refilling them .	1
I love this thing . It 's not very fancy looking but it works very well . It reduces clutter in the shower , minimizes wasting your products , it 's super easy to install and easy to refill . I 'm buying one for the guest bathroom as well	1
I love it . It really makes shower area organized and neat . For those of us who like to try new products specially shampoo and face wash and get disappointed after trying and do n't know what to do use it as a body wash . Yes you heard me I have pour all my left over shampoos and face washes in one of the dispenser and used it up all . Very functional and easy to put to gather .	1
I got this for our shower since we do not have space for a shelf . It is great ! We decided to dilute the conditioner a little to ensure it flowed easily through the dispenser , which worked great , but we also did not try it without diluting so who knows - might work well that way as well.High quality item .	1
I installed this thing about a week ago . Overall , very positive . I have a variety of liquids in it , and two are actually very thick . I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going , so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly , without any issues . As far as mounting goes , the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless , only got a little bit out . Luckily , I had a tube of rubber adhesive ( similar to the silicon , but a bit thinner ) , which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall . It is on there solid , and not going anywhere . I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product ( aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products . Guaranteed Not to Fog , Designed Not to Fall . 20 % Larger Than Our # 1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon ) and it works equally well . Of course they have not been time-tested , but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups . In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes , I ca n't help ya there , but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile . If I have to take these down at some point , it will probably be just to replace them . I am not renting , so I do n't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true . I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle . A few pumps get you going , then an occasional pump to keep the lather going . It 's much easier to control , because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser , but I want to emphasize , it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps -- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic , which I am sure will discolor over time , as does almost all white plastic -- but that is just a guess , and I do n't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue ( and if I did n't have any lying around the house , and had to order some more and wait on it , I might have been irritated enough to bump another star -- but that would be unfortunate , because it really is a great product , even if you need to order your own adhesive ) .Conclusion : highly recommend , no reservations !	1
I had this at a previous home and could n't take it with me due to the silicon adhesive which makes it very difficult to remove . I left it with the home and had to purchase another because i liked it so much . The adhesive is a definite advantage over double stick tape or other ways to affix things in the shower because it will never fall off despite the steam and condensation from normal shower climates .	1
This attaches with silicon glue-stuff , not with suction cups like it 's brother with the built-in shelves . I have both types , and both work great . I guess the suction cups are because the shelf one also has a hook to hang it from the shower head , even though I do n't use that part of it.But as far as the quality of this unit for the $ 27 I paid : top notch .	1
This is a must have for all bathrooms . When i moved into my new house , i had one of these already there in the bathroom . I liked it so much i decided to buy another one for my second bathroom . I did n't think i could find the exact one but i was wrong . Amazon has everything.The quality is great , the dispensers work flawlessly and attaching it to the wall is very easy . Inside the dispenser there is two good size containers . It comes with all sorts of stickers : shampoo , soap , conditionar , lotion , etc . IT is very handy . Its annoying to squeeze shampoo and conditionar from a bottle .	1
I think that the organizational system behind this is great - the bottles are reasonably easy to load and prime , the little windows let you know when you 're running low on anything . There are several different labels included in the package , including a blank one , in case you want to fill it with lotion instead of body wash , or whatever.The mirror is rather small , but useful for checking your brows or , if you 're a dude , your facial-shave job . It does n't steam up , there may be a coating ? Or I 'm just getting lucky : ) The flat shelf are on the top is useful for holding your razor , while the many hooks on the bottom help organize the scrubbies and loofas that seem to overwhelm the bathroom shelves normally.My only wish is that it 's just a bit smaller , as the whole thing is maybe 14-18 inches across , which is a lot of visual space !	1
this is good as we have one is our trailer and so we are able to take the ones from there and place in this for winter storage .	1
So I love this product , but I have one complaint . Everything falls off the top rack onto my head . We used a level , and we know this is even , but this still happens . Love the mirror , and now I ca n't live without the shower mirror . I loved using this to clean up the shower .	1
Easy to set up . Just make sure to absolutely wait a whole day after you apply the silicone . It 's extremely important . The only thing is that it could n't dispense a very creaming expensive conditioner . So I had to dilute it with water to work . Which I did n't like doing..otherwise , this was perfect . But the mirror still fogged . Lol..	1
I have this in our guest bathroom shower and it is perfect . The bottles hold only about 2/3 of the full size one I have in our master bath , but that is fine since the occasional use it gets does n't facilitate a lot of refilling . I loath those wire shelving units for showers so I was so excited to find this and have everything off the floor and kept together for easy use in such a tidy little package.This comes with the silicone adhesive AND a few squares of adhesive foam backing , the idea is you spread the silicone on and the adhesive foam squares hold it in place while it dries . You have to wait 24 hours before filling the bottles to allow the silicone glue to cure . I have one of these in my master bath for 3 years without budging so it is a very strong hold .	1
Wonderful product . Paired with a little exfoliation my hands look soft and pretty . My knuckles were my problem area and it looks 100 % better .	1
Just a fantastic cream and value . A little goes a long way , and it does n't leave a sticky or greasy film . Just the right size to leave at the office as well or in my purse .	1
I have used several Crabtree and Evelyn hand creams and this is probably my least favorite because of the scent . As a moisturizer it works great , especially around the nails and fingertips where my hands get dry and crack . The hand therapy goes on very smooth and non greasy but the scent is very strong and spicy , it reminds me of a man 's cologne or aftershave .	1
This is one of my favorites ! So glad I took a chance and bought this scent : ) I only wish the tube lasted longer ! It is such a great , clean scent-not overpowering and the staying power on your hands is amazing-your hands ( feet too ! ) really feel wonderful after lotion is applied !	1
I bought this because I identify with what happens to gardeners ' hands . I love the way it goes on , but I am not very happy with the scent ; and the tube does not stand up , so I have to keep it in its box in order to keep it standing in the place I keep this sort of thing . But I DO like the way my hands feel .	1
I love Crabtree & Evelyn . It really does wonders in keeping your hands moisturized . It smells fantastic as well . The aluminum bottle helps protect the lotion from damage from the heat or the sun 's rays . The small compact size makes it portable .	1
I 've been using this creme for about 20 years now . It 's amazing stuff . It 's gotten my hands and forearms ( and feet sometimes ) through 84 rose bushes , countless tree prunings , landscape rehabbing , etc . I have found that even with cuts and scratches , this lotion never stings . All the herbs probably have an antiseptic effect on injuries , but who knows.The scent is wonderful too , at least I think so . Quite unique and natural , but not overpowering.Since the creme is very concentrated , I DO recommend letting it soak in well before you go driving or touching door knobs , etc . A little goes a LONG way ! :0So glad they keep making this great product ! PJ	1
Absorbs immediately , completely non-greasy after a couple seconds . Very impressive ! And smells nice ! Wish there was more inside the tube !	1
I bought this based on other reviews . It smells great and feels great . I out it in every night before bedtime . However , my hands are dry when i wake up . Will not buy again , but works well enough to finish the tube . Maybe i am supoosed to usemore frequently ?	1
I have dry hands , as my job requires me to wash them very often . I have very sensitive skin/allergies , and tend to avoid anything with strong fragrances . This is my favorite moisturizer ; it has a definite scent , but it 's not floral or cloying at all . Most importantly , this rubs right in and leaves hands moisturized without any stickiness .	1
This hand cream has one of the nicest fragrances I 've ever come across and it seems to be one that everybody likes . The cream is non greasy and absorbs quickly but leaves your hands feeling soft and moisturized . This is the of those products I buy over and over again and have for several years . It also makes a nice gift in a basket with a pair ofAngela 's Garden 7120-921 Kids Garden Glove , Honey Bee , a hand gardening tool and a couple packets of seeds . The people I have given it to tell me that it 's become one of their favorites too . Everyone seems to like it 's nice clean smell .	1
I first purchased this hand treatment from a garden center - what a favorite it has become . I really does help restore your hands after digging in the garden ( or washing dishes in the sink , if you 're old-fashioned like me ) . I have purchased many as gifts for others . This size ( 100g ) is a generous tube and will last a long time . I gave it four stars only because it is more expensive here than at the Crabtree & Evelyn outlet store - or maybe I just got lucky when I visited that store last time . Truth is , I 'll buy it wherever I can find it .	1
Best hand cream I 've ever used , and I NEVER use hand cream . This year , I got a puppy and with it comes a lot of mess and handwashing . Top if off with my working in the food industry + new York winters and you 've got dry , painful hands . I tried many MANY different creams at a drug store one day - 2 hours worth of searching from the least to most expensive creams lead me to this one . It has a light leather smell , so definitely good for men also ( I like the smell of leather , so Im a big fan , even as a lady ) . I put it on after Ive washed my hands and it is thick , rich , and I enjoy massaging it into my knuckles . Once it 's on , it doenst leave a sticky or greasy film , just lovely moisture and no dryess . I have a mini tube in my handbag , large pump at the office , an 1in my home . I like the stuff to say the least !	1
This cream has wax in it , great for the nails , and really makes your skin look years younger ! I use it at night	1
I 've used the Gardener 's Hand Therapy for many years , but always in that metal tube . This pump is so much more convenient ! Lasts a long time and is the same , rich creme you expect from this line .	1
Crabtree & Evelyn Gardener 's Hand Therapy has been my favorite lotion for many years . While I do n't have a problem with very dry skin , I still like a good , non-greasy lotion for my hands , arms , feet , and sometimes even my face . This product is not greasy . It does not have an annoying fragrance , actually not much at all . My sister-in-law told me she uses it on her psoriasis and it helps . It 's not a cure , of course . There really is n't one . But it helps the skin feel better . Since she liked it so much , I tried it and have been using it ever since . It 's hard to find in stores -- -almost impossible -- -but Amazon.com carries it . Thanks again , Amazon .	1
My son used some of this hand cream when I had it and is now a daily user and fan . I bought him some as a surprise . He has very dry and chapped hands . This cream or lotion seems to work and does not leave that greasy feel or smell to sweet . Good stuff !	1
Now that the seasons are changing my hands are getting dry , dry , dry , just like they always do . Nothing beats Crabtree & Evelyn 's hand creams for dry hands . This was at a GREAT price too . It arrived as expected in perfect , new condition . If you have dry hands I highly recommend you try one of C & E 's hand creams .	1
I love that it has more heat settings than a lot of other curling irons , because let 's face it , no two girls have the same texture of hair . I typically use a medium setting . It 's important for my curls to last all night because I 'm a professional wingwoman by trade and my profitability is based upon my appearance . I 've had good luck with this curling iron .	1
I do n't curl my hair every day so I did n't need to get a high-end curler . I dropped my old curling iron ( 10+ years old ) and had to buy one from an all-night pharmacy . I paid twice as much as the Amazon price but was very happy with the curling iron . What a surprise to save 50 % thru Amazon for the exact same product . Now I have one tucked into my overnight bag for visits to the grandkids.The iron does everything I need it to do . Heats quickly , evenly , and has an automatic turn-off . The barrel is the perfect width ( you 'd be surprised how much this can vary . ) It feels great in my hand without being cumbersome .	1
I bought the biggest size of this curling just great but I want to say that works well with med_long hair as my hair .	1
I did n't expect too much when I purchased this Conair curling iron . It is quite inexpensive , about $ 7 when I bought it . There is nothing incredibly special about it . But it is a decent curling iron . It is available in three barrel sized , 1/2 & # 34 ; , 3/4 & # 34 ; ( which is what I bought , and 1 & # 34 ; .This is the traditional design , with a heating barrel and piece that opens and & # 34 ; clamps & # 34 ; against the barrel with a thumb lever . Our family prefers this to the newer heating wands that have no clamp and come with a heat-resistant glove . We find those tend to be awkward , as you need two hands to manipulate the iron and your hair , as opposed to this design where you have one hand free for a brush , but still can use the clamp to curl your hair.The iron features a black tip at the end of the chrome barrel . The tip does not get very hot at all.Heating is very quick , about a minute , and it has a simple rotary knob built into the handle to adjust the heat . The controls are near where some people may hold the barrel , so you could accidentally touch them , but I think the barrel design makes it simple enough to avoid that ( the rotary switch is on a thicker barrel part , adjacent to the heating iron . The switch has 25 power levels , as well as an On/Off switch and indicator , and a & # 34 ; Turbo Heat & # 34 ; button and indicator.There is a small metal rest at the bottom of the barrel to help keep the hot barrel off surfaces when you place it down.The 5 ' cord is designed to swivel to minimize tangles.Conair backs the curling iron with a 2 year warranty .	1
The 1/2 & # 34 ; barrel is perfect for styling short hair . I also like the quick-heating features . Small circumference curing irons are hard to find , and the fact that it was available so readily on Amazon was a major plus - no telephoning around or driving from place to place to determine it 's availability . Because of Amazon 's Prime Membership , it was delivered within 24 hours .	1
This came quick and packaged just like I bought it in the store.Everything seems fine with it and I like that it has the turbo heat button . Great curling iron for the price .	1
The iron heats up quickly and seems to be good quality . The buttons are well built , easy to understand and use.Like any curling iron , it does take quite a while to cool down , which is frustrating , but true with any product like this one.The cord is probably about 6 feet , which is a nice length to work with . The cord is a little stiff , so it has curled a little too much now that it has been stretched a lot.Overall good product for the price .	1
This curling iron works so well and I 'm so glad I bought it . It 's almost identical to a similar one I 'd had for a few years that suddenly stopped . It 's so hard to find this size but , once again , Amazon came through . Heats quickly , cord is a perfect length and does n't tangle . If you are looking for this size , do n't waste your time looking around . This is the one you want .	1
I am the kind of person who will splurge on cosmetics and beauty products and feel it 's worth it so I do n't necessarily look for the bargain buy in this area but the best working product.Fortunately , this curling iron is not only priced well for the value , it beats out the `` old school '' curling irons I 've used for the last 30 years.I actually bought mine at Walgreens for a higher price after reading about it in a magazine.Unlike any other iron I 've used this one actually heats up in ... wait for it ... .wait for it ... .30 SECONDS ! ! ! You can also choose your heat level from 1-15 but be leary of that 15 -- -that is a scorcher.However , some may be looking for that high of a heat . I keep it around the medium to medium high numbers and it curls in an instant . And I have uber thick hair.Touch ups are instant rather than waiting for the iron to heat up . If I am going out and find I 've missed a spot I can basically now instantly reheat the iron and have it hot 30 seconds after I turn it on.Negative : I 'm probaby odd in that I always hold my curling iron real close to the barrel . Because of this a few times I 've accidentally turned the heat level without trying . Not a big deal , but something I 'd change if I could to make the wheel maybe a little harder to turn.Conclusion : tops in my book . I wo n't go back to the curling irons of the past where I have to wait for them to heat . Instant gratification , baby ! : - )	1
So in love with my conair curling iron . I have been using this everyday since I bought this . I have never had a curling iron with a clip , so I was wanting to try it . It heats up quick . I think the buttons are perfect , I have not hit them once while using the tool . Curling iron came in super fast , came in2 days before shipment date ! It did take me some practice to use this . After the third time , I finally got use to it . Overall this product is fabulous . I recommend this if you want a curling iron easy to use , something that heats up quick , shipment comes in super quick , and for a great deal ! P.S If you are interested in this product , but unsure how to use it ; go on youTube and look up & # 34 ; How to curl hair with conair curling iron & # 34 ; . You can look up different styles as well . It helped me choose this curling iron . : )	1
My hair is very layered , so wanted this to do the longer strands . I have a smaller one for the top of my hair style . It heats quickly , love the different heat settings . Feels very comfortable in my arthritic hands .	1
I bought 2 of these conair instant heat curling irons and I love them both . I got one in 1 inch and another in 3/4 inch . The iron does have ajustable heating temperature from 1-25 and fast turbo heating . They heated up nice and hot really fast . They made shiny lovely bouncy curls in my hair . The iron has weight to it and not flimsy at all . This iron is affordable and gets the job done so I highly recommend it .	1
Wanted a curling iron with all the features offered by this one . Am very pleased with it and would buy another .	1
This is my first curling iron . I was so confused when I chose this since the price is kinda inexpensive . I could choose something more expensive and popular like Hot Tools brand but I was not very sure with the ideal that I would curl my hair often or even if I could curl it ( lol ) but this one works great ( for me ) . It gets hot pretty quickly and does n't take long to curl my hair . I like it , and I believe it 's good buy . I read some comment said it does n't last & # 34 ; too & # 34 ; long or something but I do n't really mind . For the price , just ca n't beat it or at least give it a try ! ! !	1
True to its name , this curling iron heats up fast ( literally 1-2 minutes ) , and a blinking light turns solid when it 's at temperature and ready to use . It gets extremely hot -- settings range from 1 to 25 and even a `` 5 '' is too hot to touch ; I 've used it at `` 13 '' for several months now with great results . Its clamp holds hair securely but does n't snag hairs in the hinge . A sturdy wire foot and a plastic tip keep the hot barrel off the countertop . It has an on/off button and will automatically turn itself off ( but not until it 's left untouched for about an hour ) . The iron cools in the usual amount of time ( touchable in 5-10 minutes , completely cool in 15+ minutes ) .I mostly use the 3/4-inch model -- but , with my very short hair , I also use the1/2-inch modelduring the first week or so after I 've had a haircut . Highly recommended -- they 're the best curling irons I 've ever used .	1
There 's nothing like a Conair Curling Iron ! I love the instant heat feature . It gets good and hot , not mediocre . It shuts off automatically for those people who tend to forget that they left their iron on ( I 'm not one of them but I still appreciate this feature ) . The variable settings are a nice feature to have as well !	1
I ordered two of these , in different sizes , because the price was great.I have very long thick hair . I use this on the med/highend of the temp range . I brush , spray section lightly with hair spray , start winding near the top of my hair , squeeze the release and curl down the section , ( youtube has instructional videos that are great ) I release curl into my hand then spray again.It takes	1
This 1 '' curling iron works great so far ! No complaints . The one thing i would change though , is the iron part could be a little bit longer . I have really long ( a little above my butt ) hair and it 'fills up ' the space on the iron .	1
Heats fast . curls well , and does n't grab or snag my hair . I like the circular dial design of the heat control . The only thing to keep in mind is the little metal kick stand heats up along with the iron , so if you plan to move it out of the way to curl your hair , be careful !	1
I was pleasantly surprised . The Iron curled the hair very nicely and the price is unbeatable . I got it here for 10 $ and in stores , it 's like 16 $ .	1
My hair is super straight and thin . It also does n't take heat very well . What 's so great about this curler is the adjustable heat settings . 7 works great for me and I just hold it there for ten seconds . Not only that but the curls actually stay . Most times , they go wavy after the first 30 minutes , no matter how long I hold it on for . But with this it lasted me two hours . I 'm so impressed and especially for the price . You can not beat that .	1
This is perfect . It gets really hot and keeps the curl . It cam e really fast as well . I would say get one	1
I wish I had gotten a 1 1/2 & # 34 ; iron because I do love this iron , but I like larger barrels .	1
Bought this for my niece , I have n't heard anything negative about this item , so I guess it is working well .	1
My wife really likes conair . She had a smaller one ( i believe a 1/3 or 3/4 inch curler ) that has lasted years and years so we hope the same for this model .	1
I 'm a disabled person and have to have someone else do my hair for me . As i would really like to be able to do it myself , I find it disturbing that some helpers have no idea how to use this . So que sera , sera . What can I do , but hope someone will know .	1
Tried it on my granddaughter to test it out and it works fine . I need to wait until my hair grows out a bit to use it . Think it 's easier to use on long hair .	1
I needed a 1/2 inch curling iron and this one works just fine for my needs . I have one of the same model in the one inch and I liked it , so ordered the same model in the smaller size . I like that it turns itself off after a certain period of time because I often forget to do so . I also like that you can adjust the heat or strength of curl . I have had many Conair products over the years and have been satisfied with all of them .	1
I really enjoy this curling iron , it is really fast to use and my curls stay all day . I have to mention that my hair is not curly , but not straight , still pretty easy to shape . The curler is really easy to use , heats up quickly and it was only 10 dollars . I would definitely buy this again .	1
Great curling iron ! It heats up very fast and can heat up very hot . You ca n't beat it for the price.Wish the cord was a little longer but that 's easily fixed with an extension cord.Just as good if not better then the expensive one I previously had .	1
It does it 's job , heats up quickly , and creates beautiful curls/waves . Definitely recommend it , especially given its wonderful price . I have average hair and use the iron at heat setting 17 .	1
Instant Heat Curling Iron , 1 1/2-Inch it work	1
This product deserves 5 stars ! It curls my hair perfectly and you can set the temperature of heat that you want.It gives nice curls = ]	1
This is the first curling iron i ever used.. and i am not planning to purchase anything else.I had a problem with the Auto on/off button at the beginning since my hand kept on pushing it by mistake , but now that i know the proper way of holding it it does n't bother me much.i use a heat protectant so i did n't notice any damage to my hair , on the contrary , my curls ended up being soft and shiny !	1
~A great deal and super fast shipping . It 's amazing how fast it heats up . And it gets very hot on high .	1
This is a nice curling iron . It has different settings but I only use one or two . It works great . Nice choice .	1
its easy to use , the waves last all day , very good quality for the price , i really recomend this curling iron	1
I got this thinking it would make large curls , but my hair is too long and straight for any curls this iron produces , to stay . I should have remembered that large curls just do n't stay like small ones on my hair type . BUT I got something even better that I was n't expecting ... . I use large hot rollers to sometimes add body to my hair and give it a slight wave . That is what this curler does for me now . I love it .	1
This is a great price for a great curling iron . The cord is nice and long , there are several heating settings , and it heats up faster than you can pick it up off the counter ( okay not that fast , but you wo n't even feel like you had to wait for it ) . It gets the job done , and I honestly do n't see why most people would need anything fancier .	1
I have long hair & I curl the ends everyday for work . This curling iron is the perfect size & price !	1
Okay , I 'll admit that I 'm not extremely good at curling my hair for some reason . I ca n't tell if it 's just lack of talent on my part , or if my hair just wo n't have any of it . Anyway , with this curling iron my hair actually holds a curl , and holds it well . They do n't look perfect - which may be my fault - but I 've tried a few curling irons and so far I 've seen the best result come from this one .	1
Great standard beauty product that you ca n't beat ! This is one product to order while the new ones fall by the wayside .	1
i orderd 4 at first , then i think few more , Did you know.. im 60 years old & been wearing these from day one ? YEP ! ! ! ! ! they stayed on getting me threw a divorce crying , there Water proof for sure LOLThese are the best.i ca n't remember the year they came out , but i tell ya , i was almost the first one to try it out & loved it & nothing eles since then ! ! i suppose theres others out there , but AGAIN , have to look & buy & try it out GrrrrThese Im buying should last Ummmm Hopefully a year ? kinda doubt it as i wear make up every single day , i have to fill in my brows as i used to shave them years ago haaathey do n't look to bad now , LOLits just im used to USING Eye liners for a great Look ! ! Why in the world r they leaving ?	1
Even though I brought this in Medium Brown , it has such a fine point that I can use it with my ( somewhat gray ; I 'm 68 ) eyebrows . I do n't use eyeliner ( I use fancy eyelid gel makeup ) , but I have used pencil eyeliner in the past and this is one of the best on the market !	1
I got he right color and can just use it when im in a hurry instead of doing the full process my make up routine .	1
I ca n't find this in the stores . My skin is so fair , I use white for conceler and highlights . This is perfect	1
This product met my needs for Upper Lip shadow . I found it to be non oily , easy to smooth over skin and light on skin . You will need to use a press power for your skin tone after applying the concealer . Very please with the results .	1
I have tried lots of cover/concealer products , some costing 20x ( seriously ) more . I keep coming back to Maybelline cover sticks because they really cover and coneal without settling into wrinkles .	1
I have been using this product for years . It covers under eyes and makes your eyes look a lot bigger . It also is great for covering up little imperfections on your face . I could not live without it ... ..	1
This really does cover under eye circles and redness but a little goes a long way . Since it 's a thick cream stick you should mix in some moisture cream on your hand and smooth it on sparingly . Too much will look cakey and get into wrinkles . Just a very thin layer is best .	1
I use this to cover up my red marks left after minor breakouts . It really does make it possible to cover up the red marks . I have very pale skin , and this green stick works great . Awesome product !	1
I have been using this brand for over 10 years now and consider it a necessary part of my makeup routine . I use it for highlighting my nose bridge , under my eyes to even out the skin color , and around my lips as a base to set liner . I blend it in with a colored liquid foundation and it blends well . The stick holds up for months and months - I usually go through 1 a year .	1
Love this product . Using for several years .	1
this is my second time getting this i use it on my problem areas before i put on my foundation then i put on a different concealer afterwards , very close to my skin tone it is a bit to dark but once i blend it it looks fine . if you have dry skin this will accentuate that area . i used this when i had no primer and when i did have primer . i would say use primer , it will go on smoother and be easier to blend , with out it it did kind of look chalky . if you leave this in the heat it will break ! happened to me with both of mine because my bathroom heater is on 24/7 .	1
I love this product . Have used this for years . Thank you Maybelline . And yes , I have used Maybelline for years .	1
I have had one tube of this for a couple of years now and JUST ran out . I am feeling very yucky without it.I only gave it 4 stars because the consistency could be a SMIDGE more creamy , but it has decent staying power.For those who say that it does n't cover the dark circles under the eyes , you will need to 1st use a concealer that is a shade lighter than your face 's skin color first ( or closer to a salmon color ) and then lightly add this to the top . Watch some videos on YouTube about 'highlighting ' and you will find that this color is perfect for those highlighting areas on top of your base/ foundation and normal concealer.Maybe there are better versions of this in the 'fancier ' brands , but I am returning to buy this one because I know it works and takes off 10 years when used under my eyes .	1
This cover stick is very useful to set the makeup , but does not completely cover blemishes , imperfections understand that it takes another kind and color of concealer according to the problem , but are very good products Maybelline	1
I use it for the red spots and acne on my face and it seems to help . It is cheap and works so I 'm happy with the buy .	1
My Maybelline Coverstick Corrector/Concealer arrived early and in good condition . It is a product I have used before and I am very satisfied with it .	1
I wont get enough of this ! this concealer Works so well for me , it has the right ammount of coverage that I want ( I must say is a m & eacute ; dium coverage ) and doesnt melt in this high humid and hot whether where I live ( North coast of Colombia ) I highly recommend this.. but the only thing is that if you have dry skin , you might want to apply some moisturizing before using it .	1
Excellent cover , I am very happu with this product , it covers perfectly and lasts for almost all day ! I will wait again !	1
At first you think it will feel heavy , but it does n't . I wear this over BB cream every day and it works wonders . It is not full coverage , but not bad for a drug store product . I get mine at stop and shop .	1
I have very rosy and pulpy cheeks that I 'm not a fan of . So I use this concealer everyday with my foundation to cover any redness that I may have . This is my seventh tube . I love it .	1
Sometimes it 's hard to find this kind at the stores , It was much lower priced , and it does give a pretty good coverage .	1
This cover stick lightens under the eyes . it 's not heavy , and it stays on . In the drug stores etc , I ca n't find the right color -- but I found it here . YAY ! What are you waiting for ?	1
I use this under my eyes almost every day under my foundation/ helps to counteract purpley or blue dark circles . thick , pigmented and creamy but still blend-able but not too wet so it does n't blend away , stays where I put it well .	1
AGAIN I FOUND WHAT WAS HARD TO FIND IN A STORE , GREAT PRICE , I HAVE USED THIS COVER STICK SINCE I WAS 18 YOA . WHEN MAX FACTOR WAS AROUND . TRY IT . NO REGRETS	1
This is exactly what I expected . It is always a gamble ordering something like this without seeing it . It is a nice concealer and blends in well when I test it on my hand . I will write more when I actually use it under my eyes .	1
My must have . Great for under eye circles . My top secret weapon that I need to buy every other month at least .	1
I have absolutely horrible dark circles , far beyond the point of being concealed with any type or amount of makeup , but this product significantly reduces their discolored appearance.This looks pretty good and almost unnoticeable once blended out with my ring fingers . However , I really need a primer or something with this or it creases horribly . It feels sort of greasy and heavy when applied , but if you go easy with it and just make it last by spreading and blending , it works . It looks even better if applied under flesh-tone concealer or foundation.My main problem is that the packaging is n't entirely hygienic , at least if you put the stick right on your skin . It could spread bacteria and cause breakouts , so maybe use a small brush or something with it .	1
I think this product works wonders . I 'm 62 and have uh , '' mature '' skin but I 've been using this little yellow stick for over a decade . Covers , is not harsh , eliminate dark circles , can be used as a concealer and brightner . For the money , this ca n't be beat - would n't be without it !	1
I chose this product because is the best for me , there 's nothing I do n't like about this product ; I will recommend this product for goung and middle age ladies out there ... .	1
Oily , and makes makeup slip off without having to apply pressure on the cotton pad . A little goes a long way . Cuts through heavy duty mascara , liner , shadow , you name it ( I 've used it on stubborn lip stains ) . You will have to wipe/clean the oil off your lids and lashes if you want to reapply makeup after using this . If you DO need to reapply after using remover , you should consider a water-based makeup remover that will evaporate so you do n't have to worry about oil residue causing your makeup to slip off . Usually I remove my makeup at the end of the day before bathing and do n't reapply makeup until the next day , so the oil does n't bother me . Will repurchase .	1
Very good makeup remover , I 'd like to use it , not too greasy , but after using the cleansing is very clean .	1
It does n't bother my eyes like other products and it feels good when applying . Good buy . Would recommend to others .	1
This is the best mascara remover I 've ever used . It is easy to use , takes off all eye makeup including waterproof mascara and does not burn my eyes .	1
this gets off those fiber water proof mascaras that you would typically need sand paper to take off . I put it on before I wash my face and it comes right off . I do n't use tissue or cotton to wipe it off because I feel like it will take a lash with it . But that 's just me .	1
I usually use Avon 's make up remover to take off my waterproof mascara and liner , but I find myself unhappy with the results . I was running out of the Avon remover and wanted something different to replace it , so I popped on to Amazon to see what was available . I ended up buying this make up remover based on the price and reviews and I 'm actually really happy with my purchase ! Here are a few things I 've found about this make up remover : *The bottle is about the size of the palm of my hand*Fragrance-free*Great price , especially the subscribe and save*The product is an oil , which can be a little messy*It is very moisturizing , which I love ! *If you plan on putting make up on after using this make sure to get every trace of oil off of your eyelid and eyelashes or your new/fresh make up wo n't stick*I squirt this remover onto a cotton pad or cotton ball and gentle wiggle it back and forth on my eye to remove my liner and mascara , the make up slips off easily . I tightline my eyes so sometimes that liner does n't come off with just wiping the cotton ball downwards , which is why I wiggle the cotton ball around on my eye*After using this product I wash my face normally , and make sure to rinse around my eye area to remove the remaining make up remover*A little goes a long way*Did n't hurt too bad when I accidentally got it in my eye ( I accidentally got Avon 's eye make up remover in my eye and it was awful ) I definitely will be repurchasing this product , it 's wonderful . I 've found my new favorite eye make up remover , sorry Avon !	1
Excellent product . No skin irritation . Easily remove the remains of mask . I highly recommend it . Just saw him I knew it was good buy	1
I have tried others but this is simply the best and removing mascara . It 's great for also removing MAC paint pot base for the eyes ... and for cleaning the brush that comes with it .	1
Works great to get Cover Girl Waterproof Mascara off and to me that is a great accomplishment	1
Works fast no matter what kind of eye makeup you use . Price is good ... .. easy to pack ... . not eye stinging either .	1
A cheap eye makeup remover that works . If you find that your mascara does not go on as well every day , then maybe all the mascara was not removed . This works at night and leaves a little oil around your eyes that washes off without any problems .	1
This is the best I have found to remove waterproof mascara or any kind of mascara for that matter , & I have been using it for years . It just takes a couple drops & lasts forever ( kinda oily & I assume that is why it works so well at removing the mascara & eye makeup ) . The price is a lot cheaper than most brands .	1
PRO : It removes make up wellCON : It feels like baby oil is on my eyelids afterwardsI imagine the oil free version ( looks the same but in a blue bottle ) should be just rightStill alright	1
It can be a little greasy but that does n't bother me since I use a glycolic acid cleanser afterwards.I never have to use a lot to remove my mascara . I feel like with the non-oil based ones I waste so much . This is a good consistent product .	1
If you are looking for a makeup remover that removes waterproof mascara this works great . It is oily so you only need a tiny amount on a cotton ball or pad . After wiping off all the mascara I recommend that you wash your face and areas around your eyes with a liquid soap you 'd use to clean your face normally . Then splash a lot of water around your eyes especially so there is no oily residue left . If you do n't do this the oil can be slightly irritating and may make your eyes feel itchy . So make sure to remove the remover and you should have less problems.~The Rebecca Review	1
Maybelline eye products have a long history of producing excellent eye products . Maybelline mascara has always been a favorite of mine . I highly recommend theMaybelline Expert Eyes Mascara Remover , Moisturizing , 2.3 fl oz ( 68 ml ) . Try it , you will love it . I ordered this product from Amazon , my favorite place to shop !	1
this is the best mascarra remover on the market as far as I am concerned . It immediately removes even water proof mascarra . While it feels really greasy , that is easily removed with a good face wash	1
I get the brown and it always gives me the perfect soft , natural liner . Unlike powders , it gives the definition to make the eyelashes stand out . The liquid blends well with the eyelashes , but dries really fast . It never flakes unlike other liquids . The brush is exceptional ; thin for a good line but large enough to control and leave a mark . You do not need another brush .	1
I use nothing but this eyeliner . It stays on all day . you can apply light or thick . I like a dramatic yet natural look , and this works perfectly .	1
This stays on during those humid summers and I actually snorkeled in the Caribbean , ( with goggles ) and it stayed on perfectly.Is there anything more to say ? The price is amazing and the product does what it is suppose to . No more raccoon eyes , ever !	1
I 'm not really sure what every ones problem of complaining about the brush unless you have no hands or parkinsons and ca n't hold your hand steady its virtually impossible to get this all over your eye . The brush is far shorter than most liquid eyeliner brushes and only one coat is needed . I have n't even used liquid liner in twelve years until the last week and first try made a very even and precise line . I bought this for the waterproof factor and since it is the first liquid eyeliner i ever owned 13 years ago . I also bought e.l.f . brand because it was incredibly cheap . For $ 8.99 at CVS you get 0.25 oz of product compared to almays 0.10 oz for $ 8.49 ( not waterproof ) , CGs 0.08 oz at $ 8.99 ( not waterproof ) , L'oreals 0.08 at $ 9.99 ( not waterproof ) and e.l.f.s 0.10 for $ 3.49- $ 7.99 ( not waterproof ) . For a bargain shopper or even as a spare for those who do n't mind shelling out their life savings got one tenth of an ounce of eyeliner , i would highly recommend this product . For those who have no hand eye coordination or ca n't draw a straight line to save their life I 'd suggest not buying eye liner at all since you guys always blame the product instead of your own inability to properly apply the product . http : //instagram.com/p/qE7J5sQ8PP/ a picture comparing the two products .	1
As long as this eyeliner is applied correctly there should be no peeling , fading or flaking . The only time I get some flaking or peeling is if I apply it too thickly . I put this on early in the morning ( 7am or so ) and do n't take it off until 11 or 12 pm . And in all that time it stayed where I put it and the color stayed true.I have horrible allergies and I also have tear producing issues ... combine these problems and there is really nothing I could wear to line my eyes-until I found Maybelline Lineworks . My eyes can and will at times ooze tears all day.Sometimes it looks as if I 'm having a crying jag . BUT even through all this , my liner never goes anywhere ! I use Ponds to take it off at night . Easy peasy ! The only thing I 'm upset with is that Maybelline seems to be dis-continuing many of the colors and while I can understand it , I do n't LIKE it .	1
Many eyeliners boast that they stay on all day and are waterproof but they are n't . Ultraliner is actually one of the few exceptions . Do n't spend a bunch of money on an eyeliner that promises to be good . Ultraliner is actually great . I 'm not sure what the formula is , but it stays on kind of like a permanent glove . It was even snowing and blowing in my face making my eyes water really bad , but when I looked the eyeliner did not run and was still on . I tried it on my hand and noticed that it dries right away . It dries to a material that can actually kind of be peeled off as needed . If you try to rub it , it wo n't come off . It did not really budge with water either . Amazingly you can still take it off when you are ready . It does not run in your eye and I noticed unlike some eyeliners that get all over your lower lashes causing marks under your eye , Ultra Liner does not do that . I 've had this eyeliner a long time and it still works . You may just want to clean the wand off though to prevent a sticky buildup . I 've had more expensive liners that were just terrible . You can find Ultra Liner mostly any department or pharmacy type store and online here . My only caution is do not confuse the Line Works liner with this - they are not the same and the Line Works is terrible .	1
I tried several brands already , all faking in the afternoon . I have used this for a week . It is `` water/oil proof . '' Great product in an expensive price . Great .	1
I have been using this eyeliner for years and was pleasantly surprised that it is still around . When I use it , I put eyeshadow on first , then line my lids . I have n't had any trouble with it peeling/flaking off . My only complaint is that when I take it off , it does n't want to come off -- even when I use makeup remover . You really have to scrub .	1
This liquid liner is the best liner for a smokey eye . It will give your that sexy kitten eye look .	1
On my oily eyelids ( I know I know , they say I am blessed because oily eyelids = less wrinkles ) , but when one ends up with raccoon eyes over and over after trying gazillion eyeliners , one tends to forget the blessings.Glad to have found it on Amazon , because all the local drug stores ( no matter whether in CA or OR , where I spend most of my time ) seem to run out of this particular product first ! Women must know and appreciate this wonderful eyeliner and snatch it right when it is delivered to the stores.It does require some practice to put on just right , but once I got it , I never want to go back to other eye liners.Also , as somebody else already mentioned - take care not to put it on too thick , it will then flake ( well , any make up when piled up too thickly will flake.The only con that I can think of is that it thickens up before I can use all of it , but this seems to be the case with my mascaras too . Maybe I do not use it often enough ?	1
I give this product between 3.75 and 4.0 stars . There are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.Pros : *Long lasting . It stays on all day , from morning until night*No flaking , peeling , fading , or smudging . It stays exactly how you applied it and does n't give you racoon eyes . *The color is so rich , black , and dark . The color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph . *It dries quickly and does n't feel wet on your eye lids . *It 's affordable and you seem to get a lot of product for the price.Cons : *It is somewhat difficult to remove at night . I use makeup remover and I have to rub at it a little more than I do with other eyeliners to remove it completely . *It is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids . I have to screw the cap on , shake it , and then remove the brush about 3-4 times to get the look I 'm going for . I do n't know if I just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it 's waterproof ( I think that 's the reason ) , but it 's not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.Overall , this is a good liner that gives a dark , dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging . I found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than I 've had to do with other liners . It 's affordable and I 'd reccommend it to try , but I 'm not sure if I would purchase again ; I would probably try other liners before coming back to this one .	1
I use this eyeliner after I use pencil eyeliner to give it more color and lasting power . I bought the brown liquid eyeliner . Its very good .	1
I refuse to spend $ 20+ for a small amount of high end product . This works just as well . I went swimming with this on and it did not flake or smear . You get a TON of product for the price . I 've had this over a year ... use it almost everyday and it 's still going strong . Some people said it was hard to get off ... .eye makeup remover or just baby oil seems to do the trick just fine . I would recommend this product to anyone .	1
Omg I love amazon.com this came in two days the fastest ever , I decided to try this eyeliner I give it 5 stars , had it on for 8 hours ... not a drop was gone . I have oily skin and my eyes will not hold eye liner that long..this works nice for oily skin ... .love love , love .	1
I think I 've tried somewhere near 20 or 25 different liquid eyeliners . They all either flake , rub off , are n't pigmented , or irritate the eyes . Except for this one . It goes on smoothly and precisely , and stays on until you decide to take it off , be it with makeup remover or cleanser . This stuff lasts through swimming , tears , and parties . And it 's only about $ 6 !	1
I have the oiliest skin and this is the only eyeliner that I have ever used that does n't smudge . Not even after a hard gym workout . I love the soft tip applicator and the long last formula.Then , it comes off easily when I wash my face with Cetaphil at the end of the day . This is the one makeup product that I own that I know will last all day long . Thinking about buying this ? You should , its awesome .	1
So it took me a while to decide how well I liked this eyeliner.To start off with , it has a really deep , strong color that does n't fade , so that was a plus . The consistency of the eyeliner itself is n't too liquidy or goopy ... it 's a great thickness . I 've used this eyeliner for a couple years now , on and off , to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.Here 's where things were iffy : after a couple of hours , the eyeliner would crack . It would n't smudge or bleed . It would CRACK . By the end of the day , if I had n't reapplied it , there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line . I did n't need a makeup remover wipe to take it off , I could practically peel it off . Weird ! ! Was it my eye ? Was it the liner ? I determined eventually that 95 % of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner I was using was OLD . Like , several years old . I knew it was old from the start , but it was an otherwise great liner , so I continued to use it . It was n't until I bought a new bottle recently that I figured this out . The new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if I wear it for a long time and I guess scrunch my eyes up a lot , but nowhere near the amount it used to.The brush is advertised as tapered but it 's not as tapered as I would have expected . It still has bristles ; it is n't a triangular foam brush.It is indeed waterproof from personal experience.Overall , pretty good eyeliner , at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners I 've tried as of late . This is definitely my go-to product and has become my daily liner .	1
This is the only liquid eyeliner that can withstand my oily eyelids all day without degenerating into a pool of guck . Cat eyes are my every day look and this liquid eyeliner does a competent job . But , it 's not perfect either . I 'm not sure if I should keep buying new bottles every so many weeks without using up the old ones because I think being exposed to too much air breaks down its effectiveness . Rather than getting smudgy on my lids , it starts flaking , so I look like I have chipped paint . Not good . But out of all the liners I 've worn , this is the longest wearing one by far .	1
I love this liquid liner . I 've only owned one before , and it was so runny and hard to apply that I never used it . I forget what brand that was . This one is perfect . The brush is the perfect width , and it holds the exact amount of liner needed . This stuff is not runny , and it dries almost instantly once applied . There is just enough time for me to wipe off my mistakes . Once it 's on , it 's ON though . The first time I wore it , I forgot to take it off before bed . I woke up the next morning planning to wash it off and reapply , but it was so perfect even after a night 's sleep that I kept it on and wore it the whole day without issue . I use Cold 's Cream to take it off , and it works just fine . I have such an unsteady hand , and I can usually not apply any kind of eyeliner for the life of me , but somehow even I can apply this evenly ! I recommend this to anyone who has struggled with eyeliner or liquid liners before .	1
I have used this product for years and have periodically tried otherbrands but always go back to this . The price is very reasonable .	1
This supplement is awesome ! ! ! It completely removes all types of body odor including feminine odor issues . It is very effective for me . I did n't have any abnormal body odor issues but I want to be as odor-free as possible . I recommend this to all my friends for the ultimate body deodorant . It is amazing how it makes your poo green !	1
Noticed results after about 4 days . Feces is grass green & odor has been reduced . I have noticed a difference in body odor . I still get it , just not as strong . I 've been taking 4 a day & am over weight .	1
I have used this product for many years and it is excellent . The other reviews on this product do a much better job than I ever could of describing the good things about it but all I can say is -- it works !	1
This is a very good product and really works to eliminate discomfort . The subscribe and save discount makes the price excellent .	1
I am not going to explain why I know this works so well , but it does work . And well . Let 's just leave it at that .	1
Have used for years ... Vagisil Anti-Itch Creme , Maximum Strength , 1-Ounce ( 28 g ) ( Pack of 4 ) good to have on time if you needed it .	1
This is a very effective product to relieve the itching as a result of moderate yeast infection or some itching as a result of allergy to latex condoms . It basically makes the area numb for a while , otherwise , it dose not have any anti fungus ingredient.However if the yeast infection is not moderate , the prescription tablets is a must and the over the counter cream is not working .	1
It smells like burning fur , but who cares ? If you 're out in the middle of the woods camping , or on a forever road trip and you have n't had a chance to change your drawers in a day or two , chances are , your unmentionable areas are gon na get itchy . Some areas are more sensitive than others when it comes to persistent itching and scratching . Vagisil allows you to temporarily relieve the itch so you can concentrate on driving or sleeping instead of scratching your parts off .	1
As with the other Vagisil product that I posted a review on , I did not buy this product for myself , but for friends who can not afford to buy them . Vagisil is an excellent product and I highly recommend it .	1
I tested this product on my boyfriend 's feet as he get calluses from playing basket ball . his feet were smooth and clean . I use it every 2 weeks and apply O'Keefe 's Foot Moisturizer and my feet stay soft and smooth .	1
My family had used this product for many years but I had not been able to find it in a long time . I have old feet , yep , there it is ... I have old feet . They have developed cracks and creases , callouses and snags . My husband is a diabetic and foot care is of utmost importance for his wellbeing . Pretty Feet & Hands is a great exfoliant for both of us . I recommend using this at least once a week , though it can be used daily . Bye-bye rough , dry , cracked , snags and such . Hello to smoother , younger , healthier feet !	1
I bought this months ago . Like it a lot . I use it on my feet periodically right after I get out of the shower . I think the little bit of moisture from the shower makes this product more effective . The dry dead skin rolls right off . I use it on my elbows as well to keep the dry skin to a minimum . I know some people use it on their faces as well , however , my face is already soft , and it 's also extremely sensitive . So I think this would just make my face break out . I only use it on problem areas like my feet and elbows . Good for the hands too , since I wash my hands a lot , my hands dry out . Makes the dead skin roll off instantly .	1
I will buy it again . This stuff works . I have horrible hands and this stuff did n't disappoint me . I love it and will buy again	1
Simply put , there is nothing on this earth that removes rough skin for my feet . My skin is baby smooth after use . This product is rather messy ; therefore I would suggest using the product outside . Otherwise you are left with white skin bits on your floors that are rather unappealing and difficult to clean . You will be astonished by how much new skin is revealed after using this product . I also use it on my hands , knees and elbows . My skin is highly sensitive and there are no adverse reactions to this product . I 've been using this for over 10 years and would n't use anything else .	1
WOW - GOT RID OF MY ROUGH SKIN IMMEDIATELY -I WENT OUT AND BOUGHT MORE OF THESE -I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE	1
this is what my hand and feet needs.. its really work.. all the rough skin will easily removed with out pain.. I use that every 2days before going to bed.. the results are amazing ... go for it and see the difference on your hand and feet	1
This product removes hard skin like magic ! It does not require soaking the feet either , nice and easy.I gave 4 stars in stead of 5 , because the skin on my hands were starting to burn as I worked on my heels . So you might consider putting on disposable gloves if you have wimpy hands .	1
I have scaly feet ( too soon ? ) , but this product works wonders ! I read another review where the lady/man puts the product on their feet then wear socks . I do this and it works ! When I shower all the dead skin comes off easy !	1
My doctor recommended this shampoo and it really works . I have Seborrheic dermatitis and years of Head & Shoulders never did a bit of difference . This is golden . I just wish it did n't dry out my tight curly hair so much !	1
I hate anything with fragrances in it and this shampoo does not have a smell at all AND it works fantastic . I would never use another kind !	1
Really like this shampoo because hair feels extremely clean and stays clean longer than most shampoos I 've used . Fragrance free is a must for me and this product could n't be better . Highly recommend .	1
The product works great and my skin allergy from normal shampoos is gone . My hair looks great with this shampoo . The shampoo arrived on time and it was packaged well by the shipper . DHS might consider putting no spill flaps on the neck opening under the top . There was some leakage from shipping .	1
This has helped with my eczema , but the strong smell is difficult for me to handle . I am very sensitive to fragrances and odors .	1
If your scalp is itchy , T/Gel is worth a try for as long as you are willing to keep using it for a few months . It worked for me but there were no 'instant ' improvements . In my case the itchiness went away VERY slowly but , 3 months later , it 's 99 % gone.I 'm not sure what the exact problem my scalp had but it was itchy like ... you know what . It began about one year ago and I could n't stop myself from scratching which , of course , ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated . Discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in October or November ( 7-8 months ago ) did not help much . He had nothing to prescribe but suggested that I massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because I have a fully head of hair and I am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter . ( Thank you doc ! ) To make the story short , a couple of months ago I stumbled upon a bottle of T/Gel left over from the time I used it ( effectively ) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try . The box claims that this is 'effective from the first use ' . It 's not . My scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much . And ... a couple of weeks ago I just noticed - I was n't scratching or massaging my head any more . The itch was largely gone.I ca n't say that the T/Gel cured me and it 's quite possible that the itchiness would come back if I stopped using it . Maybe I will experiment with that in a couple of months but , at this time , I am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly T/Gel use . Yes , it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.The product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me . It 's possible that it does n't work for everyone but I ca n't see how trying it would hurt.____________________________________NOTE : about the smell.The active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is 'coal tar ' which is smelly . Neutrogena has patented something they call NEUTAR which is a more refined version of coal tar that does n't smell as bad as the traditional ingredient . This version of T/Gel contains 2 % NEUTAR .	1
i bought this the other day because for the first time in my life , i have dandruff . i 'm not sure why it took 35 years for me to develop this problem , but hopefully this shampoo will always work like it has been for the past couple weeks . after exactly one use , my scalp felt so much better that i did n't mind the smell . it definitely smells like you 'd think coal tar would smell : i told my boyfriend i smelled like an asphalt plant and , being the heavy equipment operator he is , he clarified that i do not smell like an asphalt plant but rather , a coal miner on a lunch break . so sweet , that guy . but i digress ... i was hoping for a stronger menthol , tingly , cooling sensation than what i got , but it does n't really matter anymore because my itchy , red , angry scalp is calm now . i 'm pretty impressed . i used it on my patches of extremely irritated skin and it most definitely calmed the itch on those as well , but then i smelled really strongly of the tar . the smell is so strong that i am sure some people would be afraid to use it but if your scalp is itchy enough , it 's totally worth the smell . and if you shower at night , the smell is gone by morning . would recommend .	1
An itchy scalp drives you crazy . Scalpicin works but costs a fortune as you have to spread it all around from a very small , expensive bottle . Head and Shoulders Itchy Scalp products actually made my itching problem worse.The first time I tried this , I found relief . After a couple of weeks , my scalp is completely healed . Give it a try !	1
Used sparingly over a few weeks it seems to have done its job well . Always liked the shampoo and this seemed like a good addition . Also used a scalp brush when washing hair . Nice .	1
A very useful product at a great price . Good service . A must for people who suffer from scalp issues as a way to find relief .	1
I know it 's not cheap - but it does exactly what it says it 's going to do . It does n't smell great , but who cares . I would n't waste my time using any other product .	1
Certain celeb liked to brag about Head n Shoulders which is ok ... ..the real deal is T-Gel for any of you poor souls who are prone to dandruff , eczema , etc. , I use it twice ... .and I use it liberally ... .no quarter sized amounts ... .more like a silver dollar size or more and message into your scalp thoroughly , leave it and wash some other areas ... .then rinse off thoroughly , and rinse the T-Gel out , and do it again , maybe wash your back as you let it set , then rinse thoroughly again . Buying the largest size on Amazon let 's you fill smaller bottles at home if you are self conscious others seeing it , or just leave the big bottle in your shower caddy . I 've been using T-Gel for 30 years and I wear black shirts all the time . Every time I drift off to some sort of natural shampoo or expensive quality shampoo ... ..flakes come back and I go back to T-Gel !	1
Have used it just once and have already noticed a difference . I 'd been suffering an itchy scalp for a couple of months and looked up several solutions . Purchased this due to the customer reviews and am extremely happy with the result .	1
If you have tried other products and had no success , I would recommend trying coal tar shampoo . This shampoo helps me with scalp health and itch.It can bleach colored hair so be careful.I find it actually works best if I do n't use it too often , no more than once a week .	1
Good , leaves hair and scalp dry and very clean . Not so sure if it really prevents dandruff in my case , but I feel OK with it . One downside it 's its smell , But you can deal with it .	1
This product does everything it is supposed to , it smells pretty good too . It also does n't smell like chemicals , nor does it leave that smell behind after use .	1
I have been struggling with scalp issues since I was a child , and T Gel is the only thing that heals and prevents itching and redness . I love that it is offered through Subscribe and Save- much cheaper than the store and I 'll never run out !	1
been using for years and seems to keep dandruff at bay.not the ageing scalp skin issues which require rx meds shampoos.i find that the generic coal tar shampoo clones are more watered down thenneutrogena whose products are more expensive but worth the price .	1
After a couple of times of using this , my scalp psoriasis has disappeared . I will continue using occasionally just to help with that.Update - This is working ! I havent had any problems since I started using it . I use it 1-2 times a week now . I forgot to mention that it stinks ... It does consist of coal tar so you can expect to smell like tar . I will use this and then a fragrant shampoo after to try to lessen the smell.I also have color treated hair and it has not caused any problems with that .	1
Simply the Best IF ... you follow the directions . You use this great product to cleanse your hair of all the impurities and gook leftover in your hair from your regular shampoo , conditioner , and the world . You use it for 14 days . Shampooing once a day or every other day , whatever your routine is . It really works , I 've been doing this since I was a teenager . I do this routine about every five to six months . This routine is essential for fine/thin hair .	1
This may work on dandruff but does not work on seborrhoeic dermatitis . They are different . Dandruff is a generic term and coal-tar active ingredient products like this one may work on the kind of dandruff that flakes.If you have an itchy scalp which does not shed but instead causes sores , you may have the already mentioned seborrhoeic dermatitis . The latter is caused by clogged oil glands . It often takes place if you do n't shampoo frequently . That was the case with me . I shampooed only once a week because I did not want to ruin my expensive hair-color . The problem took several years to really develop before my doctor and I finally figured out what was wrong . What you need instead is a shampoo like the kind of Selsun Blue which contains selenium hydride .	1
I have slightly sensitive skin and Neutrogena T-Gel is awesome . I no longer get frustrating itching some while later on during the day.It is worth noting that you do need to make sure you thoroughly wash the shampoo out , and this can be tricky especially if the shower is weak , or you live in a hard water area . Make sure you spend a little longer rinsing !	1
I only have to use this once every few months for maintenance . Sometimes the seborrhea shows up on my nose or forehead , so I will wash those areas with this shampoo and it will heal it after a few days .	1
Purchased for my daughter flaky , itchy scalp . This shampoo calmed and cooled her itchy scalp . Would purchase this shampoo again .	1
So I guess this qualifies as an `` off label '' use but i use this primarily on my face to treat acne breakouts . In fact what I really like to do is squeeze out some of the T/Gel into a cup and then add a few drops of tea tree oil . Then i apply the gel to my face and let it sit for about 10 minutes before getting in the shower . That works well on my skin but everyone is different.As for the smell I really like it for some reason . Then again I always liked the smell of gasoline , turpentine , freshly paved roads , etc . If those are unpleasing smells to you then this might not be your shampoo . For me coal tar , or something else in the bottle , certainly SEEMS to help keep my skin clear . I never really had bad dandruff so I ca n't evaluate it on that basis.On the downside 4 oz goes really fast . I can use an entire bottle in 2 weeks if I 'm showering regularly ( you are supposed to apply , rinse , apply , rinse ) . Lastly , it is only .5 % coal tar so I 'm not too concerned about using it pretty liberally .	1
I have been a sufferer of dandruff ever since I was a child . When I was younger , my head would itch so bad , I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed . As I got older , I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes would n't be so overt.One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green . The doctor said , `` Neutrogena T-Gel . '' I asked , `` Is that a prescription ? '' `` No , '' he replied . I was stunned . I had used Head and Shoulders , Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different ? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work , so I gave it a shot.This stuff has been a life-saver . It 's not very glamorous looking - brown , weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick , curly hair . The longer you let it sit on your scalp , the better - 3 minutes is ideal . Despite the unusual smell from the bottle , your hair just smells fresh and clean.Unlike other shampoos , I have never had to take a `` vacation '' and use another shampoo to `` liven up '' my hair . T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient , Coal Tar , is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color . I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year . About 30 % of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos , but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel , my scalp will start itching again . It seems expensive when you see the price , but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.When I used to color my hair , I used a conditioner for colored hair and it did n't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel ... and after my hair is dry , I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still , no itching.If you have dandruff and have n't tried T-Gel , just give it a try - in one week , you should be symptom free !	1
As a young woman who has lost a lot of hair due to thyroid problems , I have tried a few products with mixed success . This product is n't even marketed towards hair loss but I gave it a try ... and it actually works ! I started with the extra strength shampoo but switched to regular ( less stinky , still effective ) . My hair loss stopped completely and even started growing back ! The shampoo does smell awful , but it works ! I just rinse really well and use a lot of shampoo . It leaves my hair soft , clean , and shiny . I will definitely keep using this product !	1
I do n't know what caused my scalp to itch , but this took care of it . I let the shampoo soak into my scalp while I shower so it has time to work . I was worried about the small size of the bottle , but discovered a tiny bit goes a long way so it will last a while . The smell is slightly medicinal , but it 's a small price to pay for relief . The lather is thick and rich , and my hair feels soft after using it . It does n't dry it out , like some shampoos . I 'm happy with the purchase and would recommend it .	1
My teenage found this on his own and swears by it . This must be a secret at his high school !	1
Very dry skin causes me to itch . Lotion takes care of the body but conditioner on the hair or conditioner shampoo products still leave my scalp dry . Used this product and the sensation of an itch on my scalp went away by about 80 % . After a week , my scalp does not itch . Using regular shampoo again brings back the itch after a few days and then I use the T-gel again . The only downside is that hair that has been colored will lose its color . The T-gel also makes the hair dry and you have to take care if your combing it damp . When the hair dries , it is very soft . My naturally curly hair is curlier after using T-gel . Not having an itchy head is worth any downside .	1
I was looking for something to aleive my scalp build up so that my hair will grow out again . I tried Nioxin , and all it did was burn my scalp and make my hair feel dry and brittle . I had tried T/Sal a long time ago without any adverse effects . I went back to it , and I 'm STILL in love with it ! No burning , itching , or other adverse effects . ( It does n't strip my hair either ! ) My scalp is actually sun burnt right now and it did n't even agitate the burn when I applied it .	1
This shampoo does the best job at controlling the build-up of plaques from psoriasis and removing the greasy medications I have to use .	1
I guess I had no idea what 4.5 fluid ounces really was , but I happily bought this to combat my dandruff . And it does just fine ! I definitely have noticed reduced flakes with this . As a shampoo , it 's more medicinal - it does n't smell great , does n't have a smooth luxurious texture ... but it does what it says so , I guess I have to reduce my complaining : )	1
Good shampoo . In the winter scalp can get dry & itchy , this so far is working nicely . Smell is fine - to me almost nonexistent . But it solved the dryness and itch .	1
It gave me the impression that my scalp was been treated as it should to prevent dandruff . It smells like remedy . However , no so sure if it was really really effected in my case . Perhaps I should use it more .	1
This product works great for me . I normally have an oily , itchy scalp with buildup , and I notice that I have no itching afer using the T/Sal for a month . I wash first with Nature 's Gate Tea Tree shampoo , then wash once with T/Sal ( leaving on for several minutes ) , then condition with Nature 's Gate Tea Tree conditioner.I initially bought both the T/Sal and T/Gel , so I used the T/Gel last night , and I notice I have a little itching today . I will update my review after I 've used the bottle , but I already prefer the T/Sal.Update : after using the T/Gel for a few weeks , I do not have itching , but I have a dry , flaky scalp , which I did not have before . I will gladly be switching back to T/Sal .	1
During the past two years I 've been struggling with some scalp build up problems and I pretty much have purchased all the drugstore products I could find to solve this . After months and months of trying to find a solution I decided to give this a try even though I thought it was quite expensive and yes , it did start to get better right away . However , it was n't as quick of a process as I wanted it to be so I decided to buy Head & Shoulders Clinical Strength and use it combined with this and this combination REALLY solved it in a matter of days . Since I 've done that I have n't had any problems , my scalp is super clear and I could n't be any more please . I never really stopped using this product and I do n't plan on doing it but just keep in mind that this product by itself did n't really do too much . In terms of the smell I do n't really like it , but it 's nothing intolerable or disgusting .	1
This is a pretty good product . I have allergies and one of the causes my scalp to get itchy and flaky . This shampoo has helped relieve the itchiness and flakes .	1
When my dermatologist was doing a skin cancer screening on me a few years ago , I was surprised when she said I had a mild case of seborrheic dermatitis . This made sense to me , though , as my scalp could get flaky and a little itchy at times . She recommended T/Sal . I figured , oh , great ... .I have to use a medicated shampoo now . I bet it will smell weird and dry out my hair.Well , not only does it smell like nothing , it works really well on my flaky/itchy issue , and to my shock and joy , it is not only gentle on my hair , but makes it super shiny and full . I would go as far as to say it is my favorite shampoo , period . Not my favorite medicated shampoo , just a great all 'round shampoo for everyone.I also use my wonderful Br & ouml ; & ouml ; beer shampoo , but I have found that the T/Sal even makes that work better too . I shampoo first with the T/Sal , then once with the Br & ouml ; & ouml ; . They are both free of harsh sulfates and the T/Sal is surprisingly simple in its ingredients . I believe the salicylic acid must be cutting any residue on my hair and so , making it behave better . T/Sal seems to make all my other shampoos and conditioners work better . I used to use Neutrogena 's build up removing shampoo , but found it too harsh ( sulfates ) and too pungent . The T/Sal is far superior.This is a great shampoo if you have a & # 34 ; reason & # 34 ; to use it , and even if you do n't . Gentle , mild , fragrance-free , powerful stuff .	1
My two-year old toddler has suffered from bad scalp eczema for most of her life , with scaly itchy lesions that she would scratch to the point of bleeding . I 've tried all baby shampoos on the market ( Johnson and Johnson , Aveeno , California Baby , Mustela ) and none helped.A few months ago I discovered thatDove Bar Soap , Sensitive Skin Unscented , 4 Ounce , 16 Counthad been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin , which doctors thought was atypical eczema . After discontinuing Dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.I wondered if the detergent ( surfuctant ) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response . I knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies , so I tried a small amount ( quarter size ) ofNeutrogena T/Sal Shampoo , Scalp Build-up Control , 4.5 fl ozon her , left it on for five minutes , rinsed well and reapplied , leaving it on for another five minutes . I thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried and it was very soft and wavy ; a dime size dab ofAveeno Baby Eczema Therapy Moisturizing Cream , 5 Ounceworked through her hair and scalp , a spray of water and some scrunching is all that 's needed to form ringlets that hold all day . Her scalp cleared up in less than a week , and although she is n't cured - it comes back if I do n't use it on her - I 'm glad to finally have found a solution.I use T-Sal once or twice a week on her , if any scales reappear - otherwise , I useBella B Bee Gone Cradle Cap Baby Shampoo 8 Oz . This shampoo is aloe based , hypoallergenic and paraben free , with a light fragrance that has n't caused any issues . Both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.On my end , I am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in `` hydrating '' shampoos , causing a huge amount of frizz , dryness , build up and breakage . Before trying T-Sal on my children , I tried it on my wavy hair . I was also surprised to see how well T-Sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards . I 've also noticed it helps my hand eczema ( from using strong detergents such asDial 1423982 Purex Ultra Free and Clear Concentrated Liquid Detergent , 100oz Bottle , ( Pack of 4 ) ) , if I leave the shampoo on my hands as long as I do on my hair.I now use T-Sal to help remove product build up and alternate withDHS Clear Shampoo 16 ozandDHS Conditioning Rinse with Panthenol , Fragrance Free 8 fl oz ( 236 ml ) , both very mild no-frills products that work really well.The only thing I do n't like is the small size . I 've bought a large size T-Gel to see if it 's more cost effective and will report back after I try it .	1
I had bought this shampoo because my skin would easily become flaky after cleansing both hair and scalp . All I had to do was wet my sectioned hair and scalp and apply a dime-size amount of the shampoo and lather . Leave the shampoo on for at least 3 minutes . I leave it on until I have applied to every section part of hair and after rubbing gently my scalp to remove the scalp flakes . Then I will reapply , and sometimes , I will add an essential oil that can assist the shampoo . I like this shampoo because it works well for my scalp and it cleanses both my hair and scalp . It helps also with detangling my hair , so that is a great help . The shampoos scent is light , nearly nonexistent . I think if the shampoo does n't work well at first , then combine it with essential oils like tea tree oil , cedarwood oil , neem oil , karanja oil , peppermint oil , and other oils that fight fungus and balances sebum of the scalp like ylang ylang essential oil . I hope this review helps you .	1
I like this shampoo for my hair . It leaves it super clean although it also makes it harder to detangle . The reason I did n't rate this with 5 stars is that maybe I have n't seen very dramatic results . Yes my scalp has less buildup , but it has not vanished completely . It 's great that it comes without fragrance , and it does smell nice anyway .	1
So far my experience with T/Sal has been really good . I alternate it with T/Gel . Between the two it really drops the banhammer on dandruff . I had such bad dandruff that I could not even wear a black shirt . Now I can and will only see one or two flakes here and there . That is pretty impressive.I 've found it to be ineffective on my seborrheic dermatitis . i need to use something else for that . But for dandruff ... awesome .	1
I have very dry super curly hair . I get build up on my scalp whenever i use 'regular ' shampoo/conditioner . I 've been using apple cider vinegar to treat this but it does n't always work for me . After the FIRST use , this shampoo cleared up my scalp . It 's squeaky clean with no weird off-white build up ! Yay ! There 's also no smell ! I 've tried head and shoulders , tar shampoo and hated the smell.This stuff is fragrance free . I love it : ) Btw , have n't tried the conditioner but I use my ACV/Water spray as a conditioner after this shampoo . Works wonders , super soft curly hair with clean scalp : )	1
I do n't really like the smell of this ... at all . Actually its horrible but it is the one thing that will help scalp build up or dandruff almost immediately so its worth the nasty smell .	1
This shampoo is a good addition to any anti-dandruff regimen . The salicylic acid in it helps gently removes flakes with a fairly pleasant smell . It 's not great for color-treated hair , but as long as it 's used only occasionally , like once a week or every once in a while , and in conjunction with conditioner , then it is n't too drying . Over all , it 's a beneficial shampoo that has stood the test of time .	1
For thinning hair this conditioning rinse is used in conjunction with DHS Clear Shampoo . Have used for several years and is really helping this old lady 's head of hair .	1
No perfume smell or irritant to scalp . Hair feels clean and not weighted down from conditioning . Very happy with this product and will continue to use .	1
The product arrived on time from shipper . Over all I like the product . I have sensitive allergy prone skin and after using the DHS Clear shampoo and this conditioner my allergy is gone . I think DHS should remove the yellow dye from this product so that it would be more allergy free . I have allergies to some dyes . So far I 'm doing well with the product .	1
I love this product . I also like the Shower Works ready-to-use kind - that one is a little easier/more convenient to use , but you pay for that convenience b/c it costs more . But both products work in terms of keeping my hair looking healthy . I would recommend using these about twice a week . For my hair , this really works - I have long , wavy , highlighted , fine hair ( not thick ) .	1
I 've been using this once a week for 3 months . It 's easy to use and only adds about 5 minutes to my morning on the day I use it . I do n't follow the directions 100 % . I have very long hair and have found that this works best for me : Heat up a mug of waterlet the tube sit in the hot water while I wash my face in the shower.Ring my hair out ( literally ) dump the water out of the mug and squeeze in the contents of the VO5 tubePush my hair down into the mugMy hair will absorb all of the hot oil . Then I run my fingers through for about a minute , maybe two . This works the product up the shaft of hair but leaves the focus on the bottom few inches.Then I rinse and wash my hair . I do n't use conditioner on the hot oil day.My hair is a bit greasy that day . But very slight . I must wash it the next day . It helps with the little flyaways that I get , but it 's temporary . If I used it twice a week it may work better , but it 's a little pricey for me to use a box a week.I 've noticed no difference in breakage or split ends .	1
I have shoulder length thick hair , but the ends are brittle and break too easily due to consistent wear n tear from my heating tooks ( hair dryer and flat iron used daily . ) My stylist told me about this product but I did n't want to buy it from her because the product was marked up so much , so I went in search of it a year or two later . I found it at a local store more expensive than online , so I purchased it here.Wow o wow is my hair happy . My hair has a shine that was n't there before , my hair seems stronger with the weekly use of the VO5 hot oil treatment and I 'm having less issues with our humidity creating flyaways . My hair is noticeably softer to the touch , and easier to manage when I straighten . I 'm no longer having to use the flat iron as long.Love love love this product . Buy it once , and I promise you 'll want to keep buying .	1
I have natural tightly coiled African hair and have tried other hot oils included pure olive oil but was n't satisfied with the result . I heard about using VO5 from natural hair forums and thought I 'd give it a try . While using it in the shower I was n't particularly impressed , but once my hair dried , I must say I was happy with the result . My very very tight coils were actually loosened quite a bit and hung down to my shoulder ... .with a lot of bounce . I will defiantly be using this product again .	1
When I am in the mood , I mix one hot oil treatment tube with an equal amount of olive oil and some Aussie three minute miracle deep conditioner . Then , I heat it just a tad in the microwave for an intensive `` conditioning pack '' treatment.Once you have this all on your hair , you cover it up and then you can use a blowdryer to heat up your hair to let it all absorb nicely.Or , as I recently found out , you can just go get the Frizz-Ease Smooth Start Shampoo and the Defrizzing Conditioner and you will be thanking me for telling you about it ! ; ) Realistically , you need both . You need the deep conditioning treatments and the daily shampoo/conditioner miracle of Frizz-Ease . Bless them.~The Rebecca Review	1
While I 'm not a medical expert and ca n't comment on the product health wise , I can tell you my experience . I tried the Konsyl for Balance with Psyllium fiber and prebiotic with insulin fiber which is for everyday digestive health . This helps control constipation , diarrhea , colitis and IBS . Since this is already an orange flavor I figured mixing it with orange juice would be a good way to go about trying it . This definitely was a good idea considering I could hardly tell I had added anything at all . As I already said , I ca n't really comment on the health benefits too much since I had n't had any recently problems *knock on wood* with my digestive health lately , but I can tell you that it 's easy on the digestive system . I did n't get sick or have cramps after using the product , which I 'm pretty sure is a good thing . Best part of this product though , if you 're pregnant it is safe to use and if you 're diabetic it 's safe to use as it is sugar free and gluten free ! So if you fit in either of those categories this is definitely a product that may be beneficial to you.READ FULL REVIEW : [ ... ]	1
I needed a source of additional fiber and was very upset as every brand of fiber seems to have a great need to add sugar in some form.Really glad I found this product , in Walmart , of all places.You need to shake it vigorously , not stir ; I use a small Tupperware container with a lid for it.Obviously , it works . Sometimes it works too well /cough-cough/ , so be careful with the dose.Seems pricey , but you get a good bang for your $ .	1
I have suffered from chronic consitpation my entire life . I am 65 yrs old . I have tried many different types of fiber supplements and I keep coming back to Konsyl Natural Fiber . I usually do ALL my shopping at Amazon.com because I am a prime member and the products work out to be cheaper than me going 20 miles one-way to the nearest store and then paying sales tax . However , this is the first product that is overpriced on Amazon . Walmat has this product for $ 13 . So I will buy there instead of here . My review should be that if you suffer from constipation , then this is a great working fiber that is almost taste free .	1
When I went to see my gastroenterologist last September ; he recommended that I start using this product twice a day . He was making the recommendation , based on a family history of colon cancer , plus the fact that I had hemorrhoids and a weak anal sphincter muscle . While he said that Konsyl would not improve the hemorrhoids or anal sphincter muscle ; the introduction of fiber to my diet would prevent them from getting worse . Little did I know that there were so many other benefits to using this product , including weight loss and lowering cholesterol . I 'm finding that regular use of Konsyl completely eliminates the constipation I was experiencing , and it 's great to know that it has so many other attributes . I mix it with an 8 ounce glass of water , although it 's probably best to use a shaker . Mixing it in water with a spoon does n't fully distribute all of the fiber , but it works well enough for me . I do n't notice any taste to the Konsyl and have no problem drinking it down , . As mentioned on the label ; I drink an additional glass of water right after drinking the Konsyl , to make sure it 's all washed down . One additional note ; my gastroenterologist said that he recommends Konsyl over every other brand of fiber . When I went to the Konsyl website ; they display a graph which shows that it contains more usable fiber than any other brand . This product is highly recommended by me .	1
Years ago I used this but I used one rounded tsp 3 times a day along with a healthy diet . I gradually lost 56 pounds and lowered my blood sugar levels , and my cholesterol levels dramatically.Since that time I went off of it , returned to my bad ways of eating , regained the weight , and blood sugar and cholesterol went way up again.For the past several months I have once again been taking fiber supplements . I had been taking Konjac Glucommanan Powder and have been very pleased with it . But , I decided to try Konsyl again since I can just go to the store and buy it instead of ordering online.I do not like taking the Konsyl as well as I like the Konjac Glucomannan . And , there is some differences in the two fibers . Konjac Glucomannan is solely a soluable fiber ( which will more effectively lower your cholesterol ) , while Konsyl is a mixture of both soluable fiber and non-soluable fiber ( the non-soluable fiber helps 'sweet ' your colon and creates faster transit , while the soluable fiber lowers the cholesterol but does n't increase the speed of transit ) .So , if your transit time is too fast you may want to look more at taking Konjac Glucomannan . But , if your transit time is too slow Konsyl would be better . If you want ( more ) lowering of cholesterol than Konjac Glucomannan would be the way to go . If you want faster transit along with cholesterol lowering than Konsyl is the way to go.I have decided to alternate using both products ; one product at one meal , the other product at the other meal . So , alternating both products should give me the best of both.Konjac Glucomannan sticks to the side of the glass if you do n't mix and drink fast enough , but it goes down smoothe . But , there also is a slightly odd flavor to Konjac Glucomannan . Konsyl is a pretty much flavorless fiber , but has gritty path down that I really do n't care for . But , it 's not terrible .	1
Lectric shave makes it easier to shave with an electric . It seems to prepare your skin by sanitizing it ( i.e . with alcohol ) , and making it easier for the blades/foil to glide over your skin . Good stuff and it lasts quite a while .	1
I had never used this item before . My father used to use it all the time . Now I see why . It really does give you a closer shave and reduces skin irritation . You only need to use a small amount . And make sure to wait about 15 seconds for it to dry before shaving .	1
I 'm a lady , and I bought this because I needed a quick , in-office fix to fuzzy legs . Sometimes you miss a patch . Or the whole thing ... Anyway , I did a side by side comparison . One leg I shaved dry and one I used this stuff.This stuff works great , I had a much closer , smoother shave than without it . But , it made me smell like an old man . It has a very potent 'classic aftershave ' smell that is just not my cup of tea , as a lady who does n't want to smell like a great uncle , or for someone I would consider getting close enough to to smell their face.Now I understand why it says 'rinse after using ' . That being said , it 's still a great product , and I 'd buy it again .	1
The choice of having rougher and smoother side is perfect for all skin types . The size is perfect . They dry fast , just wish there were multiples in each pack .	1
I 've been using a dish sponge , yes , you read that right , a dish sponge to wash my body in the shower . Granted it 's a nice spong , the kind that has a mesh lining on it and costs about $ 3 at my local grocery store ... but I thought it was time to commit , to an actual body sponge . I 'd read on here , after researching , that the Buf-Puf Double sided body sponge was pretty awesome , so I went ahead and ordered it . I 've used it 2x only and I have to say , I get excited ( do n't look into this too much please ) about scrubbing down in the shower now ; - ) I also hate mushy soap and use most soaps that come out of a container but a friend gave me a beautiful bar of soap and this scrubber grabs the soap so it 's left fairly dry ( the soap ) and does n't just sit there ( like I 'd let it ) and build up into a soapy mush . The sponge is definitely a strong scrub on one side , good for elbows , legs and maybe your hard to reach places on your back . The other side is soft enough to use on your face , neck , inner arms etc . Overall , I love this little sponge !	1
This really works well . It reminds me of a product from 50 years ago for the same purpose . Looking forward to showering with it .	1
The best product ever for the shower . It gets all dead skin off and makes my skin smooth and silky .	1
I always used the sponges you can get at any store and never felt like they really did anything . This sponge is great , my legs feel smooth after each use . Would recommend .	1
This makes my skin feel soo good . I love Buf-Pufs . They are the perfect exfoliation tool . It 's a must have !	1
While spring cleaning , I came across my old Buf-Puf handle . I had forgotten all about the Buf-Puf and how good it works . It was wonderful to see it still being sold . Besides doing a super job of keeping your skin clean , it also is great for using if you have been outside in areas with ticks . Years ago , I would visit a wooded area , where there were deer , and pick up tiny , tiny ticks , without knowing they were on me . It was only after scrubbing with this body sponge , that I would see the itty-bitty ticks caught up in the Buf-Puf . Then , I would just rinse them down the drain.The Buf-Puf sponge I received this week is just like the old one -- same shape , same size . Thus , it fits my old Buf-Puf back scrub handle . I 'm really glad I kept it , since Amazon and every other place online seems to no longer have any `` Buf-Puf Back Scrub Body Sponge with Reusable Handle '' . Besides having a white side to scrub your skin , the body sponge also has a `` tougher '' blue side to scrub your feet . I had forgotten , too , what a nice job it does on summer feet , when shoes are worn only when absolutely necessary .	1
I have used this product for years , plus another softer Buf-Puf for my face.Does wonders for taking off dried skin , and I just feel wonderfully clean afterwards . It also preps your skin well for your favorite lotion.I use the Buf-Puf handle and attach this sponge to wash my back.After many years , I am used to it , but for a first time user , stick to the softer white side and use a gentle touch.Overall a great exfoliate for the the body !	1
I purchased this after researching what would best help/prevent my flaky , dry skin . The extra gentle Buf-Puf is great for every day cleansing . I use a dab of cleanser , wet the puff and make little circles over my skin . It is just enough exfoliation to get the dead cells off , but not so much that it irritates my sensitive skin . I follow up with my skin care regimen ( serum , toner , moisturizer ) and this little puff has helped make a world of difference.Being the first time that I have used one of these , I am not sure how long they `` normally '' last , but I have gotten a good two and weeks of daily use out of mine , before noticing that it was beginning to lose it 's structure a bit .	1
After receiving this I realized I had had one of these for the problems with teenaged skin . Now it does a nice job exfoliating !	1
The regular version of these Pufs is way too rough , ca n't imagine using them on anything but elbows and heels . This extra gentle version is better for facial skin , exfoliates nicely . I use it with Neutrogena Facial Bar , rinse it well , and air dry it on end on a soap tray between uses . It does begin to pill slightly after a couple months but lasts a good long time as long as you carefully rinse it and prop it up to dry out . This is the most cost effective exfoliating treatment available . Too bad its only available online .	1
Works great - my skin has been clear since using these , even through hormonal acne . My skin has never been smoother/softer . I replace each one about every 3 weeks and use with my desert essence tea tree face wash on a daily basis . If my skin is sensitive , I may use it every other day , but these work great .	1
Love these facial sponges on the with the Avon Clearskin Professional Deep Pore Cleansing Scrub or your favorite cleanser . Lather up and try them - they work !	1
I remember these from my teen age years , marriage , raising my children and then they disappeared . The other day I was watching a program ( Mirror , Mirror ) where they featured top models and their beauty regimen . To my excited surprised I see one model using a Buf Puf . I ran to Google and found them being sold on Amazon and some other retail stores . Amazon was the least expensive and I purchased 6.How wonderful to feel that strong clean feeling when using the puff . It is better than any blemish control scrub on the market and leaves no grainy residue.. I could feel those dead skin cells sloughing off and after only one use my skin felt cleaner than after any clay.mask I have removed . Needless to say I am thrilled and recommend them to anyone even with sensitive skin like i have.This is a facial in a sponge .	1
I have been using Buf Puf since high school ( I am in my 50 's now ) . It keeps the dead skin cells from clogging my pores , which helps prevent old looking skin .	1
Have used buf puf 's for years , this is a good deal for 6 pufs . They are great exfoliators , I use it every other day and can see a difference if I miss a day . We live in a dry climate .	1
These buff pads are the best . I tried a less $ $ brand and No comparison . I use them with a sugar scrub and it really makes a difference with my skin . REALLY squeaky clean .	1
Excellent product to gently exfoliate the skin every day . Have used Buf-puf for decades ; store brands just are n't the same .	1
Works very well ! Lasts for a long time ,	1
I know a lot of persons have commented on how great these Buf-puf sponges are , but I had to add my own praise . I had previously tried the regular and found that they were a bit too harsh for my skin ( I have both eczema and acne , so my face tended to get extremely sensitive even when I was gentle with the puff ) . The gentle is perfect and I 'm happy I bought the 6-pack too.We 're currently renovating at home and it feels so nice after dusting , sweeping and mopping every evening to be able to just put a little Cetaphil cleanser on it and just buff off all the dirt ... .no other scrub product required ... I also use the body buf-puf for showering and ca n't help but feel nice and clean afterwards.A great little product !	1
I have been using the Buf-Puf facial sponge since the 1980 's . The teardrop shape is ideal for lightly exfoliating around the eyelids/nose area . The narrow end is much easier to manipulate than theBuf-Puf Double-Sided Body Sponge , which , of course , is a great BODY SPONGE ! SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESOf course I am paying more for these sponges , but they do not soften as quickly as the bargain brands .	1
Always a great product . I have used them for years and I still love them . If you have n't tried them yet , you should .	1
This is another product I 've used for years to keep my face clean . I 'm almost 70 and people say I look 20 years younger so keeping the facial skin free of oil and dirt must have some merit . Buf-Puf are a bit hard to find but luckily we have Amazon . Gave one to my granddaughter to help her avoid Acne and show her how to avoid oil and bacteria caused pimples . Buf-Puf Gentle has a little scrubbing action which helps to remove dead skin and keep the skin glowing . Recommended highly for daily use .	1
I just got this and proceeded to wash my face after a long day at work . It definitely has a scrubby feeling but it 's not like a brillo pad or anything , rather , you can tell it 's sloughing off dead skin . I 'm going to keep using it , carefully ( as in not scrubbing my face too hard ) and hopefully it will make my skin even nicer than it is - which is a good thing at any age but at 45 , I 'm extra grateful for that .	1
This product was great for the price . We use the buff pads every day , so I am sure that we will be ordering more from amazon again . It helps to exfoliate and make your skin soft and smooth .	1
There 's a trick to using Buf-Pufs . You do n't scrub your skin with them - you use them very quickly and lightly across your skin to create friction . Once they 've been used for awhile ( on both sides ) you need to replace them . I 'd say every month .	1
Sometimes I can not find these in stores . I have used it for years . The gentle one is not hard on the skin .	1
My face feels softer than before but it 's not a miracle worker like some reviews seem to gush . The first time you use it , you feel the difference more . Good prices on Amazon especially if you do the subscribe and save .	1
I love these . they worked so well . I have eczema so it helps get rid of dead skin cells that pile up .	1
I had this item in my wish list forever and I 'm so glad I finally bought it.I use the buff puff with a good facial cleaner in the shower and wow - it exfoliates more effectively that anything else I 've tried , and I 've tried it all . I really feel like my serums and moisturizers are able to penetrate after using the buff puff instead of sitting on top of my skin . For the first few uses , I suggest using a very light hand , as it can be a little harsh .	1
I have been using these for many years to exfoliate my skin . The size is a good fit for my hand and they last a long time . I highly recommend them	1
I have been using these for years ( since I read Bo Derek stating in a post `` 10 '' interview that she used them to keep her skin smooth : - ) ) . As my skin has aged , I have switched from the regular to the gentle version.I have sensitive skin that does n't like harsh chemicals . Using these allows me to slough off the older layers as well or better than expensive exfoliants . They helped control acne and now remove the old skin that keeps me from having the `` healthy glow '' that the commercials for costly creams promise . It has been difficult to find these locally as the shelf space gets taken by new , expensive options , so I am really glad to find them on Amazon.Inexpensive , re-usable , no chemical reactions or worries about getting something in your eye . Perfect .	1
I started using these little scrubbers some 20 years ago . I still use them . I have had to use store brand imitations for a number of years however because they are so impossible to find . Then about six months ago , I finally saw one in my local store . I could n't believe the difference ! Still as powerful in cleaning but not as harshly abrasive . I get compliments on my skin all the time . I always tell people that its because of Buf-Puf.It does n't matter what your age ... It is never to late to start exfoliating !	1
I have been using these facial sponges since I was in my 20 's , so about 30 years ! Lately they have been harder to find . In the past I used them every day when I washed my face . Now I use them twice a week . They are especially useful on the days I have used sunscreen to help remove the gunk . They last very well and I usually use one pad for about 6 months or so if I only use them on my face . Also use them on my arms and legs before the use of artificial tanning products to exfoliate my skin , they are awesome for that ! Be sure to use them gently as they could irritate your skin if you were to enthusiastic .	1
I have hyperkeratinization and these take care of it . It really helps to keep your dead skin from building up and clogging your pores . They really work .	1
I do n't have severe huge white-head acne , but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere . I have tried every . single . lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 ( I am now 22 ) . To make that search all the more difficult , I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin ... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent . Sometimes when putting on shirts ( that I wash with a nicely scented detergent ) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot . I am *that* sensitive . Hence , most of the `` Guaranteed '' products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally ( Proactiv ) .I do n't know the technical term , but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin . My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry , peel , itch , and then if I itch form red spots , etc . I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I 'm going to give it.To not digress further , I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks , and was put on Monodox `` as needed '' . When I 'm breaking out badly , I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process . So , this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.As far as MOISTURIZER , I 've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing ' feeling versus itching , stinging , or masking my face with oil . If it stung , it would end up itching after a while , and hence make my condition worse , not better . If it simply felt like a 'masked ' feeling in the face , then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and did n't help the dryness at all.This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that 's helped me . Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer , but for my personal skin condition , it truly does all it states . I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling ! It 's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool , crisp morning . It has 0 oil . None . I leave it on for hours and it 's perfect . The best thing is that it somehow does n't irritate my capricious face . I was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim . For the first time in my life , I reached for the save.I wish I could give it more than just 5 stars . Very happy customer !	1
This facial cleanser has helped me maintain my skin for some time now . I find that I have less blemishes when using it but my skin maintains a balanced moisture level , which is ideal . Many cleansers dry skin and in the winter that is not a nice feeling . Amazons price is very good compared to local retailers . I wish it did lather a little more since it is labeled as a foaming cleanser but that is a minor complaint . Overall I am very happy with this product .	1
My son has been struggling with breakouts for the past year . He has tried a number of moisturizers with no luck . They either cause him to break out , leave his face feeling greasy , or offer no SPF protection . This is the one moisturizer that works , and that is important because his acne medications can often leave his face dry and irritated . This product has become so essential to him that we order through subscribe and save to make sure he does n't run out .	1
I used this when I was a teenager to keep my skin clear . I never really had very bad acne , just a few bumps here and there . This really helped keep it under control . Luckily when I reached my early twenties my breakouts became only bothersome once monthly.I used this with the Morning Burst products and the Blackhead Clearing products from Clean & Clear . I mostly used this at night and used the Morning Burst with spf moisturizer in the daytime.When using this , my skin was squeaky clean and I was constantly getting compliments . Now that I 'm older , this is too harsh for me . I switched to Olay once acne was no longer a daily concern .	1
This moisturizer is really good . It 's just enough to keep zits at bay and aid in healing the ones that you already may have . It can dry out your skin if you use it too often , but once a day is perfect for this product .	1
I use this toner as an after shave . It helps keep my face clear of blemishes and helps prevent ingrowns from shaving . Burns a little on first application , but is wayyy more tolerable than the red colored one . I keep a bottle around my office too to freshen up before meetings . Takes the oil right off . Love it	1
Love it , Love it , Love it ! I have very oily skin and this leaves my skin soft and clean . Used in combination withNeutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash Cream Cleanser , 6.7-Ounce , my skin has never been clearer or felt better .	1
I use this moisturizer with my Clinique acne solutions clearing moisturizer . It works really great for my moderate acne . I love it ! ! I use daily in the morning n night .	1
I have always liked this face wash , it makes me clean my face and feel fresh without breaking out . I have been using it for 5 years now , and everytime I try a new product , its not as good as this .	1
I really like that this stuff is mild and gentle , but also totally cleans off any makeup that I 'm wearing , even waterproof mascara . I love the scent , very fresh and clean , and the texture is nice too . It washes off very easily and does n't cause any problems to my skin . I have a problem with acne , and have n't noticed any improvement on it because of this product , but it definitely does n't make it worse and really makes me feel fresh after I 've used it.This is now my favorite nighttime cleanser because it 's gentle , yet does an amazing job of getting my face clean and makeup-free at the end of the day . I love it for that reason , and will keep using it .	1
For some reason or another I have problem skin . I used to use proactiv solution but my skin is way too sensitive for it . Then I used a litany of brand-name facial cleansing lines -- but they were too expensive to maintain . I tried Stridex for a while but it just seemed to take my skin off . Nowadays I have stumbled upon the simplest solution ( astringent ) . I wear lots of makeup throughout the day and if I do n't remove all of it I tend to break out . I clean my face once a night with astringent , I put a little bit of lotion under my eyes and on any super dry areas , and then go to bed . Astringent , Lotion , Repeat .	1
I have used this product for the last 15 years . It 's perfect . I prefer this over the generic store brands because this formula is a little thicker . The generic seems a bit watery or thin , if that makes any sense . I 've had no issues with using this under makeup , primers , or even sunscreen .	1
I almost never had acne when I was in my teens . Mine did n't start until I was in my early/mid twenties . I went to the dermatologist then and my dermatologist recommended this lotion along with a soap with Salicylic Acid in it to help keep my skin clear . I 've used both now for 20+ years and I rarely have break outs.I have oily skin for the most part so I almost never experience any drying from this lotion and since I 'm now in my forties , I use something else around my eyes and for my neck but this works great for my face . I use it after showering , allow it to sink into my skin for about 10-15 minutes and then apply a base , then foundation.This seems like it keeps my skin bright as well as clear so my complexion does n't get dull and it does n't add shiny-ness to my face . In the winter , I sometimes supplement this lotion with something a bit more moisturizing but this is my primary face lotion for the rest of the year . It does n't make me greasy and leaves my skin soft . I do n't know what I would do without it because I 've tried switching to more expensive brands but either they do n't work as well or eventually my skin begins to break out again.A bottle of this lasts me a long time too so it 's very inexpensive to use . It 's a must have in my beauty routine . So long as they keep making it , I 'm going to keep buying.One last thing : If you get breakouts on your back or shoulders or chest , this works great for those areas as well . Apply it , let it `` soak in '' for 10-15 minutes then apply a good sunscreen if you 're going to be out in the sun for any length of time .	1
I have an oily t- zone ... NO lotion has ever worked in treating it ( and I have tried MANY different matte lotions ) Now having this lotion , I only have very little oil on my nose area but I still see a major difference in my skin compared to before and i am 99.9 % satisfied with this product.p.s.This stuff feels like Amazing silk going on the skin. ! ! ! Thanks Clean-and-Clear !	1
I have actually never purchased the Clean and Clear product itself , but I have tried both the Wal-Mart brand and the Target brand of this moisturizer . The Target generic brand is AMAZING , I honestly would give it a 5/5 ! I have combination skin , so my face is oily in spots and dry in others . I use the product everyday at night , after I wash my face , before bed . I would like to think that the acne medication has the best time to absorb into my skin while I 'm sleeping as opposed to wearing it outside in the sunlight , where it would make my face even dryer than normal . In the morning , I use a daytime moisturizer , but that is another review.I ended up buying the Wal-Mart brand because I left my original bottle at my mom 's house . The Wal-Mart brand costs less than both the actual product and the Target brand , but is definitely of a lower quality . It 's a lot more watered down than the Target version and takes several more applications to finally work . I still use it at night , however.I 'm sure the real version of this product works AMAZINGLY WELL since I love the Target version so much . But do n't buy the Wal-Mart version of this product .	1
This moisturizer is great , it makes my face smooth and it does help with acne . I will continue to purchase it , it is also very affordable which makes it even better.It makes my makeup look fresh and it goes on smoothly .	1
This cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin . I 've used other products in the past that caused breakouts or dry skin . This one does neither because it 's so gentle . It 's also less expensive compared to the other other brand name products .	1
Love this stuff . It 's perfect for keeping my face soft and smooth , without breaking out . I especially like to use it at night .	1
This does not make my skin feel greasy . It absorbs very quickly and has helped my skin so much . Since I have been using this I do n't have any cystic acne which is a major plus .	1
This works great for a basic face wash . I usually let it soak in for a minute or two ( while I brush my teeth ) and when I rinse it off , my skin is soo soft .	1
Not perfectly , but it has helped to clear my son 's face . He is 15 and getting him to wash his face is a nightmare ... at 15 ! ? ! Anyway , he had pretty mild acne that absolutely came from not washing enough at 15 . This is so easy for him and it is n't too drying . I have noticed a huge improvement with just this product . One step is about all I can hope for at this point .	1
for any moisturizer you have to be careful to not put on so much because your face will get oily . But I must say overall , I love this product . I have been using it for years now , and it works every-time . I can definitely tell a difference by just using it just once . My face looks brighter and the tone is more evened out . This product is extremely recommended to those with sensitive skin !	1
johnson 's & johnson 's has done it again ! i absolutely love this oil free lotion it makes my skin feel smooth and great with or without makeupi love using after i exfoliate or when im done cleansing after wearing make upim glad i purchased	1
I love that this cleanser smells nice and it works very well , just like Paula Begoun writes in her review of this product . It removes the most stubborn mascara I have ever owned ( it 's hard to wash off ) . I do n't even have to use eye makeup remover afterwards ! My skin sort of normal but it can get dry . So after I wash my face with this cleanser , my face feels a bit dry and I have to put some moisturizer on ... ..with Biore that I wrote review for before I did n't have to do that but Biore does n't wash off my silly mascara very well : ) choices choices . I think if you have skin on the oily side , this may work very well for you.Other than being a bit drying , it also takes a lot if this stuff to work . With some cleansers it takes 1 pump ... ..it takes 3-4 of this . Does n't foam easily . I do n't think I 'd get this one again yet I 'd give it 4 stars still .	1
this moisturizer is amazing.. it never make my face oily but it moisturize it is a perfect way that I can use my primer and foundation without having oily spots on my nose or chin ... go go go	1
I am a male and I have adult acne . The acne meds dry out my skin . I needed a moisturizer that would n't make my acne worse , and preferably , would help prevent acne . This product fits the bill . It is light , cooling , and does n't clog my pores . It 's gentle enough that I can put it on my face right after shaving , and it does n't sting or burn . ( It actually works really well as an after-shave conditioner ; seems to help prevent red bumps and ingrown hairs ! ) The only way this product could be better would be if they added sun protection to it . I hope someday they make a version of this with SPF 15 ; if they do , I will give it 5 stars .	1
I decided to try this cleanser because it was foaming . I was pleasantly surprised on how it worked . Did not dry out my skin or leave it oily . Clean and clear 's products seem to be just as good as the name brands ( which i have tried ) .	1
I 've been using this product for about eight years now and it works great for me . I have very sensitive skin and it does n't dry my skin out and it does a great job at removing all the dirt and make-up from my skin . It 's not for acne and blackheads but it keeps my breakouts under control it 's a great morning and night cleanser to use . Or you could use the 'Clean & Clear morning burst facial cleanser ' in the morning and this at night .	1
I am very satisfied with this mosturizer . I am a big fan of Clean & Clear products . It feels light on the face and works well on combination skin types . It also has a nice , clean smell to it . You do n't have to apply a whole lot of it on . I definitely recommend it .	1
This goes on cleanly with hte pump dispenser but can be a bit difficult to wash off afterwards - hence the 4 star review . Nor has this ever really foamed for me . But it does n't leave my skin feeling soapy and stiff , nor does my skin get irritated from it . I think I prefer the Olay Foaming Face wash for the scent but both are really good products .	1
I use this daily and it is perfect for my skin . It does n't dry it out and my face feels fresh and clean afterwards .	1
i use this most days . and i used this before , just bought it online because it was easy and i have prime . thanks !	1
I have really dry skin around my nose and I do n't like to use regular body lotion for my face cuz it breaks my face out . That 's why I like this product cuz its a moisturizer and a acne product . Works pretty good for the price .	1
I have dry skin as well as oily skin and acne prone skin . It 's not a fun combo to work with but this moisturizer sure helps !	1
This is the most gentle brand available . It contains 2.5 % Benzoyl Peroxide . All other brands are extra strength and have 10 % , which eats away at my face and burns . This takes a few applications to fully rid my face of break outs , but it is worth the wait to avoid any burning or injury . I have really sensitive skin and roseacea . My dermatologist recommended this for me . I am glad that I took his advice . : )	1
I purchased this product after in was recommend as a disinfectant in the book Do n't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me . I had been becoming extremely frustrated with my oily skin and frequent breakouts , so I was ready to try something new . For the past 1 1/2 months , I have been religiously using this product in the morning and Clear Pore Nighttime Clarifying Gel ( a BHA product ) prior to bed . While I have n't seen miraculous results , I have had a reduction in breakouts , and my skin texture seems to be slowly improving . In addition , I am no longer getting the dry , flaky patches which I was getting with other products . However , my skin is still oily , and I do still experience the occasional breakout . While this product certainly might provide you with some benefits over time , keep in mind that you will not see immediate results : despite the claims , there is NO product available which can get rid of existing blemishes .	1
This stuff works pretty good . Good price also , will buy it again . Also use it on my 10 year old daughter who has been breaking out as of lately and it 's not to strong for her sensitive skin	1
I ca n't believe that I find an acne cream that actually works ! ! I do n't even remember how many creams , lotions etc . I tried over the years until now for adult acne . This is the first time I really see some result and I even do n't use it regularly . If you put it on at night you 'll see the effect the next morning . Even if the blemishes do n't completely go away the next day , they reduce down in size . It helps with the redness and the pain . I have a very sensitive skin and this does n't dry out my skin . The only minor issue is that I do n't think it is completely vanishing . Some white residue still stays but it is manageable . Overall very gentle yet powerful cream . Definitely recommended .	1
I like it . It does n't make my face super shiny . However , it makes my face feel thick ( it 's not that bad ) . So far my blemishes seem smaller .	1
I recently started breaking out on my cheeks and jawline which was never a problem area when I was in my teens . This works if you use it just like the directions say : on clean skin , once a day initially then increase to several times daily . On day two I use it like every 2 hours.It makes the pimple or , in my case , underground monster , less visible and less irritating . It gets rid of any pain or soreness that makes me want to pick and pop . After day two it completely disappears.Honestly , the best thing about this product is that it makes me keep my hands OFF my face which is likely why I break out in the first place . Oh , and I started changing my pillow case every night .	1
I like this product and have returned to using it when the drugstore is out of my usual on-the-spot treatment . I use this product only at night - when the cream dries , it does leave a little flaky residue - for this reason , I would recommend using it only at night or other times when you are n't going to be out in public . It can dry out your skin a little . In the morning , I have noticed that my blemishes are much less noticable , though there are better on-the-spot treatments out there that do jsut as good of a job reducing blemishes and are n't quite as drying .	1
I used to have pretty bad acne , but thankfully it cleared up ! I do sometimes get the occasional pimple..yippee . Lucky me , I got a big one right in the middle of my cheek right before vacation . I bought this on a whim and thought I 'd try it on my bad timing zit . I washed my face like normal twice a day and covered the pimple with this . After a day , it was gone ! It was n't red and puffy anymore , and with a little make-up was nonexistant ! I do n't think you should slather this all over you face though , it does really dry out your skin and leaves it feeling kind of stiff and like you have dry soap on it ... but overall , I think it 's great !	1
This product helped dry out my acne the first day I used it . I use a very thin layer and let it sit over night then apply in the morning . A little goes a long way . I even apply makeup over it with no problems . It does n't dry out my face and I have sensitive skin . I will buy again .	1
This stuff works pretty fast it takes redness and swelling down within hours and the pimple is gone within 3 days no blemish left behind	1
The only bad thing about Neutrogena On The Spot Acne Treatment is that I did n't have it when I was a teenager , suffering from the worst acne ever ! I 've had acne for years and have used harsh abrasive cleaners , creams that dried my skin out , creams that irritated , and creams that did nothing at all . When I turned 25 I imagined my skin would clear up , but it never did . Then came 30 , 33 , 36 ... and the acne was still there , not as bad , certainly , but still an issue . Then I found this , and my life changed ! This product WORKS ... and I wo n't be without it . As I said , the only thing that could make it better is if I had it with me the week before the PROM ! If your teenager suffers from acne , they just do n't need to . Give this a try , and I think you will see results fairly quickly . It works for me just about overnight ! Thank you Neutrogena !	1
I use this product second in my regime ; I first use Neutrogena Extra Gentle Cleanser , then this , then finish off with Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer . I did a lot of research and found this to be the best B.P . product on the market . It is 2.5 % B.P and this is the amount you need in a product , if you go over that it is much too harsh for your skin ( especially mine because it is sensitive ) . Obviously if you have severe acne and need medication type products , that might be different for you . But for the average face , anything over 2.5 % B.P is much too harsh . I actually do n't buy this product on Amazon I just buy it at my local WalMart and it is about the same price on Amazon , minus the shipping charge . I 'd say it 's a pricey little product for the small tube you are getting , especially the way I use it all over my face but , hey it works and that 's why I stick to it . The other two products I use last months and are n't that expensive for how long they last so I can afford to use this product . While it says it is an `` On the spot '' treatment , I actually use it all over my face . Because it is not a gel and it is creamy , you ca n't really apply it all over your face then rub it in , you 'll have to apply a small amount to your finger and apply in batches . I do n't find this annoying or hard to do , though some might because it takes a bit longer . When I first started using this product I only applied a small amount to my face in certain spots to get my skin used to it . Progressively over 2 weeks I began to use more and more and my skins takes it like a champ now . Even though it is a B.P . product , I actually do n't get the stiff feeling after applying it all over my face . It also does not leave a white residue as other creamy products might do , it is a little difficult to work in if you 're using small amounts but it goes on well . I find that it clears my skin up well but of course I get an occasional pimple or so due to that time of the month or stress or whatever , but much less than I used to ! I always let this soak in for about 10 minutes or so before I put on my moisturizer . Overall , a small tube of the product and a bit pricey but it works and I would reccommend it for the average face !	1
This product is relatively good in the sense that it prevents breakouts . I usually put it on troubled areas every other night , and I 've had few breakouts since I started to use this . Even though there are several creams that are more effective prescribed by the doctor ( Aberela is extremely effective and my favorite for sure ) , this Neutrogena cream is the most effective I 've had without having a prescription . It does make your skin dry	1
It helps but because I have a t-zone it does n't really help the oily section . I keep breaking out . The acne disappears , but I would need to apply it several times a day . It 's not strong enough but it does control the acne break out .	1
I do have good skin and take care of it exceptionally well . This is a must go-to product for those times when my complexion needs some spot treatment . Instantly reduces inflammation and redness , allowing the healing process to begin immediately . Best price found on Amazon .	1
This moisturizer is perfect if you live in part of the country that has cold , dry winters and you have combo skin that tends to breakout . I may be close to 30 but I suffer from combo skin and the occasional breakout like a teenager . I formerly used products that contained salicylic acid because it claims to clear up/prevent breakouts . Not for me . So in my continuous search for a miracle product I decided I would give this a whirl - the packaging just looked clean and simple - yes , I was hoping the packaging was an indicator of what the product would do to my skin - make it look clean . And that it did ! This moisturizer was perfect for the Midwest winter months and into spring and even fall . However , it was a little too moisturizer for the Midwest , soupy summers ( my skin was a little too `` dewey '' by the end of the day ) .Be sure to try out the Purpose Facial Cleanser with this product ! It is just as amazing for combo , breakout-prone skin . And it 's super affordable !	1
I have been using Purpose products ever since I was a teen . I used to have acne and dry skin and needed a product that I could use to moisturize my face . Because my face is sensitive I would always break out but when the dermotologist recommended this product I was elated and am still using it to this day . It does what it needs to do to keep my face moisturized and looking young . I am 55 now and still have smooth beautiful skin . I recommend this product to anyone who has sensitive skin .	1
I 've used this product for many years . A friend who had combination skin told about it and I 've used it ever since . I have combination/oily skin and this product does n't make me breakout . I only have to use it in the morning before I apply my pressed powder . This 4 oz bottle lasts me for months and I love the price . I 've used very expensive moisturizers in the past and never had the success as I 've had with this one .	1
This lotion is the best that I 've tried . It 's lightweight , yet does the job of keeping my skin looking fresh and hydrated . I also love the fact that it has sun block in it . I use it in the morning and at night , and find that it works really well for me . It 's a great product .	1
I do n't have severe acne , but as I get older ( I 'm 39 ) I 'll get one or two large and sensitive blemishes a month that do n't seem to go away no matter what I do- not even prescription cream seems to make it better . The only solution is to do whatever I can to prevent them in the first place . I used the Aveeno salicylic acid pads for years , but they seems to do only a mediocre job at preventing blemishes . So I decided to go with the 2 % salicylic acid in the Stridex pads and see what happened.Within a day of using these ( just a light sweep over my face in the shower a few minutes before scrubbing my face with Purpose soap ) , the blemish I have been fighting with for the past three weeks DRIED UP and went away . In addition , my skin is n't nearly as oily in the late afternoons as it was.I was worried that these pads might be too drying for my skin , but so far that has n't been a problem at all . Again , I do wash my face a few minutes *after* I use the pad . The pad makes me skin tingle and it 's almost a relief to wash that off , so those with extremely sensitive skin might want to consider that.Also , the pads are tiny and thin . I usually have to use two to cover my entire face thoroughly . But still , they seem to be working well , and they are a great price.Highly recommended .	1
-Always clear up my acne-I usually use them twice per day but sometimes I 'll just use one if my skin starts to feel dry-Very good price	1
I 've been searching for an alcohol-free toner with 2 % salicylic acid . If you 're just like me , this is it . It stops the breakouts but does n't dry out your skin . I use it twice or thrice a day . Would n't use anything else .	1
My skin is pretty resilient and not easily irritated , with that being said I started with one a day but quickly moved up to two . I use this between my CeraVe foaming cleanser and my CeraVe moisturizer and they 've been working very well so far . They are pretty cheap and this order came with three boxes , but if you want the most bang for your buck you can cut these pads in half . I generally do n't use the entire pad so half is perfect and now you have 540 uses for ~ $ 11 .	1
Forget makeup removal tissues ! I have used these for years . They do exactly the job and do not make my face peel .	1
I 've become more unhappy with the Walmart stores in the upper north west Kalispell MT and Northern ID . They seem to have lots of stuff on a shelf but the item you are looking for is blank half the time or all the time and or worse no longer even has a place . Clearasel pads are one and I could n't even find Stridex . I tried stridex when I could n't get the usual at another store and over time by the end of the bottle liked them . A bit rougher but the liquid seems to stay wet all the way through the 90 pad container . And I use these also behind my ears and along my hair line and just into it on the back of my neck for mild psorisias . I think the stridex seemed to work better for that . Not sure why but it is wetter so perhaps making better contact with the skin through the hair . So when wally world let me down yet again ... I looked to mail order here on Amazon . And viola ... three pack which for me is 5-6 month supply .	1
My husband has struggled with acne for years , and this is the only product that works for him . I 've also found it to be effective on the few occasions I 've had a break-out . I would definitely recommend it .	1
Love this ! I actually use it for my bull terrier that has a bald spot on his tail and an expert told me to get Stridex and use daily ... so excited to see the good results ! ! ! ! ! !	1
These wipes are a great find . As many have mentioned , they are not easy to find in stores and you can not beat the price on Amazon . I use them as an adult , just recently , for nights . I am too lazy to wash my face and these wipes have been a great help in clearing up my dull skin . I find they are gentl and non-drying . They have a light , pleasant smell to them as well . My only wish is that they come in a subscribe and save option .	1
despite its maximum strength - the solution does not stink your face ( since the company remove alcohol from its ingredients ) and it is still very efffective . we have used this product for over 25 years and that just about sums it up on how we feel about this product . You need to try a smaller sample to make sure it is right for you and dont just take my word for it.Also , Amazon offers such a great value for money ! Packaging was just right as well .	1
This is a good every day facial scrub that does n't seem to cause any negative reactions to my skin . Leaves my skin feeling really soft .	1
I brought this for my daughter and the scent is nice and since she just started using it I ca n't give more info just yetbut so far so good	1
Have only used it for a week or so , but it seems to work ok . I like the clean smell and the way it lathers .	1
I used this facewash for a couple years and found it to be very nice for skin and with cleansing , took off makeup pretty well and was a nice mild scent . I only really stopped to switch to the oil cleanse method of face washing .	1
basics is a great product I loved because I have found is that from now on I will have more beautiful skin than I had and I have a few days using it and the change is remarkable zero fat and pimples	1
I was using regular antibacterial soaps and my hands were always dry and chapped and cracked until my dermatologist recommended using Cetaphil products and changing detergents ( free and clear ) , changing creams ( sensitive skin and fragrance free only ) . Now , my hands are clean and moisturized . This soap ( and Cetaphil products for that matter ) are awesome ! You 'll notice the difference right away .	1
just as it says a gentle cleansing bar without soap - therefore no soap film and does not dry skin	1
Being thirty , I have tried everything for my combination sometimes dryer in the winter skin ! I am prone to breakouts even before that time of the month . I am even more prone to breakouts when using harsh cleansers or even changing products to frequently . In the past year I have received four big cystic acne bumps and I am still trying to recoup from the scarring . After reading all of the better reviews about Cetaphil products and googling at the Cetaphil products at my local drugstore but opting for the fancier more expensive , well known facial cleansers - I am here to say that Cetaphil is the one brand that I trust most when it comes to my face and the rest of my bod ! Being more concerned with my somewhat sensitive skin ( After stepping out of the shower and sudsing my face with yet another harsh cleanser or even my shower bar of soap , my face was beet RED ! ) I have read that using a benzoyl peroxide zit cream or even benzoyl peroxide as an ingredient in a cleanser will kill that bacteria on your face which that nasty bacteria can lead to breakouts ! So when I spotted this bar of cleanser that stated it was antibacterial ( without benzoyl peroxide which on the bad side will cause early signs of aging on your skin - Bleh ! ! ! ) I have tested and tried it , even sometimes alternating with Cetaphil facial cleanser and what a difference ! My skin this past week has never been in such better shape nor clearer ! I am sticking to this and for 4 bucks I recommend trying it out for those of you who are prone to breakouts and cystic acne . Give it a shot like I did you may never go back to your regular acne cleanser !	1
Cetaphil Antibacterial Gentle Cleansing Bar is indeed the optimum choice for my problem skin.This pH balance non-soap cleansing bar is a super gentle all over body wash . I even use it on my face in lieu of shaving cream - it 's that soothing ! The antibacterial ingredient - triclosan , also helps protect my freshly shaved face.CONS : This stuff 's priceyCetaphil Antibacterial Cleansing Bar is very soft and it melts away quickly once it 's under the shower stream.TIP : To reduce wastage of this pricey cleansing bar , do n't lather up under the shower , lather up your washcloth instead and store your Cetaphil Cleansing Bar away from the shower ( I keep mine in a covered soap dish ) .Shop around on Amazon ... this product offers a few buying choices.Hope my review was helpful ...

I now get some other soap and it comes in 3 bars at a time . Cetaphil is a good brand but it is over $ 6.00 for just one with shipping .	1
This antibacterial soap this great for my acne prone face and leaves no greasy film . Very gentle and feels good .	1
Nothing else works especally if you have hormonal acne from high testoterone but this stuff is AMAZING . It 's super hard to find , harmon drug has it but other than that you got ta buy it online but it works well . The key is to use a diffrent wash cloth for your acne area then the rest of your body so you dont spread the germs and oils that make acne worse , then ONLY twice a week or so use those scrub gloves ( VERY GENTLY ) to exfolitae the areas . If you rub too hard it can cause more acne . But this stuff works well on backacne so far .	1
always great for acne	1
I truly love this soap . I have very sensitive skin and this is one of the few soaps that does n't dry out or break out my skin . Would recommend to others . It smells soft as well	1
This is a really nice soap and lathers up perfectly . Great for both my face and for shaving my legs .	1
the best & # 34 ; soap & # 34 ; out there , cleans , no after film , good for entire family , great for face , good clean face and body	1
I liked this soap , but because it had a short life span ( even when you cut it into chunks ) , I was about to chuck it . Then I realized you can buy it in liquid form . GREAT stuff . It is hard to find but it smells better and it has a pump which is awesome !	1
I use The Purpose Cleansing Bar for my face only . I have real oily skin and this works very well to combat against the oil . I find it to be more effective than some of the liguid gels I 've bought . Compared to the others , it is very economical ... it lasts a long time .	1
THIS IS A GREAT 'SOAP . ' IT CLEANS VERY WELL AND RINSES EASILY . I USE IT FOR BOTH FACIAL AND BODY . IS GENTLE AND DOES NOT DRY OUT THE SKIN .	1
As someone who has battled acne in the past and still gets occasional breakouts , I learned over time that the beauty companies will keep coming out with their new facial cleaners that are supposed to do some new thing that all the other previous facial cleansers did n't do . The cleansers that were advertised as for acne always made my acne worse , especially if they had salicylic acid . This is a basic facial cleanser that does everything you need . Personally I do n't want to wash my face every single day with a cleanser full of chemicals . The 6 ounce bar of this is a great value and lasts a long time . The only thing to be careful about with this bar is that it can be a little drying . Make sure you do n't use too much , and I always use a moisturizer . I use once a day before bed .	1
And she loves it . I also use 100 % aloe to seal the cuticles of the hair after shampooing as well .	1
Nothing to say except excellent . I use this daily . I can find lots of ways to enjoy.I love that this product . I have this little bottle and the giant one and I wo n't be without.I keep the aloe in the shower actually.I mix some in my conditioner for extra hydration I apply to face after shower while pores are still open . Mix with oil and apply to body.I also mix one tbsp of this with 4oz water and a tsp of jojoba oil ( or argan ) in a mister bottle for a frizz fighting spray . It works well . You just ca n't go wrong with aloe in my opinion.Aloe also makes a great styling aid . My bf uses this in place of gel now and he loves how his hair holds without looking hard and & # 34 ; wet. & # 34 ; It is also great for frizz free curls.I have troubled skin and I have really noticed that by adding aloe to my routine my face has calmed down a lot . It seems to give my skin a more even tone.I do a raw honey/citric acid mask in shower . Rinse . Blot with towel lightly . Apply some BP , spitz glycerin/ water , then apply a little aloe to lock it all in . My skin has showed huge changes doing this . My skin will never be perfect but this sure helped get it the best it can be .	1
This is the best thing in the world for burns , so recommend keeping some near the stove . Also best for sunburn , the quicker you apply it , the better . If you search for the uses for this product you will be amazed . Never run out .	1
To begin with when I opened the Gel I was surprised it had no scent . However , it made up for that with the amount of hold it had for taming unruly curls and my edges . Also , the gel does not leave any residue or buildup and can be used quite often . It doesnt have any unhealthy ingredients such as alcohol which can make the hair have a crunchy feel instead of a soft supple feel . I would probably suggest this for people who have a unruly curls or edges . Just dab a tiny bit between your hands rub where is needed and voila your hair will come out great . An added bonus is Aloe vera has healing properties for the scalp and is extremely healthy . Lastly if doing a twistout or bantu knots I would recommend this .	1
This the best face moisturizer that I 've ever tried . I started putting it on after showering , and after just a couple of weeks started noticing healthier looking skin.I 've tried quite a few different types of face moisturizers , and the only other two that match the effectiveness are hemp-seed oil , and coconut oil , but they both have downsides that the aloe does n't . The hemp seed oil looks oily on your skin , and my wife hates the taste of the coconut oil : - )	1
I have been very pleased with my purchase of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme , Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant . I use it along with a moisturizer each night . It tingles at times , but not to any extreme . It is not greasy or too heavy , but seems to last on my skin throughout the night . Happily , there is a notable difference in my skin ! I see fewer lines and my face is soft and much smoother . For the price , it is a bargain that lasts far longer than expensive products of a similar nature . I have found a product in Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Creme , Anti-Wrinkle Exfoliant that I will purchase again and again .	1
I absolutely love this product , however , I stepped out from `` fulfilled by Amazon '' or Derm Store and purchased from Beauty 4 you ; the product looks very different and smells very different from the product I have purchased in the past . So after I cautiously use It , I will come back with a review ... I just hope it does not mess with my very clear and flawless complexion.2 stars because I 'm just not sure what product is in the container , and `` real '' Alpha Hydrox is great and I do n't want to smear the Brand Name of this ProductAPRIL 10 , 2013 : Update ; I have used the product purchased from '' Beauty 4 you '' and I have not had any problems with the product . Alpha Hydrox has done what it has done for my complection in the past . However , I still suggest that one choose a reputable seller to purchase this product . Although , there are some very great stores on Amazon , one is always taking a chance purchasiang any product when stepping away from the Amazon Halo.Post Note : this product has really gone up in price , although $ 14.00 is still reasonable , it used to cost roughly $ 6.00 in the past , so watch for sales and deal breakers ! ... changed my stars to 5 ... .Good Luck	1
I 've definitely noticed a difference after using this product - especially right out of show or after exfoliating . I have been using this product for about 2 months now , and have noticed more of a & # 34 ; glow & # 34 ; to my skin , and a reduction of fine lines . It does burn/sting when you first put it on , I have sensitive skin and definitely felt the prickles the first time I have used this - nothing intense or painful , but you should be aware.Value - I have found a very small amount of this cream goes a LONG way , which is nice . A lot of small cream containers seem to empty so quickly , so it 's great that this product has a silky glide that seems to cover your entire face in no time . One caution is to make sure to use sun screen with this product as it can make your skin more susceptible to the sun .	1
i have oily and acne prone skin . this stuff is great . it 's the only glycolic acid cream i can use ... i hope alpha hydrox never stops making this !	1
I started using this creme about 6 weeks ago when I realized my 51-year old face needed more maintenance than it was getting . I 'm a Florida native with blonde hair and fair skin , so after a lifetime of sun my face had issues with some sunspots and a blotchy complexion . I do n't have problems with breakouts and only have a few faint `` laugh line '' wrinkles that I 'm not worried about yet so this review wo n't address those issues.Since I ca n't afford constant facials I did some research and developed my own skin-care regimen . Exfoliating dead skin cells is important so I decided an AHA product would be useful and ordered this creme and began using it most nights after washing my face . I leave it on anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then use an eye cream and moisturizing lotion . I had some very mild tingling the first time I used it but nothing after that - if you have sensitive skin you might want to try the 8 % version first and work your way up to the 10 % .After doing this for about 6 weeks I can see a definite difference in my skin that ca n't be attributed to just the moisturizing . The sunspots are still there ( and always will be ) but they are much , much lighter and less noticeable . The blotchiness has evened out considerably and I feel like I could run up to the store without makeup and not worry about frightening small children . [ ... smile ... ] As I said , I do n't have much in the way of wrinkles so I really have n't noticed whether this has done anything to clear them up or not . I doubt any skin product will do anything for serious wrinkles anyway , and if that 's your worry you 'll need to look into some kind of doctor or aesthetician 's services.I highly recommend this product for anybody who wants to get serious about taking care of their skin .	1
This is a very good product for a reasonable price . I have ordered this product several times and I will buy it again . This is a good seller , the product comes on time , wrapped well . Do as instructed , its a good product used with Enhanced Lotion .	1
Within a couple of days of using this product there was a bit of stinging and redness and slight peeling but that soon stopped . I had parenthesis around my mouth that is now starting to soften . Also , the faint crow feet near my eyes are fading . I also have creasing on my forehead that too are softening .	1
I am 45 and this stuff works . I have used a lot of different products since my teens . I have NEVER been disappointed with Alpha products . Simply they work . Alpha product lines tend to fly low in an already over stimulated market of commercials and new product wonders that appear in constantly in an ever changing money making industry devoted to our own vanity ( present company included ) . But these products work ! I can testify to that . The best thing is they are high in concentrate and low in price that is an A+++ in my book .	1
I absolutely love this stuff . They used to sell the 12 % Alpha Hydrox cream at Walgreen 's but they do n't carry it anymore . I learned years ago when I first started using it that the best concentration for an alpha hydroxy acid ( AHA ) is between 8 % to 12 % and the ideal pH is 3 to 4 . You can use a pH test strip to check the pH . The Alpha Hydrox cream has a concentration of 10 and a pH of 4 . The souffle works well too but the cream is cheaper and works exactly the same . I 've tried other alpha hydroxy acids in the past with a higher concentration of AHA but the pH was too high to make it effective . The higher the pH , the greater the buffer and that reduces the strength of the AHA and renders it useless . I 've been using this brand for years although I 've occasionally tried others . I have n't found anything yet that does a better job for the price . It really does help keep the wrinkles away . I do n't often reveal my age but when I do tell people I 'm 55 years old , their jaws literally drop . Makes me feel great !	1
This is a very cool product . I have dry skin , and I even used to have dry patches on my cheeks , which did n't look good at all , especially with makeup . This creme does make skin much smoother , and much fresher . It is not scented- it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell , but it 's very faint , and you ca n't smell it on the skin ( and I 'm super sensitive to smells ) .It stings quite a bit when you first start using it , and my skin looked pretty red too , but that does n't last more than 15 minutes . Also , the first week or two after I started using this moisturizer I started to break out a little- that is a temporary effect too . I guess , this is how this stuff works- that must be some sort of cleansing process for the skin . Now that I 've used this for about a month my skin is MUCH smoother and is much more clear , I can even skip the foundation , but if I do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.I have been using Alph Hydrox nourishing cleanser with this . For daytime use , I apply just a thin layer of this creme , wait for about 5-10 minutes , and apply my spf moisturizer , and then makeup ( sunblock is a must after this product , cause AHA is an exfoliator , and makes your skin more sensitive to UVA/UVB ) . For night use if my skin feels dry , I sometimes apply some Alpha Hydrox nourishing night creme ( it does n't contain AHAs ) .I 'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first , I do n't have many , and I have n't used this long enough , but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches , and for uneven skin , through faster renewal , and dead skin cell removal.I definitely recommend this product , it 's a great , truly effective creme , and you ca n't really beat the price !	1
I am . On my first jar and I definitely feel my skin has improved and is softer . I use this at night along with some Clinique washing and toning products . I do use another dry skin cream on dry areas like around my nose and eyes as they seem to require extra moisturizing . I think this product is a winner and priced right .	1
Useful inexpensive addition to my drawer of creams to treat my dry skin both day and night . This alpha hydroxy anti wrinkle cream gets used day and night while the others sit around waiting forever .	1
I have used this product for 32 years now . I am 76 yrs old and everybody always remarks how beautiful my skin looks and I know Iowe it to this cream and it is so reasonably priced and of course it is available on Amazon , bless them & # 9829 ;	1
I received this product just a little over a week ago and have used it at least once a day since . I have acne prone skin with scaring and dark spots , my skin is an olive complexion so I tend to scar easily and get spots . Since using this cream I have been able to wake and feel pretty good about walking around without using something to cover my blemishes . I have not had massive breakouts like I normally would and I feel like my skin has a touch of a glow to it now . I do not constantly run to a mirror to make sure my cover up is staying put . Will continue using this and most likely will repurchase when it gets low . Would order more now but it seems to be lasting well and I want to be sure it keeps doing good for my skin and is n't just a fluke ! Will update if it stops working for me.Update : Still works great ! I do still get a few pimples here and there and still have black heads some but nothing like before . I feel like this cream really helps my skin to not only appear healthy but also to actually be healthier .	1
Leaves my face , fresh , super clean and free of acne . Have started to use it on my hands and arms to prevent wrinkles too .	1
deep cleans and takes off all your makeup even waterproof makeup . I wouldnt recommend for dry skin though because it can leave it drier .	1
I got this to help with my acne . It does seem to clear up my skin a bit . I really like the price and I tried the Alpha Hydrox lotion but did n't like it as much as the foaming face wash .	1
I think this works wonders . It 's the only face wash I feel comfortable rubbing roughly over my eyes to remove my eye make-up , which it does wonderfully . It 's extremely gentle and reminds me of the highly dermatologist recommended Cetaphil formula . It 's a one-stop shop for cleaning my skin and make-up off at the end of the night .	1
I even use Alpha Hydros Foaming Face Wash to remove my mascara at night . It cleans my face without being harsh .	1
I have n't seem life-changing results , but there definitely is an improvement in the number of skin eruptions , as well as in the tone and surface of my aging skin . I will continue to use it .	1
I have pretty oily skin and was dreading the summer months as I hate looking shiny an hour into the day . I am crediting this face wash with balancing my skin and making the oil more manageable . I have n't change any other products in my routine so this has to be the golden ticket . I am not saying that everything is perfect but I do see a significant difference in the oiliness of my skin .	1
Bought this product before . I like it because it makes the face feel really clean and it only takes a little to do the job . Will be again .	1
I bought this instead of the moisturizer by mistake , and thought I 'd give it a try.It works better than most other cleansers I 've tried for my more mature , slightly acne prone , sensitive skin . It 's gentle , but effective and my skin feels really smooth and great after I use it . I 've noticed that it seems to make the Alpha Hydrox Moisturizer more effective . Definitely a plus . The size of the container is ample , and I use about a quarter 's worth for my whole face and decolletage , so it will go a long way .	1
this is my HG cleanser , i rarely use anything else . its not irritating and seems to smooth the skin somewhat . my skin is acne prone very sensitive , uneven and flushes easily , very combination . also the cleanser lasts me a long time : D loveee	1
I purchased all 3 products in this line and like this one the best . It does what it claims to do and the price is great !	1
I 've been using Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and Peter Thomas Roth Anti-Aging Cleansing Gel with good success for the last year . I decided to try Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash based on good reviews ( see beautypedia dot com ) and a sale price.The first time I washed I used way too much and took awhile to wash it all off . After that I switched to pea-sized squirts and it foams up and cleans great . My skin is dry to normal and I have n't had any of the problems reported by the low reviews.I 'll continue to alternate the three products .	1
I wanted a good face wash that does n't sting my eyes and leave them bright red with irritation . I read another reviewers comments that this face wash was non irritating to your eyes & decided to give it a try . It does the job and does n't irritate my eyes unless I intentionally open them while I 'm washing my face . Stupid , I know , but I kind of wanted to see if it would burn ? So here 's the report : not too much . It did burn but not nearly as much as some others I 've tried AND it washed out instantly & did n't leave my eyes scarlet with irritation.My personal favorite face wash is by Philosophy - but that 's a huge bottle and really pricey . This is a great size , does n't take up too much real estate on my bathroom counter & does the job . I 'll definitely order again .	1
Leaves my face soft and not dry . That is a good thing because I have used other face washes that irritate my skin .	1
Holy Cow , what a great cleanser ! This is one of the best best cleansers I have come across . Do n't let the cheap price fool you , this stuff works better than most high end brands . It is gentle but packs a serious punch ! This stuff cleans your skin so well and will not break you out . It also has a great smell too !	1
The best product or your money , glowing fresh skin ! Give it a try so worth it , trust me ; ) I have been using for months great results !	1
This face soap is great for removing ALL makeup , even eye makeup which I think is just great because it saves you from that extra step of removing eye makeup and THEN the rest of your makeup . Plus I occationally have eye lid ezcema and this has so far been the only face soap that doesnt cause flare ups !	1
Great face wash . I use this about 3-4 times a week in conjuction with another exfoliating wash and I think my skin looks better . I 've used for about 6 months and ready to order more . I 'm pretty picky with face creams and washes and I think this does the job in the description .	1
Been using it for years , as it does n't dry out your skin , and once a week I add baking soda to the mix and get a great facial with it .	1
Quick shipment.Customer Service was great.This product works very well with the other Alpha products.It however does n't leave my skin feeling very clean if I used alone w/o the other Alpha products .	1
Really does make your skin feel and look younger if you keep using it for several weeks . We use it with the moisturizer , and we 're pleased !	1
Mild and really nice feel when you wash your face . I have used all the name brands and this one is right up there and really better than many . very mild around the eyes too . I am surprised I am such a fan but truly it is good so the truth is the truth- : )	1
This is the best cleanser for acne prone skin . LOVE IT . After using it my face feels so clean . Much better than Proactiv or an other acne wash product . Try it !	1
I 've been using this face wash on and off for YEARS ! I just saw this at Ulta for around $ 6 so I will use this until they stop selling it.I started using Alpha Hydrox about 8 years ago . I had bad acne from using the pill and was on ProActive.This cleanser worked just as well and it was n't $ 40 ! My skin was so soft and seriously , after one day of use my skin cleared up.I 'm so happy I found this again . They 've stopped selling this at most drug stores.I have dry skin during the winter and super oily during the summer . This is great cleanser during the summer months.It 's a bit drying on my skin during the winter so I use Aveda moisturizer after.Btw , If you love Aveda cleansing gel , you might like this .	1
This face wash is an excellent gentle wash . I tried it because even Cetaphil and Purpose were drying out my skin and I have had no problems with this one . My skin is usually pretty oily and since using this wash I 've noticed an improvement . It has a neutral smell , foams nicely , leaves your skin feeling clean but not taut , and you ca n't beat the price .	1
I 've purchased this product falling for the `` Alpha hydrox '' name thinking that there is AHA in it for gentle resurfacing . And I was dissapointed to see only Citric acid in it out of all array of AHAs . Unfortunately I did n't notice all the ingredients listed . Oh well . It 's a good cleanser , foams up well and takes off all the makeup . I just wish it did n't have Parabens and Urea . I am not too fond of those .	1
This is gentle on my face , yet it cleans it very well . I have been using this with the Alpha Hydroxy lotion , and I have seen positive results on my skin . I recommend this cleaner . It does the job .	1
My face feels so smooth and clean after I use this . Top it off with the lotion and you 'll have great feeling skin .	1
I purchased this with the intent of using it on my upper arms for keratosis pilaris aka chicken skin . I had tiny white bumps on my upper arms that are similar to acne . For years it 's been a huge embarrassment since it looked like acne , not to mention , I am naturally a `` Picker '' I pick at every little thing . I have been that way since I was a child . I have seen doctors , dermatologist , estheticians , you name it . I have tried all kinds of different things with no luck at all . Doctors told me it was just allergies . I have done tons of research on treating this condition . I found that gycolic acid helps with exfoliating the dead skin cells . This has cured my embarrassing `` chicken skin . '' YAY ! ! ! Not only did it make my arms smooth , it also cleared my face up . I have suffered with oily skin FOREVER . I have tried every product out there almost , from the cheapest to the most expensive . My face was combination skin . I had lots of break outs . I thought I needed face wash for `` oily '' skin considering the a mouth if oil my face produced , on top of the pimples is develop . It did n't help I constantly picked at the blemishes . I started to use this as my facial cleanser , since doing so I do n't have blemishes . When I do it 's every great now & then . My face is no longer oily . I finally have a beautiful even skin tone . I have used this for 2 years now without any problems . You can purchase this at CVS & Walgreens for almost twice the cost of what you can get it on amazon for . At least try it , you do n't have anything to lose .	1
I bought this to help get rid of the keratosis pilaris on my upper arms and legs . The lotion did not help smooth out the little bumps and I found something better instead . Since I still had the whole bottle , I decided to use this as my night time moisturizer . I 'm in my 20 's so I have minimal wrinkles so I ca n't attest to how well it helps with those . My skin does feel tighter after using this though . Sometimes I use another moisturizer alongside this one because it can be drying . I would n't use it by itself if your skin is on the dry side . My skin has been smoother since I 've been using this moisturizer and I have n't had a breakout in a while . I 'm not 100 % behind this product , but I think it is doing what it is supposed to for my face .	1
I had done a lot of reading on treating cellulite and stretch marks and found a recommendation to try glycolic acid and AHA . I did a search on Amazon and stumbled upon the Alpha Hydrox which had some good reviews so I decided to give it a try.I 've been using it for about a week now , twice a day and I am actually seeing a reduction in the appearance of cellulite ! I 've been using on my hips/thighs/booty in conjunction with zone-specific exercises ( which in the past by itself has n't produced results like these ) . I was never overweight or large , so there was never a lot of cellulite , but enough to make me self-conscious in a swimsuit.I would say that the appearance of stretch marks is still the same , but for the price of the bottle this is definitely worth it for combating cellulite !	1
Walmart stopped selling this online . Amazon 's price is better without tax and handling charges . I 've used this for years , and it 's helped with cell turnover immensely . It takes time , but stick with it at least once a day , and you will see results .	1
I use this frequently at night . Then wash off in the morning . It does have just a little burning sensation . After 30 minutes to an hour I layer a face lotion ( with a little almond oil ) on top for hydration . I feel this keeps my skin looking fresh and smooth .	1
I have been pleased with the results of Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhanced Lotion . The packaging is not fancy , so the price reflects the product , and is reasonable . The lotion appears to be improving the texture and appearance of lines on my face and neck . As with other Alpha Hydrox products , initial use brings with it a tingling sensation to the skin , but it is not irritating over time . Overall , the product does what it claims at a no-frills price that I can afford .	1
I have been using the product for about a month . I ca n't really say I can tell a difference in my skin but I will continue to use the bottle and report back after more time . I will say that it says it is odor free on the bottle but it has a very strong , not very pleasant smell .	1
I 've only used this lotion on my neck where there were some tiny brown skin tags . They had been there for a very long time and I did n't know what to do to get rid of them . I was n't sure what this lotion would do but wanted to give it a shot . I applied it on my neck every night . After 1 week I noticed the skin tags had noticeably flatten . I continued to use it for another 2 weeks , and 60-70 % of the skin tags were gone . However , whatever left on my skin seem to be stubborn . They do n't react to the lotion anymore . I lost my patience and eventually stopped using the lotion . I am switching to ROC retinol serum and will see if it 'll clear all the skin tags . I plan to use the remainder of the AHA lotion on my face . Hopefully it 'll help to reduce my large pore size and acne .	1
I 'm ordering this for the 3rd time . I 've used it for about a year and it really helps . I 'm 56 , a natural redhead , with deep wrinkles and age spots on my face . It has softend the depth of a lot of my wrinkles , and faded my darkest age spots.They 're not gone completely , but definitely less noticeable . My skin tone is much more even . I use it morning and night . My skin is very sensitive and every other AHA lotion I 've used has caused breakouts . I get none with this stuff . My skin is very dry however and after letting this absorb for 5-10 minutes , I use Cetaphil moisturizer ... cream at night and the lighter Cetaphil lotion in the morning . Very happy with this product , which is 1/2 the price of drug store stuff and 1/4 the price of department store stuff with all it 's fancy advertising .	1
I waited a LONG time before writing this review because I wanted to be REALLY sure that this product was working for me . At first , I was using it along with another product in the Alpha Hydrox line , Alpha Hydrox AHA Souffle 12 % Glycolic AHA 1.6 oz ( 45 g ) , and experiencing problems -- it turns out that I was sold a container of the Souffle that was actually several years old . Whatever the cause , I stopped using the Souffle and have been using only the Enhanced Lotion alone for a few months now , and my skin is looking better than it has in years ! ! ! First , a little background information about me . I am currently in my early 40s . As a teen , I had very oily skin but only mild acne problems . In my late 20s/early 30s , however , I began to experience increasing issues with adult acne . Although the problem was n't severe , it was quite persistent and recurrent . I actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success . ( The only thing that really worked was Accutane , but that became WAY too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it . ) After that , I experimented with using various over-the-counter products , always with mixed results . More recently , I began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids ( AHAs ) . I did a lot of research of various products both here on Amazon and on the web site Makeup Alley , and after my failed experiment with the Alpha Hydrox Souffle mentioned above , I decided to try this product , the 10 % Enhanced Lotion . I am amazed by the results ! Within only a week or two of discontinuing the Souffle ( which made my skin break out even worse ) and using the Enhanced Lotion alone , my skin was MUCH clearer.Now , after using this product daily for about two months , my skin looks great : NO blemishes ! I do occasionally get a small pimple or two ( usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle ) , but when that happens , they fade very quickly , leaving no scarring behind . Also , I am starting to notice that the old acne scars I had from before I started using the Enhanced Lotion are FINALLY starting to fade as well -- that is taking longer , but it IS happening.I use this product twice a day . You only need a very small amount , as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face . At night , I will apply the product slightly more generously . ( It definitely does sting a bit ; this occurs with all AHAs . You can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top . ) In the morning , I will use only a tiny amount of the product ( or sometimes skip it altogether ) , and on top , I will use Olay Complete Lotion for Combination Skin with SPF 15 - 6 oz. , which contains a beta-hydroxy acid ( BHA ; salicylic acid ) and also SPF , which is important when using AHAs because of increased sun sensitivity . This combination seems to be working well for me . I have n't really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway , but when I do , I have been usingSt . Ives Fresh Skin Collagen Elastin Facial Moisturizer 10 oz ( 283 g ) .I am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products . Definitely , this Enhanced Lotion by Alpha Hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine , and I would n't hesitate to recommend it highly !	1
I love using this lotion because it does an excellent job of removing dead skin cells . In the process , my skin appears even .	1
I bought this item before and really liked it . A little goes a long way and goes into the skin with a greasy feeling . I will probably buy more when I run out .	1
This stuff is great . So happy . My skin is smooth and so much clearer and younger looking . Well worth the purchase !	1
This is a good proudct , packed well and delivered on time ... I would certainly buy from this seller again . I suggest tryng one thing in the Alpha Hydrox brand , this way ou will know if it is good for your skin .	1
I used this for the first time last night . My face did sting for about 10 minutes , and then I applied heavy moisturizer over it , and the stinging sensation subsided . I really liked the way my skin looked this morning . It looked brighter , and my face had less redness . I think I might be using too much of this product ; a little goes a long way , and I usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and , and I feel it may be overkill . I sort of like how it makes my skin red initially ; it gives me some color , almost like I was in the sun , but a healthy color , not like Retin-A red , where it 's splotchy and sickly looking . I hope this product does n't break my sensitive skin out , but I will update when more time has passed . I 'm using this on alternate days with Retin-A cream ( both at night before bed ) , as I have read several places that these two products work well if you use them on alternate days . I have very delicate skin , and I can only tolerate Retin-A twice a week , or I get a lot of irritation and redness ( not cute redness either ) .I used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week , and this AHA cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt , so I was n't alarmed . Lemons work great , but they are sort of messy and gross , and I do n't like the way it feels on my skin while I 'm sleeping . Lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion , but it appears that this AHA lotion has the same effect ; yay ! : ) UPDATE : I have been using this now for a few weeks , and I really like the results . I put it on after I wash my face at night , and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it . My skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother . Just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing . I wash twice a day , once in the morning in the shower , and then at night . I do n't use a wash cloth to wash , because that is too harsh for the delicate skin . I just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute . This makes all the difference in the world .	1
i have sensitive , very combo acne prone skin and this does wonders for me . i use it every night after cleansing and toning . this has seriously changed my skin ( at least while i continue to use it ) . this is HG for me . it stings sometimes when i use it , do n't let that deter you . you are going to love this ! pleeease give it a try .	1
My skin is oily , sensitive and problematic , but I bought this lotion and it does n't exacerbate acne or oiliness.I use this twice a day and I have noticed a shocking difference in my skin ! My breakouts are healing much faster than normal , a few new ones were coming out at first , but that 's pretty much stopped now.This product works better than ANY of my Rx acne treatments , and Proactive and Clinique acne regimens.Compared to tretinoin creams , benzol peroxide cream , a sulfur cleanser , and solodyn pill , this lotion works better than all of those . I never had these results so quickly.I do n't have wrinkles , I am 21 , SO I can not attest to that aspect.The smell is a bit funky , and it tingles a bit , but did n't bother my skin much & my ; skin is VERY sensitive ! Aveeno products irritate my face . This product tingles barely enough to notice.Also , a little goes a longggg way . You do not need much of this , at least my skin does n't .	1
Let me start my `` story '' by saying I '' m a black woman , age 47 and have always had great skin . . most people think I '' m 35 . So I decided to `` invest '' in my skin now that I '' m getting older by trying a product that helps preserve your youthful looks . I read all the reviews on this before I ordered it as I do with most things I order from Amazon , and was overall impressed . So , when this arrived I could n't wait to try it to see if I noticed any difference . Within a week I did but not before my skin had it 's little reaction to it . Yes it stung , yes I had a few little bumps pop up , couple red blotches , . .perhaps it was some `` junk '' working its way out -- because after that my skin looked more even , more radiant , little lines were less noticeable . . I really like this and will be sticking with it .	1
As a lifelong resident of Florida , at 51 I have skin that 's decorated with many , many sun spots . My arms and legs are especially affected by the spots and I 've been self-conscious about them for years . I 've been very happy with the Alpha Hydrox cream for my face so I decided to try the lotion on my arms and legs.I 've been using it now for about 6 weeks and the change in my skin 's appearance is fantastic ! The spots will never go away , but they are much , much fainter and less noticeable . Overall the skin is smoother and softer and just looks and feels much better.I use this most evenings , putting it on my arms and legs while I watch TV . I wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then put on a regular moisturizing lotion . I 've read warnings that the AHA will cause the skin to be more susceptible to sunburning , so I 've been careful to use a body lotion with SPF 15 every morning since starting this routine . I have no idea if the AHA really makes sunburning more likely , or if the SPF lotion is making any difference , but my skin looks and feels great so I 'm happy.If you have sensitive skin and have n't used AHA products before you might want to start out with a 8 % solution and work your way up , but I have n't had any reaction to this lotion . If I have a fresh scratch or boo-boo it might sting a little when I first put it on , but that 's it . I very highly recommend this product for anybody who wants smoother , better-looking skin !	1
This lotion is very good and the product is one I buy often , so yes I would suggest you try it and do as instructed.I will buy this product again from this seller . The price is right , shipped on time and wrapped well .	1
I do n't know if you can buy this in the stores anymore . Years ago , I could find it just about anywhere . I did n't think it existed until I ran across it at Amazon . I 've used different products since . So , listen up , I believe that AHA is a strong contributor to my skin looking as well as it does . I 've been using different strengths of AHA 's for years and have great looking skin .	1
I use in my anti aging arsenal . Use it about 3 times a week and feel I get value from this . It has a slight sting but does n't last long . I would recommend and use along with a regular moisturizer . I see a difference so enough said .	1
I was starting to get a lot of breakouts , even though I was in my 40 's . I was trying everything out there , and nothing was working . I had used this product a long time ago , and started using it again . I ca n't go without it ! My breakouts have decreased by at least 90 % after using this product . Highly recommended ! !	1
Two , actually . Glad to find it at this price.The last time someone asked my age , I told them , and they said they thought I was 25 years younger than that . I 'm sure heredity plays a part in that , as does sleeping each night hanging from the closet pole by my knees , but the Alpha Hydroxy has n't hurt either .	1
I received this last night and washed first with a mild soap then a Glytone Body wash with a loofah . After , I applied this and when I woke up this morning , I noticed a change in my skin already . *I have KP ( Keratosis Pilaris ) on my back and small areas of my thighs* Do n't expect a miracle overnight , but expect to notice a change in the way your skin feels instantly . You do n't need to apply much of this product . A small , less than a dime sized amount , is more than enough to work with . On the box it says that if application does not dry within a minute or less , you 've used too much . It 's true . I think this is a steal for the price and the thickness of this product . I look forward to more results after a week , two weeks , a month , etc . and will be back for a second review . 7/24/13	1
I 've used this product for 25 years on my legs and arms . It keeps them smooth and soft . It is n't sold locally so I have to order it online , but I 'm a dedicated customer . Good buy for the price and I love that they always state the AHA percentage .	1
I like it when I combine it with Lierac Coherence Firming Day Cream . This is too thin to use alone unless on sweaty summer days but for right now it needs to combined . When putting this on after you wash your face I feel some tingles . It seems to work . I 've been using this for a month along with the Lierac and I got a dewy complexion !	1
The tingly feeling is just amazing ! You will feel & see the difference as your skin will truly glow ! Amazon you are just amazing !	1
I saw a dermatologist on Dr. Oz recommend glycolic acid for aging skin . She actually said everyone should be using it because it encourages cell turnover and brightens skin , diminishing the signs of aging . On the show , one lady mentioned that she had used glycolic acid in the past but that it stung when she applied it , so she stopped using it . The dermatologist replied that we 've come a long way in skin care and that today 's glycolic acid does n't sting anymore . I 'm here to tell you it does , especially around the lip area ! I usually just blot with a cool wet facecloth and that stops the stinging . As far as effectiveness , it definitely works . Within a few days , peeling begins . At this point I stop applying it and use a good moisturizer . When the peeling stops , usually in just a day or two , I resume using the product . I alternate between glycolic acid and retinol , both of which cause peeling . I highly recommend this product . You ca n't get a better product for the price .	1
I used this product for two days with sunscreen and noticed that where my glasses sit on my nose it started forming a scab . I suggest people who wear glasses not use this on the bridge of your nose and sides where your glasses make contact . Just use a separate non-comedogenic moisturizer and then use this alpha hydrox lotion on places like your chin and cheeks and forehead .	1
I heard the excitement about Alpha Hydroxy from my favorite entertainment/health info show of Dr. Oz . I bought both the clearm and the lotion . The lotion is great . I think I like it ! !	1
I am a male in my mid 20s that has been suffering from acne since my early teens . I started using the Acne.org regimen many years ago , and found that to be sufficient for the most part . Or , at the very least , I thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that The Regimen was the best I could do.About a year ago I bought this stuff and for some reason I never used it but once - maybe because it stung a little . But a month ago I had literally the worst acne flare-up I 've had in years : something new every day , deep beneath the skin 's surface , and it just would n't quit no matter what I did . I went searching online for more ideas , and to my surprise , found this on Acne.org 's website with pretty unanimous acclaim ( which is impressive since acne `` cures '' seem to be very hit-and-miss ) . Needless to say , I found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night . To my surprise , the very next morning things were looking up : the swollen areas of cystic acne looked somewhat `` deflated '' , and places I could feel were about to erupt were no longer feeling that way . Over the next couple of days , the situation went from bad to nearly cured.Since then - about a month - I 've had literally had my longest stretch of acne-free living that I can remember in years . I apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day , and apply it to my whole face at night . Of course , I always wear sunscreen now and have added a tiny bit of Jojoba oil to that to get totally moisturized and protected skin.I have n't even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up , and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff . Although all acne cures are likely to have different effects on different people , this has been such a miraculous change for me that I just have to recommend it . It 's only $ 10 , it lasts a good while , and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face 's glow in general . In addition to being acne free , my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.10/10 ? I think so .	1
I use this as a night treatment about 3 times a week . It is a good price , as some of the aha products do n't have the potency of this , and are 3 to 5 times more expensive !	1
The cream sinks in well enough but really dont see any changes in my skin after using for 2 weeks . I have KP so was trying to get rid of but think I will stick to peels and shea butter.UPDATE : I continued with the cream just to use it up and my KP on my arms is noticeably improved . Put it on after shower and it soaks right in ! I will keep using and buy again ! Good stuff ! ! !	1
Great for daytime with 20 % vitamin C serum from Timeless and sunscreen . At night I go for PTR retinol fusion PM . I also do monthly 30 % glycolic peel , this AHA 10 % keeps my skin well maintained in between my peels . Great price too .	1
I wanted the lotion form and I was looking for a 10 % for at least $ 5 and I could n't even find anything less which is nuts . Tonight I seen this tor $ 5 which pissed me off because I bought the 10 % oil-free watered down formula and I hate it even though it has really high ratings . Oh well I am sure it will work anyway .	1
I started using Alpha Hydrox lotion I estimate at more than 20 years ago . I first purchased it at a Longs drug store , because I could see light brown spots coming on one side of my neck , I was in my mid 40 's and the little brown area was on the right side of my neck , I do not get in the sun much so I assumed it came through the car window while I rode in the passenger side . I knew from research that AHA 's that had at least 10 % Glycolic acid in them were supposed to even out your skin . I have always had great skin , never before had a dark spot or blemish . So I purchased this and used it after washing my face and appying Witch Hazel , ( which I believe is the best thing you can put on your skin ) . I put a small amount of this AHA lotion all over my face and neck . I could not believe it , after only a few weeks using morning and night the light brown spots were gone ! Since then I have never been without it , and although I am now many years from that first bottle . I still have great skin , no spots and the only wrinkle I have is a line between my eyes , most people get two of them I have one ! But I attribute my great skin to good care and good genes but most of all to this Alpha Hydrox lotion . It sometimes stings a bit after I have exfoliated my skin , but I have never had a bad reaction to it . I get many compliments on my skin and I do not wear any makeup . I do use Ponds cold cream too . The old tried and true stuff is sometimes better than the newer things on the market . You ca n't go wrong with this stuff . I only use a two pea sized drops , so it lasts a long time . I have recommended it to all the people who compliment me on my beautiful skin . I recommend it to all who read reviews too .	1
This lotion is 6 oz that contains 10 % glycolic acid . You do not need that much when you apply this lotion so it will last a long time , plus with the continuous skin exfoliation my skin has been so much softer .	1
I love AHA Lotion . Here are the reasons why : No # 1 . This is 10 % AHA in it which is the most percentage I 've been able to find in a face lotion . No # 2 . I noticed a difference in my skin over the course of 3 days of using this product and No # 3 . It does not dry out my skin . I just love this stuff . I have hyper pigmentation and lots of acne scars around my cheek and chin area and this product has lightened those areas a lot since I have first used it . No other product has came close.. I 've been using neutrogena , aveeno and those horrible harsh chemical peels in vain for years thinking it was helping my skin but ... I got a wake up call when I started using AHA , it 's awesome ! I use it about two times a day . In the morning and I leave it on at night . I love how it feels when I first put it on because I can feel tingling and thats when you know it 's exfoliating . I used something similar to this years ago and I loved the results but it dried out my skin way too much . I 'm glad they came up with a product for people with dry skin ! I love this stuff .	1
As a retired hairdresser I have some training in skin care and the Alpha Hydrox line is effective and modestly priced . It works better than the designer products at triple the price . Do n't waste your time or money on any product with less than 8 % glycolic acid , and do n't be suckered into buying brands that promise more than 14 % . The FDA mandates no more than 14 % , and those products that claim higher concentrations are `` fudging '' their formulations . One thing to remember ? When you try a new product give it 6 weeks of use before deciding whether or not it works for you . It takes 6 weeks for skin cells to go through their `` life '' cycle . It 's only after a full cycle that you will see full and true results . I love this whole line of skin care and have been using it for several years . I just turned 50 , and people are constantly asking what skin care products I use . You simply can not beat the Alpha Hydrox line for effectivness and cost !	1
I enjoy the entire line if Alpha product . These products allows your skin to repair and the products glide on leaving your skin so soft .	1
This product seems to be making my fine lines fade . I only use it around my eyes and sometimes my forehead on the horizontal creases . I have used it almost nightly for about a month , and even though my sleeping has been less than desirable , my fine lines are definetly minimized . I am using this as a preventive measure ( I am only 24 years old ) so not sure how it would work on more mature skin . My one criticism is that it also seems to dry my face out slightly . This product is very potent with Alpha Hydroxy Acids ( 10 % ) which can cause irritation , photo-sensitivity and flaking . Research has shown that AHA can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles , but there is little evidence to suggest long-term efficacy .	1
I do n't know why it took me so long to try this lotion . I have sensitive , oily and mature skin . I know it is supposed to be for dry skin , but it really does n't make my skin any oilier than any other lotion . I 've been using it a week and have noticed brighter , smoother facial skin . Fine lines seem to be disappearing . I am very pleased with this product and plan to continue using it .	1
I recently purchased this from a local store , I have to admit I only bought it because it was reduced price . But I have be using it twice a day for two weeks and the difference in my skin is very apparent . I am a black 46 yr. old , since using this my skin glows , my cheeks are naturally rosy , my skin tone is evening out and my pores look better . And my skin is so soft like a baby 's . I will be definitely be using this for quite some time , and the amount you get 6oz . is quite a lot of product . In addition to my face and neck , I have be using it on hands and they are smoother and less wrinkled . I wish I could bath in this stuff . I would highly recommend it and there was little to no smell from the product .	1
I can not believe how great this moisturizer is , especially for the price . It is such an excellent deal ! I use this every night after I wash my face , and my skin looks fantastic ( if i do say so ... ) I do n't have any breakouts , which i used to have occasionally , and my skin is so smooth . I 've recommended this to so many of my friends and family members , and they all love it too .	1
Omg this lotion has helped my Keratosis pilaris skin condition ! It has helped smooth out my skin and reduce the `` chicken skin '' look on my arms and legs . I am extremely happy with the smooth feeling skin and the reducing of the dark marks on my skin . I wish I had used this long before now . I still have a few bumps pop up from time to time ... but it is dramatically reduced . I use it twice a day ... morning and night . I hope it keeps helping ! : -D	1
Finally , I found a product that works effectively to reduce fine lines and smooths out skin . I have been using this lotion for approximately three months now and absolutely will not buy anything else . I have sensitive skin and although the lotion burns slightly when on my face , it is soooo definitely worth it ! I have been told I look younger ( late 20s , early 30s ) than my real age ( age 42 ) . I can honestly see the difference myself - even , healthy , younger-looking skin . I 'm very healthy but before using this lotion , I was getting acne on both my cheeks . I tried every acne creme from over the counter to prescription cremes and nothing worked . Since using this lotion , no more acne ! I have to attribute this 'miracle ' to my faithful use of this lotion in the morning and before bed . I also think it 's because at the same time , I purchased the NUFACE microdermbrasion facial toning device which I use approximately three times per week . As another reviewer here noted , if you purchase the Alpha Hydrox products from their own website , you DO get it for slightly cheaper ( with free shipping ) , esp if buying packages . I love amazon too ! !	1
I will let everyone know how it works along side my aqua glycolic skin care system . I am using this on my arms and legs .	1
I have been using this product for a couple of weeks and I really like it . My skin feels softer . I will continue to buy and hope it even does more in the long run .	1
At first this made my skin oily when using at night . I stopped using it and my skin started to dry out . I have very oily skin.Update : After using the glycolix 20 % pads and taking B-stress vitamins , my skin is getting dry . I started using this again at night and the oil free in the day . My skin is clear for the first time since my teens . Amazed ! Finally found my formula that works .	1
So i was a bit skeptical about this product at first . I tried it for a whole week and let me tell you-brighten skin tone-acne going away-old acne scars fading-new acne scars fading-softnes-smoothnessI just dont really like the smell . I did a patch test as they said . It burns on acne marks alil but no harm just working.How I use it before I go to bed i apply a peas size that all . I even started using it for my toes knuckles they have gotten hard from last summer.. and its helping ! !	1
I am using acne kit from acne.org . i got this to compliment that kit . I use this once week , but mainly for spot treatments . As soon as i feel a zit coming i apply this to it few times through out day and zit never really makes it starts healing away right away . Great lotion . And for spot treatment this bottle will last for years .	1
Not sure how to feel about this b/c I have not used it consistently yet . But when I do use it during the day it encourages my skin to form a greasy film over it that feels tight . I do feel a tingly sensation when put on . I believe it aids in accelerated skin turn over because I am seeing more dead skin ready to be sloughed away after I started using this product .	1
I bought this product along with the foaming face wash on a whim and I love it ! I have used many ( much more expensive ) skin care brands in the past , but none are this consistently great for my skin . I have oily combination skin that is prone to hormonal breakouts . I use this product each night ( start out using it every other night , as it might sting a bit at first ) . I have seen my skin even out and I 've experienced much fewer breakouts ! Horray !	1
Everything that we know that is in this product , does exactly as it 's suppose to . I 've used it for years and it gently exfoliates the skin while making it soft . Yes , it may sting a little going on , but that 's very typical for those of us that have sensitive skin .	1
I bought this product to eliminate some post acne marks that I had and it worked very well . The only thing is that you can not use it every night because since it is not oil free , it will cause some acne to come out - how ironic right ? It helps with marks , but it also causes what you are trying to avoid . Wish this came as an oil free product .	1
I have been having acne issues since i was 13 and im now 23 . Nothing ever seem to work for the acne scar . I am usually skeptical about people reviews but I heard that AHA could help and i gave it a try . My goodness ! Its only been 2 weeks and i am already seeing great improvements in the texture , tone and the overall health of my face . The price is just right and the quantity is definitely worth the bang for your buck . Do n't be scared when you get a burning sensation , thats normal and proof that it is working . Out of all the products i have used to treat my acne marks , this is by far the best and the price is a bonus ! This will have your skin looking so young , fresh and alive . You will glow ! Im so happy and slowly regaining confidence . i ca n't wait to see future results .	1
This lotion claims to be an anti-wrinkle cream , and guess what ? It does work ! I purchased this with the the Alpha Hydroxy face cleaner . It is mild and does not feel greasy on my skin . I plan to use this and reorder it when I finish it . I recommend this without reservation .	1
Start with the face wash and end with this . Clean , smooth and soft skin you 'll love . I wo n't go back to using anything else .	1
I bought this to help with wrinkles and dark spots . It does make a difference but you will definitely need another moisturizer since after you use this your skin will feel slightly dry and tight	1
This stuff really works . I typically use it twice daily : once in the morning and once at night . In the morning , I typically let it dry and then apply a sunscreen moisturizer . My acne has gotten better , my skin is smoother , and dark spots have gotten lighter . At 6 fluid ounces and 10 % glycolic , it does n't pay to buy more expensive products that come in a smaller size like the souffle ( which I also have ) .	1
I was very skeptical about buying this because I have tried just about everything out there on my skin . I have n't had any noticable results until now . I use this with Alpha Hydrox facewash . My skin has never looked better ! After the first week I noticed amazing results . I have oily acne prone skin , but the combination of the two products has made a huge difference in my life . My complection has never looked better . I finally feel comfortable going without my make up , which I have n't done that since I was 13 , pathetic huh ? I reccommend this to EVERYONE ! It 's worth every penny ! I started noticing fine lines in my forehead so I wanted to find a anti-wrinkle cream to help with all my skin issues , uneven skin tone , breakouts , oily skin , etc.After a 2 weeks of this wah la ! PERFECTION ! ! ! !	1
This performs well and at this price , you get a big bottle that should last quite a long time . Recommended !	1
This lotion in okay , not greasy , not very moisturising either.I bought it after reading the benefits of including glycolic acid in my skin care regimen , it was intended for my face . I have not used it for that long on my face , as I use Tretinoin most evenings . When I did use it , it was somewhat sticky , stung a bit , and I did not notice much in terms of effect or benefit from it . I did not break out , but it did not help with the acne and other sundry bumps on my face.However , I had these small bumps , in the fold behind my knees . I read on Amazon that this lotion could help , and indeed it has , within about 5 days the area has been completely cleared of the bumps.I will continue to use it all over my body , and face , whenever I am taking a break from Tretinoin .	1
Basically , a good product that delivers all it says . I love all of the Alpha Hydrox products because they work and they are inexpensive .	1
Great stuff . If you have blemishes , this works and clears in a month with twice a day application . In day time I use as smashbox . spf 20 over top of it .	1
I 'm nearly 25 and still get moderate breakouts . The worst part are the red marks that hang around for weeks even after the blemish is gone . This product is not only keeping my skin clearer , thus avoiding more red marks , it 's also fading the red marks that were already there . My face has n't been this clear in a long , long time . I use it once in the morning and once at night . It goes on nice and light under makeup - I ca n't even tell it 's there . I ordered one for my sister after having such great success with it myself .	1
It is a little harsh but I suppose that is the nature of the acids . I do n't use it every day . But it compares favorably to other similar products I have used .	1
This is a good product and you can just use a little bit to hae a good result . The sellers were good for they packaged well and shipped fast .	1
Since I tend to have acne scars and dark spots around my face , I decided to try this after so many good reviews . I wasnt disappointed only except for the fact that it needed a pump . Other than that , its light , absorbs quickly and does what its supposed to do and my skin looks more even and soft .	1
Happy with my purchase . Keeps skin clear and smooth . I bought this for my fine lines , and have noticed a slight improvement . That 's all that can be expected from a topical product , so I am happy . Worth the money and since a little goes a long way , it lasts a while . I use morning and night , and use an SPF during the day .	1
I 'm 48 and Mom is 75 yrs old and ANY moisturizer gives us immediate acne . I 'm glad I found this again , the AH souffle is a tad oily . The no-oil formula is a godsend , no more breakouts . The product exfoliates according to how much and how often you use it ( overuse will get you a red face ) . It provides a gentle peel effect that starts working quickly drying up oil and acne . I like the rate of peel ; no scaly face . In 2-3 months I had smoother skin , slightly smaller pores , and better skin tone . Using Alpha Hydroxy I have received the first EVER complements on my skin . I have very few wrinkles for my age . I 'm not saying I look 30 , but I look good . Mom 's a recent convert , her skin has smoothed and she has noticed a difference .	1
I have been using this product for several weeks and can definitely see an improvement in my facial and neck skin . It is n't at all harsh . I 've experienced no peeling , but the results are there .	1
I have n't been using this product long , but I feel like I am seeing an improvement in my skin after just a couple of weeks . I can tell it 's working because I get a mild burning sensation shortly after I apply it , but it 's not bothersome and goes away after a short time . The price is beyond reasonable .	1
This product makes my skin look smooth but I have to use it sparingly . It can dry your skin so I use it every two days . I like to use it under other products to enhance their benefits . This is a good investment .	1
This has really been helping me with some new acne I have been getting . Its clearing it up quickly . be sure to wear sunscreen with this product .	1
I am using this in tandem ( switching nights ) with other products that provide chemical exfoliation for my horrible skin , so it is hard for me to speak about its effectiveness specifically . That said , I do know that I have had no problems with this product . I was concerned that it would irritate my skin , as I am certainly prone to irritation and redness , but I have had no such issues at all . It seems to be the gentlest of the products that I use . My skin is looking ( relatively ) fantastic lately , and this probably has something to do with it !	1
Highly recommend for oily skin . Could be a little drying for other skin types , though . I have had excellent results with this product , and I have tried EVERYTHING , both over the counter and prescription . I find this works best during my `` downtime '' from Renova -- I take 3-6 months off after an 18-month stretch to give my skin a break . During the down time I use ROC at night and this in the morning . It mimics the dermatologist-prescribed routine I am normally on , just gentler . Be sure to wear at least SPF 15 when using this product !	1
I hate the creamy feeling when i use the other product no matter what they claim as oil free i still feel really uncomfortable after few hours after uses , but this one gives me a light but enough strenght to keep my face clean and hydrated .	1
I have skin so porcelain and sensitive that even ancient Chinese pottery experts would be baffled by it . So , needless to say , finding a soap that does n't irritate it can be a baffling chore . Enter : Aquanil.This stuff is , honestly , perfect . It 's so soft and light in your hands that it feels only slightly more substantial than the small amounts of water you need to dab your face with pre-use . Once you 're sufficiently wet enough , apply as much or as little of the soap as you want and you 'll barely be able to feel it once it 's in place . Scrub to your heart 's content- no abrasive soap suds here- and then rinse gently with water and you 're done . It 's like an odorless , colorless waft of air just hit your face , not a state of the art soap product.Have sensitive skin ? Tired of unpleasant soaps with weird fragrances and color additives and grainy suds ? Then this is the cleanser for you . It feels like a delightful cloud passing across your skin . Except , y'know , cleaner .	1
I 've been using this for years . Very mild for sensitive skin . Good for rosacea . Oil-free . Leaves my skin very soft . I found Cetaphil irritating but this never is . It does n't irritate eyes either . I expect to buy this forever !	1
I like this much better than cetaphil because you can use it on wet or dry skin so if you are getting in the shower you can wet your face , cleanse and rinse off . I am also washing my hand with it that has eczema and it has gotten it under control along with an RX from my derm .	1
My Dermatologist suggested I use this and I really like it . A few days a week I add a pinch of baking soda and use it as a scrub . It makes my skin really smooth and does n't irritate it at all .	1
This was recommended by my dermatologist . I use hazel witch astringent to remove oil , then I rub this in just like a lotion ... no washing with water ... it cleans your face and does n't over dry it , which can actually cause pimples . My face never has redness from other cleansers that I 've used with water . Great for sensitive skin and people prone to break outs .	1
Great base for makeup , fragrance-free and silky on the face . Why pay hundreds of $ $ $ when nothing can erase wrinkles ? I 'm hooked .	1
This product is wonderfulIt came fast and it makes my skin moisture and smooth.I am really satisfied and happy .	1
This is heavier than the lotions so I normally use it on my arms and legs , and a dab on my face at night with the lotion . It 's fragrance free , does n't break me out and helps with winter itching . I recommend for sensitive skin types like mine , because cold weather makes my life miserable . Always has . Dry skin , rough hair and five months of no light . At least there 's a lotion line out there that cures one of those issues . Could the makers of cetaphil please destroy winter as we know it ? I 'd really appreciate it , if this global warming deal does n't work out ... thanks . Oh by the way , I think they changed the formula because it 's easier to spread .	1
This is a fine moisturizer , one that I often turn to in the summer when my skin suffers from too much exposure to the sun or too much air conditioning.It 's also helpful in the winter when skin suffers from wind and cold . It 's a bit of a first-aid treatment for my face.It has been a great hydrating lotion for me , as well as effective on rough , chapped areas such as heels and elbows .	1
Last few months , I 've been researching moisturising things , mostly for my hands ( but the rest of me too ) . Maybe it 's age creeping up on me , or it 's my endless washing of hands , but about a year ago I noticed I started to acquire those old-man hands with dried/parched skin , especially on the back of them . So I 've been trying all kinds of cremes and lotions ( go to my reviews page and see ; I 've reviewed some of what I 've tried ) . A lot of them help , some more , some less , but amazingly , after all this effort , I was in a drugstore on an unrelated errand , and bought -- on impulse -- a jar of this thing here , Cetaphil . I 'm not even sure why I did : I 've never heard of it before , and I always look for the ingredients to be natural , w/o a chemical factory listed there . Well , to be fair , Cetaphil is n't bad -- no parabens , no fragrances , no colors . But otoh , it 's got some chemistry in it though , alcohols and what not . Well , anyway , I got me a jar and tried : wow ! It 's perfect , better than everything I tried bevor , natural or not natural . It is:1 . Bland and neutral ( no smell whatsoever ) .2 . Not greasy at all , not even initially.3 . Thick but not hard to spread because it 's somehow strangely slick , like frozen sour cream I 'd imagine would be ( except it 's not frozen ) .4 . Extremely effective : produces even-textured and even-coloured , supple and hydrated skin in one day ; does not clog pores ; skin stays hydrated at least a day ; survives a handwash or even two somewhat ( and then , it 's easy to reapply if you need , 'cause unlike a lot of other things I tried , it does n't smell and therefore can be used at the office w/o bothering anyone around ) .All my researches and expense , and the 100 % -adequate answer was sitting on the shelf in my local drugstore ( Walgreens , thirteen-ninety-nine a jar ) . Who would have known ... and it 's two to four times cheaper than other thing I tried . I also got the lotion , to compare . I like the creme better ( it 's more `` substantial '' , persistent ) , but both are good though.Bottom line : Very highly recommended.PS . One thing I 'd like to see that 's not available is smaller ( portable ) packages . I ca n't go around with this bucket on me , it 's too big : it 's good for home , but I want a small dispenser in my briefcase . There was a small ( er ) , 8 oz , bottle of lotion available there , but no cream in a small container . For now , I 'm stuffing a small amount in a tiny tin from Burt 's Bees Hand Salve , but it 'd be nice if I did n't have to do that.Note 1 : it 's even cheaper in Wegman 's ( like ten bucks , +/- ) .	1
I get extremely dry , itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather . I have all kinds of lotion , and for some reason never tried Cetaphil . I bought this and it 's now the only thing I use -- it 's that good ! In addition to dry , my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well . I 've used Aveeno with some success , since it 's unscented , as is this . I found the main advantage in this as opposed to Aveeno is it 's extremely moisturizing . I smooth it on in the morning and find that at the end of the day my skin is still very soft and not at all dry . It 's the longest-lasting lotion I 've ever tried . It 's not at all too heavy though , or sticky and it absorbs well . It 's nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent . I would highly recommend this to anyone , from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions ( e.g . psoriasis , eczema ) .	1
without a doubt the best facial moisturizer I have ever used ! Tried hundreds and this one is the best !	1
this is amazing , i have conbination skin and it works very well with the cleanser . i have been telling everyone how great this is	1
My dermatologist recommended this to me 10 years ago and I still use in when I occasionally have dry skin . I do not use it as much anymore since it cured my dry skin , if you have eczema , this really helps .	1
Love Cetaphil ! Used to spend big bucks on those fancy dancy products at the dept . store . Tried this at the recommendation of a dermatologist who told me all that I really wanted was a good moisturizer ... .that a prescription would be needed by those companies if they lived up to their claims ... ..I 've been using Cetaphil ever since ... .also the cleanser.You just ca n't go wrong . It 's non -greasy , keeps your skin moist all day ... .and before you go to bed , after washing your face , all night ! It can be used all over your body actually : those elbows ! I get told all the time that I look much younger than I am , and also that my skin is beautiful ... .well , I dunno about all that , but any help I get is because of Cetaphil . I also like bare minerals radiance ( slight shimmer ) and Nars for some of their liquids ( blushes ) that I put on to make my skin have a dewy look .	1
I love this stuff . I use it as a facial lotion . This tub has lasted me over a year and I use it on a daily basis . I have extremely sensitive skin and this lotion has n't irritated my face at all . It also has NO smell at all , no weird chemical smells or anything . It goes on a tad bit greasy if you use too much , but it quickly absorbs . It also does n't irritate my acne . When I do n't use this product , my face gets really dry like it usually does , but it works great when I use it . If I had to pick a con , it would be that I hate that this product is in a tub ... ..since it lasts so long , I do n't like the thought of dipping my hands into a tub , it feels unsanitary . If you accidentally forget to put the lid on , the product gets hard at the top ... ... either way , whatever . It still works great .	1
My dermatologist recommended Cetaphil . I tried the lotion and the face wash and honestly nothing special . Then I saw this in Costco while looking for my daughter 's cream ( she has ezcema ) and thought `` why not try this '' . I fell in love with this cream after the first try . This is woooonnnderful ! It has a non greasy feel , doesnt leave skin sticky , lathers and absorbs really nicely and quick enough for my toddler to get her clothes on post bath time . I also love it for myself on my arms and shoulders ( i dont use this for my face though ) . I find that this doesnt clog my pores , since I have acne prone skin on my chest , back and shoulders I was worried it would be a problem there . Nope not at all . I live in a very cold climate and with the drying heat always being on , I get dry patches of skin , this will eliminate them 90 % overnight and totally by the next day . Im so happy I finally found something that works well with my sensitive skin and acne . : )	1
This lotion was recommended by my pediatrician and sister who also uses it on her child . I love it ! It is very soothing and moisturizing , especially when you are washing your hands a million times a day after changing diapers . It keeps my baby 's skin soft and my hands from drying out . It 's great for the whole family .	1
Originally purchased to help with my grandson 's excema , now the whole family uses it ! It does n't have much of a smell to it , and moisturizes very well .	1
My grandson has dry & sensitive skin and his parents need to lotion him 3 times a day . This cream generally goes on his face soothingly . It keeps his face lubricated and helps minimize eczema when used diligently . This is a quality name brand product .	1
Well , you 've no doubt heard from some other reviewers that cetaphil 's moisturizing lotion formula is greasy so I wo n't beat that into the ground . It does bother me that a product with the 'lightweight ' and 'non-greasy ' monikers does not live up to expectations . However , if you put a very very small amount of water into the bottle ( several drops ) , just enough to curtail the thick viscosity , you should be fine.Aside from that the product does the job . If you are looking for a non-comodegenic , hypo-allergenic product then this is for you . If you are also looking for an oil-free product , then this is not for you .	1
I have been using Cetaphil products for the last 15 years . These tubes are great to carry around and fit easily in my purse . The cream can be used on face or body . It is unscented and is very easy on my sensitive skin .	1
I moved to the high desert plains a couple of years ago and the combination of low humidity and hard water began to wreak havoc on my skin . I 've tried many different products at many price points , including some extremely expensive ones . Lotions did not last and most creams I tried felt too heavy or either looked *or* felt greasy . This Cetaphil formula has the perfect balance for me ; it is light enough to sink in deeply and thick and creamy enough to make my skin feel incredibly soft and have that feeling last.TIP : I buy this extra large size to keep the cost low but I reuse small cream containers to make this `` portable '' .Leaves my skin soft and supple . Does n't leave a scent . Does n't cause breakouts . Quite simply the best !	1
I did n't expect to like this cream as much as I do . It 's an excellent value and I do n't plan to be without it in the future . Cetaphil now sits on my bathroom vanity and is used as a routine moisturizer for my face , elbows , arms and any other moisturizing needs.The scent is clean and very minimal so it does n't iterfere or offend.It has n't caused any breakouts and seems to hold moisture longer than many of the high-end moisturizers I 've tried.Excellent product and a terrific value.The glowing reviews here were my reason for trying it and I 'm very glad I did .	1
After many different skin moisturizers for my sensitive skin , I stopped at this one to balance my skin type . No perfume and not greasy .	1
Absolutely love this cream . I have combination skin with oily t-zone but my skin dries out near my cheeks , near my eyes and chin . I use this cream twice a day -- once at night after a shower and once in the morning after washing and cleaning my face . A lesser moisturizer would result in dry skin by lunchtime but this cream really keeps my skin moist and soft . Super safe around eyes and works into skin really well . No added scents ! I 've tried lots of different moisturizers and this one is by far the best .	1
another great subscribe and save product . It 's the only hand cream that I can rub on and it actually rubs in . Does n't feel greasy and over time , do notice a softening of very dry , well used hands . I 'm a dirt digger , so if it works for me , it 'll work for anyone . I also have sensitive skin and can break out with the wrong stuff ... not w/Cetaphil .	1
This is my go-to day to day moisturizer . I liberally apply this after showering to keep my skin smooth & moisturized through the day . Being able to buy two 16-ounce jars from Amazon has been great ! This product was originally suggested by my dermatologist to help with my very dry skin , and after I 've been delighted with it !	1
I 'm a product junkie . I have bought every expensive cream , lotion , anti-aging product out there and spent tons of money doing so . This cream is amazing . Seriously ! About my skin in case this helps : I have very dry skin that is prone to break out . I felt I had wrinkled prematurely because of sun damage so I was focusing mostly on the wrinkles when I bought products . Often my forehead would be flakey and my chin would have breakouts . Frequently I had red patches on my skin and a very uneven skin tone in general.Since using Cetaphil : I have NONE of the flakiness and have not had one single break out . Also , my skin looked more wrinkled than it was because it was so dehydrated . Cetaphil has seriously taken ten years off my face and body . Oddly the place that I can tell the most difference is in my neck as I do n't have that crepeiness ( Not sure this is a word ! ) . I 've thrown everything away and have started stockpiling this stuff.I have NEVER had a product that made such a difference . My make up now looks better , I actually glow and I do n't feel like I look my age anymore . I use it on my whole body and for the first time ever , I have an even skin tone . I can not recommend this highly enough .	1
My kids have eczema . I was walking around Walmart looking at soap section . A woman saw my kids and told me to use Cetaphil soap/body wash followed by Cetaphil cream . My kids are 9 and 10 . I ask them how their skin feel after using the Moisturing Cream . The 9 year old said her skin felt softer and smoother . The 10 years shares the same opinion . I felt it was softer too .	1
I have tried many different lotions and this is the best one I have ever tried . It keeps my skin moisturized without being overly oily and sticky . It does n't dry out my skin after and it is fragrance free . It does n't leave a noticeable residue or layer of oil on my skin . It is well priced too . I have used expensive brand lotions that only dry out my skin more , leave my skin too oily or irritate my skin.Cetaphil is amazing .	1
This cream is teriffic for dry , chapped , cracked hands . This cream is totally non-irritating and totally fragrance free . I slather it on at night and wear a pair of inexpensive white cotton gloves , although you do n't really need them because the cream is not greasy.White Cotton Parade Gloves ( By the way , no need to buy expensive `` medical '' gloves -- the cheap ones work fine . ) Works like a charm ! Also keeps cuticles soft and preserves that manicure . Highly recommended !	1
Our pediatrician recommended this when our 3-mo . old had moderate eczema , and after 1 or 2 uses , we had a baby with very beautiful skin . To this day , he 's 14 mo . old now , we still use it every night after his bath . Great for infants and toddlers .	1
My dermatologist recommended I use this product after I developed acne in my mid 20 's . Thus far it 's been perfect and keeps my well moisturized and breakout free .	1
Dermatologists everywhere , including my own , recommend this cream for patients with eczema . The main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick and it contains no fragrance . I 've used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it , even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.I decided tonight , for the first time ever , to analyze every one of the ingredients . It 's disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients thatCetaphil Lotionlacks . Perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol ( see below ) .Ingredients : Water , petrolatum , glyceryl polymethacrylate , dicaprylyl ether , glycerin , dimethicone , glyceryl stearate , cetyl alcohol , Prunus amygdalus dulcis ( sweet almond ) oil , PEG-30 glyceryl stearate , tocopheryl acetate , benzyl alcohol , phenoxyethanol , sodium hydroxide , acrylates/C10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer , dimethiconol , disodium EDTA , propylene glycol.Petrolatum : This lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist Robert Chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called `` rod wax . '' On the plus side , petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known . It is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin . Premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid ( not the same thing as urea ) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water . On the minus side , many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin . In addition , as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body , there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately `` breathe . '' That is , it prohibits the skin from a normal , necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere . As a result , petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.Glyceryl Polymethacrylate : This substance is used in cosmetics to hydrate the skin by increasing its ability to absorb moisture from the air . It is presumed to help heal and reconstruct the dermis layer of the skin and increase skin firmness because it contains elastin.Dicaprylyl ether : This is an oil derived from a plant , AKA dioctyl ether or Cetiol OE . It functions to condition and smooth the skin . It is a non-greasy emollient that spreads easily and is commonly used in non-irritating or `` sensitive '' skin-care products.Glycerin : Glycerin AKA glycerol and glycerine is commonly found in medical and cosmetic preparations . It is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant . It is safe enough to be consumed internally.Dimethicone : AKA polydimethylsiloxane ( PDMS ) : This is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon , a naturally occurring earth element . It is approved for internal and external use . Allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder . They include itchy , burning skin , hives , dermatitis , swelling of the mouth and breathing problems . Silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients . They make anything they are in more spreadable . They cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth . They create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent , much like petrolatum . They can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.Glyceryl stearate : This ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid ( a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils ) . It functions as a moisturizer , but it can be a skin irritant for people with sensitive skin.Cetyl alcohol : A fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil . It is used in cosmetics as an emollient , emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions . In rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant , but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.Prunus amygdalus dulcis ( sweet almond ) oil : Very safe , natural oil.PEG-30 glyceryl stearate : Emulsifying agent . It is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.Tocopheryl acetate : This is a form of vitamin E , a safe preservative . It is generally healing to the skin , but some people can develop an allergy to it , resulting in skin rashes , especially around the eyes . In my own case , I am very allergic to pure vitamin E around my eyes , but I have never experienced any allergic reaction to Cetaphil Cream.Benzyl alcohol : This substance is used as a preservative in IV medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties . It is considered very low risk . It is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas . It is found in many essential oils , such as jasmine , hyacinth , and ylang-ylang.Phenoxyethanol : When information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted , quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe . Unfortunately , research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic . Many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it . It can worsen skin conditions like eczema , and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.Sodium hydroxide : Like potassium hydroxide , this is another name for lye . It is used in the paper and chemical industries , for the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents , for pH regulation , and in the production of aluminum . It is used to neutralize acids and increase the alkalinity of whatever it is in . I would presume that is the reason for its use in this product but -- lye ? Really ? Acrylates/C10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer : This is a lab-derived , white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market . It is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets . Though considered safe enough to consume internally , like Vitamin E , some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling ( dermatitis ) . So far , I 've never personally developed an allergy to Cetaphil so , presumably , I 'm not allergic to this ingredient.Dimethiconol : Similar to dimethicone ( see above ) .Disodium EDTA : This compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages , cosmetics , contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages . When combined with vitamin C and sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) , it forms benzene , a dangerous carcinogen . This chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.Propylene glycol : This lab-derived compound is a form of mineral oil commonly used in brake and hydraulic fluid and in antifreeze . Cosmetic products employ it as a humescent , to prevent the escape of moisture from the skin . Unfortunately , the Material Safety Data Sheet of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin . In addition , due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin , it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities .	1
we have tried everything from eucerin on up ... and this works the best . This cream is thick , and we apply it after baths ... ... notice a huge difference if we skip it . works great on dry skin , and although it is sold locally , I prefer to buy it here to get a 2 pack ... .	1
I buy this sat Costco when it is on sale and went on Amazon to do a comparison price check . I do not use this as my everyday body cr & egrave ; me , even though my dermatologist wishes I would . This is non scented and I tend to use it at night after showering before I go to bed as it very rich . I turned on a friend to this as she has very dry skin and now she uses it every day . Important to note : scoop a small amount onto your hands and rub your hands together to 'melt it down ' before applying to the body .	1
My skin is very sensitive and this is the only product I 've found that works very well no matter what weather we 're experiencing . I 've been using all Cetaphil products for about 7 years now and would n't trust anything else on my skin . I LOVE IT ! ! ! I recommend this product .	1
I got this tip from a co-worker who 's daughter had terrible acne-I use it as a body lotion and also on my face . There is no oily residue	1
I was told by my dermatologist that she could only strongly stand behind two products for moisturizing . Eucerin and Cetaphil . Since my skin is so dry , especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more , I have tried both . I think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked , dry , red skin , the thing about Cetaphil ( specifically the cream in the jar -- not the pump lotion ) is that it is not even a tad bit greasy compared to the former . It eliminates dry skin within a few hours . My friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter . Both of her children also have hands that look so chapped you would think that they were sunburned . I bought this to give her a sample of as well . She keeps it right on the counter , and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works . Besides its effectiveness , the odorless , nongreasy , tasteless , very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that I have ever come across . I use it on scratches that I get very easily during the winter , I use it after shaving , even to calm down the sunburn over aloe & vera . At this price for two jars , it 's a steal and depending on how liberal you use it , but jar will last at least a couple of months for one person . Just such a great product at a reasonable cost rather than paying an enormous prices for names like Avon or oil of OLE .	1
I get extremely dry , itchy skin since I live in New England and am often outside in harsh weather . I have all kinds of lotion , and for some reason never tried Cetaphil . I bought this and it 's now the only thing I use -- it 's that good ! In addition to dry , my skin is very sensitive and allergy prone as well .

It 's not at all too heavy though , or sticky and it absorbs well . It 's nice because I can use it all the time without getting tired of an overpowering scent . I would highly recommend this to anyone , from people who just want good lotion to those with skin conditions ( e.g . psoriasis , eczema ) .These little tubes are great since I can toss them in my bag for dry hands .	1
I love this . My dermatologist has always told me to use cetaphil because I have acne . I was actually using the cetaphil facial moisturizer for a while until I tried this . I like it a lot better because it moisturizes my face a lot better than the other.I use it on my face and neck every time I wash my face ( morning and night ) . It does n't feel too thick , but it helps moisturize . It Does n't feel greasy , oily , or sticky either . Another plus is that it lasts forever if you use it for mainly your face . I 'm guilty for using in on the dry patches on my arms though !	1
Unfortunately , this moisturizing cream is n't the best . It works wonderfully on my body , but it causes a horrible rash on my face . I 'm still in the market for a product gentle enough to moisturize my face .	1
This is one of the best products I 've found for very dry skin . I even use this as a facial moisturizer , and my skin has n't felt better !	1
I buy this in bulk because we use it every day . It 's well worth the price because a little goes a long way and it really works . I have very healthy , super soft skin because of it .	1
This stuff is a miracle . I have incredibly dry skin from eczema and allergies . Winter is pretty awful for me . My skin , especially my legs , get very dry and itchy . Then I scratch and they hurt . Then I put lotion on and they sting . And I 've tried everything , having particular luck with colloidal oatmeal lotions , but they were n't perfect.But this has been a godsend.Even though I use Cetaphil face wash , I would have never thought to try this out but received it in a package of products from Allure called the Allure Beauty Box . After my first use I was in love.It 's thick , feels nice going on , does n't burn , and kept my skin unbelievably healthy . I have n't scratched my legs once all winter for the first time in 25 years . Seriously unbelievable.I ca n't recommend this enough . Really does what it says !	1
i bought it long time ago and i still have it . its very moisturizing and it dry fast i use for my body and feet	1
I use this as an all over ( head to toe ) moisturizer year round . In the summers , I put my go-to sunscreen over it and it 's not too much . I 'm a bit of a product junkie , so in the past I 've deviated from this to try other lotions and creams , but always came back to Cetaphil . I 'm not budging again . It 's economical , it does n't contribute to breakouts ( the skin on my face has an attitude ) , it moisturizes and keeps my skin that way throughout the day , and it seriously softens everything it touches . It 's not greasy , soaks in quickly and well , does n't interfere with any make up I use ( that said , I only use a gel blush and maybe some powder ) and it has a good ranking on the Environmental Working Group site ( I think a 2 or 3 ) and contains no parabens . Sold .	1
Great product . I like that it does n't have all the bad stuff in it . It 's thick and creamy , good in the winter and in the summer . My skin stays moisturized all day . I wo n't use anything else .	1
Ok , so I 'm anal . I pour over reviews for hours before making a purchase . It was so well worth the effort in finding the Cetaphil cream ! This cream is light weight , but works wonderfully . I really do n't understand the few reviewers who said this cream was heavy or greasy . At 52 and still prone to acne from moisturizers , this cream is fabulous ! I purchased a chemical peel that recommended this product for use after treatment and I am so glad I did . No breakouts , hydrated skin and a steal compared to the other `` miracle '' creams out there . Also , my hands and legs have never been so smooth and soft . No more oily/greasy feeling on my hands and legs as with other moisturizers . Plain and simple , this product works ! Thank you Amazon . Your review system , lightening fast shipping and unlimited selection of products keeps me coming back again and again .	1
On my doctor 's advice I started using Cetaphil products . I absolutely love the moisturizing cream as it seems to really sink into the skin and moisturize it . I always apply this cream before going to sleep at night followed up by an application the following day . During particularly dry seasons , I may apply this cream several times a day.This stuff really works . I suffer from very dry skin and Atopic Dermatitis . Applying the Cetaphil cream seems to help alleviate these skin conditions . What is really nice is the skin cream is unscented . Sensitive skin , like mine , can be irritated by perfumed lotions.Highly reommend .	1
This cream is simply the best moisturizer available today ... non greasy , great texture , penetrating but my skin absorbs it nicely . I especially like the way it is dispensed which allows me to travel with it easily . It is now hard to find in drugstores so I am thrilled that I can get it on Amazon .	1
This product is truly fragrance-free and does not cause an allergic reaction on my skin like so many other products do . At first , I did n't care for the Cetaphil cream because I thought it was greasy , but with a few days use I realized that I was using too much . A little goes a long way.This winter has been brutal on my skin -- especially my hands -- but Cetaphil had made them soft again .	1
Goes on easy , last the entire day/night , moisturizes better than lotion , no odd smell too . Not goopy or thick or oily like others . Heck , if I want goopy thick I would use petroleum jelly . Major drawback is co $ t .	1
This is a great cream for me to use in the winter . I use another , more expensive cream regularly , but if it is a particularly very dry winter , I will use this cream at night . It is light , non-greasy , and has the same reputation as the Cetaphil washing lotion . It is designed for severely dry skin . It 's perfect for my skin areas prone to dryness like hands , feet and elbows , yet it & # 8217 ; s even gentle enough for my face . It 's non & # 8211 ; greasy and absorbs quickly . Once applied , it leaves my skin feelingAccording to the information , & # 34 ; Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream has quality humectants , emollients and occlusive agents that provide intense , long & # 8211 ; lasting hydration . These attributes of the cream make it ideally suited for dry , sensitive skin and symptoms of dry skin associated with eczema and psoriasis. & # 34 ; I apply as often as needed , usually in the morning and before bed . For best results , use directly after bathing , wetting the skin or washing hands . I use it with Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser to cleanse my skin before moisturizing . It is recommended by dermatologists and pediatricians.Recommended . prisrob 01-08-14	1
i use this at night time ; i have slightly oily and sometimes acne skin ; but i still need a moisturizer ; it is not greasy and i can even wear it under makeup if needed .	1
My son has Psoriasis and this is the only product he can use and he swears by it5 Stars all the way1	1
I like that I can buy on amazon in a three pack , for cheaper , because my daughter loves these . It is a little thicker than most lotions , but not thick like creams , so she feels it works better for her dry skin , without feeling sticky .	1
I have extremely dry skin/psoriasis and I have tried all of the moisturizers in the world that claim to relieve dry skin but Cetaphil is the only cream that has ever saved me . It 's really great for any skin type and I recommend it to everyone . It seems like it would be greasy but when its put on , it absorbs really fast and you can see that your skin really and FINALLY finally moisturized and its a rather wonderful feeling . I 'm pretty sure that if I did n't use it , I 'll have horribly dry/ peeling skin all over my face and look twenty years older than I actually do because of it . It 's so wonderful ! CeraVe and Cetaphil are the two moisturizers I highly recommend , but Cetaphil is still my favorite .	1
I have used this cream for years and love the way it moisturizes my skin without leaving it feeling oily or greasy .	1
Cetaphil cream is always in my bathroom and I 've been using it for 4+ years . I use it during all seasons to keep my skin soft and moisturized . I have sensitive skin and I normally need hypoallergenic cosmetics/skin care products and this is moisturizing yet super gentle and leaves my arms and legs feeling soft like a baby 's bum .	1
I needed the smaller tubes to carry outside as the tubs are too big ( but cheaper ) .Good cream for sensitive skin.Wish it is cheaper though .	1
My dermatologist friend has this all over his home ... he 's got two little kids ... . so I figured there might be something to it.Bit pricey but I can see how this will last me awhile ... . I like to use it on my drier bits ... feet , knees , elbows , face , etc . I was never great about lotion on my face but when I 've used this , it 's been kind of awesome ... . it just love that it feels so rich but so neutral ... I guess that 's the point ... do n't want it to aggravate the skin ! So I figured I 'd splurge a little in my mission to become better friends with my skin . I figure if I get a good running start now , I can look more youthful even as my body has other plans ; ) Really like this cream !	1
I 've used this product for about 40 years and it is still excellent . Ever so often I have been enticed away by other creams , but I always come back to this cream . The lotion is great too .	1
Lotion . If you 're using anything else on your skin you 're doing it wrong . THis is amazing , never gives me a rash , I throw some scented oil on the tip , mix it around with my finger , and I have the best , most luxuriant body lotion in the world .	1
it is very useful for me , especially in autumn and winter part of my body starts to be very dry	1
I have tried everything and beside Olay for face , this is the very best . I use it on my body and face , along with the Olay , and the results are wonderful . My skin is soft , not greasy , dewy , plump and zitless . This lotion might be a little heavier than some but my skin likes it . If u have dry or allergy-prone skin , this is for you . I tried a cheaper lotion a few weeks ago and ran back to this . Cetaphil makes several varations , so any skin need can be met . Excellent for ppl like me who hate fragrances ! So great .	1
I 've had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my 'fancier ' , good smelling stuff . I guess you could say that I am sort of a 'lotion junky ' because I have so many . I even have some in a storage room because I do n't have enough room on my closet shelves for all of them . I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason . I do n't know why because I had n't even opened my Cetaphil lotion yet . Maybe because it 's in such a plain bottle . But , as they say , `` do n't judge a book by it 's cover '' . I now know this applies to my Cetaphil lotion . For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best , but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW ! ! I do n't think my skin has felt this soft in a long time . Well , maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft . This stuff does n't wear off or evaporate like some others that have to be reapplied a few hours later . My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs , arms , etc . I will now be using this from now on as my first pick . Who knew ?	1
I 've used this product for more than 10 years and could not do without it . It is light and softens the skin in such a pleasant way , never leaves a greasy feeling , and has almost no fragrance . This bottle lasts years and years since you do n't need but a drop to cover your face , neck and chest . Highly recommend .	1
The best lotion you can buy and very good for you skin and wo n't break you out ! Love it very much !	1
I gave this a 5star for service , product , prices and speedy delivery . I truly love Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion its the best for Dry skin its so moisturizing to the skin and not sticky feeling . I cant be without it ... Great Vender will buy more in the future from them ... thanks	1
My skin is very sensitive and very dry so i have to be very careful about what products i use . This lotion is definately a godsend . Since it does n't have a sunscreen i only use it at night but it mosturizes really well and does n't cause any breakouts . However , I think if you have oily or combination skin this may not work for you .	1
Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find . I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives , but Cetaphil does n't cause me to break out , itch , or dry up.I 'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar , as bars can cause one to have clogged pours ( read : blackheads ) .The only downside is that it wo n't remove makeup very easily , so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This 4 oz side is perfect to throw in your gym bag or overnight suitcase .	1
I love this cleanser . My dermatologist recommended it because it is safe even for sensitive or problem skin . After it arrived and I read the directions , I realized that it can be used even without water ... just tissue it off . It is so gentle in fact that the directions recommend that when using water , you do not rinse completely , but instead leave some of it , which then acts as a moisturizer .	1
Finally , I found something that words nicely on my skin , keeps it soft aftercleansing and works on those stubborn blackheads . This works great , and althoughit is more expensive than some facial cleansers , I would recommend it to anyone who is wantingto hone in on those problem areas .	1
I 've been battling acne for years now and this is the best face wash that i 've ever used so far .	1
This cleanser is gentle on sensitive skin , economical , and a little goes a long way . A four-ounce bottle can last you for a week if you use it once a day .	1
I have very sensitive dry skin , and this GENTLE face cleanser works great on my skin . It makes my skin feel soft and refreshed . I would recommend this item !	1
Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is the gentlest facial cleanser I have been able to find . I am highly allergic to several different soaps and preservatives , but Cetaphil does n't cause me to break out , itch , or dry up.I 'd suggest the liquid Cetaphil cleanser instead of their soap bar , as bars can cause one to have clogged pours ( read : blackheads ) .The only downside is that it wo n't remove makeup very easily , so I only use it in the morning and use my trusty cold cream at night.This bottle is rather large . I use it to refill my 4 oz bottle since it 's cheaper to buy 16 ounces at a time .	1
At first I thought this was something just for the face , but I quickly learned when I perused the back label that this is for the body as well and can be used on babies . This is meant to retain needed moisture and I notice immediately a glistening on one arm when I compared both arms.This can be used while in the shower and rinse off after applying and rubbing gently . I prefer to use the Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser without water . The cleanser is a clear/off white gel type of texture that rubs into the skin with a light lather . There is no scent evident when squeezed into the hand or rubbed into the skin . With a cloth you can easily remove the excess , while leaving a thin film on the skin . There is no tight feeling to the skin , just soft and smoothness.The gel cleanser is not gooey to touch and works rather quickly in obtaining clean skin for the entire body . I prefer to use it on my hands and legs and sometimes go for the face . This is much better than using soap on my sensitive skin and leaves it moist and almost glowing.The bottle is clear so you can see when you are low and plan on restocking . I have some left still since I do not use it on a daily basis . The problem I have is the bottle is too large to fit someplace where I can remember it and see it daily in the bathroom , so it is confined to the bottom cabinet below the sink and it gets pushed back when new items are placed there.The statement on the bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser states , Softens As It Cleanses , one that I totally agree with and can attest to as an eczema sufferer .	1
Thank you to all the people who reviewed this face wash . I have been having a horrible time with my skin due to the harsh Wisconsin winter and this face wash is just what I needed in conjunction with the new serum and moisturizer I am using , that I posted reviews about.This face wash did n't irritate my already extremely irritated , itchy red skin that was not enjoying the fact that I was having difficulty figuring out what to do with it , because it became that way out of no where . I have had to completely change my skin care regime , because my normal routine suddenly stopped working ... badly . I tried multiple serums , moisturizers , etc . This face wash along with the other two products I have reviewed were the only things that saved me from scratching my skin raw . It definitely does n't hurt that my skin looks amazing too ! FYI , in conjunction with having very sensitive skin , I also have rheumatoid arthritis , which is an inflammatory disorder that I am on multiple medications for and my skin is extremely picky about what I can use on it . This skin cleanser is a life saver .	1
The texture of the cleanser takes some getting used to ; it does not spread over the skin like soap so I ca n't get away with a couple of squirts on a washcloth to wash my whole body . I have dry , sensitive skin and mild adult acne that gets worse with exercise and the hot weather . In the month I used this ( only lasted me that long ) I realized I was n't breaking out the way I used to . When I ran out I tried another , less expensive product that was also supposed to be dermatologist recommended . I broke out the next day and had itching in areas that were n't itchy using Cetaphil . I 'm going back to Cetaphil but to make it last longer I 'm just using it on my face and sensitive areas . I think it 's worth it .	1
Hi , I 've been using Cetaphil for years now . I first bought after reading reviews in Allure magazine and I was n't disappointed one bit ! ! It 's the best , non drying and non-abrasive cleanser I 've ever used ... and while it is a bit pricey ( I 'm pretty cheap lol ) it 's worth it and the bottle ( used by my eldest daughter and myself ) lasts us 6 months ! And you can use it without water if you needed too ! It 's amazing ! Honestly , I will use this stuff forever . : ) LOVE it !	1
Ever since my friend told me about Cetaphil a few years ago I have not used any thing else ! Since then I have been introducing my friends and family to Cetaphil soaps and creams . Not only does it make your face and body so smooth and soft but I think it makes you look younger . I have noticed that the wrinkles around my eyes and forehead seem to have diminished a little . I highly recommend the lotions and face creams . This is a great product for all ages of women . You will feel the diffence on your skin as soon as you apply it !	1
I do like this face cream . It does not have perfume . The consistency is watery and my skin absorbs it quickly . However , on those days when my skin got very dry , I found it to be not moisturizing enough . I recommend it for the summer use . For winter , it depends on your skin . If your skin tends to be very dry , then you may want to find something else .	1
I have very sensitive , combination skin that is also prone to breakouts . I purchased this moisturizer a few weeks ago and so far I am satisfied . Complex 15 provides even coverage , does n't cause breakouts , and does n't have a strong odor . It is n't completely effective in combating my dry , winter skin , but I expect it to be a great moisturizer for the warmer months .	1
I dont know how i survived so long without this cream ! I have combination skin ( a very oily t-zone and dry cheeks ) and Complex 15 balances everything out . It sinks right , and almost feels like I 'm giving my face a drink of water ... my oily t-zone is controlled and my entire face is baby soft . I still have bottles of expensive cream in my cabinet that I wont go near ... I 'll be a Complex 15 girl for life . TRY THIS STUFF !	1
I picked this up since my daily Clinique moisturizer was n't working for me in the winter time . I have clog-prone skin with some sensitivity . I can not wear products with mineral oil at all.I can not say enough about this product ! I wish I would have known about it years ago . My skin loves this stuff and is not breaking out - that 's a miracle in itself . It 's fragrance-free which really is essential . I do n't understand why other companies continue to put fragrance in skin-care products.This face cream is more of a rich lotion and it 's hypoallergenic , noncomedogenic and fragrance-free . It has what you need and does n't have what you do n't need . I hate to have to rave , but I think it 's perfect ( for me at least ) . It plumps my skin and has properties that attract moisture and hold it in . Over time it works even better and restores the delicate mantle of the skin.Apparently , this is often recommended by dermatologists and now I know why . It 's a bland , yet highly effective face cream that really does what it says .	1
This was Rx 'd for me many years ago.. for dry skin but has no irritating oils.. feels like a normal washed face wit out the dry tight . Holds water based moisture all the books tell one to use . Hard to find . No other like it .	1
I have been using moisturizer from all stretches of the earth . NuSkin to dead sea to japanese products to Exuviance . This one moisturizes very well . The thing about less-expensive moisturizers are that they do the same job , but they are thicker . I have been having drier skin , overall after using this for a year , so I 'm not sure if the long term benefits are good . My skin looks older but I do n't think it is due to this product or just aging . This product is a bit too much for summertime , if you have an oily/shiny t-zone .	1
I have sensitive skin and combination at that . I used to spend much more money on the kinerase moisturizer . But I decided to try other brands so save some money . After several attempts on different brands . I found this gem ! Diamond in the rough ! It lasts me a long time and I have no reaction to it . I only hope they do n't discontinue it any time soon because I really do n't want to find another one and chances are , it will be much more expensive . At this price you should definitely try this .	1
This is the only sunscreen that does n't make my face break out . I love it and I always get compliments on my skin when I 'm using it every day . Highly recommended , especially if you have sensitive skin !	1
This is light and feels good going on ; it soaks in quickly . I 'm not sure that it is better than other less expensive brands , but I like it .	1
Recommended by my Dermatologist . Like it and use it . Very light and creamy . Does not last all day like some but is nice to use often .	1
I have been using this lotion for over a month now and I really like it . I researched new lotions online and this came up as dermatologist recommended so I took a chance and ordered it . It is perfect for moisturizing before putting on make-up because it does not leave the skin oily or greasy . I have sensitive skin and it seems to be perfect for me .	1
this was recommended by my dermatologist and I am pleased that she did It leaves my face so soft and I feel that it is a safe product	1
This is an elegant body and or facial moisturizer . I have only used it on my body . It makes my legs feel soft and hydrated and absorbs very quickly . I had used Cetaphil on my legs recently after a shower at night . Well , my legs kept sticking to the sheets and kept me awake most of the night . Needless to say I even had to wash the sheets the next day.Very nice product . I like the DML lotion much better .	1
I love this lotion - it 's the only kind that works well with my sensitive skin , and it does n't cause any breakouts . I would definitely recommend this for people with acne .	1
Very well absorbent by the skin , no smell . I would recommend this product to people with very dry skin , works perfect .	1
I love this cream ! ! ! I bought it because Dr Oz recommended a retinal cream to stop the signs of sun damage , and although I am not `` wrinkle cream '' age , I spend a lot of time in the sun , so I am worried about sun damage . On the Oprah website , they listed several that were recommended , and this was the cheapest and easiest to find , so I thought it would be the first I tried . I am so happy with the results , this is all I need to try . Right away , I noticed my skin looked `` brighter '' hard to explain , but that is the only way I can describe it . After about a week of daily use , my pores look smaller , and my face feels amazingly smooth . I feel like I can wear less make up . I do n't have wrinkles yet , so I ca n't comment on that , but hopefully continued use will help prevent bad ones ( I 'm realistic , I know I 'll get some , but maybe they wont be so deep ) The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I feel that I need a bit more moisturizing on some areas of my face , so I end up using more that the pearl sized amount , maybe double . I dont think the recommended pearl sized amount is nearly enough for most people with dry skin .	1
Pleasant smell , non-irritating , non-drying does it what it claims ! I was depressed over how my skin was looking & tried Proactiv but that stuff made my condition worse , with this & the Neutrogena , Anti-Wrinkle , Anti-Blemish cream , I noticed a noticable difference the next day even my mom said that my skin was pretty ! Do n't expect a big lather with this in fact , it 's actually a good thing it does n't lather too much ( it 's just right ) because that can be drying to your skin just as they say you do n't want an uber soapy shampoo that lathers too much because that can strip the oils from your hair drying it out . I LOVE THIS STUFF , & being on a fixed income I needed something I can afford that actually delivered on it 's promises !	1
EVERYTHING I EVER BOUGHT FROM NUTROGENA IS FIRST QUALITY AND RIGHT ON THE DOT FOR WHAT I EXPECTED .	1
I am sensitive to the feeling of anything & # 34 ; heavy & # 34 ; on my face . This feels light and makes my skin feel so soft . Love the product .	1
So great to use such a small amount & feel as if it 's working ! Great price/excellent product , but I 'm not expecting miracles @ 60+ ...	1
I have used this product for years and it is good . I 'm pleased with it and never irritates my skin .	1
Based on the fact that I 'm currently using several anti-aging products , I 'm not certain which are helping and which are n't , so I ca n't comment on the anti-aging claims of this product.However , I will say this : the product goes on without a greasy feeling and makeup is easily applied over it . Also , `` a little dab 'll do ya '' . Goes a long way .	1
This is a fine skin cream , it reduced pore size , improved my complexion 's color and uniformity , did n't irritate it and did n't induce acne . I wear it daily prior going to bed and at afternoon if I am not going out ..definately improved my skin overall.Edit : after using this cream for more than 3 weeks now on daily basis I can say it has no effect on my age spots however , it does improve drastically pore sizes and makes my skin looks smooth and soft . will definately re-order	1
This is an amazing cleanser , I 've yet to find one that works as well as this one does , and I 've tried at least a 100 of them . The first time I used it , after showering I saw the difference right away . My skin was very smooth and softened , makeup went on much better too . My friends even commented and asked what I was doing different ! ! The product is a pearly white cream , nothing really special . The consistency reminds me a bit of clearasil , it 's pretty thick . It lathers up very nicely though , and the smell is kind of a light citrus-y smell , nothing special there either . I have mild acne , and a few fine lines , and this cleanser really helps . I LOVE the effect it has on my skin , like I said nothing else really comes close , I 'm pretty sure they sprinkle magic into this or something.I 'm so glad they have it on Amazon , because it 's not available at my store anymore . This is the only cleanser I 've bought a second tube of , and I 'm definitely going to stock up . Everyone should try this ! !	1
I was using neutrogena rapid anti wrinkle night moisturizer ... By the way I am 36 and have 2 lines in the forehead and a wrinkle in the nose in between eyes . And also lines around eyes ... I do n't prefer to use chemicals near eyes.. So I use organic natural product for around eyes . The rapid anti wrinkle was good.. Still I felt it might be too strong and I do n't need it now .. In late 30s ... Might be in late 40s ... So tried this cream which is milder ... I am using it for the last 2 weeks ... When I wake up every morning and see myself in the mirror ... I feel like my face is super clean , fresh and soft ... does n't break out my combination skin ... So far so good ... Will continue using this	1
I am a young woman and Im always looking for something to help keep my skin looking young and fresh and healthy . This product is AMAZING . I used just a pearl size amount every night after cleansing and my face stays moisturized the whole day after I wake up and after about a week I really started to notice that my skin tone was even and smooth . Great buy	1
So this product review will not be as in-depth as many of my others but that is because there is not a lot of in-depth info to post . I have always been a huge fan of Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle moisturizer ( the one with Retin-A ) and figured that coupled with the glowing reviews , this might be the way to go for cleansing . In short , I love it . It does a great job ( T-Zone , combination skin , daily moisturizing , daily sunscreen use , rarely wear make-up , mid-thirties with minimal wrinkles ) . I have not broken out at all since I purchased this ( except for recently when I tried a new face mask ) . It does not have a strong smell or any cons EXCEPT possibly one . When you squeeze it from the tube , it kind of & # 34 ; balls up , & # 34 ; and can roll right off of your hand . Once you realize it , you can be more careful . It rolled off my hand a few times into the shower , so from then on , I knew that would happen so took steps ( cupped hand , etc . ) Try this if you like Neutrogena or are just looking for an excellent skin cleanser . If you have any questions , just ask .	1
so this is a product that def kills two birds with one stone , being 27 I am wrinkle consciousness but i have still not have outgrown my occasional adolescent breakouts , I have used everything from dermatologic , to philosophy , etc proactive , murad , and for drugstore , this with my clarisonic brush works the same if not better !	1
I recently decided to begin taking better care of my skin . I 've always had pretty good skin , but now that I 'm getting older I figured I should start really watching what I put ( and do n't put ) on it . I read online ( mostly Beautypedia ) about the great effects of Retinol on the skin , so I began my search for a good Retinol product I could use at night . I have used products across all price ranges , but no matter how many high-end moisturizers/skincare products I try ( I used to love Laura Mercier ) , I usually find myself coming back to Neutrogena products because they are well-priced ( especially now that I 'm on a student budget ) and effective . I was very happy to discover that this product is rated a & # 34 ; BEST & # 34 ; on Beautypedia , and one of the cheapest of the kind.So far , I love how it feels on my skin . I have somewhat sensitive skin , so I prefer unscented products , which this one is . It hydrates my skin and makes it glow , and my skin is usually still soft in the mornings , despite being quite dry naturally . I honestly have n't noticed too much of a difference in my skin , but it may be because I have n't begun to develop wrinkles yet . But I think that long-term use of this product will probably help prevent wrinkles from developing anytime soon !	1
I have been using this sunscreen everyday for about 1 year . I use it everyday , rain or shine . I hike about 28 to 35 miles per week , mostly in the southern california SUN , and it works . I have oily skin , and it does not cause breakouts .	1
First of all , I 'm 51 , so I 'm not a 25 year-old who has no real wrinkles or skin issues such as unevenness and sun damage . I 've got it all , plus super sensitive skin . I 've been using this product during the day and even sometimes at night for a few weeks now with no irritation and great results . Some of my friends had mentioned another product that might be even better , so I briefly switched to RoC 's Deep Wrinkle line . OMG . I only lasted two days using it because of the perfumes and the general heaviness/oiliness I experienced , not to mention it made my eyes water ( and I did n't even put any around my eyes ) . I took those products back , needless to say . The grass is always greener -- not.Neutrogena Healthy Skin is a great line in general . I now use the eye cream and the night creme as well as the day creme . I will stick with this line and not stray again . It goes on silky , no oily feel , no harsh perfumes , and no skin or eye irritation ( and I use it around my eyes ) . I wake up looking a little brighter every day . Deeper smile lines and brow furrows are softening more and more , skin is more even and sun damage is lightening up . : ) Love the line . Works for me.UPDATE APRIL 12 , 2014 ( I am now 52.5 , fyi ) Well , I have to admit , I 've been lax about using my little best buddy face cream since I wrote my original review ... To my dismay , at my skin check , my dermatologist asked me `` What are you doing differently since I saw you 6 months ago ? Your skin looks more uneven , and I think you may even need a special cream for some developing actinic keratosis . '' ( common rough patches from UV exposure that can lead to skin cancer ) . I freaked out a bit and thought immediately that about six months ago , I stopped using this cream ... damn . I had moved and disrupted my routine , blah , blah , blah and thought that a couple of days would n't hurt me . Well , a couple of days turned into months ... She told me that I could either go the prescription route that stings like an SOB and makes your face all red and weird for days ... .or I could go back to using the Neutrogena and STICK WITH IT . I think I 'll do the Neutrogena ... live and learn , my friends .	1
I ca n't find this is ANY stores . Neutrogena makes something similar in a pump , but I hear that it 's pretty harsh on the skin . I got this due to rave reviews -- and Thank You Amazon for carrying it -- - and I absolutely love it . I wear it almost nightly under my moisturizer . My skin is smoother and appears fresher in the morning . It did make my nose peel a little bit , but that 's when I take a night off . I really like this and hopefully can continue to buy this .	1
This is a nice product , and seems to be working ! It is gentle for the skin , some of the retinol products can be irritating , and this is n't ! I wear a stronger spf under it , because 15 is n't strong enough for daylight !	1
I have been using this product for 3 weeks and have had great results . I have dry , sensitive , blemish prone skin . I 'm in my late 20 's with severe environmental allergies and mild acne . I can not use Benzoyl Peroxide as it 's too irritating and actually makes my skin swell . Retinol , AHA and BHA are the only OTC products I can use without breaking out . This product is not hard on my skin and I 've noticed my acne clearing since I 've started using it . In the morning , I can see my blemishes have healed some compared to the night before . I have also noticed old blemish spots fading significantly . I also like that it comes in a tube rather than a jar . The antioxidants and other ingredients wo n't spoil that way . Good for Neutrogena for coming out with this product !	1
This was a very good wrinkle cream . I am not out of it yet but when I run out I will probably buy some more .	1
I like Neutrogena , this one is really good , it feels light on your skin . Beware if you have sensitive skin that tends to redness - this will enhance the redness	1
I really believe that this product works and have bought here multiple times now . Good price for a great product that I believe in !	1
I have been using this cream for over a year . I have sensitive skin and many products contain chemicals that are irritating . I have this product on my Subscribe & Save monthly shipments - nice discount too ! My daughter is also using this product . It is light . You do not need a lot ( dime size is enough for my face and neck application ) . I highly recommend this product .	1
I bought this primarily for its SPF function , since my new foundation does n't contain it . I 've been very impressed with this cream . After using it 1 month , I noticed my skin tone is more even . It hydrates well and it does n't clog pores.The disadvantages are : 1 ) the shiny finish - perhaps would be better for more mature skin ( I 'm in my 30 's ) ; and 2 ) it does n't last that long . My tube was gone after 1 month , although I was using it on my neck and chest as well . I 'd say you should expect to buy a new tube every 2 months if you are the only person using it.Due to the low price , I 'm going to stick with this cream unless/until I can find other places to cut my budget . to cut the shine , I use Peter Thomas Roth ... a small tube of this lasts at least 6 months : http : //www.amazon.com/Peter-Thomas-Roth-Anti-Shine-Mattifying/dp/B001MA5RKK	1
This anti-wrinkle cream takes a long time to work but it is a really good product and it has SPF 15 which is a plus . It goes on really well and does n't cause breakouts . I really like it .	1
This moisturizer leave my skin soft and well hydrated . My pores are also noticeably smaller and little acne flair ups have subsided . I did n't have any adverse reactions and my skin is pretty sensitive . The only flaw is I have to layer a higher SPF over it , but I do n't really mind .	1
Slight irritation when using it , but it goes away . It seems to be a strong cream but feels good . Not greasy . I feel like this is working in combination with the St. Ives timeless moisturizer .	1
I purchased this Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle , Anti-Blemish Cleanser several weeks ago from Ulta for $ 6.95 shipped . I LOVE this face cleanser . I use it with theClarisonic PRO Deluxe Professional 4-Speed Skin Care System with Spot Therapy Kit , Whiteand have seen fabulous results ( no miracles ... but definitely a clearer , smoother complexion ) . I only use this cleanser every 2-3 days . I alternate it with other Neutrogena cleansers so that I do not overdry my skin ( especially as we are approaching winter ) . So far , my skin looks much clearer and smoother . I get those occasional blemishes in the T-zone area and this clears it up . I have even noticed that my pores and those fine lines are less visible . It even has a nice smell . Overall , I 'm very happy !	1
No harsh fragrance . Easy to use and leaves my skin feeling soft . I also feel that the area around my eyes look a little younger . I will order this again .	1
I 've tried nearly all of the major anti-aging creams out there . I 've tried all the big drugstore brands ( olay , Roc , etc ) , I 've tried department store brands ( clinique , origins , etc ) , and I keep coming back to this one every time . I love that it does not have a fragrance ( the overpowering scent of perfume is what turned me off from Roc ) . I love that it 's not greasy , but yet it gives me just the right amount of moisture before bed . Most of all , I love that this 30-something girl still gets carded regularly when I buy a bottle of wine at the grocery store . Really , what more can a girl ask for from a wrinkle cream ?	1
My mother and I both love this ( she 's in her early 50 's , i 'm in my early 20 's ) . This leaves our skin soooo soft and feeling moisturized and hydrated without an oily slick . She has eczema and this goes very well on her skin , I have very sensitive combination skin and this has never broken me out at all . In the winter I have also applied this during AM hours to keep my skin from feeling dry during the day . We love this and highly recommend .	1
I like the feel and texture of this product and did not experience any reaction and it made my skin feel soft and supple	1
Great product , not greasy at all . I would recommend it ! This product was in Allure magazine , and all those girly magazines , which is why I decided to try it out . Great stuff , been using it for years . Never caused me to break out or anything .	1
My Dermatologist told me to start using this when I was 25 since i had a bad scaly patch and just could never ever get a grip on my dry skin . I have super dry skin and had been trying all kinds of stuff , even vasoline and olive oil . My skin is so dry it hurts after I take a shower . Anyway I 've used this , and only this plus the other night one in the pump - and my skin looks awesome and I 'm almost 40 now . I stopped when I was pregnant , and when I had the baby as these creams may not be good for pregnant ladies or infants ( they do n't know but it 's a lot of vitamin A so play it safe ) . I just used coconut oil ( straight ) during those times . EVERYONE has always told me they CAN NOT believe my age , I look way way young for my age . I can show you a photo if you want .	1
All the neutrogena are very effective when it comes to anti wrinkle and acne fighting , only draw back if you are prone to have sensitive skin like me , be careful how much you apply , and how often you apply it , otherwise it will really dry your skin out and your skin becomes very itchy.So make sure to follow the directions , do only apply to the effected area , stay away from anywhere from the eye area , about 1 inch at least , and try it out first and use it every other day or so.Even as I keep my Neutrogena products on hand for emergencies , : ) , for the day to day use you maybe want to check out the Lush products that are also on sale here on Amazon . Dream Creme , amazing moisturizer ( also for people who have dry skin due to Caner treatments ! ! ! ! ) , Vanishing creme , amazing moisturizer for acne prone skin , deminishes redness , acne scars , and Herbalism , an organic cleanser .	1
I 've been using the night cream from this line for a few months and quite like it -- so I decided to buy the corresponding day SPF 15 cream.Overall , it 's a nice product . Moisturizes well , and have good enough SPF . I like the fact that it has retinol and comes in a tin tube ( so sun ca n't decay the retinol ) . I have n't noticed any improvements in my fine lines or wrinkles , but I 'm using it more as a preventative measure ( I 'm 34 currently ) .However , I have noticed that the texture of the product is a bit chalky and less nice and soothing as the night version . I attribute this to the SPF , so that 's fine . I like this product enough to continue buying it .	1
yes , this product is the best I tried so far ... I 'm the kind of person who never really buy the same products again because I like to explore , and see other options , but this cream is it for me . lol , yes , I 'm in love with it .	1
Face wash is very creamy and think which means you can use a lot less of it compared to thinner face washes , I do definitely feel the softness of my skin when using this , no strong smell , no residue , all in all I really like this.Eye cream is nice and smooth , I can already see a difference in the dark circles around my eyes even though this is the first use , you do n't need the pearl sided amount , I just dot along my eyes and that is more then enough to get the job done.SPF 15 face cream , there is not a strong smell with any of these products which I like and so far no skin irritation even though I have never used retinol for anything before , again you do not need to pearl sized amount even though this is thick if your skin is warm it will almost melt into your skin and you wont need nearly that much . My face looks brighter and more clear and I have a lot of acne scars that are obvious.Please note I did not use the face wash that came with the eye and face cream , I used the Neutrogena anti-blemish anti-wrinkle cream I can not comment on the face wash that came with the system.Will leave another update if anything changes with these products .	1
with just 1 month of using this product my skin already feels so much smoother . for people that wear makeup this is great for it soaks in very fast and does n't just lay on top of the skin before you put your makeup on . i have it delivered monthly and i use in the am and pm . if it 's been a very warm day i put it on again in the afternoon . love that it has a sunscreen in it . no such thing as using too much of this in the florida climate . i highly recommend this . i do n't see however that it would work well for excessively dry skin .	1
i like most of the 'healthy skin ' line of products and this one was no exception . however , i prefer lotion to a cream for daytime use , therefore , i would not likely purchase this again .	1
This is an amazing night cream . I wanted to try a mild retinol product to see how it affected my acne prone skin and I am happy to say that there are only two products in the world that do not make me break out after using it and this is one of them . I noticed my skin was much smoother after just the first application and only improved afterwards . No tingling or burning as with other retinol products and I even applied it around my eyes without any negative reactions . There was n't any significant improvement with the fine wrinkles that I have on my forehead due to sun exposure but it is still a wonderful night cream . Overall , I definitely recommend this product .	1
This is the best cleanser I have used in years . I have 30 year old skin that is starting to look a tiny bit tired after two kids and lack of sleep . In addition I have break outs still on a regular basis or should I say I did until using this product . Since using this product my skin is looking refreshed and I have ZERO breakouts , even around that time of the month . I ran out and was using some sample products I had on hand and what a mistake , my blemishes came back almost instantly . As soon as I returned to using this product my skin was clear and feeling great . I use it once a day in combination with the Neutrogena lavender face wipes at night . This product is not a scrub , but a creamy sort of cleanser . I would recommend this product for sure , no hesitation .	1
this is a decent face wash ... nothing special for me ... the consisitency however , is extremely frustrating ... it is almost to thick to be separated or lathered , I do n't know how to describe it lol , but it makes my skin smooth after use..i do n't see any effectiveness concerning my acne problem though ... probably works best on those with minor acne..	1
I typically use an organic night cream that costs around $ 30 . I wanted to save on my skin products , so I bought this ; I must , say it works well so far ! I have VERY oily skin ; the oilyness of my skin has not gone away , however , this night cream helps control it , so that when I wake up in the morning I am not too shiny ! You only need half a dime size of product , so it lasts !	1
I bought this product in despair after Neutrogena discontinued Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment . But I found I liked this product better . True I am older and it is time to switch to a more intense moisturizing regime , but this product really worked . I know Neutrogena has put Oil-Free Acne Stress Control 3-in-1 Hydrating Acne Treatment back on the market but I am sticking with this Anti-wrinkle stuff from now on . I highly recommend this to anyone over the age of 25 who has the intelligence to wash their face before bedtime . Use this , it may not get rid of wrinkles but it really does keep your face softer and prevents peeling and helps heal sun damage . I speak from experience . This stuff is not a miracle ( most products are not ) but it really does a good job and the price is very reasonable .	1
Starting working after a week . I seriously noticed a difference and I already bought a second . Also helped with acne scars .	1
I love love love this ! Its thick and rich without being oily . Having combo skin everything is hit or miss when it comes to face items . This is stellar and beyond what I expected . I have fine laugh lines and after only 3 days I see them smoothing out already ... Just awesome !	1
Was n't sure about the age of this product . I buy this product on a regular basis and frequently the color of this cream ranges from white to a cream color . The color on this particular product was more yellow - I was n't sure about it but used it anyway . It did n't seem to cause any break-out . However , I have since purchased this from other vendors and again the color of the cream ranges from white to a cream color .	1
I tried this out because of the great reviews.I did n't really notice much of a difference , but that could be because I do n't have any wrinkles.I hope this will help me not get bad wrinkles as I get older ... NEVER TOO EARLY TOO START !	1
I have used this product for several years and have not found a better shower oil . It is cheaper to buy it at Amazon than my local drug store .	1
This bottle will last a long time . It has a pleasant scent and I typically reserve it for putting on in the evening since it does not contain sunscreen . I love to put it on before I go to bed as I really think it helps me get to sleep and I tend to think of it as a luxury product .	1
The Neutrogena Body Oil is very light . I use this when I get out of the shower and within minutes it is absorbed into my skin and my skin is hydrated through out the day . My skin does not feel oily or greasy just soft and smooth . I love that this oil is very lighly scented and does not interfere with my perfume or body spray .	1
Highly recommend . Will leave your skin silky smooth after a shower , with a very delicate scent . Not greasy at all . Highly recommend . Also real bang for the buck .	1
I 'm a huge Neutrogena fan and was perusing their products on Amazon when I stumbled across this . I was about to run out of lotion and needed something that could handle how dry and flaky my shins and elbows tend to get - especially now when I 'm flying a lot for work.The bottle arrived with the cap broken at the hinge unfortunately . Luckily , the oil had n't leaked out and gotten all over , but it does make storage kind of obnoxious right now , so I 'm going to have to steal a cap from an old shampoo bottle or something to replace this one.That aside , the product itself is great ! If I was choosing on fragrance alone , this would n't be my first pick , but the smell is very pleasant and is growing on me . Instead of rigorously toweling myself dry after my shower , I do a cursory drying , leaving my skin quite damp and then immediately use the oil . It soaks in much better and quicker that way and can proudly say my elbows have n't been ashy in over a week ! I do also use this at times on my fully dry skin , and it 's still great , just a little more oily feeling at first.This product is defnitely a keeper , . I just do n't know how it took me so long to realize this exists !	1
I never thought a body oil would be so great . When I hear `` body oil , '' I think , `` greasy , '' `` thick , '' and `` gross . '' Neutrogena body oil is none of those things . I squirt a little in the tub when I run a bath , and it keeps my skin from drying out . After I shower , I put it on my legs and they never get dry , either . It 's so light that you do n't feel it at all , and the scent is very light too . I did , however , order the unscented version for when my current bottle runs out . My husband is hooked on this stuff too . We keep a bottle in the shower , and when we turn the water off , we just put some on our arms and legs before we get out . That way , we do n't have to use a lot of heavy lotions instead .	1
I 've switched from body lotion to this Neutrogena Body Oil . Living in AZ is pretty dry and lotions do n't rehydrate my skin after showering like this does . I 've tried several methods from using it right in the shower to toweling off LIGHTLY and apply this afterward . That 's the method I like the best . If I dry myself off too much and wait too long to apply the oil , I just lightly dampen my skin and then apply the oil . Great product I wo n't ever be without .	1
I have been using this product for years and sometimes it is hard to find . I have it on subscription at Amazon and they are so good about having it to me every 2 months . I love the feel and silkiness this gives my skin and can not imagine anything else working as good .	1
This is my favorite thing on the planet ! I have been using this body oil for years and years ( 15+ years ) . I use after shower before drying off , then my regular body lotion , makes my skin super soft and leaves a nice scent behind ( if you like the smell that is , also comes unscented ) . I recommend to everyone and I know a lot of women who use it that also love this body oil . It is a little uncomfortable to get out of towels ( also leave scent behind on them ) but soaking in detergent for a few hours does the trick . Just leaves a silky soft finish on your skin , not on your clothes , great for dry winter skin .	1
This oils absorbs inmediately and you can add lotion after and your skins stays hidrated all day.I think for tropical or humid climates is enough because is not heavy or too oily .	1
I have used this product for years . Before I get out of the shower , it turn the water on HOT.. Let it get steamy . Then turn off the water and then apply . Great on the elbows and knees . The fragrance is ok but it is a great moisturizer and not oily .	1
I love this oil , it is light and smells wonderful ! ! Great for after the shower ! Will be buying again ! !	1
For years I have used oil on my wet skin after a shower/bath because of its moisturizing power . But when I was skin tested for allergies for new skin issues , it was discovered that I have an allergy to fragrance . That 's when I switched to this product . It does what I need it to .	1
It 's light and perfect for summer . Much cheaper here than at Target , and it 's available in the larger size , which is a better deal .	1
Two days after I started using this product , which I love , I noticed that my skin was mush smoother and shinier than it had been before . I love the way it smells , and after using it and then going out , I 've gotten complements on my perfume , even though this body oil is all that I was wearing . I put it on mysking while it 's still damp , just when I get out of the shower . Highly recommended .	1
I started using this with my mother , chemo dried her skin out . I use it after a shower , 2-3 times a week . I like the smell of the original . thisis best for everyhting but hands , for that I use working hands , my hands take a beating . The amazon price is excellant .	1
First of all , I always buy the unscented body oil because I use a dropper and squirt some of my favorite aromatherapy essential oils into it before I use it . It takes no more than one dropper full to completely scent the entire bottle of body oil . Impressive , and with heavier oils like sweet almond it takes alot more than just one dropper to carry the scent.I use this after my shower , and just a few drops on my hand can cover an entire body area ( lower leg , upper leg , arm , ect ) . I find the moisture to be helpful , but not enough for my legs , so I use lotion there , too . But it helps , definitely . Plus it adds a sexy sheen ( as in shine , not Charlie ) .It 's also great for suntanning , though suntanning is bad for skin anyway ... this at least helps keep the skin moist and is n't so heavy that it makes me feel sticky afterwards .	1
I love this product . I put it on right after I shower and so I do n't have to apply lotion after that . It makes my skin soft , touchable and non greasy . Unfortunately , since it is a light formula , it does n't last for a whole day so I do have to apply lotions that evening or night if I showered in the morning .	1
This product is very gentle on the skin . I was so pleased with the fact that you only need a little and it goes a long way . I like the smell , it is not heavy and is easy to enjoy . I could see myself buying more .	1
I have tried all kinds of oils over the years to combat dry skin . I love this Neutrogena body oil , I love the large bottle it comes in , it has a great flip top that makes it easy to use , without making a huge oily mess . It smells great , it goes on smoothly and is easy to blend in . I will be ordering more of this , it works so well . It has helped me get rid of a patch of very dry skin I had on the back of my neck . I just put this on after a shower , when the skin is still moist . It really moisturizes and is n't greasy .	1
I used this product to take off eye makeup regularly , it works well . It is light and fragrance free . I will order it again	1
It does not smell like sesame oil at all , which is good . Not like the smell of food . It actually has a very pleasant smell . Oil is not too thick . Nice to apply after a bath , but you can also put some on the tub when relaxing . Wife and I are using it especially more often during the winter . It helps you to stay a little bit warm . Helps your skin to keep it from drying . Not bad to use for massage , but kinda expensive for that purpose .	1
Ditch the lotion for this fantastic body oil . I use this immediately after I shower and a little goes a long way . My skin always have a healthy glow - even during winter . My skin is moist and NOT OILY . This is a FANTASTIC product ! !	1
Having used this fragrance free oil for years , I was saddened to find it had disappeared from my local stores . Only the scented one is available locally , and after trying it , I vowed never to use it again . How delighted I was to find my old favorite on Amazon . It works best if applied to wet skin after bathing , then towel dry gently . It is a very light oil , and is absorbed quickly . Regular use will restore dry skin to a soft , supple condition . Very highly recommended . Thank you , Amazon ! ( And , of course , thank you Neutrogena , for developing the product in the first place ! )	1
This goes on soooooo easily and absorbs quickly into my skin . There is a very slight shimmer upon application . NOT greasy at all ! ! ! ! Since this product is fragrance-free , I 've also used it in my hair , and it works as well as the Fekkai hair oil I use . It 's thin so it would be hard to overdo it like lotion . The only thing is that when I 'm in a rush , some oil droplets find their way to the floor or my counter . Easy peasy to clean though .	1
BUT NOT ANYMORE ! ! ! This product is awesome . I put just a wee bit in my bathwater and voila ! ! Gets to places I was too lazy to reach . I 'm not itchy from this terribly dry winter we 're having and my skin does n't feel tight . I love to also use this oil as a massage oil . There 's no fragrance which I like because it allows me to put on perfume without feeling too scented.Pros : Not greasy in the bathtubHydratingSoothing for itchy dry skinSpreads easilyAbsorbs quicklyCons : Can get a little priceyMust ... have ... .more ... ..	1
I am trying to get rid of celluite on my legs and thighs ... I know that it will take some time because it has been on my legs for many years . I love the way it smells and I just might have a chance to get rid of celluite . It is easy to rub in and it does not stay oily when you rub it in really well . I do like this product .	1
This is perfect if you have allergies to fragrance as I do . I use this but also love the Neutrogena Rainbath .	1
My go to moisturizer straight after a shower . Love it . Light , absorbs quickly , no stickiness , and smells move too , I have used it for years . And it does keep your skin from drying out . Love it .	1
Smells nice , keeps your skin moisturized and does n't require a lot as a small amount works very , very well . Does n't leave residue and absorbs into your skin very quickly while still retaining moisture . As usual , Neutrogena knows their stuff and this product comes easily recommended .	1
I have always loved this oil . I have n't used it in a while , so I was thrilled to get it for such a good price . I use it on my wet skin right after a shower or bath ... ..it 's WONDERFUL ! ! ! It 's light and not greasy at all . The smell is divine , but not overpowering ; you can still wear your favorite perfume or body spray and it wo n't clash . It 's also great as a cuticle oil .	1
I am totally devoted to this product ! A 32oz pump bottle of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil sits on the ledge of my bath tub right next to my other very favorite bath/shower product ... ..Vitabath Moisturizing Bath & Shower Gelee , Original Spring Green . When used together , my skin stays soft and smooth even during the coldest winters.I first learned of Neutrogena Light Sesame Body Oil from an article in a magazine about the personal favorite products of beauty profesionals . The oil was mentioned several times as a tried and true after-bath or shower moisturizer for even the driest or most problematic skins.The oil is meant to be applied to the body immediately after bathing or showering but before toweling dry . The oil is quickly absorbed into the skin , almost nothing is left on the towel used to dry yourself . Once dry , your skin is silky smooth but not oily . The fragrance is delicate and clean and not cloying.I then apply a good moisturizer like ( Olay Quench Body Lotion Extra Dry Skin - 20.2 Oz ) to my hands , feet , elbows and any other area that I think could use a little more softening and smoothing.The oil and the moisturizer combine to form a moisture barrier on the skin that lasts and lasts . It 's surprising to see how quickly the oil works ! And how much more effective it is to use the after-bath oil than just an moisturizer by itself.This product is a good investment in your skin 's health and appearance !	1
I 've been using this product for years and I always find myself coming back to it . Sometimes I go looking for something new but end up disappointed and upset that I ever thought to leave it ( it 's as close to a husband as I ever want to get ) .What I like about it:1 . SPF is there . It 's not a lot but it 's there . With my other SPF makeup , I feel adequately protected.2 . It absorbs quickly without taking everything with it . My skin stays soft and supple all day.3 . It does n't smell bad at all.4 . IT DOES N'T BREAK ME OUT.5 . My skin is extremely sensitive and with regular microdermabrasion , I am sometimes left with red , flaky skin that needs to be treated with love and care . This product does n't exacerbate what my skin goes through and even also layers well with other moisturizers when I need backup.6 . On days when I 've gone without foundation and wearing only this , I 've gotten complimented on how `` luminous '' my skin looks.Overall , it 's an awesome product and I recommend it . As someone who also uses mostly `` high end '' products , I am amazed with how rarely Neutrogena lets me down . I thank them for saving me some serious green !	1
I have to start out by saying that I am really not a fan of Neutrogena products . This is one of the exceptions . Three days after starting Accutane , I ran out of my expensive moisturizer ( Physiodermie - Oily Skin Cream - 50ml ) and had to run to the drugstore to buy moisturizer . I had a meltdown because they did n't have Olay in stock and bought Aveeno , Cetaphil , and this . This is the best , by a long shot . It feels nearly as good as my expensive one , but it does n't sink into the skin quite as fast . The only downside is the smell , which is of clay . I do n't mind it , since that proves it is fragrance free -- I just wish it was a little less strong.My favorite drugstore moisturizer is stillOlay Regenerist Deep Hydration Regenerating Cream , 1.7-Fluid Ounce , but I would definitely repurchase this neutrogena moisturizer !	1
Got it way before estimated time this product is what I needed will tell you all later how it 's been doing . my face is quite red allot of the time.Update : Makes my face feel good and soft take care of the red . Good price too .	1
Neutrogena oil free moisture SPF 15 is amazing . The bottle has a little pump that makes it very easy to dispense . The product goes very far and you only need a little bit . This product is great for people with dry/semidry or combination skin . It helps combat dry skin in the places that need it without adding additional oil . It is also good to put under makeup . It causes much less foundation to be used up due to the fact that the skin is already moisturized . It also has SPF 15 which is great for the summer when you 're not outside for long periods of time . ( For long periods of sun exposure , I would suggest a higher SPF . ) This product does smell a bit like sunscreen so there 's no secret to what you 're using !	1
I have oily skin to the point where I avoided using moisturizer as every one that I tried in the past made by skin even oilier . It was embarrassing ! I decided to give this one a try because of what it says it does and because I somehow developed small patches of dry skin on my face that needed to be treated , even though I was still oily . This moisturizer is absolutely amazing ! My skin feels so smooth after application with no greasy after feel and I am totally shocked to see how well it has kept my makeup in place . I did not have to blot once during the day while at work . It 's been 12 hours since I applied it today and my face still looks great . This product really works ! ! ! I am overjoyed that I decided to give it a try and highly recommend it .	1
another discntinued item from amazon , i love this moisterizer , need it to return though - seems like Amazon is not carrying Neutrogena products at all anymore . Very disappointing .	1
This moisturizes my skin well without making it oily or making me break out . But it 's not heavy-duty , so I recommend having a more intensive moisturizer on hand to use once a week or so to really keep your skin from getting flaky .	1
I had meant to order the SPF version , which comes out of the pump a white color . This is a creamy-whitish . Nothing wrong with that , but I need the SPF coverage and I actually use it to lighten up my light tinted moisturizer ... I 'm kinda pale , so I will stick with the SPF next time . That said , I still use this sometimes at night or if I know I will be bumming around the house all day with no fun-in-the-sun . It is lightweight and , like all Neutrogena products , of high quality .	1
This stuff helps my skin and does n't break me out . It is more like a lotion than a cream . I like how it has sunscreen in it to protect my face .	1
I have used this periodically over the years and really like it . This particular purchase was for a male friend who told me he swears by it and uses it everyday .	1
I use this product daily , as well , I mix it with my thick foundation for light sheer summer coverage . I have dry sensitive skin so this product has been perfect for me . I ca n't recommend a better daily facial lotion , especially for the price .	1
Works really nicely . It does not make your face oily at all but give enough moisture where it feels really nice . I definitely recommend this product .	1
Of the thousands of moisturizers that I 've tried , this one has got to be the best . It goes on lightly and does n't feel at all heavy . There is no funky scent . It does the job and it makes your skin better . I even recommend this moisturizer for peels because it really helps speed up and clean up the peeling process . Overall , a great addition to any night regimen .	1
I have 30 years old , white female . Had acne all thru my 20s , it 's clearing up the older Im getting but this moisturizer has been a LIFE saver . I have tried so many other products out there , Simple , Clinique , Coconut Oil , Oil of Olay , etc ... and nothing worked . They were too greasy , too smelly and caused breakouts or over drying and made my skin feel tight . Read many reviews on this , purchased this at my local Walmart and have been IN LOVE with this ever since . I use before my makeup every morning . 1 pump is plenty- apply to face , let dry ( 5 mins or so ) and then apply makeup . I use a Neutrogena Night cream as a night moisturizer , but this would work fine too ! So happy with this . No break outs , leaves my skin feeling wonderful and just enough moisture to NOT be oily ! Deff reccommend this as a try ! : )	1
I have sensitive skin that seems to be becoming more and more sensitive as time goes on . I 've tried lots of different products claiming to be great for sensitive skin , but those claims do n't usually hold true ( they either make me break out or itchy or have scents , etc . in them that are irritating ... .or are for more mature skin ) but this stuff does ! It moisturizes without being greasy or causing irritation . I 've been using it for about a year now and I 've never had any problems with it . Usually lotions will cause me to break out in a purple patchy rash around my mouth , but this does n't at all . It does need a few minutes to really absorb into the skin after applying it though ( at least before starting to put on make up or whatever ) . Definitely recommend !	1
I used this product for years before switching to the Neutrogena Healthy Skin formulation , which contains glycolic acid . I loved this moisturizer . I did not find it too oily or greasy - one of the reasons that I switched to it was becuase I found it to be much lighter than the Clinique Daily Moisturizing Lotion that I had been using . I could even use this product during the summer , when it is very hot and humid where I live . Neutrogena makes great products . Highly recommended .	1
im 13 and i love neutrogena products . i bought this from target and it was $ 10 . i have been using it only for a little while but i noticed it made my skin super soft ! ! and spf in a moisturizer is awesome , and the fact that it is no comedogenic ( srry idk how to spell that ? ? ) i would totally recommed this , i have sort of oily skin and i think i just need to buy some blotting wipes or something like that , elf ahve some 150 for $ 3 ! ! but i think that theres nothing that will stop the oil from coming out through the moisturizer or your makeup . if that makes sense . hope this helped : ) good luck	1
I have very acne prone skin and this stuff keeps the oil down and really keeps my face soft and moisturized . Love it .	1
This moisturizer was good , did not cause any acne , provides a somewhat dewy finish . Not the best texture and perhaps alittle bit liquid like . A decent buy .	1
I order this product for my husband . Before we got married he would n't bother to put anything on his face ! Once he started seeing me use all my lotions and potions he asked for my recommendation . He has combination skin and since neutrogena is very hypoallegenic and I got this cream for him . He 's been using it regularly for about a year now and loves it !	1
I used to have more of a dry/normal skin type but as normal..skin changes over time , and for me mine has been changing to be more on the oily side and where occasional breakouts have now become a persistent thing . For a while I have already been using cleansers that target acne and did n't see much improvement . It took me a while to realize that maybe it was time I changed my moisturizer too ( Duh ! ) . My previous moisturizers were those for normal/dry and those that claim to be & # 34 ; for all skin types & # 34 ; ( lies ! ! ! ! ) so this is my first time trying a moisturizer that targets oily/combo skin.I 've used this for only 2 days now but I have felt and seen instant results . I truly believe it has helped keep the oils at bay and in turn keep my acne from continuing to swell or creating more . I was concerned that it would have more of a drying affect and leave any dry spots noticeable , but surprisingly it did not ! A lot of pros : *Lightweight*Unscented*Not greasy*Not sticky*Dries almost a matte finish so you do n't look shiny*While it helps to stop the oil from surfacing , it still keeps your skin very moisturized.I 'm pretty impressed with this moisturizer . Other moisturizers tend to leave your skin sticky and shiny but this did not and it just made my skin look like bare , ungreasy , unshiny skin ! ! ( just with pimples that are hopefully leaving soon ) .In case you were wondering : I use this with the Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Cleanser and a Murad cleanser that I switch between . Also , I find that powder/mineral foundation has helped to add that extra layer of oil stopping fighting power .	1
For years I have struggled with dry , acne-prone skin , and all moisturizers I tried caused me to break out , left my face feeling oily , or would wear-off and would need to be re-applied throughout the day . This is the first moisturizer I have tried that works for my sensitive skin without any of those problems.This product dissolves quickly without oily residue and leaves my skin feeling soft for the entire day ( until I wash my face my again ) . I use this product twice a day ( morning and night ) after I wash my face , and I love it ! If you are struggling to find a good facial moisturizer , I would definitely recommend this product !	1
I am 58 years old . People tell me I look like I am in my 40 's . I use this along with the very ultra gentle cleanser . No breakouts , moisture and seems to lesson the lines to where you do n't look in the mirror anymore and go ugh ! How about that for this price !	1
I really like this moisturizer and use it every day as do my teenage daughters , great product that does not clog pores .	1
My skin 's very oily ; this product controls my oil production without drying out my skin ! You only need half a pump to get complete coverage ! I recommend using this after washing your face with the Pomegranate face wash or the Oil-Free face wash !	1
I chose tiis moisturizer because it did not have SPF in it and it was advertised as not to clog the pore on my face . I seems a little more pricey than Oil of Olay . I have always used a moisturizer after shaving , it does a far better job of soothing the skin thanalcohol based products P.S . after about 1/2 of the bottle the pump no longer will pump and you are left with 1/2 bottle that you have to beat out with your hand to get it ... . I wo n't make this mistake again of ordering this ... Shame of them ...	1
I 'm 29 with combo/acne prone skin that 's somewhat sensitive . I used to use Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel , but decided to try something less expensive . The Clinique moisturizer has a more runny consistency than this moisturizer and glided on the skin more easily . This moisturizer is a little bit thicker and that makes it more moisturizing than the Clinique . I felt like the Clinique moisturizer just stayed on the skin for a few hours and than my cheeks started to feel dry and I 'd feel like I needed to reapply it again . I do n't have to to reapply with this one . My skin still feels moisturized hours later . This moisturizer has a lightweight feel and that 's key for me because I have oily skin . I just use a very small amount and that 's enough to cover my whole face and neck . It does n't make my skin feel greasy at all . I have n't noticed any breakouts with this moisturizer either . I have an oily T-zone and my cheeks are usually dry and tend to get a little flaky . The Clinique moisturizer did n't do anything for the flakiness on my cheeks . This moisturizer absorbs into the skin perfectly and I no longer have flakiness on my cheeks . One day I washed my face and decided not to use this moisturizer to see how my face would feel . I immediately noticed the difference . This moisturizer fits my budget and my skin loves it . It 's something I 'll definitely repurchase .	1
This is the only face lotion I will use . It 's not overly greasy and it has actually helped decrease my acne if I use it in the morning and before bed .	1
I really like it , especially for the warmer times . For reference , I have oily and acne prone skin that can be sensitive to some products.PROS : -moisturizes fairly well-dries matte ( and keeps me from being shiny for about 4-5 hours if I only have this moisturizer on ) -affordable-mixes well with other products ( beauty oils , facial serums , sunscreen ) CONS : -no SPF ( personally , I find putting on sunscreen can be a laborious extra step ) The only reason I did n't give this 5 stars is because I have yet to find a moisturizer like my all-time favorite one ( Lancome Visionaire moisturizer ) . I would definitely recommend this product and would buy it again .	1
I use this both night AND morning and have never experienced a break out , rash , or any such thing . I used to use Clinique oil-free `` moisture in control '' because I would frequently break out . While I did n't break out after using it , my skin did n't feel moisturized , and after turning 40 that is key . I 've been using Neutrogena Light Night Cream for over a year and love that it also contains few ingredients , no fragrance and NO sunscreen . Personally I do n't like the idea of rubbing sunscreen into my face every morning , especially when I do n't spend much time outside during the day . So I recommend giving this a try for both morning and night applications for sensitive skin . It makes my skin soft and moisturized but never greasy feeling . I use this in conjunction with Regenerist for sensitive skin .	1
This is hands down my favorite moisturizer . It 's worth every cent . It feels great , lasts all day , and no more dry skin .	1
Light lotion , absorbs quickly , virtually no scent ( no strong chemical smell . ) Excellent basic light night lotion especially if it 's a hot night . As with all neutrogena products , not a problem for my acne prone skin .	1
Neutrogena Light Night Cream IS in fact light , it goes on easy , you only need a little bit at a time , and guess what ? I wear it during the DAY ! It 's the only thing I can ever find that is n't greasy , that goes on so smoothly and that does n't have sunscreen in it . I 've had Melanoma before so I 'm very careful about not only wearing sunscreen when I need to , but also not overdoing it and not having it on my face CONTINUALLY . It 's not good for your skin when you have chemicals all over it all the time . So ... the & # 34 ; night & # 34 ; cream is what I use on my face to moisturize in the morning , then if I WANT to put on sunscreen , I do . There are weeks at a time in the winter when I do n't need sunscreen because the UV index is virtually zero when it 's cloudy and/or raining , so I like to have a choice about whether to have it on my face or not . Again , too many chemicals are not good for your skin , so while sunscreen is a great invention and allows us to go outdoors without being burned from damaging ultraviolet rays , it should still be used sparingly .	1
I 've tried the following night creamYves Rocher Bio night creamHildegard Braukman chamomille night creamAveda night creamAnd neutrogena light cream is still the best- it is fast absorbing , light , creamy , leaves no residue , and leaves the best light scent . The only set back is that this product contains paraben . I hope the company improves its formulation so it no longer contains known carcinogens .	1
This is a great night cream for sensitive skin . It 's not going to take away wrinkles or remove dark spots , but it 's so inexpensive that you 'll have money left over to spring for the expensive creams .	1
I 've used this for the past few years and it 's perfect.I 've tried other drug store creams that do fancy things like anti-aging or helps with sun damage , tightening , brightening , etc . They all irritated my skin or had little effect . This cream moisturizes and gives me a very clean glow . I do n't feel greasy , there is no stinging , tingling or itching . It 's just moisturizer doing its thing.My skin type is pretty oily too , and I live in a hot , humid area . Despite the weather and all that , this does n't leave my face like an oil slick in the morning and I still feel clean and moisturized . So if you have dry skin and you want to use this , just adjust the amount of cream you use accordingly.The lack of extras in this cream may be considered a negative to some people - look at it as an opportunity to use more intense products like serums on targeted areas . Right now I 'm just using some acne spot-treatment cream and a simple eye cream for hydration , and this clean cream allows those things to do their work without having conflicting chemicals . I like it , I 'm sure other people like that too.Totally recommend this product !	1
I DEVELOPED SOME KIND OF MILD RASH IN MY EYEBROWS AND AROUND MY NOSE . ONE NIGHT I HAPPEN TO TRY THIS NIGHT CREME AND NOTICE THE RASH WENT AWAY . NOW I USE IT EVERY NIGHT AND MY FACE IS SMOOTH AS SILK .	1
2 mins after putting this on my hands no longer feel greasy nor rough . It leaves them soft thought a couple hand washings as well . A little goes a long way with this so dont be freaked when you get it and it looks like jelly coming out the tube !	1
My hands are extremely dry during the winter time . These hand creams do provide plenty of moisture but more like a thin coating on applied areas . I like these hand creams because they are not so oily and it is absorbed fast .	1
Being a CNA keeping my hands from cracking & bleeding is a full time chore . The gloves dry my hands out & washing them so much during the day really does mess up my skin badly . I 've tried other lotions , creams , gels , everything I can think of & nothing has worked . After reading the reviews on this hand cream I thought maybe it would be worth a try & if it did n't work , then there was n't a real loss because the price is so good.My hands are cracking , bleeding & they hurt so bad . I ca n't even get rid of one cut before there 's another on my fingers or top of my hand.I 've started using this cream & immediately it softened the cuts that are already healing & soothed the skin around them . My hands are smoother , softer & the cream absorbed quickly without a greasy after feel.Even after washing my hands it did n't feel like I had to put on more cream right away , my skin was n't so dry that it was about to crack like it normally does.This really does take just a little bit at a time & leaves my skin smooth . I 'm going to try it on my feet too.I have ordered a couple more so I can have one in the car & another at home . Plus I 'm going to give this away as a gift to someone else who suffers from cracking , bleeding hands . I 'm so glad to have ordered this stuff . If you have dry skin , consider giving this a try .	1
If you have really , really dry hands , you should use this product . It is awesome ! I prefer the one with fragrance but this one was in a good price , so I bought two units .	1
this product it great when first applied it feels wet , but soaks in so quickly , best ever the itchy dry hands and red cracks are going away .	1
After having my baby I developed a rash on my hands from overwashing and extremely dry skin . I visited a dermatologist who prescribed me a steroid cream to get rid of the rash and samples of this hand cream . He insisted I use this every time I wash my hands to keep them moisturized so I would not have another rash breakout . I have been using this for over a year now and do not have dry chapped skin . I still wash my hands about 20 times a day so this is a life saver !	1
Hands down this is the most amazing Lotion Cream I have ever used ! Softens even the roughest skin I recommend it highly ! I have tried literally 100 mof lotions for dry skin this goes a long way not to much , if you have any rough areas buy it , you will never be sorry you bought 4 .	1
I love this lotion- it stays on through a hand washing and it sinks in well . However they changed the lid on it recently to a screw on lid ( used to be a flip top ) and I dinged it a star for that . The new lid is VERY cumbersome ( big lid , tiny hole to match up to the screw thingy ) . I am always dropping them on the floor ! Anyway the lotion is great if you are constantly washing your hands !	1
Just as it states on the tube , you 'll get need a dab . My hands go from dry and stiff to moist , smooth , and gorgeous . This is a get stocking stuffer .	1
My knuckles get extremely dry and cracked during winter months . I have tried numerous types of lotions ( OTC and medical samples ) . This stuff is cheap and excellent ! I use it nightly and it gets the job done .	1
This has been my favorite hand moisturizing cream . I just use a small amount every night and my hands are always so soft when I wake up in the morning . It is a thicker cream so it feels better than a watery lotion . I definitely recommend !	1
I wash my hands a lot and as a result they show it - this cream is the best by far in healing my dry cracked skin and cuticles .	1
This is a great product but it is not what I would call a hand & # 34 ; cream. & # 34 ; The formula is a yellowish almost clear oil/petroleum-like based formula . It does absorb into the skin but not completely.I would not use this during the day to avoid leaving greasy prints on things . This is a great product to use at night because it does absorb somewhat into hands and the residue creates a & # 34 ; mask & # 34 ; soaking completely into the skin after a few hours . It leaves hands very soft and well moisturized ; perfect for night treatments.If you have severely chapped dry hands this is a great product because it will not cause a burning sensation that most hand lotions will . The formula is extremely gentle and would work on most cases of dry cracked skin .	1
I like the Neutrogena hand cream because the consistency is slightly different from a regular body lotion . It seems to last a bit longer . The size of these is convenient as well .	1
The original Norwegian Formula hand cream rivals the original European Nivea cream . This was a perfect winter hand cream that was n't as turbo-greasy as Aquaphor but rich enough for chronically dry/cracked hands .	1
This stuff is great ! It keeps your hands hydrated and a bottle is so small but will last forever ! You really just need a dab and your hands will be silky smooth . Perfect for the winter !	1
This creme is super heavy duty , but tends to disappear as it soaks in . Great for hands and feet . Being in Arizona , I am always having to apply some kind of creme to my heels and hands to combat dryness . I 've run through about a dozen , high-end and low-end , but nothing works quite like the Norwegian Formula . Must be all the glycerin ? I would n't use it on my face , obviously , but anywhere you have itchy , cracked or super dry skin , go for it .	1
First of all , thank you to all the other reviewers who persuaded me to give the Norwegian Formula Hand Cream a try ! I ca n't remember the last time my hands were this soft ... if ever.It took a little less than 7 days of regular use to smooth my rough , winter skin and now my hands are soft all the time and that includes after washing dishes . There is no scent so the men in the household also did not mind giving it a try . I would recommend this product to anyone who suffers from chronically dry , rough hands and probably will never buy another brand of hand cream again .	1
I bought this cream one winter for dry skin and very drying tap water , but did n't use it very much because I live in a pretty warm climate where super cold/dry spells are pretty rare . I nearly tossed it when I was moving but decided to keep it , and I 'm so glad I did . I use Epiduo for my acne , which dried out my combo/dry skin even more and made it very red and sensitive . My entire face , and especially around my eyes , was so painfully dry and flaky . Even fragrance-free/sensitive skin creams and lotions still burned and irritated my skin . My skin was flaking so bad during the day from my makeup it was disgusting by the end of the day . I thought I was just going to have to stop using my acne creams altogether , my face was so bad.One night in desperation I pulled this out of the medicine cabinet , and noticed on the back it was non-comodegenic and said you could use it anywhere- lips , eyes , face . I bravely slathered this everywhere , and it was like a miracle for my skin . It did n't burn , there was no fragrance , and it soothed my irritated skin . After a few days of using it morning and night my skin was 200 % improved , and my acne has almost entirely cleared up . My acne creams are able to work since my skin is n't constantly dry and irritated , and my skin is seriously glowing from how healthy and moisturized it is now . My makeup goes on perfectly ! I use this every night , and sometimes very lightly in the morning if I have a dry spot . It 's great on lips and , of course , hands and everywhere else . I carry this with me all the time now . Highly recommended !	1
This is MUCH more than a hand cream . It 's not really a cream , which initially disappointed me ; it 's basically a slightly thinner , petrolatum/vaseline-type product . I initially just wanted a fragrance-free creamy hand lotion I could put rub into my hands the same way I would with any other lotion . But this has a slightly different purpose ; it 's more of a dry skin treatment than a standard lotion-type moisturizer . I found that if I rubbed just a dab on the backs of my hands and on my nails where they can get a rough , ragged and chapped , it softened them up within a matter of a few days . And because it 's a little thinner than vaseline , it rubs right in . If it leaves behind any residue , I have n't noticed . I also use it on other dry areas like my elbows and knees without concern that it will come off on my clothes . I have also started using it 2 or 3 times a day on the very rough , dry areas on my feet , including my heels . I spend much of the year barefoot and never wear socks down here in our almost tropical climate . Now , with just a few applications , most of the dry areas are basically `` cured , '' and my VERY dry , cracked heels are close to it . I will have to continue using it as a preventive measure , but it does work beautifully.Since the tube size is legally small enough to put in my carry-on on flights and I prefer the fragrance-free version , I can also use it on my face around my eyes and my lips which get dry on long flights . It 's basically a multi-purpose product I would n't be without and costs no more than a regular jar of vaseline . OTOH , if you ARE looking for something thicker like vaseline , you might find this a little on the thin side . I still recommend trying it , though .	1
I have really bad allergy/eczema on my hands mainly palms or between fingers during warm months . It gets little blisters with fluid inside and that 's when it gets very itchy . It 's such intense itchiness that I ca n't stop itching ... Then blisters open and crusted on the skin , then it gets cracked open . This year is the worst , it spread on my entire right hand , which really makes it difficult to do anything . I went to doctors for this , probably couple times previously , only thing they give out is prescription strength hydrocortisone that works temporarily but soon enough stop working altogether . I tried homeopathic , herbs , all kinds of stuff but this is the cream that succeeded to moisturize the cracked skin without getting itchy . Other moisturizing creams even the kind for sensitive skin or natural kind , always made my skin even more itchy though it moisturize it okay . But this cream moisturize best , and if used on my kind of skin problem , it 'll feel so much better after the skin absorbs it . If your skin feels greasy after using this cream , then this must be too heavy for your dry skin . So I recommend this cream to only those who have EXTREME dryness that cracks the skin and bleed , or you have allergy/eczema like me . I sleep with glove on after I put generous amount of this cream , then my skin feels so much better in the morning . Wonderful product !	1
Awesome lotion for anyone suffering from dry skin . It works especially well for dry cracked heels and feet . If you 're having problems with cracked heels just apply a thick layer before bed and do n't forget to put on some socks , otherwise you 'll get the sheets all messy.The reason that the neutrogena takes so long to dry on your skin is because of the high percentage of glycerin in it . But that 's also what makes it so good for your skin .	1
My hands and legs get very dry especially in the winter . I have tried many products , but Neutrogena Norwegian Formula provides the best relief . Nothing comes close . I 'm glad it 's packaged in a 4 pack because that 's about what I 'll need to get through a winter !	1
I work in a medical office , wash my hands about 60 times a day and get very dry skin , especially in the winter and this is the BEST hand cream out there , and I have tried dozens of hand creams . It is greasy at first , but absorbs quickly and prevents cracking and dry skin if you apply frequently . This is a must in my purse at all times .	1
This is one of the few hand creams that I can whole heartedly recommend . It is a concentrated formula so you only need to use a little bit . It 's best to use this cream at night , maybe even with some lotion gloves , it will keep your hands feeling nice and soft .	1
I had used this years ago , and did n't like it because it was too thick . The formula must have changed , or I am more intelligent and used it properly this time ! Yes , it is more like an ointment than a cream , but it goes on creamy IF your skin is fresh from the shower or hand washing . Just use a little . Do not glop it on . My dermatologist suggested using this as a night time hand cream for my dry hands . It works really well using it this way , and if I need to I can add a little extra and put on gloves .	1
This Neutrogena hand cream is the only product that provides moisturizing for both my hands and even my face . I have tried too many other products to count and was so glad to re-discover this great hand cream . My skin was getting progressively drier with weather conditions and as I get older , but problem solved . Thanks Neutrogena !	1
After putting this on I forget about my dry winter hands for hours . I just wish it came in a lager size and with a better cap .	1
I have trouble with hand creams because my hands sweat more than the average person 's . As a result , I find this lotion to be somewhat slow absorbing . It almost feels like a thicker version of aquaphor - very rich and emoliant , maybe even a bit greasy . However , I notice that my cuticles are very well moisturized when I use this and the effects last several hours . I suggest using it sparingly . It wo n't be my holy grail hand cream , but I will definitely use it in conjunction with a more fast absorbing and lighter lotion .	1
This is good especially as the winter progresses , but I prefer something a little creamier . I like the size for purse , desk drawer and car .	1
This stuff really does work . The hype is real . I have been using Crabtree & Evelyn 's gardner 's hand therapy for years and have really liked it , but this stuff just plain works better . The other stuff is good though , if you need an alternative , but it 's more expensive and frankly is n't as good.I live in the Pacific Northwest , which typically does n't have a very dry climate . But we are having a very cold spell right now with no moisture in the air and my skin is drying up something awful . And , this stuff has saved my hands and , believe it or not , my face ! I use argan & maracuja oils on my face typically and they do wonders , but this magic potion is taking care of a pesky dry spot on my face as we speak.This stuff is fragrance free too , so any of you sensitive folks will have no problem . And a little goes a long way as it is very concentrated .	1
I 'm absolutely in love with this hand cream . Since it 's winter my hands have been cracking a lot and feeling really dry . If it is n't the weather , it 's washing my hands too often , but this cream has completely healed my hands . After one or two uses ( overnight ) my hands feel and look better ! You need only a small amount to get this result too ( : It does feel a little tacky after you apply it , but give a minute or two and it 'll sink into your skin . It 'll be like it 's not even there ! I totally recommend this product . No doubt in my mind .	1
**Updated review -- I 've continued to use this product daily and found that it also works on razor burn . I found the product to be incredibly soothing on any surface used to shave ( legs , face , etc ) , and of course the product absorbs immediately . With highly sensitive skin that is prone to break out for any reason under the sun , this product continues to get an A+ from me and from those in my family that use the product as well . **This item was pricey , but well worth every penny . First of all , this product is extremely thick so a little goes a very , very long way.This is an intensive lotion meant to treat dry skin and restore it to it 's naturally soft condition . I found that it is best used at nighttime . I 've tried using it with nighttime gloves , and that works well too . I just prefer to rub it on my hands and go to bed . The only reason that I did n't give it 5 stars is because I do n't prefer to wear gloves at night , and because it takes time to absorb , you pretty much need the gloves so you do n't chance getting the lotion on other things while it dries . I figured it out to be about 20 minutes before it fully absorbed , but I put on quite a bit ! Because this takes longer to absorb , I would n't recommend using this as a daily lotion you might leave by the soap dish by the bathroom next to the sink.I use this daily , and because it 's so concentrated , that 's all I need to maintain smoother skin . It 's no easy task when you have kids of your own and are around kids at a daycare where germs spread like the plague . For every diaper change , sneeze , runny nose and shared food , I am washing my hands A LOT ! This product works as advertised ! It also works wonders on cracked elbows , heels and is soothing for skin conditions like Eczema .	1
This hand cream was created for use by Norwegian fishermen working in the North Atlantic . There is nothing glamorous about it . It does n't have pretty packaging , there is no pretty fragrance , it tends to be a little slow to absorb and it is gooey if you get too much on . However ... it is hands down , without a doubt , the hand cream that produces the best results over any other , in my opinion . I use it at night ( I use a more easily absorbed cream during the day ) and the next morning my hands are kitten-soft and incredibly smooth . Not surprising . After all , if it can help those fishermen braving the icey waters of the North Atlantic , think what it can do with our hands !	1
My hands have always gotten pretty awful in the winter but this year is worse because I work at a job where I have to wash my hands many many times a day . My hands were horribly red and between my fingers were starting to bleed . It got to the point if water even touched my hands , it really hurt . I bought this after seeing some adverts for it . I am so happy I did . The first time I used it , it was a little off putting because it is so thick . I did n't know why it was n't absorbing into my hands . Then I realized I just had to work it into my hands more than normal lotion . After the first use , I noticed a difference . After daily use for months , my hands feel great and are still soft.I only use this right before I go to bed . I work it into my hands , wait a couple minutes , then work a little more in . Some people may find this overkill but like I said , my hands get very dry . Because it 's so thick , I do n't use this during the day . I uses Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion a few times throughout the day . But , if I did n't use this at night , the Aveeno would n't be so effective during the day .	1
I was surprised to see how quickly the winter dryness had affect my hands -- and only my hands . The Neutrogena lotion showed up at exactly the right time ! I was even more surprised to see how fast it worked . The thick and greasy formula is obviously for when your skin needs emergency attention , and it took no more than two days for my skin to look and feel better . You 'd have no idea my skin was dry and flaky just last week ! The Norwegian formula , as I mentioned , it quite thick . It looks like a translucent gel in the bottle . It stays exactly where you put it and turns white as you rub it into your skin . You definitely need to rub it in well , and a little goes a long way . If you use too much , your skin might feel a little sticky after.I would n't recommend it for every day use if you 're not experiencing rather dry skin , but it 's great for cracked and dry hands and feet , too ! I 'd definitely buy this again if the dry skin returns .	1
This is hands down THE best product for dry hands ! As it says on the front of the tube , `` just a dab '' rubbed into the back of each hand and , poof , scales , cracks , dryness , and pain are GONE . The effects last for several washings . It 's amazing . One tube lasts a long time because you use only a dab at a time . Do n't over-apply ! Suggestion : draw a short , thin line of product across the back of one hand and use one finger of the other hand to massage it in from wrist to fingertips ; after the gel turns white and then disappears into your skin , repeat on the opposite hand ; then rub your hands together to get any remaining gel onto the inside of your hands . Apply sparingly . Do n't use it like ordinary hand lotions/creams - it 's not like those products ; it 's a one-of-a-kind product . Applied correctly , it will leave your hands smooth and soft without feeling wet or greasy . It 's fragrance-free , so there 's no obnoxious perfume smell . Enjoy !	1
This is my favorite hand lotion . A tiny dab moisturizes both hands . I find I have to reapply it fairly often , but I have n't found any better products .	1
This hand cream is just the best out there . My father has faithfully used it for decades . I rarely needed it until my mid-20s , but when my hands are dry it follows true to its motto , & # 34 ; Just a dab heals dry skin. & # 34 ; The consistency is , at first , something like vaseline . You expect it to be oily and slick . Rub your hands together for about 10 seconds , though , and they feel baby-soft with no residue . It 's borderline-magical . It also works for me on elbows and any dry patch of skin . I wish there were versions of this for feet and face , though ; it does n't apply as well to those areas . Cracked heels and breakouts will have to find another cure.Still , this is the only brand of lotion I have ever bought twice . You should put it at the top of your list to try if you have dry hands .	1
I LOVE THIS STUFF ! This is by far the most moisturizing cream I have used without being oily . I use it on my lips and as eye cream and can totally see the difference . If you have chapped skin I would use this .	1
My mom started using this product and has been `` addicted '' to it ever since . She uses it when her hands are dry any time of the year . I was a little skeptical of this `` miracle cure '' ( as said by my mom ) , but when I tried it out I must say that I was pretty impressed . My dry skin went from being rough and , well , dry to smooth and moist ( but not too moist . .just enough to feel nice ) . The only problem I had with this hand cream was that it was very thick and it made my hands very sticky/slippery for quite some time . .a longer time than most lotions/hand creams . . .But , after it dried out some , everything was cool . ..	1
I have spent so much money over the years on skincare ! Bought all the expensive brands ( Estee Lauder , Lancome etc ) My skin is sensitive and on the drier side and almost everything I used did not work . I use this for my face ! I am 53 and this stuff is incredible ! It makes your skin very soft and not greasy at all ! I Great under your make up too . The glycerine is the ingredient that will do the trick ! I have used it now for years and I will not buy anything else . You need so little that it lasts a long time too .	1
I works . Really . On hand AND FOOD AND EVERYWEHRE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! but it 's kind of annoying when it leaves your palms oily and eventually i wipe it on my shirt ... but it works so good i can not resist putting it on	1
Neutrogena hand cream is just about the best heavy-duty hand lotion out there . It is n't nearly as greasy as many of the hand creams on the market . It is quick and easy to apply because it rubs into your skin fairy quickly , yet its effects are long lasting . Using this cream a couple of times a day really helps my chapped hands.The only drawback of this product as far as I 'm concerned is its packaging . The old version of this product used to have a flip-top cap which was much easier to use and less messy than the screw-on cap which the new version has .	1
I have been using this hand cream for nearly 20 years and is perfect . I have has issues with my hands cracking and bleeding during the winter months , I worked at a hospital and a nurse told me about trying this and it almost seemed impossible to have hands that could feel so soft and not bleed . I have dry skin to start with then the winters have made them almost impossible to keep them from hurting and this stuff has made them feel almost normal . I gave some to my grandma that had very dry skin like mine and this is all she uses and was so thankful for the product . I would recommend this to anyone who has any issue with dryness on the body . You will thank yourself for giving this a try .	1
Just to clarify , here 's what this product is NOT : -this is NOT lightweight-this is NOT instantly-absorbing-this is NOT watery or creamyBasically , do n't expect the milky , instantly-absorbing hand creams you 'd find at places like L'occitane or C & E . ; The formula is more akin to stuff like Aquaphor , so 'hand cream ' might be a bit of a misnomer ( this is more of a waxy gel than a cream ) .Be warned -- this formula IS waxy , thick , and not as easy to spread as runny , milky hand creams . BUT , it absorbs quickly enough , and application is n't particularly laborious . A little goes a long way.Here 's why I like it : -NON-IRRITATING : I tend to get eczema during dry winters , on sensitive areas of my face/arms ( e.g . around my lips , elbows , etc ) . I 've tried tons of creams meant for 'sensitive skin ' , that only served to provoke already-irritated/dry skin . This stuff has never once irritated inflamed skin.-NON-GREASY : ok , so this stuff does n't instantly disappear onto your skin . BUT , it 's not nearly as grossly greasy as products that are mostly petrolatum ( e.g . Aquaphor , Vaseline ) . If I have an eczema flareup on my face , I do n't want patches of shiny grease . Thankfully , this stuff is not that.-ACTUALLY HEALS DRY SKIN : I visited to numerous dermatologists who all told me `` no idea what causes eczema , nothing you can do except use your topical steroid creams '' . It was a vicious cycle : sensitive-skin formulas like Cetaphil , Cerave , Eucerin , etc , only provoked already-irritated skin , and thus could n't provide much-needed hydration . Which made my skin dry . But when I used water , it only further dried out my skin . Topical steroid ointments were the only things that worked , until I tried this stuff . It 's seriously a life saver !	1
First tried this over a year ago when it was on sale , 2 for 5 bucks , and have been hooked ever since . This stuff is AMAZING , I usually hate most lotions/creams for one reason or another , too oily , smell , etc but this stuff is the BEST . I wo n't use anything else now , if you 've hated lotions in the past but have dry hands do yourself a favor and just try it , I bet you wont be dissapointed !	1
Every winter my hands get really chapped . Even if I wear gloves . They crack and bleed and are just not attractive . Every year I try to find something that works . I took a chance and bought this item . It 's amazing ! I put some on last night and immediately noticed that my knuckles were n't as tight and my skin was softer . Applied a little more before bedtime . This morning , my hands are silky smooth . There 's no cracking , no chapping and they look amazing ! It is thick , and until it absorbs it leaves your hands feeling a little weird . But it does n't take long to absorb and that feeling goes away . For the results , it 's well worth it ! I recommend this product to anyone who ca n't find anything that works .	1
I love this moisturizer . It covers my face well and it is good protection from the sun . I will definitely keep buying this product .	1
I 've been using this product for years . I like it.It protects my skin and it does n't feel greasy.It 's not real expensive either . I recommend it .	1
I live this product - it is great as a moisturizer and is n't too heavy for my oily skin . I love the scent but , unfortunately , I think that is what made my skin tingle when I first started using it . The tingle has gone away , for the most part , but people with sensitive skin or people ( like me ) who use things like Retin-A that make their skin sensitive , take note . I think next time I 'll try the Olay Pro-X Age Repair Lotion or the Total Effects 7-In-1 .	1
Nice and light , though it does leave me skin a little oily . When used with a primer , it works just fine . I recommend Revlon 's Photo Ready primer .	1
When I buy moisturizer the single most important factor is the SPF , and I also consider the price . This is a good moisturizer that not only has the proper ingredients to provide great sun protection , but is also reasonably priced and lasts a long time . I will buy another brand if it has the right ingredients and is cheaper , but this brand is available at most stores and I know I can trust it .	1
So far so good ! I 'm happy with the results . My skin is not really oily since I 've used this . Like this product	1
This is my favorite face moisturizer and I would recommend it for daily use . I have tried other face moisturizers and they are either too expensive or hard to find again or do n't work well or at all . I usually sunburn with even a small amount of exposure but this product is just the right texture , easy to use and a good base for my skin .	1
Bought this for my mother while Amazon was offering coupons on different Olay products , and I 'm glad I did . I was looking for a good daily moisturizer with some SPF protection for her mature skin , and this was the right balance of price and quality . I will repurchase when she runs out .	1
I 've been using this product for a several years . At first I used it on my face and neck , but as I got older , I needed a creamier moisturizer for my face as my skin became drier . I still buy this for my neck though . I 've seen women with really wrinkly necks , so far mine is OK.I have ultra sensative skin , this Olay does n't hurt when I put it on , I like the fact that it has SPF 15 which helps a little bit to protect my skin from the sun . If I 'm going to be out in the sun for a long time , I use a different product , with a high number , SPF 30 to 50.When I ordered this , I thought it was the larger size , so when it arrived , I was a bit disappointed . I bought another one exactly the same , in this size at Walmart a few days ago , it only cost $ 5 , I paid $ 6 here on here Amazon , it 's good to shop around.I would recommend this for those who are just beginning to use a moisturizer .	1
Non greasy , fragrance free , absorbs fast , base for makeup , moisturizes , lasts all day and can be used under or over another product . Olay lotions are the best I 've ever used . I will burn down cities if they stop making it . Not really . I will probably just be incredibly sad . Love olay .	1
This is my other go-to moisturizer that is SPF 15 . It has a perfect texture and works very well and I will buy again .	1
I love this lotion . It smells good but it is not strongly scented , it feels good on my skin ( not too heavy , not too light ) , and it definitely moisturizes all day .	1
I do n't know what Jaag is talking about . I love this product . I have extremely fair and very sensitive skin and this does n't burn my face at all . It moisturizes well and I really like it .	1
always my dad 's favorite .	1
This face cream is very light and easy to apply . There is no harsh sunblock-y smell , or stinging when I apply it . Also , my skin absorbs it well .	1
HG face moisturizer . its the only kind i can use that wont break me out with repeated use . wish the spf were higher . i only use the classic formula with zinc .	1
I love it is why I give this an A+ . Great lotion and feels very good on my skin . I do recommend this lotion .	1
This really helped add moisture to my skin . it is light a weightless . A little but goes a long way and I usually only have to apply it once a day to keep my skin smooth and supple .	1
All 3 arrived in great condition , and I use quite a lot of this product in the Summer time . I have tried so many other costly sunscreen products , and found them all to be rather sticky . I am handicapped and like to sit outside in good weather . I used to freckle up so much , even though many sunscreens say up to 30 minutes . But with this light formula I do n't have to use very much , and I do n't look like our Dalmatian . This is sort of funny , but when I used other sunscreen products my sweet dog did n't like the smell and she would n't sit real close to me out side . Animals are very sensitive to smells . It is a very nice product , and I 'm sure that other customers will enjoy it also as the moisturizer keeps the skin so nice and soft .	1
Since I 've turned 20 , I have had problems with blemishes . So , for the last few years , I began to try many different face cleansers and lotions to solve the problem , and finally stumbled upon this one . It 's lightweight and definitely moisturizes just enough . I never feel like my face is oily or greasy . My blemishes have n't completely gone away , but ever since I began using this lotion , my skin has been noticeably clearer . I assume it 's because it does n't clog my pores like my old lotion must have . The only complaint I have is about the bottle . When you squeeze it , you either get no lotion , or the lotion explodes everywhere . I wish they would put a pump on the bottle or something , so that I would n't be wasting so much lotion when I barely squeeze it and it all comes flying out .	1
olay has definitely the best skin care products , i have tried many brands in the past and always return to olay .	1
I have been using this lotion for years I love it ! It has SPF in it too ! ? I feel like it keeps my face mositurrized all day and the SPF also helps . It works great under make up .I highly recommend !	1
I have simply fell in love with this facial moisturizer . I 've found that most sunscreen containing facial lotions feel heavy on my face and irritate my skin . This does n't do that at all , and the best part of all is it 's not greasy but actually leaves a kind of dry finish to my skin that is perfect for applying makeup . I would recommend this again and again !	1
My face was horrible and I was starting to notice that I was n't looking as vibrant as I needed to for someone as young as I am . ( I bought this product when I was 24 and I am now 26 ) . My skin is horribly acne prone and incredibly sensitive . I have trouble with clogged pores and I really thought since I already have such heavily oily skin that adding more moisture or oil would just send my skin into overload.I could n't be more wrong . After a month or two of using the product I noticed that my skin had a healthy glow , I noticed that I was n't as oily . I also noticed that in combination with using my acne treatments that my outbreaks were n't as bad , but were getting better over time . It has helped with the elasticity of my eyes and a little of the product goes a long way . I have had the same bottle for over two years and I just can not seem to finish the product . It is an amazing little moisturizer . I really like how the SPF 15 is enough for my skin to counter the sun , but become a little darker over time . I really enjoy this product and when fall comes around again , I will definitely be getting another bottle of it .	1
Makes my face feel moisturized and very soft after washing it . Would recommend if you 're in need of a good moisturizer !	1
I am over 50 and have used this for years , it works the best . I have some other stuff , its lighter and ok for summer . This is really great in the winter weather . poepl comment all the time on how lovely my skin is , I rarely wear any make up .	1
Very moisturizing and great protection against the elements at a reasonable price . I have sensitive skin that irritates easily and this has always been kind to it .	1
I always purchase this . It 's great because I live in a sunny climate and have sensitive skin . This cream make my skin feel soft And hydrated .	1
good product does what it says oil of olay products a good used it for my trip to mexico last month and the price was great	1
I use Olay Complete on my face in the morning and at night before bed . It makes my face feel so soft and smooth .	1
Give it 2-3weeks and I gaurentee you will be glad you tried it , it is light and thirst quenching on the skin and seems to cover a multitued of tasks , you will not need seperate creams for eyes etc . My tip is to use it a s a night and day cream after gentle washing and exfoliaiting the face . By night put slighty too much on so as the skin has to slowly drink it in.You really will see a plumpness and radiance to your face in this space of time . This stuff is not bank breakingly expensive either .	1
I have used this product for many years and have always liked it . My mom also loved it , before she passed away . This was a great deal ; I saved money by ordering the bundle	1
I 'm 35 years old ( soon to be 36 ) and I generally stay out of the sun , so I do n't have to worry about wrinkles yet ! However , I 'd like to KEEP my skin looking youthful , and I know that I do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work . Also , several older relatives ( 70s and 80s ) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces . I figure if I start working on prevention NOW , when I reach that age , I 'll be less likely to develop the same problem.Furthermore , I 've been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately , and these are drying to my skin . Ideally , I wanted a moisturizer with some sun protection that could also help keep my skin from drying out . This moisturizer was a quick ( i.e. , without any research ) , off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore . I have not used any Olay products in the past.This product seems to be doing an excellent job , so far . While I ca n't predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years , I 'm very happy with the day-to-day benefits of using this moisturizer . I put this on in the morning before going to work and wash my face again about 10 hours later . During that time , my face does not look oily at all . Further , I have sensitive skin and I do n't notice any redness or irritation . Also , this product does not have a fragrance to it ( fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin ) . So it truly is good for MY sensitive skin.One problem I have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when I dye my hair , the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead ( I have a pale complexion and I dye my hair black ) . I end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days . I 've had one hair appointment so far since I started using this moisturizer , and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead this time ! I also think my skin is pretty soft since I 've been using this , and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts ( the package says it is non-comedogenic ) , so that 's nice , as well . For what it 's worth , it 's easy to put on makeup ( i.e. , foundation ) after applying this moisturizer . Finally , you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face ; I expect the bottle to last a long time.Wow , I do n't normally gush about skincare products this much . I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really ca n't think of anything I do n't like about the product . At any rate , I 'd definitely recommend this moisturizer .	1
This is a wonderful eye make up remover . I use a small dap , sub and them wipe off with a cotton round . It takes off heavy eyeliner and mascara . Its slightly greasy so i always was my face afterwards with soap to take the oily residue off .	1
I used to use this as a teenager but for some reason stopped . I 've been using covergirl foundation over olay face cream for years but for some reason my face started breaking out recently . So I bought a bottle of this and my face cleared right up and I do n't even need the olay cream because this cold cream moisturizes my face plenty	1
I have horribly dry and sensitive skin that freaks out every time the seasons change . This year , as winter was arriving , has been the worst - too much unusual dry and cold weather . So , my face felt like it had been put through a meatgrinder ( and kinda looked that way too - red , blotchy , flaky ... ) . I have spent a small fortune on skincare over my 35 years - more in the last 10 as things have gotten progressively worse . I have tried all-natural solutions , expensive stuff , drugstore stuff ... some work for a short while and then stop , some do n't work at all . Some are great for sensitive , but do n't do enough for dry - some are great for dry but sting when I put them on.Anyway - out of desperation this year , I thought I would try this ( as well as the lotion ) . It has been WONDERFUL ! My face looks better than it has in months - it is soothing and moisturizing , without being too heavy or leaving me with those crazy red bumps that some products are prone to . I have been using the combo for about a month , and so far have had no problems.I use it 2x a day , putting about a teaspoon on my face and massaging for a minute or two . I then wipe it off with a warm damp washcloth . I follow it with the lotion and I am good . At night , I just use extra.I ca n't say enough good things about this combo . I finally feel like my skin is reasonably `` normal '' - hopefully , this can be a keeper !	1
I 've bought so many cleansers- clarien , Clinique , lancome , Kiehls , cremes , liquids , wipes , etc . After all these years with all these products I 'm back to the one my mom and my aunt used all those years ago - and it works , and it 's great .	1
I purchased this cleanser and am quite pleased with the results . The item is now one of my regular purchases . Thick cream and if you put it in the fridge it is great to put on cold and then wash off or wipe off after it warms to regular temperature . This little trick also keeps the product shelf life longer and is so soothing after a hard day .	1
Unless you buy this by the caseload , I THINK you will get a better price at your local drugstore . The jar I received was tiny ( my abd for not checking the size more closely ) . The product itself is great for my very sensitive skin . It takes off makeup and eyemakeup like nothing else can .	1
All my life I 've heard about how horrible mineral oil is so I 've just avoided it . It turns out my skin loves the stuff . I started washing my face with this after using a cream wash overseas that I could not find in the US . I had noticed that some eczema which I could not get to clear up started getting better after using cleansing cream as my face wash . I was put out by the heavy rose geranium scent ( though if they use rose geranium oil it 's probably not so bad for the skin ) , but I find this does a great job of dissolving makeup and grease while leaving my skin soft.I 've tried the oil cleansing method before with a lot of success so I understand how oil can clean the skin well . However , I found the oil cleansing method to much trouble to keep up with . Cleansing cream dissolves just a little faster and easier and requires less heat on my face , which is good.I find just rubbing this in is pleasant , and then washing it off with a warm rag is good enough to leave my skin very clean but soft.I have not seen any increase in breakouts after using this , myself . I 'm very happy with the product and see why it 's been around so long .	1
Out of all of the current Pond 's cleansing products , this is the best for removing eye makeup . It takes off everything , and leaves your skin moisturized . Please note the size of this particular container - it 's very small .	1

******UPDATE JULY 10 2013********Regarding my old review below , I WILL NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ANYMORE . Sadly , they have changed the ingredients . It is loaded with chemicals now and I will not put them on my skin . If it helps any , I now cleanse with pure coconut oil , using same procedure ! Hope my sharing helps you.God bless . ********************************************************Now I know why my grandmother swore by cold cream ! If you have DRY skin this is hands down THE BEST moisturizing cleanser on the market.Recently I 've have had to change my skincare routine because my skin is now DRY instead of normal . I 've been searching for products to both make my skin look radiant and to actually improve it . I have found my cleanser : PONDS COLD CREAM . Who would have thought ? PROCEDURE : I use Ponds to clean my face/take off my makeup in the evening.After applying it to my face I use several tissues or a damp cloth to take it off.NOTE : I 've noticed that my skin stays more `` dewey '' if I use tissues.IMPORTANT : If you 're wearing mascara it WILL get a bit messy ! ( You may prefer to use an eye makeup remover - I do n't . ) RESULTS : My skin looks moist and I could NOT be happier.I hope you have as great of results as I did ! God bless : )	1
I will readily admit that the ingredients are not great . That 's why I gave 4 out 5 stars . But ... It works . I 've got dry skin specially because I live in a dry climate . After washing my face , it would be greasy looking in less than an hour . I realized my skin was too dry and it was overcompensating . The area around my eyes has drastically improved and my skin is n't as greasy looking.Since using this product for a few months , it does clog my skin . I now only use it around my eyes , cleaning gently with a washcloth . I have seen a big difference in keeping the area around my eyes moisterized .	1
This is a basic make-up remover . I forgot how thick it is . It does a good job at removing my make-up . You need to wipe it off with a face cloth or wet wipe to remove . It will not come off with just a water splash . It leaves my skin soft and dewey . I would recommend to you if you like the extra removal step . You wil need to follow with a toner to completely remove the residue from your skin . Nice scent .	1
The product has been around for years and has proven itself to be an excellent makeup remover . I will continue to purchase it . Amazon has very good prices and is prompt .	1
This does have the extra ingredients that some people on here are unhappy about , but it does not sting or burn me whatsoever . It feels very mild and nice on my face . Everybody was raving about the smell , so I was surprised when I opened it and realized that the smell is kind of like a grandmother 's perfume . It 's not a bad smell at all , though . The cream takes my make-up off nicely , even tough liquid liner . I was really surprised by how small the jar actually is , but after using it I realized that this stuff will last me forever . You only need a very small amount to do the trick . Overall , I 'd recommend this to anybody !	1
I love this stuff so much . When reading the other reviews I was really concerned that I would end up getting some in my eyes and that it would hurt like mad , but I use it to remove my mascara and I have n't had an issue yet . I only use this stuff at night , because it 's a bit too much for my skin to use as a morning and evening cleanser . I recommend it for oily/combination skin !	1
I use this after I wash my face and before I put on makeup . I use it morning & night in the winter , and at night in the summer , on my face and neck . It does not take much at all to cover a lot of area . One container lasts me forever ! My brother even uses this in the winter when his skin gets so dry.This does n't clog my acne-prone pores at all ! And works wonders very quickly ! ( I like to think it also helps me avoid wrinkles ! - I have n't gotten any yet ! ) This moisturizes without that greasy feeling some products can leave you with . I highly recommend this ! 1smileycat : - )	1
Reasonably priced skin cream that can go on under makeup for daywear and apply liberally at night . I have been using this for years and it does softens skin in an extra rich texture that has a pleasing and recognizable scent.Since I am allergic to lanolin and have had sensitive skin my whole life I first checked the ingredients on the back of the jar and found this is not listed.There is also no sticky feeling left on your hands or face after applying and no tightness present on the face . It feels so silky when applied after I have come inside from a hot day , relief in a small jar that can be applied over face and throat . I have noticed a big difference in how my face looks since I first started using Pond 's Dry Skin Cream .	1
I never taken care of my face as I should so I ordered a jar of this to start the process . Turning 30 is boring and hard . so far this has been a really , really great choice ! ! I have very sensitive skin and I get little to no breakouts and this lotion has been a perfect balance to keep that consistent . I 've tried other lotions that claimed to be amazing ( I 'm looking at you Lush ) and have either broken out of the ingredients have dried my skin out drastically.I will buy this again and continue to use it .	1
I bought this to replace the cetaphil moisturizer I was using and I am pleasantly surprised . I wish it had a better fragrance but it gives my skin the moisture it needs .	1
I have reordered this product because I do very well with it . It provides good moisturization and does not cause breakouts.Better than some higher priced products .	1
I have been using this for about 10 years now and I really love it ! I usually buy it at Walmart because I can get the enormous jar for a pretty good price . I have always had pretty clear , dry skin so this moisturizer is perfect for me !	1
I have extremely dry skin ... if I scratch my face in certain areas , like around my nose , skin flakes off , it 's so dry . So of course I 've tried every kind of moisturizer out there . This has worked the best for me . You only need a littlebit , I put it on and my face stays moisturized all day without my skin soaking it up and drying right back out . But it 's definitely only for dry skin . Other people will say its greasy , but if your skin is truly dry like mine , It 'll soak it right up and stay moisturized and it wo n't look greasy .	1
This would especially be good for winter months when it 's cold and windy because it 's a little heavier . Love the smell of it !	1
Great hydration without the breakouts . Scent is alittle much and may not work for alot of people with allergies to fragrance . They need to make one fragrance free then I would rate it a 5 star .	1
This is super effective in moisturizing dry spots . It might be a tiny bit too much for daily use on my combination/oily skin though . But I was in a desert for a vacation and came back with peeling skin on the sides of my nose and used expensive creams to no avail . 2 days with this and it was gone like magic . Recommended highly for dry skin . I just use the excess now on my body and it smells like baby powder . ( Depending on how you like that smell )	1
I have to echo the other two excellent reviews of this product . I too have been using this for about twenty five years off and on , but I always come back to this . The scent is great , yet light not at all cloying , the coverage is excellent and very thorough , really tones down the pinky brown color that is my skin after cleansing and applying makeup . The colors do tend to run on the light side , just as a warning if you have darker skin . I would recommend the non color adding Translucent if your skin is darker . I use the light-med . and it is perfect for my light skin . The result is flawless , smooth , lovely and a luminous complexion . The one I trust and will use forever . Note* While I love the looks of the vintage packaging ( has n't changed since 1935 ) , it can be hard to control the stuff from the inside . I recommend poking holes in the plastic , so as to control the product coming out . A few years ago , they put out a sifter with this and why on earth they discontinued it , I have n't a clue . Other than that small technical defect , this stuff continues to rock ! ! ! Best powder out there .	1
I have used Coty for years . Love the texture , coverage and smell . It goes on evenly and helps keep my make up fresh looking all day long .	1
Ditto all previous reviews . I do use or need foundation when I use this powder.excellent flawless coverage . I am 60 years old . I did buy this at Walmart for 5.83 . Sorry Amazon .	1
Ok , so I tried this a few years ago and gave it a thumbs down . Well I 'm now 50 and in need of some light coverage instead of the more heavy coverage I needed before . A little background on me : I 'm half Japanese , olive toned , oily T zone area and slight chin acne off and on . I 've been using Everyday minerals but it 's making my skin appear rough and too & # 34 ; made up & # 34 ; for my liking . I did try BB cream ( Skin79 hot pink ) but the color was too light and I am having to mix with another foundation to get a good color . While I looking around I came across this stuff in my old make up bin . Thought I 'd try it again . Well it really does a great job of evening my skin out and keeping my natural skin color . This a BIG plus . It is really hard to find a good olive color and I tan quite well in the summer and pale out in the winter . It 's really a pain for me to find the right color going back and forth mixing colors . This works no matter how dark or light I am . I also struggle with some large pores on my T zone area . This stuff really helps in that dept a lot . Though my pores are still there , they are no longer noticeable and I no longer have to use a pore primer ! The only thing I use is a light under eye concealer underneath and spot treatment on my chin and then brush it on . Another great thing is that this has great staying power.Really keeps the oiliness at bay . I really need that living in Texas ! It 's cheap but not that easy to find but it 's big tub so I would imagine it will last a good long time . The smell if not offensive to me at all . It 's nice girly smell , not like sulfur or something like that . So I 'm changing my mind . For now this is what works for me ; )	1
This is the only cosmetic product I 've stuck with for over 25 years . This powder has been around forever and there is a reason for that . It has a very fine texture which applies perfectly . It is also very inexpensive . Most people would be able to use this powder without foundation , since it enhances and perfects the complexion so well . Unless you really need extra coverage , I recommend the basic translucent shade if you wear foundation , which should work with nearly every complexion . The other shades are heavier and , if used with certain foundations , might not last as well for over 8 hours without caking . On the other hand , the heavier extra coverage shades work very well without foundation . I 've tried Christian Dior , Lancome , Elizabeth Arden , and a million other loose powders and none of them compare to Coty .	1
I love this stuff its just like I remembered ! I will definitely be repurchasing again once this runs out I love it !	1
Max factor pan stick is hands down the best foundation I 've ever used . If you want total coverage , this is the one for you .	1
I have very visible acne scars and this the only thing that covers them completely . It is a very heavy make-up , but if applied correctly ( to a clean face , after your primer ) it holds up well . I wish they were still available in the US . Thank goodness for Amazon .	1
I have used this product for 45 years and it is still the best foundation ever made . You can put it on sheer or use it as a thicker dab for concealment of blemishes or age spots . It is the best foundation ever made . Period .	1
I love to use this foundation stick ! It 's easy , portable and perfect for full face if you want a full coverage or it 's great as a concealer . I have yet to find a foundation stick that is this easy to apply and truly has a FULL coverage . I have olive skin and use the true beige shade , however , it really is ok if it is too light as you can go over it with a darker powder and it looks great !	1
Did n't want to spend the money on Bobbi Brown 's so I tried this . The coverage is heavy enough but without being goopey , lighter coverage than Bobbi Brown 's . Super easy to apply , love the portability of this product.Only complaint is that it 's a little drying so put on a good moisturizer before applying .	1
Thank you Amazon for finding an importer for this makeup . When Max Factor stopped selling in the US , I was devastated . I then found it at another place online , but they stopped carrying it too . I hope this vendor will continue the relationship with Amazon.This makeup is creamy , covers well , and comes in a variety of shades to blend with almost any skin tone . And it is a lasting makeup . I get several month 's use from each tube . I also love this makeup , because I no longer have to worry about spills when I travel . It 's not magic , but it will cover those flaws and blemishes , of which I have far too many . It does n't cake or look garish . What else can you say ? It works ! It is expensive , since it has to be imported , but it is worth the cost to me to . I love using it that much .	1
I ordered this for a friend and she is very pleased . She had a hard time locating it elsewhere . She uses it every day and always looks great !	1
I have two other foundations that I mainly use but this comes a close second to them . Great coverage . Stays put . Easy to use . What more could you ask for ? Maybe make it easier to find . I 've been so surprised at how many stores have dropped this product . I really love Max Factor and hope it does n't get discontinued . That would be a real shame for such a good brand . Their mascara , 2000 Calories , is one of the best I 've used too . Went looking for it the other day in the store but no luck . Thank goodness we can still get it here . : )	1
My skin is combination , tending towards oily . This daily moisturizer gives my skin the moisture it needs without causing more pimples and other blemishes . It leaves my skin silky soft and sinks in well after a shower - it does n't sit on top of your skin like many moisturizers . For the roughest of winter months , however , I do need a supplemental moisturizer ( I use German Nivea creme on top of this ) , but I have found this is a pretty reliable , year round moisturizer .	1
This is the stuff . And as pointed out by another reviewer , SPF 25 would definitely be a better precaution than 15 but this moisturiser is so good otherwise I can overlook it for now . The main aspect of it that appeals to me is that the product actually stays on the skin and keeps moisturising all day . On a face as dry as mine is that is a rare accomplishment . Other creams bite the dust in a few hours on me.A reliable product that does what it claims to do at an especially good price .	1
Twice the thickness of the light night cream -- - somehow makes skin feel moisturized for a long time but absorbs enough so it is not so sticky . Excellent . Very neutral scent , with no unscented-chemical smell to annoy or interfere with colognes . As with all Neutrogena products , not a problem for my acne-prone skin .	1
The addition of SPF is always appreciated - in this day and time it 's a necessity . In the case of this product it is SPF 15 - higher would have been better.Nonetheless , this is a nice hypo-allergenic formula that provides hydration for face and neck . It absorbs quickly so one does n't have to wait to apply makeup .	1
I have very sensative skin and have tried pretty much every facial wash ( drug store , spa , department store brands ) . My favorite ( very expensive ) facial wash was discontinued , so I was back on the hunt . I finally decided to try this cleanser and LOVE it . Does not irritate my skin or cause breakouts . Cleans , but does n't strip moisture . Give this one a try !	1
I tried almost every product from neutrogena and this is by far the best . This is the ONLY cleanser I used that does n't dry skin out , it adds moisture and my face feels very clean after using . I been suffering from acne and my dr recently prescribe clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide , I use the medication along with this . best ever !	1
I have very sensitive skin , especially in the winter . I love this facewash ! Very subtle smell , if anything . My face feels clean , but it does not dry out my face . I definitely recommend it .	1
I 'd been using the regular Neutrogena bar soap on my face for years , but I just decided to grab this one day while shopping . I could not be more pleased ! I always thought my skin looked ok , but with this I actually love my skin ! Not to sound vain , but I look in the mirror and just think about how good my skin looks now and I do n't even wear coverup ! IMO I think it makes me look younger too , but that could be wishful thinking ! This does not have the consistency of a cleanser , it does seem more like a lotion , but do n't let that dissaude you , it is really great on the skin !	1
I have dry , sensitive skin . I 've tried a number of cleansers like this one ( Cetaphil , Ponds cold cream , Boots cleansing lotion , etc . ) and this one seems to work the best . It takes make up off well and does n't leave behind a 'filmy ' feeling if you just wipe off . If you do rinse with water , it does n't leave you with a tight , squeeky-clean feeling . It really does leave your skin feeling moisturized and yet cleanses enough to get rid of the dirt and make-up ! I 'm very happy with this cleanser and will purchase again .	1
Love itgreat for teen acne , no harmful additives or strong smell.Convienent with subscribe and save , and the cost is comparable.I would reccomend it and will continue to purchase	1
When choosing skin care products , I usually follow the recommendations fromThe Skin Type Solutionor Paula Begoun'sDo n't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me ( Do n't Go to the Cosmetic Counter Without Me ) . This product is one of Paula 's Picks for an overall excellent product , so I decided to try it when I needed to pick up a new cleanser.I have very sensitive skin , and this did burn slightly the first time I used it , but , since then , it has been fine . It also works great with a Clarisonic brush.Since , as of my writing this review , Amazon is n't including the ingredients list for this product , I wanted to include them here : Water , Glycerin , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Cetyl Ricinoleate , Isohexadecane , TEA-Cocoyl Glutamate , Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate , Stearyl Alcohol , Cetyl Alcohol , PEG-40 Hydrogenated Castor Oil , PEG-20 Methyl Glucose Sesquistearate , Bisabolol , Anthemis Nobilis Flower Extract , Tocopheryl Acetate , Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate , Stearyl Glycyrrhetinate , Tetrasodium EDTA , Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer , Triethanolamine , BHT , Geranium Maculatum Extract , Dipropylene Glycol , Phenoxyethanol , Propylparaben , MethylparabenThis is a great cleanser for the price , but I just wish that it were free of parabens . It 's worth trying , though , if you have sensitive skin .	1
This stuff is very good for sensitive and oily skin . It mositurizes as it cleans and doesnt strip your face or cause a red chemical rash afterwards . My skin was so happy a week after washing with this and moisturizing with the neutrogena oil free moisture .	1
I 've used 3 or 4 bottles of this product and it works for me , as it does n't have a fragrance and does n't dry out my skin .	1
This is the first product I use in my regime ; I follow up with Neutrogena On-The-Spot Acne Treatment Vanishing Cream and then Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisturizer . I did a lot of research on products and I found this to be the best on the market ( that of course is on the cheaper side ) . It is free of many of the chemicals that should NOT be in a cleanser and it is definitely a great buy . I do not buy this on Amazon , I usually just buy it at my local Walmart and buy one at a time , though buying it on here in bulk might not be a bad idea . When I go to the store I 'll pay about $ 5 for just one , so it seems that a pack of 3 on here is overly priced . But anyways , it is a great product that does what is needs to do , clean the dirt off my face ! I have sensitive skin so this is a great cleaner that does n't turn my face red or anything . Also just a tip , I did a lot of research and if you did n't know , you are supposed to splash your face with warm water to open up your pores , dispense the cleanser in your hands and wash for 30-45 seconds , and rinse again with warm water . Be sure when you dry off your face you are NOT wiping your face , you need to pat it gently and let it air-dry for at least 5 minutes before you apply anything else to your face . When using this product once a day , maybe sometimes twice , it lasted me about 4 1/2 months , WOW ! For $ 5 , that sure is worth the money . So overall , a great buy , might suggest you buy them at your local Walmart because it seems to be cheaper than buying in bulk .	1
I like this cleanser cause it does n't dry my skin out and puts moisture into my skin .	1
This does as is advertised . I use to use Avena lotion but that product was discontinued . This seems to work just as well as the Avena product .	1
So many things that are labeled & # 34 ; gentle & # 34 ; irritate my skin but not this - I 've bought this over and over again . Nothing comes close to replacing for me at least .	1
soooo mild and moisturizing especially in a desert climate or in the wintery midwest this is a godsend . no lather but no super tight face either	1
What more could you ask for thick creamy and really clears up my skin . Did n't dry me out and smells neutral .	1
I originally purchased this product when traveling . Later , I purchased an additional package upon returning home . These cleansing wipes remove makeup remarkably well , including eyeliner , mascara and eyeshadow .	1
I use this once a day in the night to help get all my pores clean from the day . This has a nice light scent and makes my face really soft . I recommend this scrub .	1
I first purchased this product because I wanted a cleanser in a squeeze tube so that I could easily use it at the gym . Pumps are hard to `` close '' so that they do n't accidently pump into my gym bag . I also wanted a cream cleanser because after I turned 40 skin dryness in my face became more of an issue even though I make sure to drink plenty of water . I also purchased it for the price . I did n't even notice that the packaging read `` oil free '' . I typically do n't buy oil free cleansers because I want more oil in the cleanser to moisturize my skin.Well , do n't let `` oil free '' fool you . Deep Clean does not dry out my skin . It works as well as cream cleansers that use the word `` moisturizing '' on their package.As of 01/06/2012 Amazon listed this product as costing $ 5.74 for 7 ounces ( $ 0.82 per ounce ) and $ 19.77 for 21 ounces ( $ 0.94 per ounce ) . It does not make sense to me that the cost per ounce for buying in bulk ( the three pack which comes to 21 ounces ) is MORE than the cost per ounce for buying a single unit . Buying in bulk usually means saving money . I will be hitting the `` 1 pack '' button when I order and then once the item is in my cart I will increase the quantity . I will not be hitting the `` 3 pack '' button .	1
I started using this cleanser last year , and I can honestly tell you that my skin has never looked better . When you rub in this cleanser it creates a cool , tingly sensation -- you can literally feel it working into your pores , and the creamy consistency makes it easy to apply just the right amount . It does a wonderful job of helping to prevent acne and blackheads without drying out your skin.My forehead and cheeks are prone to dermatitis and used to get dry and flaky with the cleanser I 'd been using , which was actually also a Neutrogena product : the Deep Clean Facial Cleanser for Normal to Oily Skin . It worked for me for a while , but eventually it started to dry me out ( which caused more breakouts ) . I decided to try to cream cleanser based on its superior reviews , and I 'm glad I did : something about the composition of the cream cleanser must make it milder than the other product , because I have n't had a problem with dryness or secondary breakouts since I made the switch.As with any face wash I 'd suggest using a toner after washing to get rid of any residue , but really , this is one of the best facial cleansers I 've ever used ( I use it in conjunction withNeutrogena Oil-Free Deep Clean Gentle Scrub , 4.2 Ounce , and it 's the best skin-care combo I 've ever tried ) . I hope it works just as well for you as it has for me !	1
I have used many high end scrubs and this is one of the best and least expensive . Each time I use the scrub , my skin feels really clean and fresh . Makeup goes on better too . Will buy again . Do n't need very much so the tube will last quite a while .	1
I bought this cleanser for my husband . He was looking for something simple to help his complexion and he loves this stuff ! I was sharing my own personal cleanser with him at first , but he did n't like that . I decided to try this for myself a couple of times . It does n't foam , but it leaves your skin feeling squeaky clean . I also love the smell . With regular use , I have noticed a change in my husband 's skin for sure . Good stuff ! It looks smoother and brighter .	1
I alternate between this cleanser and their Fresh Foaming Cleanser . This one makes my skin feel a bit more `` squeakier '' which I like when the weather is warmer . This is a great cleanser and should work for anyone except someone with very dry skin . This does not dry out my face and I have combination skin . This is a must have for a gel cleanser .	1
I 'm rather lazy at washing my face , so this product is great at removing makeup at the end of the day when I 'm too tired to wash it . After using it for a while , I think it actually is doing a better job at cleaning my face than soap and water . Super fast , super easy .	1
This is the best facial cleanser I 've ever used . I love how it makes my skin feel really silky after washing with it , and it gets make-up off really well too . I 've tried the generic brand at Target , and it just does n't work the same . Stick with the original !	1
Okay - I agree with others that this face wash can be drying . I would not use it . However , my husband swears by it and I see his results . He has been cursed with horrible problem skin that can have bad cystic acne breakouts even though he is in his fifties . If he goes even a few days without using Deep Clean he will begin breaking out . He is a firefighter and is usually very good about bringing all of his grooming items when he works a 24 or 48-hour shift . Occasionally he forgets an item . If this is the item , you can tell even if he had to use a different product for as little as one day.I have to believe what I see and his testimonial .	1
This product is great for everyday use and wont strip the skin like a lot of other cleaners I have tried before . It cleans the skin well , and even removes foundation . It does n't leave my dry skin feeling sensitive . I also like the glow it leaves . Having been in the fashion and entertainment business , I am very particular on making sure my skin looks its best and this is the best product I 've found . Its my go to staple skin cleansing product . Highly recommended	1
Oily skin is simply irritating . Especially on hot , humid days , my face feels so clogged up and muggy . Although the label may say makeup remover , it works perfectly as a quick facial cleanser , leaving my skin feeling refreshed . These wipes do have trace amounts of salicylic acid - for you out there who might care .	1
this product can be a little strong in smell but its not harsh on my skin . it removes water-proof make up very well .	1
I 've found this cleanser does a great job of removing light to moderate oil/dirt from the skin without overdrying . It is a cream based cleanser with no abrasives in it , so it 's very gentle on the skin as well.I usually rub a little bit on my skin with my hands , then wash it off with water . This is good for when you just need a light cleansing . You can put a little on a wash rag , then rub your skin with the rag if you need a more robust cleaning.Overall a great product .	1
I use this stuff with the Clarisonic Mia , which is perfect - you really have to leave this stuff on your face for at least 1 minute to get the most benefit from it . It leaves a slightly greasy feel to your face after you wash it off . Not in a bad or pore-clogging way , just in a pleasant `` not squeaky clean , not tight '' way . I can even get away with skipping the moisturizer at night in the summer .	1
I love exfoliation , I exfoliate daily in some way shape or form and this is one of the better exfoliants I 've used . It does leave my skin red for a little while after using , but I see the results and love how my skin looks and feels since using it .	1
When they say deep clean they mean it . I have sensitive skin and do n't normally use astringent products like this but right after I had my baby I was only getting the chance to wash my face about twice a week . My normal cleanser ( which I typically used every day ) was n't getting my face clean when used so infrequently so I tried this and it was a great find . I understand why some people felt it was too harsh and I would never use it every day , but if you have oily skin and are only getting the chance to wash every few days this is a great way to go . One problem was that it did dry out my lips if it ran over my mouth when I rinsed my face , so I spread a little petroleum on them first and that did the trick .	1
This is definitely a superior product that has changed my skin cleansing routine for the better . I am a complete fanatic when it comes to my 48-year old skin . I bought these wipes because I needed something to use when I travel overseas , and I do n't like carrying soap . This has turned out to be a breakthrough product for me . First of all , I have very sensitive skin , prone to break outs with any oil based products . I use these wipes now instead of Obagi cleansers , as I think they are just as effective , soft and non-irritating , and my skin is perfect now . I get tons of compliments from women and men alike . It is so much easier and involves less mess than soaps . On occasion , if my skin gets dry , I use Aquanil cleanser and these wipes to take off the cleanser , then moisturize with Aquanil . I use this cleansing regimen and alternate retin A , Obagi C Rx serum with hydroquinone , and Obagi C Rx exfoliant and my skin looks like I 'm 30 years old tops . Also , my son now uses these wipes -- he is a teen and has acne , but these are great and convenient and oil free . He is now more likely to clean his face often with these because of the convenience . I 've tried two other wipes similar to these -- clean and clear , and Aveena .	1
I love love love this cleanser ! ! ! I 'm changing products all the time to see if I find a better fit , but I always come back to this cleanser ! It feels sooo good on my combination acne prone skin . It does n't dry it out , however I can feel it cleanses very well . I like to leave it on as a mask during the time I brush my teeth ( about 5 min or so ) , then when I rinse it off my skin feels amazing , there 's a light tingling feeling and incredible deep clean sensation ! They say it contains beta hydroxy , so I 'm guessing it 's acting a little kind of like very light peeling , refreshing your complexion every time ...	1
I have been using this cleanser for years now . I use it all year round without scrubs or any additional cleansers . On its own , I feel it does a great job of cleansing . Although it may not remove all the oil and grime , it does cleanse well compared to other deep clean cleansers .	1
I have been using this cleanser for years and I love it . It does a good job cleaning your skin , while also leaving it soft.A few months ago I switched over to Biore Combination Skin Balancing Cleanser . In comparing the two products , the Biore does a much better job cleansing your skin . When I am wearing make-up , the Neutrogena Deep Clean always left a little reside behind . The Biore , however , never did.But , after using Biore for 3 months , I decided to go back to Neutrogena for daily use . The Biore was just too drying . I never had a problem with dry skin with Neutrogena . So , back to what I used for years before . I 'll still use the Biore for the few times a week that I wear make-up ... but , for every other day , I am going to use Neutrogena.My husband also uses this and loves it as well .	1
This has a nice gentle scrub . Nice smell , a bit citrusy . The little beads are effective but can probably use daily , I intend to use it a couple of times a week . So far no complaints .	1
Men ... if you have large pores that get clogged up this is for you . I started using this two months ago . It will keep your pores clean and open . After just one month I found that the pores on my nose were staying open and actually seemed to be slowly diminishing in size . I have this as one of my many subscribe and save items ... so I know it will be a good price and I know it will arrive with all my other sub/saves on the 1st of every month .	1
I do n't use this often but when I do it feels great to my skin . It cleans well , removes oil and dirt . I like how does not cause that overdrying feeling once it dries . It also seems to have a cooling aid too so if I happen to clean to harshly I wo n't tell . For those who wear makeup from my understanding it 's a good at removing it before bedtime . This does cost a few bucks more than its competition Noxzema -- I do n't see a big difference besides you paying for the name . Nevertheless pretty good facial cleaner .	1
I use this product everyday . It cleans my face really well . I recommend to all woman and Teens to help keep your face looking great .	1
Have been using this for years . It 's a great cleanser that does n't leave your skin feeling stripped or caked with soap .	1
I have an oily forehead with dry nose and cheeks . I get blackheads and sometimes acne , especially if I do n't follow my skin reggie.I 've been using this with some other Neutrogena products for about 8 months now.The texture is white and creamy . It tingles on the skin if you let it sit for a few minutes . I let it sit on my face while brushing my teeth or during the shower , then rinse with cool water . I use every morning.My skin reggie : Neutrogena Cream Cleanser every morningNeutrogena Clear Pore Cleanser OR Neutrogena Blackhead Cleaners as a wash every morning , as a mask once a week.Formula 10.0.5 mud mask once a week.Apricot Scrub once a week.Change pillowcases every few daysUse a separate towel for face only , change every few daysWash face morning and nightFollow with moisturizer always and sunscreen for the day on top of moisturizerTry not to touch my face , do n't pick blemishes	1
great for removing makeup from the face ! works easily and quickly , deep cleans -- really feels cooling and clean . not irritating my sensitive skin at all . all the makeup really does come off , when I use my toner no more makeup comes off so it really is cleaning my skin very well and it makes my skin feel refreshed afterward . will repurchase .	1
I have dry skin with the occasional zit , and I use retin-A creme at night so I was hesitant to try this at first . But I decided to try it after hearing all the good reviews . This leaves my skin feeling clean but not dry , unlike all the other acne cleansers I tried . Great product ! I bought 3 tubes and have been using it for over a year .	1
smells really good and gets rid of all the make up . kind of burned my eyes a little bit but i usually rinse my face after i use any kind of make up remover so it was no big deal .	1
Because I ca n't afford to use Opium bath gel , this is my second choice . I keep a 32 oz pump bottle in all my bathrooms.It has a nice fresh scent that you wo n't tire of and wo n't fight with your perfume .	1
This one I really like and it probably deserves a 4.5 Stars . Excellent pump and one feels refreshed and invigorated after the daily ablutions . Neutrogena has been around and they always distinguish themselves for carrying some Very Decent products and this is for sure one of them !	1
I loved this gel from the day it debuted many years ago . Thankfully , the scent is the same , rather like Neutrogena soap . The pump is nice on the tub ledge and the gel works great in the shower , too . It rinses clean in any water , hard or soft . I like to follow it up with the Neutrogena sesame oil for the body . Great stuff .	1
I have always loved Rainbath . It smells great and feels so soft on my skin . Neutrogena has a real winner in this product !	1
This smells fresh and clean . Had a problem opening the pump but I held the collar firmly in place while turning the pump and it popped up finally . Disaster averted . The price is half that of the local stores and this size is larger than the usual .	1
I love this mascara ! I have used it for several years and when I try other mascaras , I am never happy with them and I always come back to this one . I do n't like waterproof mascara because it is so hard to get off and I feel like I pull eyelashes out when I try to get it off . This if perfect ; it is truly a thickening mascara and makes your eyelashes look great ! And it does n't have to be black ; even the brown looks great ! I like that it 's also hypoallergenic and that it conditions my lashes with aloe and vitamin B5 . And even with the shipping the cost was less than if I bought it in a store ... and it 's delivered right to my door !	1
I have extremely sensitive eyes . Mascara , eyeliner and even eyeshadow can cause extreme irritation and itching and little white bumps on my waterline . I searched for a mascara I could wear that would n't leave me in pain and wanting to take my eye makeup off immediately . This product was recommended to me and I took a chance . I am very happy with the results . Not only did it not irritate my eyes the mascara itself was great ! Will be purchasing again .	1
My wife likes this mascara as it thickens and lengthens without clumping . She has a favorite mascara and this one is as good as it is . She also likes that it is washable and easily removed.She does n't care for the brush as much as others she has tried but she can live with it . One issue that frustrates her though is that the brush is short and it can not reach the bottom of the tube and she feels that you can not use all of the mascara that is available.She rates this at 5 stars and would buy it again . I have posted a photo for your information .	1
Just like it . It dries out a little faster than others , but that 's ok . I use a cleaned used mascara wand to separate lashes if necessary , when it gets a little older and dries up . It 's easy to remove without heavy creams or a lot of scrubbing , and that 's what I REALLY like .	1
I love this mascara for several reasons . First , it does n't irritate my sensitive eyes . I use mascara to emphasize my eyes -- I do n't want red , irritated eyes ! It also goes on clump free and makes my lashes look thick and natural . Finally , it does n't flake off , leaving me with raccoon eyes after a few hours . It 's getting harder to find ... I hope it does n't become discontinued !	1
This stuff rivals Maybelline Great Lash as a contender for the best cheap mascara brand on the market . Almay 's One Coat Nourishing Mascara goes on smoothly and clump-free . It 's easily biddable , and while it 's not quite as lengthening as I would like , it 's a perfect mascara for work . I 've never had any issues with flaking . I recommend it and will repurchase it myself .	1
I always use this . It 's fast and gets even waterproof mascara off quickly & completely . I use one side of the pad for one eye , turn it over and do the other eye . I do add a couple of drops of water on the pad and it works just fine , staying moist enough to do both eyes .	1
I live in NYC and Duane Reade and CVS do not sell these anymore . I have friends who tried these and say that they are too greasy . But , I like the extra oil to run into my eye area . I 've been using these for years , and am so happy I found them here at Amazon !	1
I have tried a lot of eye makeup removers including some really expensive ones . Almay pads are by far the best . They are a bit oily but they are supposed to be in order to protect the skin around your eye . ( Do n't get the oil free they do n't work ) There are 80 pads in the container but I use one pad 3 or for times so they last forever .	1
I have used both the moisturizing and the oil-free version of this makeup remover . Now , I will only rebuy the moisturizing one . The oil-free one was terrible.I can deal with having a bit of oil around my eyes after removing makeup , especially if it is moisturizing the area like it says it does . I end up going to sleep anyway after removing makeup , so it is n't a big deal . The formula is extremely gentle and it does its job without irritating the eyes . And if you do n't want the oil around your eyes after removing the makeup , just take a towel and wipe it off . It is not a big deal.The oil-free one , on the other hand , irritated my eyes to no end ! I could n't even finish the container . My eyes became really red and bloodshot and I just could n't keep using them . I am going to throw these out and re-buy the moisturizing ones .	1
good price good product good presentation i recommend the product you can buy it several times excellent bran and you can be confident	1
I love this Fragrance . First time I used it I was n't sure but it has really grown on me and my wife loves it too : )	1
This has been my significant other 's favorite cologne for years and years . We purchased this directly through Amazon ( NOT a reseller ) and received the legit product . Contrary to other reviews , he has not noticed any change in the product 's scent or strength . The price ca n't be beat and after checking various online options ( like Sephora ) , I was not able to find the legitimate product for a lower price .	1
cool water was/is my number one pick for everyday wear.. but Hugo out did cool water wit this one.. smells sweet but not girly , perfect balance of sweet and fruity .	1
Nice smell same I brought from Europe but not long lasting . I do n't know but not long lasting at all . I love perfumes long lasting . Daytime use with casual wear only.-HP	1
No wonder this is Hugo Boss 's # 1 seller.. so many notes in the fragrance makes it very unique . Quite a bit of citrus with a side of woods . Would definitely recommend to others .	1
Every man must have this cologne ! it smell , so clean , fresh , I 'm in love with this cologne , buy it ! you wo n't regret !	1
Got this for my hubby for our anniversary and he was so delighted . I received it in time and packaged very well , and the price was excellent ! Thank you !	1
I bought this because it was on the top ten colognes for men on some site i went too on google . Anyways , it smells really great and lasts all day . I work in a corporate office and its 8 hour days and this scent lasts well pass the time i get home . Warning : you dont need a lot of sprays for this , a few well placed squirts around the neck and the wrists and your good to go . I recommend this , it came well before the estimated delivery time , nothing was tampered with and it smells really great . Get this fragrance and smell like a BOSS !	1
you cant go wrong with Hugo by Hugo Boss ... still the same..kind of a gold standard fragrance for men..Mild yet smells wonderful ... Can wear it everyday ... great price at Amazon for a 5 ounce bottle ...	1
This is my FAVORITE hand soap . It 's creamy and moisturizing and has a wonderful cherry/almond scent ... and I ca n't find it in the store ANY place.I found it HERE ! ! ! Happy happy -- joy joy joy ! !	1
First of all , I love amazon because they carry avariety of products . This handsoap is very mild andpleasantly scented . The bottle is very pretty foryour bathroom or kitchen . I would recommend this product .	1
This handwash is fantastic . Every time I go to the States , I restock on more because of course , it 's unavailable in Australia . It feels like you are really cleaning your hands as opposed to using fragrant soaps that do n't really remove that grimy feel or dirt . It foams well and when you towell your hands , they do n't feel tight or dry so I get the feeling like it 's not drying out my skin . Also , to top it off , the scent is devine . It 's not overpowering but subtle , and yet you can still smell it faintly for a while later.I hate using bar soaps for my hands and I love this wash . I wished it came in bulk to use as an all over body wash . I highly recommend this soap especially if you get dry hands . I find myself washing them a little more frequently throughout the day just to get that gorgeous smell back in my nose . It 's a great cleanser and it looks after your skin .	1
Sometimes you find a product that becomes a staple . Agree , this is just a super hand wash with a great scent and excellent texture . It is never harsh on your delicate skin . Many times a repeat buyer for years . Highly recommended .	1
I like the almond scent . I do n't know what else you can say , it is a good product . I buy this regularly .	1
Early in my married days we were living , well let 's call it , a low-income life . With a baby on the way I picked up another ( lower-cost ) brand . The sticks were harder and the cotton was n't nearly as puffy and soft.All I can say is that on this item you CAN tell the difference ! So in my house we always carry the Q-tips brand of cotton swabs and I must admit we also use a decent ( and soft ) toilet paper as well.Some things just are n't worth skimping on no matter how tight your budget .	1
I 've been using Q-tips for years , the condensed cotton makes it much more easy to clean without coming apart - which I hate about other brands . I do n't think I would use any other brand .	1
We have tried the store bands and the & # 34 ; off & # 34 ; brands and find this product , while not perfect is the best of all of them . For us the swabs stayed intact and firm and did not unravel as was noted with other reviewers . In fact that was what the store brands did . The only reason that we did nto give a five star rating is that soem of the swabs were packed so tightly on the ends they did not absorb much .	1
I 'm sure I 'm not the only one but I use these to clean my ears with , even though the labeling tells you not to . Just be careful !	1
These work great and are not the kind that are flimsy.. Good quality and durable.. I use daily and they are soft and the cotton is tight rolled and dont come unraveled in your ear like some cheaper versions !	1
There 's a reason why these guys have been around for years . Their quality and price have made them the best value there is for cotton swabs . They do the job , however interesting that that may be , and come back for more . They 're indispensable if you have a baby or young children , but they grow with you into adulthood as well . There 's some things you should n't buy the generic and this is one of them . They 've been around for years and for good reason - they 're great !	1
Sometimes , it 's not whether this brand is so great but how every other brand kinda disappoints . Q-Tips are the number 1 brand for Q-tips : ) ! I have used every other brand , found in countless hotel rooms and even resorts . I love the softness and fullness of the cotton swabs , and this was a pretty good value on Amazon . It is wonderful not to have to go to Target or somewhere else with Amazon offering these types of products online . Thank you !	1
Have bought these q-tips for years . I have noticed they are n't as fluffy as they used to be . The quality of a lot of products have suffered over the years , just a sign of the times I suppose . We do use these a lot though . Besides ears they get used for make up and even little craft projects . Not really much you can say about q-tips .	1
It 's kind of silly that I 'm reviewing Q-tips online , but this is the only kind that I will buy anymore . I tried generics , but found that the cotton tips are more compact and not as effective . These are 100x better : )	1
premium quality cotton swabs . dispenser not particularly handy.the cotton ends hold up . substitutes are cheaper in price and quality .	1
I have tried other brands in the past but nothing is better than Q-tip . Softer yet stronger , there is nothing better . A product with a thousand uses . This 500 count can be found elsewhere cheaper .	1
The best tips , the softest by far and worth the money . I use these for everything from art projects to removing eye makeup gently .	1
These are very nice , a little too skinny on the top ( I would prefer more cotton ) , but otherwise these are nice . They never band when I use them . I am sure if pressed significantly , they will bend , depends on the purpose of usage .	1
There is not much to say about cotton swaps - they work . You can do lots of things with them ! The price for these is good .	1
Fits my needs , does its job , always use Q-Tips and always will as long as the quality continues . Good buy	1
like others have said , the quality of the cardboard piece in the middle has cheapened ... it 's a bit more flexible and less durable . That said , they are still 10 times better than any generic brand q-tip , so there is no way I 'll be switching for now .	1
You know how they say the only thing you should stick in your ear is your elbow ? Well , I have never followed that advice . : - ) I use Q-tips to get water out of my ears when I get out of the shower . Other cotton swabs do n't have the cotton as tightly wound and cheaper discount brands have left little strands of the stuff behind - whether in my ears or when using for a craft project or other purpose.Also very handy for cleaning the grooves in your outer ear , Q-tips brand are the most comfortable . I have used other brands , but they feel like you 're dragging a tree branch around your outer-ear , not smooth cotton.Good for cleaning your dog 's or cat 's ears as well ( just do n't put them in too far ! ) - and just a good product for about a million uses . I 've even used them to get shoe polish into hard-to-reach groves in dress shoes - and Q-tips brand does n't leave fiber strands behind like the others do !	1
My wife and I have used the Q-tips swabs for many years . There has never been any problem with the way that they work . They do not come apart or unravel under normal usage and this includes using this item as a small paint brush or a cleaning tool for small objects . The Q-tips swab has always worked just fine as they should .	1
I love the color this leaves my hair and it does not seem to be as damaging as other brands I have used in the past . I will say I have had the best luck with Feria Color products in general , so I may be a little bias , however I have never been disappointed with any of the colors I have tried .	1
I gave this product four out of five stars because I have n't tried it yet . It looks good in the picture though .	1
I love the product & it makes my hair really soft , smooth & healthy , but with this particular color it 's actually the 1st time I have ever colored my hair in over 35 years that it colored it the same color my hair already was ! . There was literally NO difference ! None ! But the grey was gone . Rather amusing & a learning experience	1
Love the color , love the application and LOVE the conditioner.Future suggestions : Sell the conditioner alone too so it can be purchased independently of the color kit . I would use this conditioner at least 2 x a week if available outside of the boxed kit .	1
For starters , my hair LOOOOOVES color . Soaks it right up and does great with almost all cheapo home kits.I got to the color on the box from very dark brown in about 3 colorings that were spaced out , hence the 4 stars . I have a lot of red in my hair and it really kept the brassiness to the minimum while I worked on getting to a lighter shade . there is a lot of really nice dimension to the color as well , making it look naturally blonde.I also ignored the timing instructions . I always apply my color the same way ( roots to ends ) and leave it on for 45 minutes no matter what . I also cover my hair with a plastic cover to keep heat in and help the color set.I finally got bored of the upkeep this color required as far as roots go and went back to my natural , but it was a fun ( and cheap ) way to go medium blonde for a while .	1
but it is getting difficult to obtain . my subscribe and save for this item has now been cancelled . I get so many compliments on this color .	1
FERIA DOES NOT COVER GREYS VER ELL , WHICH IS WHAT I WANTED . IT MAKES THE HAIR VERY SHINY . NICE LIGHT COLOR WITHOUT TOO MUCH RED TONES .	1
I got tired of my blonde and red highlights- mostly because they took so much time to maintain . I was going to grow them out but then I started having those growing-out-highlights roots that look kinda crappy , especially now that I can see a few sparkles ( what I call my gray hairs ) showing up in there.I used the online tool at the Feria website to choose which colors would work best with my coloring , ordered the product from Amazon and dyed away . This color is a shade darker than my normal hair.I was n't expecting much- but this stuff is amazing ! Despite being a slightly darker shade , it still has tons of shine and made my hair look like it has *natural* highlights , as opposed to the chunky salon highlights ( I love those , too , and was worried this color would look really flat and boring but I wanted to choose a color I thought was closest to my natural shade- and will be even closer as the color fades a little ) . So , no you will not get salon-style highlight results but on my hair , this product dyed all my hair evenly and it still looks fairly lively.I have relatively fine and thin hair but it is down past my shoulders . I used one box , left it on my hair for the recommended 25 minutes before washing it out . When I first mixed it , the color looked like a creamy white but slowly darkened as it was exposed to air . I used some cotton balls with water and soap to get dye off that I had gotten on my forearm , in the sink and on my forehead/ears/neck- no stains to speak of . I do recommend using gloves other than those in the kit or under the supplied ones- they break too easily and you could end up with Hey ! -I-just-did-a-home-dye-job hands.Most importantly , to me , this product resulted in very even and professional looking all-over color . I ca n't even tell where my highlights used to begin now . I highly recommend but please follow directions . There is also a pretty pungent ammonia smell , so you 'll want to make sure you have adequate ventilation . When applying , go slow and make sure the product is *really* worked into your hair . I started at the top and worked my way down . Used the entire bottle but I think it still would have been enough if I had longer hair . You might want two boxes if you have LONG , THICK hair ( like I only dream of ! ) .5 stars for excellent results and beating my expectations !	1
I really like this color ! On my dark brown hair turns out exactly like in picture on the box . I have very little gray hairs and the color seems to be lighter on them ... so I would not recommend for someone with lots of gray . I use it every 6-8 weeks .	1
I discovered this color on what was my never ending search for the perfect bright copper red hair color . I found it once at Target , then when I went back to get more , they were sold out . I went to every drugstore in the area for months and no one ever has it in stock . Finally I did an internet search and have been ordering it on automatic delivery ever since . The color is not for the faint of heart-it definitely gets noticed . I love it . I am stopped regularly by men-and women and complimented . There is no comparable product out there . I even went to a beauty outlet and worked with a sales person but the color came out more pink than copper . This is so much easier .	1
I like the ombre look . So i decided to try this after all of the tutorials Ive watched.Long story short , I think this look is okay ... ..Its definitely looks better with your hair curled , like a light wavy ... .But thats just my opinion ... .Its a very nice product , everything you need is right there in the box.You can achieve any look with this.i will say my first time , my hair did turn brassy copper color.But i bought a second box by accident and re did my color , and its a nice honey blonde ... ..	1
This is my absolute all time favorite Red . I have been using it for almost 2yrs . It 's not a pink red it 's a very bright orange red . Once the initial brightness wears off ( if you do n't like attention do n't use this color ! ) it turns into a completely beautiful copper color . I 've tried other reds and I always come back to this one . I hope Feria never stops making this color because I would be heartbroken .	1
Deep Copper Shimmer : I 've been too afraid to use an at-home dye , so I 've been forking over hundreds of dollars for salon color . I finally decided to try L'Oreal 74 Deep Copper Shimmer instead . It was the first time I have ever dyed my hair by myself , and it was easy ! There is more than enough product for a test strand and then someone with long ( though not thick ) hair . My hair looks just as good as it does when I have it done in the salon and feels incredibly soft . The color is exactly what it shows on the box , even at my dark brown roots ! I highly recommend this . L'Oreal -- please do n't ever discontinue Copper Shimmer ! The color is outstanding ! Champagne Cocktail : NOTE : This review is for L'Oreal Feria 91 : Champagne Cocktail . I am going to cover in this review what I desperately needed to find before I tried this product and couldn't.Hair type : Colored blonde with reddish-blonde roots from a salon ; previously highlighted blonde from being dyed red . Hair is thick and goes past shoulders to the end of the shoulder blades.When I dyed it with Feria : 5 weeks after last salon visit , on unwashed hair ; 1 box of dye was all I needed.Review : I love being a blonde but was considering going brunette to save on money and salon costs , which in the area I live are upwards of $ 100 at almost any salon ( unless you want your hair cut by someone fresh out of beauty school -- which , no offense , is too nervewracking for me personally ) . Then it occurred to me -- perhaps I could try highlighting or coloring myself from home . I used to color my hair red ( the L'Oreal Copper Shimmer ) and I got so good at doing it that I did a better job than my stylist . If you 're unsure about doing it yourself , check out Youtube for Kandee Johnson 's how-to-dye-hair video . This is the video that taught me how to dye my own hair in a professional manner.After comparing brands , I went back to L'Oreal , as I already trusted the line and it had the best reviews . I chose Champagne Cocktail based on the L'Oreal `` Find my color '' walkthrough ; I chose a cool blonde since I have pink tones to my skin and my hair ( being dyed red for so long ) has a tendency to lift red . I did a strand test , even though the instructions do not say to do so . I wanted to be sure that my hair would not lift extremely red ( no orange for me , though I did like being a ginger in the past . ) I left the color on my roots for 25 minutes and then covered the rest of my hair for 10 minutes . My roots are still slightly darker and redder than my lengths ( roots are strawberry blonde , and lengths are very pale blonde ) , so I would probably leave it on longer the next time I refresh my color ; I think I will strand test my roots for 25-45 minutes and see how that works out.I am pleasantly surprised at how this dye came out ; my hair is very soft after saturating with the conditioner , and I will probably use it again . However , tomorrow I think I will try the L'Oreal Brass Banisher to see if that can cut some of the strawberry blonde out of my roots . Hope this helped someone ! EDITThe Brass Banisher cut the red out of my hair ! I do n't have to go to a salon to get my roots to match , and I do n't have to bleach them . For full review , go to the Banisher product page .	1
I will definitely buy this product again . It shipped moderately fast , just in time to keep me from going crazy about my hair color , haha . I have naturally auburn hair , so it made my hair nice and orange . : ) I love it and I would definitely recommend it to people with any hair type , it makes it nice and shimmery just like the name . Hah .	1
First , you absolutely must know your range of tones for your skin . Do not colour your hair prior to that discovery or you will end up with the wrong colour.Next , if you are attempting to go from blond to black , you MUST use a filler . With that said , hair colouring does require prior knowledge . Also , often times , it takes multiple applications for colour to grab well . That means you may need to colour repeatedly to get the deepest and darkest colour result . As well , a MULTI-FACETED colour product means that it will NOT deposit colour evenly . That is the entire point of the MULTI-FACETED colour product , it grabs here & there . **To prevent colour from fast-fade do this ; After you colour , gently rinse hair , add a conditioner treatment , and DO NOT WASH with shampoo for 2-3 days . This helps to set the color better and prevent quick fading issues.Also if you use a lot of styling products , do not attempt to colour over hair that is coated with styling product , it will not work-out properly.Lastly , do not experiment without prior knowledge of hair colour . Seek a professional for a first time colouring , and then , you can attempt to maintain that same colour , after the fact , on your own . And stay within your range of tones such as cool versus warm.Example : If you have fair skin ( veins appear bluish under skin ) and blue eyes then you have cool tones . If you have hazel eyes and pale-peached , golden toned skin ( veins appear greenish under skin ) you are a warm tone . Hope this helps people in regards to making mistakes with hair colour .	1
I rarely see copper colors in the drugstores so I was happy to find this on Amazon . I 've been coloring my hair red for years but I have found that the coppery reds are much more flattering . And as I tend to leave the mixture on longer than required as i usually get distracted , this does not leave reddish- purply tones . When I colored my hair today I left in on for an hour and it looks rich and gorgeous . Feria colors do n't seem to fade as fast either . Great product .	1
The color comes out true to the picture , which almost never happens with other hair colors . Also , you do n't get that chemically smell afterwards like you do with so many other hair products . It leaves your hair in great condition..	1
I 've been using this for almost 2 years . It is so expensive to go to a salon so I do my own color with Feria ! This color looks like a subtle red-brown until you step in the sun or under a light . Then the color looks really bright red . It 's very pretty and easy to apply .	1
I LOVED this shade on me ... wish I did n't have to shell out $ 11+ for it ... if it ever drops to a $ 7 membership auto ship , count me in !	1
All other red hair dyes look fake and harsh- this is the only red hair dye that I have used which looks natural and truly beautiful . It is getting harder to find too . I have used this color on someone who looks lovely in carrot red hair and no other color will do.Fades out to a lovely strawberry blonde as well , which is a big plus .	1
love it , love it . I buy all the time . great with dark hair . give pretty highlights.i will keep buying it .	1
Such a lovely color , and there was n't a hint of red which is exactly what I wanted . The color is a silky looking chocolate color and looks amazing .	1
I tried to take dyed hair from a natural color to white/platinum blonde with Slpat bleach . Then I wanted to add their purple for a streak in the front.. My goodness what a horrible experience . Their stuff hurt and one application left my hair so fried I thought it 'd fall out ! ! Their purple was not purple and bled even after careful dying . The bleach just ruined my hair , it was this horrible mush . I hated it but bleached the purple out , oh my poor hair.Now I have bleached before with the blue tub of bleach by l'oreal . That stuff was awesome , still dried out my hair but not as bad as Splat ! Anyway this Platinum was a little weird as it expanded and erupted out of the bottle but I just needed my roots done . I was terrified because I 'd been using Everto every super duper conditioner I could find but my hair was a mess . Wow it actually made my hair feel stronger ! I do n't understand how but it repaired my hair ! My roots are not platinum but after one shot of this stuff they are a very light golden blonde . NOTHING will in one shot take a medium brown hair to pure white in one application with frying your hair to mush ! If I had used this instead of splat , maybe would have taken two or three applications but my hair would not have been this damaged and I 'd still have reached platinum.If you want white or platinum , either do it professionally for fast results that might not fry.. or get enough of this stuff for 2 -3 applications ( i.e . 4 bottles if you need 2 just to get all of your hair ) and avoid frying your hair ! Believe me I wo n't make that mistake again .	1
This did lift my medium brown hair to a yellow blonde . Which I toned down with a purple toner and now it is a lovely blonde.I left it in for 40 minutes after applying it to my hair . It took me about 20-25 minutes to complete the application so some areas of my hair had 60 minutes of contact with the product . That hair came out completely blonde . Next time I will leave it on a little longer.Left my hair in great condition in comparison to other brands I have tried .	1
This is the hair color that I like to get , but I do not think it is quite the brown that I want for my hair .	1
This shimmering color is just beautiful . I have had problems finding it in stores . I was happy to find it on hereD	1
I 've been using this color off and on for a few years . I find the feria line is n't nearly as drying to my hair as others . My hair feels in great shape when I 'm done . I have a hard time keeping color on my hair ( with any box or salon color ) - my hair wants to turn blonde ... even though my hair is brown and the roots come in brown . I use this every 6-8 weeks , but my hair is usually pretty blonde when I do . The color comes out great - no orange tints at all ... which is a problem I usually have with other boxes . I will continue to use and stop switching around !	1
I 'm a fan of this shade from Feria - beige browns are hard to find . My hair tends to go red whenever I color it & the beige really tones down the red without going flat or ashy . Also , Feria seems to give you a bit more dye for your money so I only use 1 box instead of the usual 2 for my shoulder length hair . I 'll keep using this product as long as they keep making it .	1
I love this color when ever i decide to do black . This color is more of a blue black than a bright shiny black . The mixture turns a dark blue color when applied and developed . Although for Feria 's version of blue black the color is still very shiny looking . You will not get a dull black using this brand and color . If your looking for more of a natural black or a jet black then you would definitely want to stay away from this color . Instead try using the color Black Leather for a more natural looking black . I love blue black hair for my `` Scene '' styled hair the two looks go perfect together when doing `` scene '' styled hair in a black color . There will always be some fading when using a hair color but with Feria i find that it fades only a little and its no big deal to do a touch up every once in awhile . In all my years of using this brand i have always been satisfied with its results . This color works best on Medium brown to dark brown hair to start for a more deep and darker black with a hint of blue for an undertone . Usually when starting with to much of a darkest brown to black color the blue will not always be noticeable using `` any '' brand which i have had that experience before too . In my opinion the color is very pretty and the brand never fails . When using dyes remember to always wash and rinse hair in lukewarm water to cold water to help keep colors from fading/bleeding . Especially when rinsing the dye itself out during application time . They tell you to rise the color out until water runs clear ( DO NOT DO THAT ) this step i do not do . I rinse about 10 % of the color mixture out then use the conditioner and rinse some more . Your having to rinse your hair twice which helps fades color faster in its beginning process which can make hair seem faded faster and will fade easier . So do n't rinse most of the color out during its initial application which is the most important in my opinion and it works for me . That way you still have a tiny bit of color left in your hair enough to extend the color and penetrate to keep your hair rich in color until you wash your hair for the first time . After dying i do n't wash until a week to a week and a half later .	1
I 've been dying my hair for 10 years , and this is my absolute favorite blonde hair color ! Feria seems to last longer than most home coloring brands that I 've used . It smells nice , and it lasts longer than your average box color.New improved Feria boasts of `` 3X Shimmering Highlights '' ... and they 're not lying ! In the light , you can really see it shimmer . I can also pick out some highlights & lowlights if I look closely . I love it ! This color itself ( Dark Golden Blonde ) is my favorite . I tell my sister it looks like `` gold in a bottle '' , which is totally true ! As a bonus , I love the conditioner that comes with it ! If you want non-brassy color with rich golden/reddish tones , use this ! You wo n't regret it !	1
Back in the day , I would have seen a girl with her hair like this and thought she needed to do her roots . However , I had gotten sick of my plain dark brown hair and wanted something new . I saw this at Target and went for it . I have actually tried before with highlighting kits to do this but thanks to the Feria brush it is now much easier to get this look . My hair at this time is shoulder length and I took the brush and bleach and at chin level created a new look . It is really cute ! I curled the ends and ca n't wait to premier it . If it gets accolades , I will update this review ! ! ! LOVE IT ... In case my low votes are due to my lack of editing ... SORRY , My hair did look fantastic and A LOT of guys liked it ! I have used this again and again .	1
worked really well	1
Great color , for reds , stays a long time after repeated washings , and of course , speedy delivery & # 8230 ; will order this color again & # 8230 ; thanks , KL	1
This is my favorite color red to use , it gives a gorgeous red-orange on brown hair and I 've used it over top of blonde and pink hair as well with wonderful results . Always leaves my hair feeling great and the smell brings back memories . I really love this brand .	1
This color is so bold and edgy , it is fantastically vampy . The color has blue undertones , which I learned after dying it over a few errant bleached blonde strands . This color does fade very quickly , and it should be noted that there is nothing natural looking about this color . L'Oreal Paris Feria has several natural looking shades of black -- but this is NOT one of them . This color is simply too shiny and far too stark to be considered `` au natural '' . Fortunately for me I was craving something more dramatic and quasi scene-looking . I 'd recommend this for anyone desiring an edgy look . For those just wanting to touch up on dark strands -- seek another product .	1
A perfext color match .	1
so I love the convenience of finding them on Amazon at a good price . I had been using Golden Blonde for years - but it started turning my hair a brassy color . I used this and it removed the red cast to my hair and left it shiny . It is lighter than Golden Blonde , but a good summer color . I will buy again .	1
I bought this color to change my look , just a little bit . I did n't want to be to drastic . I like the color because it also covers my gray hairs and it makes them look as though I have highlighted my hair with wine tones .	1
Let me start by saying , I am a first time hair colorer . Within the last 2 years I have been through some extremely stressful life-changing events that have caused my hair to begin to gray despite my age . I never thought I 'd be gray before I turned 30 ! Needless to say , I tried to pluck them until I realized I could n't keep up . Then I tried to accept them . Then I thought , why the heck am I putting up with this ? ! I 'll have the opportunity to `` gray gracefully '' when I 'm 60 ! So I picked this up at a local store after a recommendation from friends , and proceeded to agonize over a color choice . My hair is naturally a medium to dark brown and I wanted a color that was similar to my own , perhaps slightly lighter , just to cover my gray and add a little dimension . I chose this color ( medium brown ) because it seemed the closest to my natural color . Nowhere on the box did it say this color was auburn or red or anything of the sort ! So imagine my surprise as my hair starts to dry and my roots are RED ! The rest of my hair was lightened slightly and did come out a lovely medium brown with hints of red , but my roots are lighter than the rest of my hair which makes the red more noticeable . It 's definitely not a horrible thing . I like it and aside from the initial surprise when I saw the red , I am pleased with how it came out . I just thought it was necessary to let other ladies know that this most definitely IS red , despite what the box says.That said , being my first time coloring my hair ( and doing it completely by myself , no less ) I was a little anxious but the process was incredibly simple . I picked up a few tips from videos on YouTube and covered the floor in newspaper , put oil on my skin just beyond my hairline to avoid staining my skin , and wore a towel on my shoulders . The process was as simple as mixing the solution and applying it evenly throughout my hair . If you have dark hair already , it would be hard to mess this up . I 've heard it can be tough to color blonde hair on your own , so I 'd advise not choosing this color as a blonde unless you 're prepared for a lot of red . If it turned my dark brown into red , I can only imagine what it will do to a blonde ! Regarding the gray , I was aware beforehand that it can be challenging to cover gray . This color did hide the vast majority of my gray though I can pick out a few areas where the hairs are quite a bit lighter than the rest . I realized right away that these were my gray hairs that did pick up the color but did not come out as dark as the rest of my hair . It 's all good to me , though , because the gray is gone ! It actually looks like very subtle natural highlights and I like the effect . Just be forewarned that this product is not going to completely blend away your gray and give all your hair a uniform shade . I would probably advise against using this particular color if you 're heavily grayed . I am only about 5 % gray but it was enough to bother me and I am much happier with my hair now ! Overall , I was very pleased with the product 's simplicity and the final result , but please choose another color if you 're not looking for red in your brown . : )	1
This is the best boxed blonde I have ever used.I 've been bleaching my hair in various ways for ten years now . I 've tried every boxed brand under the sun , I 've gotten highlights , I 've gone to the salon , and I 've even had my friend bleach it ( she went to Aveda ) . This has been the best product thus far.My hair is long and naturally a dark dirty blonde color , though it has years of different bleaches in it . This is the only boxed hair color I 've used that has actually given me close-to-white results . It will always be a little bit yellowy ( just a bit more golden than what 's pictured on the box ) but I 'm sure you could really knock out any brass with a good purple-blue toner . I have not had any issues with brassiness using this brand , though . And that 's amazing , considering I used to have rust-colored stains in my hair ALL THE TIME when using other brands and no amount of toner would help . I also only need one box to touch up my roots , which I do every 4 months or so , since my hair is pretty damaged from previous experiences.And the best part is , this stuff does n't reek or burn or itch like an ammonia-based color does . Normally , I have to leave the bathroom several times during a coloring session and seek fresh air outside , but that 's not the case with this ! I also only leave it in for about 20 minutes for fear of causing breakage but I still get a great color out of it.The conditioner that comes with it is also good , but as previously mentioned , my hair is damaged ( and dry ) , so I tend to use the entire tube of conditioner after coloring . This ensures that my hair actually feels healthier immediately after coloring and I see less breakage.All in all , I would highly recommend this to anyone considering going blonde . Take it from me , a ten-year expert on do-it-yourself dying . ( But I 'll warn you . If you have really dark or reddish hair , I 'd recommend going to a professional . It will probably turn out orange if you try doing it yourself . )	1
I found my hair color on the mons site and it is such a relief not having to worry about buying it every month it will just arrive . I love this color have been using it !	1
I 'd been messing around with lighter shades of red for about a year before I came across this color . I loved being a strawberry blonde , but the deeper , darker reds always intrigued me . So , I picked this up at Target . I wan na say it was the same price as on here.. At first , I thought it was too outrageous . I do n't want to attract attention everywhere I go . But then I started getting compliments . I mean , everywhere I went . I had people tell me it was the prettiest hair color they 'd ever seen . And I have to say I agree with them ! The only downside is that it did n't seem to last as long as I 'd hoped . I use a color depositing shampoo so I expected my results to last a tad bit longer . Either way , I 'm happy dying my hair every day if that 's what it takes to keep my hair this beautiful !	1
I have been using this color regularly for 4 years . I love it.It 's a very bright carrot-y color at first , but as it fades it becomes a very natural red . I have seen many surprised reactions when I tell people that I am not a natural red head.This is the ONLY brand that I will buy an orange-y red from . It 's the only brand with the vibrancy I want.TIPS : -when dying your hair red spray windex on anything you accidentally get hair dye on ( it 'll come off near immediately ) -DO NOT wash your hair for 3-4 days after dying your hair red ( it helps lock the color in ) -DO NOT use shampoos with sulfate in them ( they cause the color to fade extremely quickly ) -depending on how much it fades and how long it 's been you may have to completely redye your hair instead of touching up on it because of the color difference between when you first dye it and when it fadesGood luck !	1
I have no real idea what all the one star reviews saying & # 34 ; black & # 34 ; are for other than they did it wrong because there is a special process to make red from a box come out right , and if you do n't follow it no matter the brand you get a darker or horrid red shade.First I did n't use it on dark hair , that is the key . If you hair is dark strip it down and use a soft red or very soft honey blonde to as a base . Then the next day apply the red dye , and only leave it on 1/2 to 3/4 the time it actually requires . Rinse it twice , and then use color treated conditioner on it , not just the one in the box . It is a long story but in short the chemicals in pre-boxed dye for red do n't always mix well with previously treated hair or dark hair pigments.Product ReviewThe item was pricey compared to other brands , but I have n't found another brand that gives me the deep rich red shade I wanted . It was n't as light a red as the box , no , but it did turn out well . I also use test strips when I try a new product to avoid disaster in case the product does n't work right.It does come out blood red and stain everything so put some lotion around the edges of our face , on your shoulders and neck , and your hands so it will wash out easier . Put down towels you do n't love because it is going to make on heck of a mess and is nearly impossible to get off anything with using harsh stripping chemicals , learned that the hard way.Positives-Easy to Use-Firm Red Color ( at least that was what I got on my hair ) Negatives-Fades fast-Comes out black if you do it wrong , and it is easy to do red hair dye from a box wrong-Price TagAll in all , I would buy it again , however I lean more toward the next shade of red down .	1
I read up on this before buying it from my local CVS . I had been wanting to go ombre for a while and this is one of the only kits could find . I did n't want it THAT bad that I was willing to shell out a ton of money to pay for it to get done in a salon , and I 'm pretty good with my own hair so I thought I 'd give it a try.I have medium/dark brown , which I 've never bleached , highlighted or dyed ( beyond demi-permanents that only slightly alter my color ) . I got it trimmed recently , so it was pretty healthy looking with only a few split ends right before I used this kit . I have very thick hair , and the bottom layers are especially dark . I do like the color of my hair , so I figured with the color being stripped down and lightened ... how bad could it actually be ? I was concerned and super nervous about this , especially because of all the negative reviews , and because I 've never seen what my hair looks like bleached before ... but I do really like the way it turned out . The last time I colored my hair ( temporarily ) was about 2 months ago with a demi-permanent dye that is about a shade darker and much more red than my natural color . I thought that they dye had entirely washed from my hair by now , but I could see some strawberry pigment after I used this kit.This kit itself is pretty user-friendly . I was actually very surprised with how well the brush worked with achieving the gradient look rather than the & # 34 ; oh man , girlfriend has some SUPER bad roots , she should get that fixed & # 34 ; look . Obviously you need to be careful about how and where you apply it to make sure the application remains consistent on both sides , and do some lighter brushing closer to the top to make sure you get that fade . I also made sure the ends of my hair were super saturated . I would recommend starting with the darkest part of your hair ( so that develops for the longest time ) and ending with the lightest parts ( so that develops for the least amount of time ) . You also have to be careful about over-brushing with the brush in the kit , and apply the bleach quickly . If the bleach starts to dry , you 're going to have to yank through the strands , and yes , the bleach COULD damage your hair . That 's the nature of the chemical . Stick to very small sections of hair ( 3-inch sections max ) so you can work quickly to get the bleach in before it starts to dry , leaving you with more tangles and breakage the more you try to pull the brush through it . I stuck to the 45 mins MAX total time ( per the included instructions ) , and my hair does not look unhealthy , fried , dry , etc. , but like I said before , it was pretty healthy to begin with . I showered immediately after and let my conditioner sit in for a solid amount of time.I like the way my hair looks , but I can see how this would be an issue with anyone who has any kind of dye in their hair , especially if it 's semi-permanent and they had it done in the last 6-9 months . If I were to guess , most people who gave negative reviews or this product either 1. did n't apply it correctly . 2. did n't let it process for the correct amount of time , 3. did n't like the color of their hair once bleach was applied , 4. had colored their hair recently enough that it would affect it , or 5. had unhealthy/dried out hair that just did n't take to the bleach very well . I was just lucky enough to have the stars align with my current hair conditions , and the kit worked well with what I have.I gave it four stars for a few minor reasons : because the gloves that came in the box were super flimsy , and because the bleach just did n't work as well with my my darkest hair.Overall , I think this is a great kit as long as you are careful , do n't have a lot of previous dye jobs , remember to deep-condition your hair afterward , and are willing to tone your ends if you are unhappy with resulting color the bleach leaves behind . Just be smart , follow the instructions , and be kind to your locks . Good luck !	1
This hair color gives me the best shine my hair has ever had ! It covers up my grays pretty well , and with the use of Pureology shampoo it seems like my color sticks around for awhile . It gives my hair a dark brown with a slight auburn color .	1
The color payoff was pretty good on my previously dyed hair ( Asian virgin black to dark auburn , then faded to a brownish color ) . It is definitely not a natural color obviously , my results came out similar to the picture , but a bit darker . Overall I 'm pleased , but would probably go for a less orange color next time .	1
This is my favorite brand of at-home hair color . I have tried almost every kind out there , and this is the only one that provides a shade true to what is shown on the box . The color comes out vibrant , and your hair is actually soft and shiny after coloring . I definitely recommend this product ( and any of the other shades in the L'Oreal Feria line ) .	1
The label on the box said `` Deep Bronzed Brown . '' I love anything bronze ; it looks great against my yellow toned fair skin ( although , there is some red creeping in there ) .I 've been coloring my own hair for a number of years . When I used to lighten it , I went to a pro . But now that I am merely adding or slightly adjusting my own shade , there are too many products available that do as well , if not better than salon results I 've had.Even so , I used to sometimes pick a shade that looked great on the box , but then turned too dark for my tastes . My hair is naturally darkish medium brown . I 'd tried some brownish red shades recently - and finally decided that those were not for me.I did n't , however , want a flat , mousy brown color . I wanted it to look natural , with some highlights . When I saw the L'Oreal Feria # 45 French Roast / Deep Bronzed Brown and fell in love with the color - I still wondered -- will it even look close to that on me ? I stood in the aisle for quite some time , weighing the odds . Staring at those little color boxes . Then I decided to take the plunge ! When it was time to rinse the color out , I was nervous about what it would look like . Would it be flat and dark ? So I decided that since the light in my bathroom always makes my hair look darker than it is - I would quickly turbin wrap my head and NOT look at it until I could see it in the window where more natural light pours in . I did sneak a peak , just at the top of my head ... . and I liked what I saw ! I ran with a hand mirror to the kitchen , the only place in this depressing little apt . ( that I will soon be leaving , thank God ) to get a good look . I almost could not believe my eyes . It looked JUST LIKE the box , highlights and all ! I could not be happier with my results from this product . So much so , that I will point L'Oreal to this review . They deserve to know how I happy I am . And so do you , which is why I am writing this.I can not attest to whether it will look the same on you - but I should tell you about my hair . It is extremely fine , but there is a lot of it . In fact , hairdressers used to be shocked at how thinned out it looked wet . I have very little gray , so much so that I can go for months without coloring if I want . But I like to refresh the color every month , in any case . And I do not wash my hair every day . More like 3-4 or even ( gasp ! ) an entire week , in winter.My skin tone is fair-medium with yellow undertones that often appear reddish . My eyes are an amber brown.So -- I can honestly say that this is one of the best hair color products I have ever used . And I have practically used them all ! I would say , if you like this color . Go ahead and try it . You probably will not be disappointed -- in fact , more like delighted !	1
I have used this dye for 8 months now . I basically do my roots about every month or so . I first used this with low expectations . I have naturally auburn hair so it is very difficult to lighten , more so then even black due to the placement of the red pigment directly in the middle of the hair shaft . You literally have to nearly destroy the hair to get a light result . despite this fact I am addicted to wearing bold colors in my hair like hot pink , blue and green . For those colors to look anywhere near the way I like I need a white result . This dye gave me a white result after 2 applications spaced 5 weeks apart . I first colored my hair pink . It was lovely . I get bored though and wanted to try blue . I thought I would end up with purple because I normally still have a slight tinge of the color as it fades to the blonde . I did my roots as normal but noticed on the parts that went beyond my roots that it removed the pink completely and took only a few minutes . I did the whole head again with about 15 minutes left in the max time it is supposed to stay on your hair and I had white hair after with no hints of pink . This had never happened with bleach before . This stuff is magic , I hope they never discontinue it . There is a bit of dryness , I will not lie . It is really nothing compared to the usual bleach one would normally have to use to lighten to this level .	1
This is the color for you ! Ruby Rush is really , really red ... perhaps even a little more so than the box shows . It 's a blast of color for the redhead for the holidays , but not sure I 'd want it 365 days/year . Still - it is FUN ! But remember : it 's permanent , so you 'll have to wait a bit if you want to change it !	1
lightenes my choc brown hair like 4 - 5 shades to a light brown with shimmering golden hi lites does n't look red . I love this stuff . do n't want blonde but lighter brown as im over 40 and dark hair makes me look older . kinda got the color that Jacqueline Smith has ( ths spokeslady for kmart clothes , former charlies angels # her hair is lighter brown wth blonde hi lites . # not dark like when she was a charlies angell . I love this . ppl complimented on it . its my fav , normal color now . I do n't go to the salon anymore and ppl think I do. ! I have used other hair colors from a box that turned my hair red/ orange or auburn . this feria colors my dark hair to a light brown with hi lites , as I want . some people think I go to a salon and get it professionally done . I have gotten compliment . thanks this is the only stuff I use now . ( PS- I put saran wrap over my head to help with processing my dark brown hair and leave it on for 50 minutes , - about the same if I m doing roots , then do the ends for 5 mintues . then rinse ) the saran wrap helps with getting a lighter color ... I really like this they oughta make a version for great 100 percent grey coverage like excellence products from loreal . im 50 but luckily my family greys later in life . mom did n't get greys til age 60 . but got ta switch over to excellence when I start getting greys .	1
I love this color 56 Auburn Brown , get complements on it all the time . It does tend to fade faster than the John Frieda foam in medium red brown but at this price ( 7ish ) it 's a bargain .	1
I have stick straight , black Asian hair and was skeptical whether or not this would work or be too harsh , but it worked and looks great ! PROS- I left it in my hair for 25 min and rinsed it out . It is VERY subtle , I recommend leaving it in more for a bolder look.- Hair does not appear damaged , but then again I did not leave it in very long- Other people have complimented me on the new highlights and said it looks good- The end color is really beautiful and goldenCONS- You have to put A LOT of it in your hair ( especially if you have long hair ) . My problem is that I thought I had enough in , but I didn't.- It 's a little challenging to apply evenly and get the back hairs in . In my case , only the front portions changed colorI would recommend this and buy it again !	1
I love the L'oreal Feria color line and this is proof why I do . Every color I have used by them has been wonderful ! I had Honey Brown hair and wanted a change . I did n't want a black with a blue base tone or a violet base tone , I just wanted black . My hair now is very black , shiny , healthy looking , and vibrant . It is kind of messy with the application ( but what hair color process is n't ? ) I knew what to expect though since I use Feria quite often but someone who is trying it out for the first time might be surprised . My only advice is , use a towel . Fabulous product and the results are what I wanted .	1
I love this . I used to over in over color my hair blonde from Loreal and thena toner . omy it costs alot . I tried ash blonde and got purple tones.. so one day I waslike ok try this.. I am amzed . My hair is a light diamond blonde it is gorgous.I use the loreal shimmer blonde shampoo and cond . with this and wow so pretty.The color lasts me three weeks and feels and looks great . I also use a silk drops to makeit soft . It is nice . thanks..	1
I do n't like spending a lot of money and I do n't like going to get my hair done . Over the years I try to save money by buying the cheaper boxes but my hair never turns out the way I want it to . When I use Feria it comes out exactly how I want it each time . I also love that it 's pretty much the only box that gives out true highlights . It 's amazing . Other plus about Feria is that it comes with a lot of actual product . Meaning if you have long hair you only need to buy one box ! In the end it 's just better to spend a couple more dollars to make yourself look great . I 've never had a problem with any Feria hair colors . I love it !	1
It is a nice color but I am on the fence with it . I think I 'm going to try golden sunset next , I feel this is a bit too red for me personally.It really is a pretty color though .	1
I have been coloring my hair for years , and this is one of the best colors I have ever tried , I have medium Brown hair and I had previously done highlights , this is my second time to use this Color and every time it comes out great , it does have a red shimmer to it , PERFECT for spring time . It makes my highlights pop even more . My hair is soft and shiny and there is no harsh chemical smell to it . I would definitely recommend it for others .	1
I would use only this , but need to darken only from time to time . The highlighting effect in Feria accumulates negatively for me in gray areas and I need to darken and go back to this for new highlights .	1
Ok , first off , I dont work for Lorea'l and i have tried it all . LOL.. My hair has gotten very dark brown with age . So i have been highlighting since i can not even remember when . This is the first time i have ever tried a drugstore product . I was in a jam and had to cancel my professional salon appointment , however i had somewhere to be and needed my roots done ! ! ! So i took a chance . This product was easy to mix , shake it for about 3 minutes to ensure the powder disolves fully . i started at the crown of my head , which seems to always be the darkest and longest to process . Take small sections and apply with your finger spreading it onto roots and regrowth . Trust me ladies , i have been sitting in that chair long enough to know how to do this . If your hair is dark like mine , leave it on for 45 minutes . or even an hour . Do not listen to the box . This is the best color i have had that i didnt pay 150.00 for in a salon . I would go every 4 weeks faithfully because i hate roots ! i will be saving a lot of money , i am so glad this happened . The color is not like the box , it is more natural looking blonde more yellow but not fake yellow . You want the yellow and NOT ORANGE ... My friend used this , and her hair turned Orange , very brassy , so we bought another Loreal product the platinum excellence product 01 an ash base , as ASH takes out orange , and waited a few days and did this over the Feria , and it took the brass right out . So if anyone ends up brassy try that it really worked . Not everyone 's hair takes the same to dyes . and to be blonde its a hard thing to accomplish , so if you get brass , try this . I dont do well with silver shampoo 's . i find it turns grayish . just leave the product on longer . its not bleach so it wont damage like bleach . happy coloring . I am so happy to be saving money ! ! ! !	1
My girlfriend loves all colors for her hair and she likes to mix them sometime she was very happy with the result	1
So the color came out similar to what I expected BUT it made my ends SO much darker AND now I have to dye again already because the gold base has been turned orange by the sun so buyer beware	1
As someone who has been dying their hair red for close to ten years , I know a good red dye when I find it . I tend to use this dye in the winter , when a darker red is more appropriate . The color is beyond phenomenal - it 's bright , deep , luscious , vibrant , so many positive clich & eacute ; hair dye adjectives . It 's absolutely gorgeous in natural light . I prefer for my hair color to look as natural as possible , and this is on the very line between natural and unnatural . But considering that most natural-looking do n't capture the vibrancy of true red hair , this definitely does the trick.I do n't go to any extreme lengths to maintain my color , so with normal washing , the brightness lasts for at least a week . I assume washing in cold water will make the color last longer . Even after it fades , the color is still on the natural side of red . The hair dye itself is perfectly easy to use . The dye and conditioner smell really good , and the weekly conditioning treatment works wonders for dry hair.To put it simply : I strongly recommend this color . The color is true to the box .	1
I just colored my hair with this product this morning . It came out better than I expected . I thought that it would come out looking dull since it is such a dark color , but it is shiny and looks great . I am hoping it does n't fade quickly . Only four stars since I am not sure how long it will last as of yet .	1
I love this color and have been using it for a couple of years . The conditioner which comes with it is excellent as lightening your hair this much , will dry it out badly without conditioning .	1
I tried this product because I wanted to try a new look for summer.This product pretty much worked like it said it would -I 'd say that this lightened my hair about 2 shades ( it says up to 3 on the box ) , although it ended up with a pinkish tone to it . No problem , though -as long as it 's not rusty I 'm OK with that.I have medium-dark hair though ( I 'm half Japanese , half white ) . My hair is more on the Asian side , very straight and thick.This is a `` cool tone '' color that says it will minimize orange/reddish tones , and it looks good . It 's not exactly what it looks like on the cover picture ( and unfortunately I did n't end up with that Gorgeous Creature 's face , either ) .I have grays here and there , and it did n't really cover them at all . Not that I expected a lightening product to , but I thought I 'd just note that here . I 'm not really sure if this is a color dye , a bleach , or both ... I did n't expect it to cover completely but since my hair is lighter , they 're less noticeable.The directions state that the user should apply it on the main part of the hair and the ends first , wait 20 min . and then apply it to the roots and wait 10 min . This was a little confusing to me , as there is no way that the user can completely avoid the roots when applying . I did my best though and it worked out for me . The conditioning stuff that is put on at the end needs to be applied every week afterwards and they say not to shampoo the next day after using it to retain the color.It was really easy to use and fast.Too bad I have to color my hair every 3 weeks b/c it grows fast ... this stuff retails for $ 10 in most stores but it 's still cheaper than a couple of trips to the salon .	1
I color every four weeks to keep it looking fresh and I love this color . Use the conditioner , apply color to CLEAN hair , and IMO you ca n't beat the value . I am a prime customer and have auto shipment on the product .	1
I ca n't find this dye anywhere , firstly . Secondly . IF you 're like me and you have dark , dark , brown hair , maybe you should look elsewhere . I actually came to this shade because I wanted a reddish tent to my hair.Anyway , this stuff actually shimmers , though my hair is no where near copper it is shimmering . I actually had shiny stuff all over my pillow for a week , so , just a heads up . I love the results I got . I closer to a copper chestnut than a sultry copper , but , like I said , copper was never my intention .	1
I have used this product for many years , get many compliment on my hair color.I highly recommend this product	1
This is my go to brand when I change the color of my locks . Shimmering color that lasts a couple months if taken care of properly ! ( Although all color must fade eventually . ) To lighten hair dramatically you must use a bleaching agent ; a little helpful hint . Have fun and take care because you can lose your locks of love if you 're not careful .	1
First time I have used this make and product . I was getting so tired of the brassy look with the other brand . I loved the color . It is a lighter brown but very natural looking . Does n't drip like the others when applying and did n't have that awful , eye burning smell like my old brand . Will continue to use .	1
Before I used this my hair was previously dyed an orange-red , with a bright fire-engine , semi-permanent , red.The semi-perm red had faded , leaving me with streaks of the original red mixed in . So already , I KNEW that this probably would not get rid of that red shade entirely.I 'd been curious about this bleach for awhile , since I usually have light blonde hair , so I snagged a box of this.First off , the formula , when mixed , is MUCH thicker than any dyes I 've used before , so I did find minor difficulty making sure it was covering all my hair and even getting it out of the bottle . Some of my true color ( dark blonde ) was growing in , so I made sure to leave that for last.As the bleach developed , the red became an amazing light baby pink color , My roots turned a gorgeous white and the orange-red is a slightly lighter peachy-pink.It 's really pretty if you 're into unusual hair colors ( Which I am ) .Another thing I noticed is how SPARKLY my hair was after dying . I imagine if my hair had been blonde to begin with , this would be lovely.The conditioner is a nice touch , it 's a purple toner which really pumps up the white-factor and I also used it to successfully & # 34 ; tone down & # 34 ; some of the parts of my hair that were too pink.So all in all , very pleased with this . If I had used it before dying my hair red , I 'm positive that it would 've gotten to a nice platinum .	1
Very convenient to shop for colors andline and not have to suffer through price gouging at the beauty stores . Fresh quality too .	1
The reason why it scared me is because this is my first time dying my hair and once my hair dried , it did n't look at all like the color . My hair looked like my natural color only with pink blotches here and there . I went to bed and the next day my hair color looked a little better and my hope was restored . I took a shower and noticed the water going down the drain was pink and I assumed the color was still washing out . When my hair dried this time , the color changed again ! Now I 'm watching my hair color as the days pass and it seems as if the color is still adjusting to the color on the box . So if you experience the same thing I am , do n't panic . The color comes in eventually .	1
I have used conditioning sprays by dove , loreal ( costs $ 9 a bottle ! ) and frizz ease . This stuff is by far the best and only $ 3 a bottle at the store . I have n't gotten my hair cut since FEB and it is now NOV and I dont ' have any split ends . I use it on my son too because he gets `` crib head '' or whatever it is called where their hair is all nappy in the back from how they lay on it , even though he is 2 . This is the best priced and best working spray . I use sulfate free shampoo , skip the conditioner and just use this . I have naturally curly hair if that makes a difference , it is a tiny bit coarse , it is n't thick or thin . This stuff does n't weigh my hair down either or make it oily , I still only wash my hair every other day .	1
Such a great product for a great price . I use these on my hair and also my 2 little girls hair after a bath . It smells great and really takes out tangles leaving hair silky . When it gets about half empty I just fill up with water and it still works really well b/c it 's so concentrated .	1
I 've used this for years , and it 's a must-have for helping to keep my heap of curls controlled and conditioned . I use a little every night after I shower and occasionally in the morning , and it really helps to keep my curly hair from tangling and the ends from splitting/frizzing . It also has a pleasant , light scent , and it 's a good deal price-wise compared to other leave-in conditioners ( many of which I 've tried and not been nearly as impressed with ) .The only drawback is that I have very thick hair and thus go through a bottle of this in a month -- I wish it went a little further . Still , for the price it 's hard to beat .	1
I use this to help with the tangles ... .it smells like the beach ! Coconuts ! I thought the price was for 1 but was very happy to get 3 bottles of this ! ! SO a great value ! You spray in and leave it ... my hair is soft and shiny ... it does not weigh it down at all . I put one bottle in my beach bag !	1
I love ALLLLLLL of Aussie 's hair products . but this has to be my favorite by far . it leaves your hair smelling amazing and helps keep it manageable .	1
Smells good holds well is easier to apply and I can take it with me and spray it when I need it . I 'm sticking with this one it makes hair soft shiny smooth silky and it smells amazing . Really good for long curly hair . : D Im buying more tomorrow .	1
I have not been able to find this conditioner anywhere until I spotted it on Amazon . Because it 's a spray mist , it 's much easier to control where and how much I want to apply , which I like because my hair is fine and most bottled conditioners weigh it down , even after ample rinsing . This spray also enhances the highlights in my hair - I do n't know why since it 's not meant to do that , but I do n't mind . The scent is wonderful and light . I purchased a 3/pk for about $ 11 with free Prime shipping so for now , I 'm a happy camper ! Thanks again Amazon ... ..	1
Great product , love it , please do n't discontinue it or try to improve . does the job for me now , very convenient to use and pack for travel	1
This is my favorite leave in conditioner because the smell is great , and I use it when I braid my hair to capture fly aways . Its really fun .	1
I have very dry , thick , coarse , curly hair . Was skeptical about this product because of the cheap price , but I had used Aussie products years ago , and thought I 'd try it . LOVED IT ! Pros : Nice Scent . Light , and freshLeaves my hair shiny and softDe-tanglesInexpensivePrevents the `` frizzies '' Not heavy , greasy , or waxyRefreshes my curlsAs a side note , I use this product first , after towel drying . I then also use a conditioning balm , and sometimes a bit of gel . I find that I can `` refresh '' my curls the second day after shampooing with this product and it looks great . No bed head !	1
Since using this , I need nothing else for natural curls . I use a small plastic bottle ( the .97 bottles that walmart sells in the 'travel size ' bins work for me . ) to mix 1/3 water to 2/3 conditioner . This gives a good mix for morning for waking up dead head curls . The bottle I use gives more spray per squirt so I 'm able to really wet my hair , as needed , and do n't get hand cramps from using the conditioner 's pump spray.I use the condition 'straight ' for rainy or damp days to battle frizz . Even if I get caught in the rain , the conditioner will help hair dry without frizzing . The conditioner 's bottle pump is a little stiff and if you 've got a lot of hair , you may want to get another plastic bottle to use it straight , to avoid hand cramps . I do n't ; but , for arthritis sufferers , it may be necessary.I also use it 'straight ' as hair spray for 'setting ' a style . It does n't make hair stiff , but does hold the curls and hair will feel soft to the touch.Also , getting this via Subscribe and Save saves money as well as assuring I wo n't run out .	1
This is a very nice leave-in that wo n't weight your hair down or leave it greasy -- that said , I think for people with dry hair ( myself included ) , I do n't feel it 's enough to totally moisturize our hair like it needs to be . But this is a very good , every day leave-in that smells soooo good ! I use it on my ends when I 'm putting up my hair at night , and it works great !	1
smell good and light weighted leave in conditioner .	1
A really good , inexpensive spray on , leave in conditioner . Comb , spray and you 're on your way . Has a very mild coconut sent that reminds me of the water/ocean..	1
I love the smell of this leave-in conditioner and it does a really nice job of keeping my hair untangled ! I would recommend this ! It is also a really good buy and a good price for three of them ! I was able to buy one at Walmart first and once I saw I liked the product , I was so excited to see this deal online !	1
No grease or oil . Just a nice leave in conditioner that deals with dry looking frizzy hair . Worked with my hair type - good stuff !	1
I have used this Aussie product for years . I have dry hair that tends to get frizzy , especially in the humid weather of the South . This product keeps your hair soft and smooth . I love the smell of all the Aussie products and buying this through Amazon 's subscribe and save program , you get this at a great savings . I would recommend this product to anyone ! !	1
I bought a bottle of this a few years ago and it had tea tree in it and it was absolutely amazing stuff and really great for my itchy scalp . My hair never looked better . Now , they 've replaced the tea tree with aloe and it now has a better pina colada type smell . Delicious , summery smell , by the way . Without the tea tree , the product is not as good as it used to be , but I will continue using it because the ingredient list is top notch and the smell is so yummy . There 's really no need to spend more money buying salon products when you can get stuff that 's just as good or better for a fraction of the cost . One bottle of this is $ 2.50 at my local Wal-mart . You ca n't beat that !	1
Aussie products are amazing anc affordable ! I love the hair insurance . I have fine long hair and with this I can easily work through the knots after a wash. And it smells delicious !	1
I 'm becoming obsessed with hair products so now I always like to have something in my hair even when I 'm not styling it . I love this product because it 's a spray , and it 's quick to use . It does n't leave my hands sticky , and I can put it in my hair as soon as I get out of the shower . I use it before I use other hair products too . Plus , it smells really good ! I mostly love it because it 's a spray and not a cream . It 's cheap , and I will definitely be buying this again when I run out .	1
I use this after my morning shower , and it makes my hair easy to brush out . It 's sort of a no-tangle-guarantee for me . Perhaps people with different hair types may find other things work better for them , but I have thick , straight , and long blonde hair , and it 's the best I 've come across .	1
This leave in conditioner is great . It smells good and can be used to control frizzy hair during the day if the humidity gets to it ( even though the directions say to apply to wet hair only ) .	1
Ca n't believe it took me so long to find this stuff . I have fought bed head all of my life and foorced a comp through the tangles and could n't really get it to comb properly but this stuff changes that . Spray some on my hair and the comb glides through and it stays where it is combed ( some spots may need a little second spray ) and my hair appears much healthier . I am really sold on this product and highly recommend it .	1
I have thick hair and it works great . Makes hair soft and shiny . If you use too much it will make your hair look flat .	1
This product smells great . It has a coconut/beachy/light smell that fades so it is not overpowering at all . I wash my hair with shampoo and conditioner , then spray it on my dry hair and comb thru . It leaves my hair super soft and smooth . I even used it a day after washing my hair when I woke in the morning to smooth out bed head . It does not leave your hair greasy or weighed down at all . Not sure how that is possible but I love it . I have atomic pink hair and it does not fade my color .	1
I love this leave-in conditioner and it 's so hard to find ! Glad to get it in an & # 34 ; add-on & # 34 ; deal . I 'm a lap swimmer and have colored and highlighted hair but do n't like wearing swim caps . Instead , I wet my hair and spritz this into it , so my hair is saturated and the chlorinated water rolls off . At least , I 'm hoping that 's what happens ! My hair stylist suggested I do this and my color seems to last as long as it should .	1
This is a good leave-in conditioner . The scent is great . I just wish it was a tad bit thicker because it 's very watery and runny and I prefer leave-ins that have a silkier , thicker feel . But I would definitely buy again .	1
I love this stuff , I invested stock in this I put it in my hair and little girls hair when it dry before I Put in a ponytail and it makes the hair feel soft and moisturized .	1
I live in dry desert climate and use this everyday on clean soaking wet hair . I scrunch out excess water and scrunch in Aussie volumizing mousse . This combo is better than any high end products I 've tried and I try everything .	1
great price , great value , the price on Amazon is for 3 bottles , so it 's a bargain . The Aussie product has no alcohol and it leaves my hair nice and soft . great to used on dry hair in between shampoo days .	1
I have used this hair conditioner off and on for about four years now and I like it best . It works to help untangle my ruthless wavy/curly/spirally mess of hair after I shower , and leaves a pleasant smell : )	1
I ADORE this leave-in conditioner ! It smells nice , it works great , and it does n't leave a nasty feeling residue in my hair ! I have very curly hair , and live in a humid climate . This stuff was GREAT for humid days . I use it EVERY day after showering , before I put in any other products , and it helps keep my hair from damage due to styling products . If I use just the conditioner , it leaves my hair soft and less frizzy . It 's WONDERFUL stuff , and Amazon has a GREAT price !	1
Love this inexpensive humectant conditioner . I have thick , fine , long straight hair and I only use it on the ends when I need it . Works as advertised - just go easy on the amount !	1
Suave Conditioner works like it should - conditions hair and rinses out cleanly with no residue . It 's also priced reasonably , so it 's a winner in our household .	1
I was in search of a moisturizing conditioner because my hair is super dry ( and color treated ) , so I bought this conditioner thinking that if I did not like it , I would have lost only a little under $ 2 . However , I was pleasantly surprised at the results ! Plus it smells amazing , too ! ( I also bought the Humectant Shampoo and really like that , too . Smells wonderful and lathers up into a very nice moisturizing ; whipped consistency . ) The conditioner leaves my hair very silky , shiny , and ... a little secret ... I also squirt the size of a dime into my hand and run it all through my hair after shampooing and conditioning for a nice leave-in conditioner . Yes ... my hair is that dry ! And by the way , it does not make my hair feel greasy or weighed down at all . I spray a little bit of my usual styling spray in my hair and blow it dry . My hair turns out silky , shiny , and just overall LOVELY ! ! I am so surprised . This stuff is really amazing , and for the price ... you just ca n't go wrong . Obviously its not for everyone , but you wo n't know unless you give it a try ! I will definitely buy this again , and will tell everyone about how great it is !	1
This is a great moisturizing conditioner.. If you are looking for a conditioner that will leave your hair soft and full of moisture you should definately give this product a try . The price you can not beat !	1
When I was young my mother never used a conditioner on my hair . My hair would get so tangled in knots that I 'd literally have to have it cut off . It was only when I discovered conditioners that I could finally grow my hair long . The conditioner is necessary for me to keep my hair tangle free.The problem I have with many conditioners is that the chemicals in them are n't great for my skin . My skin tingles or even gets sensitive after I use the conditioner . This is especially noticeable after I sleep for a night , since my hair gets on my pillow , the conditioner rubs off onto the pillow and then my face lays in that.I 'm really pleased with the Suave Humectant Conditioner . It is one of the least reactant conditioners I have tried . I can use it daily without any problems . It does a great job with my hair , too . It definitely makes it easier to brush through . What 's interesting is that it 's labeled as a `` for dry or damaged hair '' conditioner . I would normally consider my hair to be on the oily side , but the conditioner does quite well for me . It does n't make my hair oily.Well recommended .	1
* I liked the conditioner , but still think the shampoo is drying or not so moisturizing . * A great find for the price .	1
I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners , thinking they were much better for my hair than the `` grocery store '' brands . Then when traveling and not being able to find my conditioner in an `` under 4 oz . '' size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some . I bought this one because I like the name brand that it is comparable to , but also because it was cheap and I would n't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip . ( I gave the remaining conditioner to the person at the hotel front desk ) .I was so surprised to find that this conditioner left my fine , flyaway hair just as soft and manageable as the more expensive brand . My hair is a tangled mess after I wash it and I have to use a conditioner . It also keeps away dryness . I could n't tell the difference between this conditioner and my much more expensive salon brand ! Still , I thought maybe it was just the difference in water or the weather at the place I was staying on the trip . I bought the shampoo again at home when I ran out of my salon brand and found that it performed just as well with the local water , weather , etc . That was 4 years ago and I have been using Suave shampoos and conditioners ever since . I have n't found a single one that I do n't like and I 've saved a bundle on shampoos and conditioners . Two thumbs up for this product !	1
Suave Daily Clarifying shampoo is great for removing build up . I use it weekly because my dandruff shampoo builds up after a while ; my friend uses it daily because the many styling products she uses leave her hair looking dull.The bottle says for `` normal to oily '' hair , but my hair is dry and I 've never had an issue with it drying out my scalp.This has to be the best bargain shampoo in the world . If I did n't suffer from dandruff I would use it only a daily basis .	1
We only use this for occasional hair washing but use it daily as a replacement for soap in the shower . No more soap scum and it works great to clean the body ! We always have many bottles in the house and refill a larger pump bottle from another shampoo is it 's easy to use . Just one or two squirts on a washcloth is enough for a shower .	1
Delightful shampoo works well AND looks good while it waits to be used . I also transfer it into clear , vinyl liquid soap pumps to stand on my vanities -- matching colors to decor . As a hand cleaner , there is none better .	1
This is a great item for a gal with oily hair . I try other things , but always go back to this shampoo . Totally affordable , cleans nicely , but does n't strip my hair . I love it .	1
i always like suave shampoos , they all do the job well and get my dirty ol locks nice and clean .	1
Suave Naturals Shampoo , Daily Clarifying - 22.5oz . . .. I have used this many times before and I have always loved the fragrant scent	1
I like using this shampoo after I 've been in a pool with clorine or when I 've used hairspray or other gel products on my hair . This really seems to do the job of cleaning my hair and leaving it soft and manageable.I used to spend a fortune on salon brand shampoos and conditioners , thinking they were much better for my hair than the `` grocery store '' brands . Then when traveling and not being able to find my shampoo in an `` under 4 oz . '' size that I could carry on the plane I decided to wait until I reached my destination to buy some . I bought this one because I was traveling in a smoggy area and could almost feel the smog in my hair , but also because it was cheap and I would n't feel bad about leaving a good portion of it behind at the end of the trip . ( I gave the remaining shampoo to the person at the hotel front desk ) .I was so surprised to find that this shampoo left my fine , flyaway hair just as clean and soft as as the more expensive brands .

Two thumbs up for this product !	1
I am an African-American woman with 4a hair . I gave this shampoo a perfect score because it thoroughly cleaned my hair and scalp with drying it out or stripping it . My hair has low porosity so it can easily collect build up . It is important for the health of my hair to keep it as clean as possible . I use it about once a month . I also love the price . I bought it at Walgreens for only 75 cents . I was surprised that such a cheap product could work so well . I recommend this product to anyone with any hair type . I 'm sure this product will work just as well with naturally straight hair . I am definitely going to use more products from this brand in the future .	1
I have used a loads of brands like Redken , Biolage , John Frieda , Garnier etc . This shampoo has been the best I have used so far . It really cleans the scalp and hair without any residue . Pair it with any good conditioner and results are fabulous . This is cheapest and yet the best shampoo I have ever used ! Highly recommend .	1
Wow . I thought prell rocked it . I now have a new favorite . Why ? It cleans thoroughly , leaves skin clear , removes the ick from hair and has a neutral fragrance that works with any suave conditioner . Also doubles as a body wash . The price in stores is about two dollars . I hope they never stop making this . Too many shampoos are filled with oil and silicone . This relieves my hair of the heaviness some products create . It 's a steal .	1
This is a great product at a great price . Hopefully it will be back in stock soon . We use it in place of soap to wash in the shower . Leaves no soap scum and works just great . It 's also wonderful as a shampoo from time to time to clarify hair ( it 's original use ) .	1
My doctor recommended I try this shampoo ... I would say it 's my favorite now , it does n't cost much , it does a good job , it does n't strip my hair ( I have & # 34 ; Einstein & # 34 ; hair when I let it get longer than a few inches ) or dry my scalp . Smells nice , but not & # 34 ; pretty & # 34 ; .	1
Well actually I do n't use it . I buy if for my kids and my husband . And none of their hair looks greasy so I guess it cleans ... . It smells good too !	1
Granted , it is the industrial ingredient standard , but What Suave has done for the knockoff is what Armani has done for the couture industry . Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo ( comes in clear-Blue or clear-White ) washes away the daily grime of product use and can also be used to treat swimmer 's hair in a pinch . For just under $ 2.00 it is a real gem , and if I was n't such a die-hard Aubrey Organics fan , I 'd use it every shampoo ... Like I said , it 's a real keeper ( and great for all hair types ) ! A+/A-	1
We use this exclusively for removing grease and oil from clothing before washing because it works great . We pretreat the stains and let the item sit and then throw it in a cold wash and this removes almost everything . I can wash light blue work jeans covered in black grease stains and make them look practically new . Fantastic !	1
Suave Naturals Shampoo , Daily Clarifying 12ozClears all of the chlorine & gook from products out of your hair.. love it	1
Suave shampoo is one of those products that I 've used for most of my life . I 've tried more expensive shampoo over the years but keep coming back to Suave simply because it works very well and it costs very little . Usually I 'm a huge proponent of the 'you get what you pay for ' way of thinking . However , there are exceptions that prove the rule , and this is one of them ! That said , I have short , uncomplicated hair that 's only dislike is conditioner ( it makes parts of my hair stand on end for no apparent reason ) . I do n't do much styling aside from a littleFiber Molding Cremeto spike the front a little bit , so my shampoo needs are probably not as complicated as someone with long , curly hair . For a guy ( or woman with short hair ) this stuff is perfect and does exactly what I need it to : clean my hair . It 's worth trying even if you think you might not end up loving it , simply because it 's inexpensive , so if it does n't work out , you 've lost nothing.For the price , I ca n't find a shampoo that is as good . This is straight up the least expensive but highest quality shampoo out there . Recommended to anyone without complicated hair , for use with kids , or as an alternative to more expensive shampoo that does exactly the same thing.NOTE : I 'd recommend getting this from Amazon directly to take advantage of their free shipping options .	1
I was searching and searching for a shampoo that would n't make my hair flat , dull , and greasy etc . I was also looking for a shampoo that wouldnt give me breathing attacks because i have very severe asthma and sinus problems . I found this shampoo and , it works great ! .Unlike Wen , Tresseme , Garnier , and Matrix , which made my hair flat , dull , and greasy while also giving me suffocating breathing attacks , Suave Naturals Daily Clarifying made my hair thick , smooth , and shinier than I expected . I have been using this product for 3 months and , it works every time . I have gotten countless compliments on how sleek and healthy my hair looks , and even my best friend ( who uses Wen ) was astonished when I told her `` I use Suave , nothing more '' And , on top of it all , my breathing is now better in the shower ( I literally used to suffocate and wheeze , espically when I used Wen and Garnier ) I would recommend this for everyone . It is certainly worth the price , compared to a $ 60.00 9 ounce bottle of Wen . The good thing about this is that it actually works ! ! : D	1
My daughters use this and the conditioner to match . They are 5 & 6 years old . They love the strawberry smell ! I love that it gets their hair squeaky clean ! The bathroom always smells great when they are done too~like fresh mountain strawberries ! This product is very inexpensive and works like a charm !	1
Got this because of all the reviews . I now have this , the ocean one and the clarifier . It works just as well . Cleans thoroughly , smells nice for `` fruity '' days , and is a great body wash . I love how much lather it creates too , but all the Naturals do so . I use this when I 'm not feeling `` oceany '' but want something sweet , and I use the apple conditioner with it . No build up , no fuss , just clean hair . I need conditioner though , as it 's not a creamy formula -- I do n't like those anyway . If you like the basics , this is for you . Also , dirt cheap at the store , but I 'd buy it here if that was a necessity . I do stray from Suave but always come back . Suave Naturals , I just do n't know how to quit you.Anyone else do that ? Try other products but then run back to what you really like ? I do n't know why I cheat , it never lasts . I 'm definitely a Suave addict , although I wo n't tell a stylist that . I know I 'd get in trouble .	1

Suave is good value for a quality product . When I use the strawberry shampoo together with Suave strawberry conditioner , my hair smells luscious , and people tell me so . I try other brands every now and then , but I always go back to Suave .	1
About the time my son turned four Johnson 's baby shampoo - a household staple - began to fail us . It was n't getting his and his older sister 's hair clean and so I set about to find a replacement . Suave 's Strawberry shampoo was it.This shampoo gets their hair clean and leaves it smelling nice . In addition it works fine as a body wash , which means that I can clean the entirety of their sweaty , mud splattered little bodies with one product . After using it for over a year , I can say that I 've found no downside . It does n't dry out their skin or hair , and it 's affordable.Four Stars . Very Good Shampoo . Smells nice and cleans well . We use it as a body wash and it does n't dry out or irritate my children 's sensitive skin.Pam T~	1
This is impressively good shampoo - and great price - compared to the Nexxus equivalent . I strongly recommend this product !	1
I purchased several bottles of Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo when Amazon had it on sale for $ 1.24 . At that price , it was a real bargain . It is a decent shampoo , that did n't dry out or leave my `` normal '' hair greasy . The shampoo is a poor man 's Nexxus or Paul Mitchell formula . Having used both of those over the years , the Suave version is n't as good . If you have dry or damaged hair , you may want to look elsewhere . Also , the current Amazon price is $ 5.99 . There is no way I 'd pay this for a Suave product . If you can get it on sale , and have `` normal '' hair though , I can recommend Suave Professionals Humectant Moisture Shampoo .	1
Very value priced shampoo , great for thick frizzy hair , good value for the money , would definitely buy again . Recommended product !	1
I randomly got this conditioner when I saw it was only a 1.50 on sale . I was throughly surprised the first time I used it . The scent is quite enjoyable and nice . The texture feels wonderful on your hair and leaves my hair feeling soft and definitely not dried out . I would recommend this conditioner to those trying to keep their hair healthy but may be on a budget and want drug store brands .	1

i love this product , when i first read the comments from other costumers i thought & # 34 ; OK i 'll go with it and try what will be the results & # 34 ; & oh i must say i was amazed , when i have something on my face that disturbs i put it and thats all its Gone : ) ) ) . i do i either in the evening or morning ...	1
It deep cleans without stripping my skin . It does n't make my skin produce more oil because too much has been removed . After use , my skin is able to be moisturized . I 've used other toners and this is by far my favorite .	1
This is my favorite toner . Cleans and refreshes . Love it and highly recommend this product .	1
I used the toner today after doing an at home facial and OMG it smells good first of all . I did n't expect that because I never thought to smell it once it arrived . It goes on soothingly and refreshes the skin . I 'm glad I purchased this product .	1
I TRYED AT LEAST TWO TONERS BEFORE AND NOTHING COMPARES TO THIS ! ! IT MAKES YOUR FACE SO REFRESHING AND CALM AFTER YOU WASH YOUR FACE . IT FEELS LIKE COLD WATER WITH SOOTHING ELEMENTS IN . PLUS IT 'S NOT OILY LIKE MOST TONERS AS WELL . AND IT 'S GREAT FOR ACNE PRONE SKIN.AND DRY OR COMBINATION AS WELL . I USE THIS WITH MY OLAY FOAMING FACE WASH FOR SENSITIVE SKIN . THEN MY ZAYPT ZIT GREAT TRIO . BUT I HAVE ACNE PRONE AND THIS CALMS THE ACNE DOWN PERFECT . AND NOT OILY SO YOU DO N'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR FACE GETTING LIKE A OIL BUCKET . IT 'S ALSO VERY CHEAP THEN LOTS OF TONERS SO DO N'T THINK THE PRICE IS LOW CAUSE THE PRODUCT IS BAD . THE BEST OF THINGS COME IN LOW PRICES AND PACKAGES ! ! LOL THANKS AGAIN OLAY ! !	1
I 've tried many toners and I have to say I love this product ! After cleansing my face , I apply with cotton swabs and my skin feels so great ! In addition , there is no overwhelming smell . Once again , Olay lives up to their own standard of quality products . .	1
i keep this eye gel in the fridge when i need a good pick me up under my eyes i apply this on a clean face and it makes me feel bright and refreshed i havent noticed anything with dark circles on fine lines . but im not repurchasing this product again on that note	1
I 'm 75 years old , and I 've been applying this gel every night for the past five or six years . There 's no way of knowing if the wrinkles would be worse without it , but I think it 's helping , and it feels so wonderful when I apply it before getting into bed at night.The jar does n't hold too much , but you use very little with each application . And the 2-Pack is more economical than buying one at a time at a retail store.A good product at a fair price .	1
Leaves a cooling sensation after applied . I use it morning and night and no issues with contacts either . You use very little so it lasts a long time .	1
If you use this as directions say , and use it daily of every few days it really tightens up your eyes . A tiny bit goes a long way .	1
Love ! Keeps my eye area smooth and cool . Does not irritate my eyes and helps my under eye concealer go on . I use morning and night .	1
The first time I bought this . I forgot about it and one day when my eyes felt dry puffy and tired . I tried it . It was shockly awesome . It felt cool to the touch . The puffiness and the tiredness went away . The lines were noticeble deminshing as well . It is a great product .	1
I have used this product on and off for years . I find it soothing and nonirritating . I do not know that it improves the appearance of my eye area , but it sure provides comfort .	1
My favorite powder for shiny faces .	1
This powder really does what it says , controls shine ! I have relatively shiny skin , especially in my T-zone , so I have to dab it on there & it takes the shine right out . I do n't have to continually re-apply , which I usually find myself doing with other shine free powders I 've tried . My typical coloring is nude beige & this soft cameo matched my complexion perfectly . I will say that I am using L'Oreal Paris Magic Nude Liquid Powder Bare Skin Perfecting Makeup & they work perfectly together . I do n't have to use much of either .	1
I 've been using this stuff for years . I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT ! It sets my foundation great.. & is even great without foundation & still has great coverage ! I also use it for touch ups.. A LOT ! It lasts quite awhile & does n't feel heavy or cakey at all . I definitely recommend for someone who is looking for something that is JUST as good as high end powders ! The only downside is the powder puff it comes with falls apart VERY easily . I bought my last compact just 3 weeks ago & its completely falling apart ! But it 's an easy fix because I just use my blush brush to apply it for touch ups . Just wish it came with a better quality puff . It 's worth it though for the LOW PRICE ! I just recommend tossing the puff & buying a better quality one that can be washed over & over or simply by using a powder/blush brush . Other than that I love this stuff ! !	1
Does what it needs to do and travels well . The compact has held up well in my bag and is great for quick touch-ups .	1
Applying this powder to set my foundation makes my makeup last a long time . I like that the color is translucent so it goes on clear .	1
I love this powder . I have been using it for a couple of years now . I use it because my face is a little oily . It controls the oil pretty good .	1
My only complaint with this face powder is that the powder puff thing that comes with it ALWAYS starts falling apart long before the powder is running out . I 've purchased this close to a dozen times and the cheap powder applicator never fails to fall apart on me ... Love this powder though - it 's great for a matte finish over foundation and not too heavy .	1
I am obsessed with makeup and I absolutely love this powder ! It matches my skin tone perfectly and it blends in well with my bb cream and helps me stay oil free all day with little or no reapplication . I would not be able to wear a bb cream or foundation without it because my skin gets oily .	1
so far this is the powder I usually buy along with cover girl , depending which is on sale and it is a good product .	1
I love this powder it is great . It does what it said its supposed to do . It does take away shine . Product is as described . I am happy with this product .	1
This is a nice pressed powder the size I got was small and has lasted for sometime now it feels nice .	1
GOES ON MATTE which i had n't even considered until after it had shipped and was already in transit . Which was nice because I 'm Jamaican/Mexican with a medium brown complection that looks nothing like the color of the product in the picture.I have incredibly oily skin , this product has not eliminated , but has done wonders for keeping the gross oily spots at bay , for the most part anyway.The only con and the one reason it is n't 5 stars is that i still have shine , but not nearly to the degree that it was before . this has done wonders for my self esteem . I would highly reccomend to anyone who has shine problems : )	1
I feel like it keeps the oil at bay . Not very good with the color range and packaging is n't very cute , but it does it 's job . It is nice to keep in your purse/makeup bag because of it 's size . It is in very thin packaging . Sometimes it can be hard to find these . I see these in my local cvs but not in my walmart or walgreens . Not really sure if they are phasing these out .	1
It came pretty fast , works great ( I use a brush instead of the pad they send with it ) .Ill be buying another when this one runs out !	1
This is probably the 6th bottle I 've ordered over the years . Gets the yucky black remnants of the mascara off from the lids and under the lower lid .	1
Might as well review one of my long-standing , best beauty products . I buy several of these at a time because I seriously NEVER want to run out . No oiliness after , gets all mascara and eye shadow off easily . Love this !	1
I 've used this Maybelline product for many years ; no complaints . Better than most higher-priced eye makeup removers ; why pay more ?	1
I have been using this for years . I like that it is not oily . I like that I can subcribe and save .	1
I do n't wear a lot of make-up.. just mascara and eyeliner so I did n't think I needed this but I got it just because i felt it i should since i do go to bed with that little make-up on and i keep reading and hearing its bad for the skin somehow . so yeah i got and its alright , it gets most of what i have on my eyes off , but not all ( i think i need one for waterproof ) unless im doing it wrong idk . but yeah if you need a little make-up remover this works just fine . No itchiness , no irritation , no blurred vision ( obvs do n't rub it into your eyeballs ) and i always rinse it off . its also convenient which is the No.1 thing for me . I love Maybelline so yeah , not bad	1
My wife is writing this review for me : I have tried all different eye makeup removers , either they are greasy or do n't remove enough eye makeup or leave mascara behind . This Maybelline remover works so very well , removes all of my makeup , does n't leave my eyes greasy or leave remnants of mascara behind . It even removes waterproof mascara . I used Lancome for a while , and honestly , this works better and is so much less expensive . Everyone should at least try it before buying expensive brands .	1
This is the best at removing Mascara/coverup makeup . Not oily at all and does'nt irritate the eyes . That 's important because I wear contacts !	1
This product was purchased to mix with some others to make the correct shade of loose powder . It works very well .	1
I bought it for my sister and she really like it . It does what it says regarding the shine control , and it covers a great deal	1
This powder has a wonderful , fine , silky consistency and a pleasant smell that does n't linger . It goes on smoothly with the included puff and controls shine for a long time -- maybe not all day , but for several hours , at least . I have mostly normal/combination skin , with a forehead that can get oily and cheeks that tend toward dryness ; this controlled shine all over without making any part of my face dry or itchy . It did n't reveal flaky patches or make the thin skin under my eyes look wrinkly . It 's difficult to evaluate the finish because it does n't really match my skin tone . I would expect a powder that only comes in light or medium to be more neutral , but this has a noticeable yellow tone .	1
Recommended.I have used this to set my L'oreal True Match liquid makeup for years . I have fairly pale skin , and this is the only powder I 've found to match my skin tone . Most powders have a tendency to run pink , and I have decidedly warm undertones , so I was pleasantly pleased to find a powder that wo n't turn my face orange . I have also used CoverGirl 's similar powder foundation , which runs slightly more pink than this ( though I 'd probably classify it more neutral ... ) , and I have a tendency to buy whichever one 's cheaper at the drug store . I do not , however , like the powder puff that comes with this product . It 's the thin , flat , cloth-type thing that might work better for some people but cakes the powder over my foundation . Whenever I purchase this powder , I use my own face brush to apply it .	1
i love this powder , it never makes my skin shiny . its the perfect color for my skin tone . and i will buy again and again	1
I went on a product-kick to find solutions for my super oily face and this is my favorite product I 've found . I also bought de-slick spray from Urban Decay and Basis face wash but have n't noticed a big difference from either of those ( Urban Decay 's complexion prep spray is much better than the de-slick spray , FYI ) .This product REALLY cuts down on my oil issues ! You can wear it alone for some light coverage and to feel clean when lounging around or wear it over/under makeup to stay looking matte much longer . If you 've got super oily skin , you need this . Do n't expect all your problems to be solved.. you 'll still need oil blotting sheets and your usual methods , but I find this to be a big help . For under $ 5 , you ca n't go wrong !	1
And by fine I mean it does not feel or look heavy on my face . Helps set my liquid makeup if I have used it .	1
this stuff will last me forever its so loose that you do n't need much for you face . i use the cap take the brush dip in powder that tap all the excess off in the cap and use whats in there for the rest of my face .	1
Maybelline shine free Loose Powder really leaves a nice finish on your skin . I use it over their makeup . It reduces the look of pours and leaves skin with a nice clean look . Very natural looking .	1
I 've been using this product for a number of years . It 's light and neutral and , as advertised , shine free . Price and delivery were good and I 'll continue to order as needed .	1
Arrived on time but the color was a little darker than I thought it would be.I will try again in a lighter color .	1
Cheaper than pressed powder for oily skin . I like it and will buy it again when i have to buy it .	1
Practical loose powder , great to keep around for everyday use . I would n't say its the best loose powder out there , but its quite decent . I used it to apply under the eyes before putting on eye shadow .	1
This is perfect powder over my foundation . It sets it perfectly and it lasts all day ! It is not cakey and it feels like you have nothing on . You will not be disappointed .	1
I have very fair oily skin . This is everything I need ... not cakey at all and gives me a great matte finish ! Best of all it is super affordable !	1
I was using Bare Escentuals mineral veil at $ 20 a pop ( smaller container compared to this as well ) with average results when a co-worker with fabulous matte skin introduced me to this when I finally asked her how she stayed shine-free all day when I had to reapply powder on my nose two to three times a day . She told me she uses the Maybelline Shine Free powder . I could n't believe it but I tried it anyway because at $ 5 a container , I could just trash it if I hate it.I love it from the first use . It 's not translucent . It has a bit of color . But the color is so light it really just perfects your foundation and give your a matte flawless finish . I dust it on top of my make up all over to set . Then I take a flat brush and pat down more powder on the oiliest parts like t-zone and area around the nose . Do n't worry , it does n't cake . The color does n't build up and become unnatural looking either . It 's so great at controlling oil , staying put , and looking great , I hardly reapply powder to my face the rest of the day . My make up does n't end up in my smile lines either . I find that I rarely even use the powder in my compact anymore . I just keep it around for the mirror ! I bought one container and it lasted me months . When I finally ran out and went back to Target for more , it was no longer on the shelves . I tried 5 other Targets around my work and home with no luck . I was so sad that it was discontinued . I ended up buying the Cover Girl powder thinking it would be the same but that powder was awful , dense , no oil control , and smelled . For the last several months I was back to using Bare Escentuals . And just by dumb luck I run into this again on Amazon tonight while trying to fall asleep . Why did n't I just check Amazon in the first place ? Definitely putting it on my Subscribe and Save list so I can get it sent to my house regularly . So excited ! ! ! My point is ... try it . It 's only $ 5 . I do n't think you will be disappointed .	1
What can I say it 's face powder , it gets the job done . No funky smell or caking . Came as pictured and unharmed .	1
Maybelline Volum ' Express Mascara is so much better than Great Lash . It goes on evenly and lengthens without clumping.I always use my mascara long past the three month suggested shelf life and it does n't get dried out very quickly . ( However using mascara after six months puts the user at a risk of infection , so be warned . ) And it really is waterproof . You 'll need a reliable mascara remover if you want it to come off your lashes . I 've sat through tear-jerkers wearing Volum ' Express and come out without a smudge ( much less racoon eyes ! )	1
This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras . It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup . It does n't clump at all , and it only flakes if you really start rubbing your eyes . My only complaint with this product is that it is very difficult to remove ... but it 's a waterproof mascara . It 's supposed to be long lasting ! When I shower and wash my face each night it will not budge . It does n't bother me , but if you are someone who must remove every speck before bedtime , this is not for you !	1
I have been using this since it was in the light blue bottle and when this was the lone Volum Express , before the Falsies , One By One , Cat Eyes , etc . I just love it . I will say that it is a very dry mascara and takes some getting used to . The first two or three times you use it , it 's really thin and feels like it 's not doing anything , then it gets thicker and drier after that , which is when it 'll be much easier to build volume.I layer about three coats of this to get my desired look . The first one is normal , sweeping from root to tip . The second I focus more on wiggling it in the roots , then the last I use the end of the brush to get in and separate any lashes that may have clumped up . You can even go further if you want and layer on even more if you 're going for a more dramatic evening look , and you wo n't have to wear false lashes.I like to bend the brush into a curve to better fit my eye and I feel like that helps to coat every single lash . You ca n't do that with the newer rubber brushes like the one in Cover Girl Lash Blast.This stuff will not budge . I wear it in the summer even when swimming and it does n't go anywhere . Any other mascaras will smudge right underneath my eyebrows about halfway through the day , like right where the tops of my eyelashes hit . This one does n't do that.As far as removing it goes , I have a habit of picking of my mascara at night rather than using a makeup remover , and this is the only mascara I 've ever found that just comes right off and does n't get all goopy when I do that . If I wear other eye makeup with this mascara that I need to remove , I just use coconut oil and it all wipes off very easily.I highly recommend this mascara , but I know mascara is something that is all about personal preference . Give it a try ! And remember to try it out a few times to for it to thicken up .	1
I was so discouraged by the last Maybelline Mascara that I was unsure I was going to find one I liked besides the Falsies mascara . The first thing that drew me in on this was that it was waterproof , and volume . I have really thin-point-straight-down lashes , so I know I should stay away from really wet mascaras and go for volume and waterproof since they have a more `` waxy '' build . Though , this does stay wet enough to build and build to get a look I have been trying for , without massive clumping or turning my eyes into a solid mass . The second thing I was excited to see is that it came in brownish black . It is so difficult to find a mascara that is waterproof and brownish black . Usually the only waterproof one is Very Black . It looks just a touch less harsh with my skin and eyes ( I have fair skin and dark brown hair ) , a little more natural.All in all I love this . It holds my curl and the brush is super nice and not too big.I would recommend this to anyone with thin lashes like me .	1
I have been using this mascara for a few months , and I like it . I do n't want & # 34 ; monster & # 34 ; lashes - just lashes that look a bit thicker and darker that look natural . This mascara works for me . Toward the end of the uses , it may get a clump or two on the brush , but I just wipe them off on a tissue . This mascara looks natural without looking like you are wearing false eyelashes .	1
does n't run or fade or chip , so it gets 5 stars from me ! : D altho its a pain to wash off .	1
This is the best bang for your buck when it comes to inexpensive mascaras . It definitely gives lashes dramatic volume but in a way that draws attention to your eyes and not your makeup .

i bought this mascara because i was tired of looking like a racoon when i went to pool parties . it has definately helped and will work if you dont rub your eyes underwater . it still drips a little in the pool , but not much . i have extremely long curly lashes and this made them appear very thick as well , which i liked . it clumps a bit at first , but after a week or so , it calms down . its a good buy for the price .	1
I have been using this for years , love it , it is a mainstay as far as makeup goes , maybelline products are always good !	1
L'oreal has a great product line . Pick the shade closer to your skin tone and you will not be disappointed . I am in my fifty 's and love anything that will enhance my skin naturally .	1
This has been one of my favorites for about 15 years now . When I can afford it , I try and keep it in stock . Very good price from Amazon .	1
The price was good and it does what it says . I will continue with it if it does not skyrocket in price .	1
I have used L'Oreal for years , it has always worked well for me . I would recommend this product to anyone old enough to remember why Marsha was goovy .	1
Love the coverage because product is light and does not break out my skin . Beautiful color and easy to apply . Will buy again .	1
I use L'Oreal Paris products on a daily basis . I find that they are consistently good quality products without the department store prices .	1
I purchased 2 shades , ( creme cafe , and golden beige ) . My complexion is olive , medium tan . These colors are very similar , but the creme cafe was a tad deeper in color . A perfect match for me . The creme cafe feels like it has grit in the foundation , almost sandy.. but after smoothing it on , the grit dissapears . It has a slight painty smell to it . The other color is nearly odorless , and with no grit . Both containers were unsealed , and the original stickers were obviously scraped off . ( Likely the clearence stickers ) . They didnt however , appear used . The containers were full and there was no excess makeup on the inside of the lids . the cost of these shades vary , but I got 2 for no more than $ 9.00 ! Way better than drugstore prices . The finish of this makeup is somewhat dewy , a healthy looking glow . If you have oily or combo skin , like me , you will want to wash , then tone , then prime your face before applying this , then follow with a powder in order to get a shine free look .	1
This make up is the best . It covers good and last all day.I was pleasantly surprised . I will definitely purchase more.Looks great and is a great price ... .	1
To be honest , I wondered if this makeup was going to be good , because it was sold at a MUCH lower price than I paid in the store , but the ONLY difference was that it did not come in a box or package ( except package it was shipped in , lol ) . The makeup itself is exactly the same . I like this L'Oreal product , it works very well for making my skin tone look even , and it lasts all day . I definitely recommend the seller , and will buy again myself .	1
it covers really well n feels smooth i set it with powder and it lasts all day : ) but i think it was used because the bottle was kinda dirty with the foundation its self . And it has stickers that said `` new '' and they were like half way peeled off soo that was a downside : (	1
BEAUTIFUL and Cheaper than going to the store even with shipping . Makes me look 5 years younger and looks smooth and natural . LOVE IT !	1
I bought this light color because it was at an awesome price and its a established product . I mix it with my summer ( darker ) foundation when applying and it works out perfectly .	1
Great makeup I use this all the time and go back to it . Color is good and am very happy with the purchase . Thanks !	1
Absolutely fantastic . It does what it says it does . Came right away and was very reasonably priced ! Thank you so much .	1
I am always searching for a foundation suited for my olive skintone . This color was perfect in caramel beige and for my type of skin , Dry with oily t zone . I was so shock to find a foundation which covers minimizes my discoloration on my cheeks and makes my skin look so much better . I was so happy ordered several more for not to run out . Thank you Amazon for carrying this product.The product is medium coverage , applied it in sections and do n't need that much , this gives a better coverage to your face . Please use a light hand on application . I notice some women like to rub in their foundation like lotion . A big no , no.Thank you , Native Rose	1
Is this a good base . I recommend them as making a cost analysis and quality is this basis that best goes to my taste .	1
This face makeup I have used for many years and have always been pleased with the color and the staying effect of the makeup over a long day . I used a face powder to set my makeup and the face powder is also L'Oreal . In this price range this is a good makeup .	1
I love the L'Oreal Visible lift makeup , it goes on smooth , lasts throughout the day , and has a very light weight feel on the skin . I think it 's actually making my complexion better . It was a great price and free shipping from this seller . I would definitely recommend to any age group or complexion type .	1
i like the consistence , the covereage is medium , not bad not good but with power over it it looks nice i would buy this again .	1
my skin already looks better and younger each day that I use this product . It covers blemishes and wrinkles very well , I get comments of my appearance age is 5-6 yrs younger than what I really am . I complement the foundation also with age rewind powder , I think the combination of the two really help each other	1
I have been using this foundation for years and absolutely love it . I bought it at Amazon because their price is better than the stores ! ! ! ! ! I also sent one to my daughter in another state and she loves the coverage too .	1
I was looking for an orangy lipstick since ages , then I found this one on Amazon and I bought it after reading reviews on makeupalley.com , since I was not able to physically see the product . I didnt know what to expect.I am very happy with my purchase . Perfect color and excellent texture . The product was also in mint condition and arrived on time .	1
I was watching a review on youtube and the artist used this shade of lipstick . It photographs beautifully and works well for any skin tone and especially shows up the teeth . I could n't find it locally and was happy to find it online . I am glad I did . It really is a pretty color . A heads up it is a dark cherry color for those use to wearing lighter shades of lipstick .	1
I 've has this lipstick for such a long time , and you cant find it in stores anymore : ( . I do n't use this by itself , I use it for a perfect ombre lip . I take any lip liner and outline my lips , and hen fill in the sides . Then I take this lipstick and put it on the center of my pout . Then I smush them together , and I have a nicely faded ombre lip . I get compliments every time . I have found that my ombre lip works BESTEST ; ) with this lipstick . I 've tried it with mac ones and its never as good ! This lipstick is a staple in my collection . Very quick shipping !	1
have been looking for the perfect nude lipstick that offer higher pigmentation for dark olive/tanned skin . this lipstick does not disappoint- matte with a sheer finish . a great match for a smoky eye !	1
I bought this Revlon `` Kiss Me Coral '' lipstick about a month ago for the first time . Although it is labelled as Coral , it is actually more like it looks in the picture -- a slightly orange-y red . I was nervous about that when I purchased it , but it turns out it actually is very flattering with my skin -- I have very light , fairly neutral skin ( I do get red cheeks , but with foundation it evens out ) . It works well whether it 's applied and blotted just a little bit ( for a nighttime look usually ) or for a daytime look , if it 's blotted a lot it looks like more of a stain.I also think it looks very pretty when I use it as a cream blush ( very lightly applied of course ) . It 's a `` creme '' lipstick , so it 's not sparkly and it 's also not matte -- very creamy and smooth . It lasts rather long as a lipstick actually , and for me I need minimal applications throughout the day.When I originally bought this , I was looking actually for a lighter more true `` coral '' color ( I was thinking more pink ) but I guess I 'm just attracted to bright reds ! I am glad I went with my instincts and chose this .	1
When it comes to many beauty products , I 'm a big fan of going for the drugstore brands over the higher-end luxury brands and this Revlon lipstick does not disappoint ! They 're very pigmented and moisturizing , which is great for my chronically chapped lips . The color goes on smooth and I do n't find it feathering out or flaking after a few hours like I do with many other lip colors.I was looking for some nice colors for fall and bought these in Rum Raisin and Raisin Rage , which go great with my medium Indian skin tone . Rum Raisin is a softer pinkish red color , which is beautiful for the daytime . Raisin Rage is a bolder red-burgundy . I did n't find it nearly as purple as the picture shows . It 's awesome for the fall , and is that perfect red color I was looking for , without looking too 90s.Knocked off one star for staying power . This did n't last too long on me . Then again , most lipsticks do n't due to my dry , chapped lips . The moisturization and pigmentation more than makes up for it . I do n't mind touching up every now and then . Definitely my new HG for lipsticks !	1
I got the lipstick and I really like it because it is a nice dark color and I can use it to match anything .	1
Beautiful color , so pigmented . I just can say that I love REVLON products and I will get more of their stuff .	1
This color used to be more in style than it is now . But its a good product . Bought this 15 years ago , still love it . I top it with a light pink lipgloss .	1
A good bargain on this lipstick . The color is neutral and goes on creamy and smooth . I love the feeling of it on my lips . It does n't smear or wear off . A great deal on pack of 2 . Will buy them again !	1
Glides on your lips and lasts forever- I got so many compliments when I wear this shade- the PERFECT subtle red .	1
When my favorite color for years was discontinued ( do n't you just hate that ? ) I turned to this one and just love it ! There is a perfect amount of & # 34 ; pearl & # 34 ; so your lips do n't look flat and dry . The consistence is nice and smooth .	1
Revlon lipsticks are all amazing . There are so many shades and they all apply creamy and beautifully . If you do n't want to splurge on mac then get revlon lipsticks . They 're highly pigmented and feel so nice on the lips . I do n't even need to use a lip liner with them . They last about 1-2 hours before I reapply them . They might last longer but I always like to reapply my lipstick about every hour unless it is a liquid lipstick .	1
This color goes with everything you may be wearing , except bright red , or dark brown . Many people have asked what shade I am wearing as it looks really good and is flattering to almost everyone . It stays on a better than average lenght of time , unless you eat or drink . I often put gloss on top for a more dramatic effect .	1
I 've used this color for the past 15 years , and I 've enjoyed the texture , quality , and color every time . Difficult to find , often sold out , and there is a good reason for that . It is a great neutral shade that goes on lighter on than the tube photo shows , which is more of a medium color . Not too dark , not to light . My friends use this and we are mature women with mature skin . Back in the day when I used to still tan , it also looked great , but it also does well with fair to medium skin tones . I no longer tan my face , and this gives my pale lips lots of color without washing out my white with freckles face ! I find the color is flattering with most everything I wear except orange and warm reds , which is not in my wardrobe.My colors is considered to be between Summer and Winter ( Color Me Beautiful book ) and that basically means I usually wear the cool colors , not the warm ones . I do n't find it to be super long lasting , but I actually prefer that . It feels great on my lips , and I do n't mind reapplying it after eating . Taste is nothing special . I do n't notice any lipstick taste unless I 'm using a flavored fruit type of lip balm , so not sure what other reviewers were expecting it to taste like . Hope that helps someone decide which colors they want . One other add : I bought this on a subscription delivery schedule , but I noticed that it has increased to over $ 2 more than last month . That was disappointing . I 'll be keeping an eye on that before I order it again .	1
I love this one of Revlon . The colour really suits me - I have brown hair , fair skin , and blue eyes . I would recommend it to anyone !	1
This is a very interesting fall color that goes on supple and feels like silk on the lips . I like that it has just enough moisture so it does n't dry out your lips . The only thing I advise you to do is exfoliate your lips with a little brown sugar and olive oil before applying to avoid any cake build up . I ca n't stress how relaxed and vamp this color is I just love revlon .	1
I literally received this lipstick a few hours ago and I 'm absolutely in love with it because it looks so natural and cute ! ! I makes my lips look softer and bigger and I love it . Ca n't . Stop . Putting . It . On !	1
Warm , lip color-enhancing neutral . Not-too-warm , not at all cold , so if you need a warm , natural not-too-light/dark shade to swipe on this is one you should have in your handbag . Great price , rapid delivery . Non-drying when you use it over balm and if you take care of your lips .	1
I use this product because you can change the color of the lipstick with the lip pencil that you use and because it is a nude lipstick it can be used on mostly any skin type .	1
Do you like Lipstick ? But , do you find that your lipstick makes your lips dry , chapped , or crave Doritos ? Well , Revlon Superlustrous is for you ! It almost has a balm feel , and is highly pigmented ( it only takes one `` coat '' ) . I like this color because it kind of has that Minaj-esque pop of pink but very much subdued and casual Friday appropriate .	1
Absolutely love Blackberry 640 . It is a deep rich color . Goes on smoothly . I prefer Revlon over the Est & eacute ; e Lauder lipsticks that I get as a gift with purchase .	1
Revelon Super Lustrous Lipstick Creme Lipstick is as in thename very lustrous . This lipstick will keep lips moustourized all day long . There is no need to add extra moisturized to your lips when usingthis Lipstick.The Color is very beautiful and last all day . All in all I would say this is a good value for your money . I have used this lipstick for many years and I have never been disappointed by its performance .	1
I PURCHASED THE LIPSTICK IN MAUVY NIGHT . IT GLIDES ON SO SMOOTH , AND MY LIPS FEEL SO SOFT . I GAVE IT FOUR STARS BECAUSE IT COULD BE MORE PIGMENTED , BUT NOT THAT BIG A DEAL BECAUSE THE FINISHED LOOK LOOKS SO GOOD ! i THINK I HAD TO PUT A FEW LAYERS ON BECAUSE MY LIPS ARE MORE PIGMENTED , I HAVE OLIVE SKIN/ROSEY LIPS , SO MAYBE THATS WHY .	1
I do love Revlon lipsticks , and I have used only Revlon lipsticks for many years.The lipstick stays on well , and like most Revlon products , I think they are tops .	1
Softsilver Red is a light strawberry red with silver shimmer . Has a little bit of pink and hints of coral too . Very pretty color . I actually like this color so much , I have it on autoship . : ) .	1
I am fussy about my lipstick . It has to feel as good as it looks . This lipstick fits the bill ; beautiful flattering color with a little glimmer ( making lips look a little poufy ) and feels creamy . I will order this lipstick as long as it is available .	1
I love the formula for the Revlon Super Lustrous Lipsticks - I own a handful of different shades and this was an excellent addition . The lipstick is creamy but not sticky and does n't bleed even without lip liner . The shade is very opaque and gets good color on one swipe , but I find it has better staying power after a dab with some tissue and then reapplication . The color itself is perfectly neutral for my lips , evens the color out slightly and adds the barest natural pink to my lips . Not sure how that 'll help other people , but I 've got lightly tanned/olive skin tone for some perspective . 10/10 would buy again .	1
best all around warm tone color . hope they never discontinue this color . I am addicted to it for everyday use .	1
This is the first red lipstick that I 've enjoyed using - it 's very smooth , and makes your lips look great !	1
My wife loves this particular shade of lipstick and it 's so hard , if not impossible to find locally ... so much easier justplace an order and viola ... I 'm sure she 'll be ordering again from this marketseller for they are excellent	1
A tube of lipstick could have gotten lost between the cracks , but not at Amazon . This was a new shade and I love it ! As all my otherorders from Amazon , it was packaged perfectly , arrived shortly after ordering , and the quality was the gold standard as always withRevlon Products . I thank anyone who saw to it that my order was handled with tender , loving care . I appreciate it !	1
I bought this for my mom who loves the color . She wants me to get a couple more because she 's wants backups.I tried it several times and I would say the formula is VERY good for a lipstick at this price point . It does n't last amazingly long and is n't as AMAZING as some of the more expensive lipsticks I own ( Estee Lauder , Mac ) . But the difference in price is HUGE . And if you 're okay with several touch ups in the day , it makes a good every day lipstick .	1
More women have asked me what color lipstick I am wearing when I use this # 225 from Revlon . It is a medium boldness with hints of coral and pinks , which means you can wear it with almost all colors .	1
This color goes on well and it goes with absolutely everything . Even darker colors work well with it if you have a fair to medium skin tone .	1
Love this red ! Great lipstick ! Applies smoothly and long lasting . Very happy . Also purchased other colors . I think you will like it , especially if you are a Lady in Red !	1
I have some dry patches no moisturizer seemed to be able to control over the course of a day . I know this is a night cream , however , I 've been using it in the day mixed in with my sunblock and it lasts all day . I have n't seen those dry patches in the last month or so since I started using it . I do n't know about wrinkle control just yet but I does work very well for me as a moisturizer . It does have a scent to it , I do n't consider it offensive but I grew up in a time when most beauty products had some scent to them some more than others so I do n't mind it . It does n't linger .	1
Best moisturizing cream ever . Great for after peel ( use NCN Peel ... The best ! ) . Cant use during the day unless I put on olay regenerist over the top to combat the greasiness . Love , Love , Love !	1
I love this face cream . I Have used it for decades . It is just the right creaminess for dry facial skin . It has a pleasant smell , but not too fragrant . It lasts a long time and the price is very reasonable . It only takes a tiny little bit once a day - under make up or at night . Try it . Your face will love you for it .	1
top of the line in company and in products for i always like to have some cosmetic products to help bring out my best attributes .	1
Out of all the eyelash curlers I have tried this one is the one that has been doing a great job . I have big eyes and natural long and full eyelashes so it 's a little hard for me to use just any curler , but this one is a good size and it works perfect for me .	1
My eyelashes are n't particularly short , but they do go straight outwards so are very hard to see . The curler is a very good buy for the price and works great and it 's very portable . I use it every day and my eyelashes definitely look better .	1
First , other reviewers are correct that what is pictured is not what you 'll receive . The shape is different , the handles are n't the same shape , the pads are silicon rather than the rubber we 're used to , etc . It threw me for a moment ... but then I used the curlers . I have used Revlon lash curlers for as long as I can remember and love them . This actually curls my lashes better than all the ones I 've previously owned so I do n't care that they are n't what is pictured . I do n't know if it 's the slightly bent shape , the larger head , the silicone pads , or what , but my lashes are completely curled - nice sweep-up effect - and the curl seems to stay much longer . I highly recommend them .	1
not all lashcurlers are the same ... and definitely will pull out your lashes if you do n't use it correctly ! i like that it 's easy to find replacement pads ; of course the curler itself if made to last forever too !	1
It does the job , so I have no complaints . I will buy it again , when the current one wears out .	1
After I came to America , I 'd tried different brands of shampoos and conditioners , which deeply harm my hair.I was thinking I have to bought shampoos and conditioners from my home country . However , I tried this conditioner one year ago . It surprisingly works so well for me ! It is so smooth and smells great . I love it ! !	1
First use of this particular product , but long time user of the Clean line . Most recently used used the Triple Moisturzer from Neutrogena . The hair comes out clean and soft . Ca n't ask for much more.So why four stars , not five - I only give to truly outstanding products five stars . This is very good and recommended .	1
I have tried almost every conditioner on the market and found that most are too rich and weigh my hair down or they do n't moisturize enough and left a rat 's nest out of my hair . Of course the superexpensive ( Fekkai ) ones work great but I get tired of paying that much money all the time . I was very pleasantly surprised that this conditioner worked PERFECT . My hair felt conditioned but it was not weighed down and it had some body . This has a very light , pleasant scent . I highly recommend this to anyone just to try and see and at this price its not an investment .	1
GREAT ESPECIALLY IF WHEN YOU HAVE OILY - LONG - COLOR TREATED HAIR . JUST WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY OILY - TANGLED HAIR .	1
Like the shampoo , this conditioner is great , my hair is so soft and full after just one use . I wish I could find it at local stores	1
This soap is just ok ; it sort of makes my skin feel a bit like it has a film on it or something , but perhaps I just need to get used to it . I quit using sulphate soaps , and I use this or Dr. Bronner 's Tea Tree Oil soap.UPDATE : I really love this soap , and my skin loves it too . I have VERY sensitive skin , and I ca n't even use soap with a wash cloth , because I will itch when I get out of the shower if I do . I really like how delicate this soap is on my skin . I slather my arms and legs in coconut oil after the shower , and my skin has no irritation at all . I will probably use this soap forever , as it cleans , but it does n't make my skin angry . The bar also lasts FOREVER ; I have been using it everyday now for several months , and it 's only halfway gone . Great deal for the money : )	1
This soap is AWESOME ! I first found it at a discount store and the single bar lasted 8 months . I wash my face with it twice per day . Olive oil is the perfect for any skin type . Its nature 's perfect moisturizer . The bar itself is extremely large so that it will not fit in a normal soap container . I was tempted to buy two just in case but its so large I will have it for awhile . Now that I think about it , I will buy more at the current price . You never know when it might go up in price .	1
I switched to this soap after finding out the `` cruely-free '' ones I had been using contained palm oil `` hidden '' in the ingredient lists under different names . Palm oil production is driving orangutans to near extinction . Not exactly `` cruelty-free '' as those soaps claimed . This brand is great for sensitive skin .	1
I feel the need to write a review of this product mainly because of all the reviews saying its caustic.First let me say I am a soap maker and run a very successful business making cold process soap . Sometimes I do n't get a batch made for myself and I have to buy some , so this was convenient and I bought it even after reading some of the terrible reviews . I have several means of testing soap for caustics I used every single one on this bar before using it on my skin , this soap is in NO way caustic ! It 's a pretty nice basic soap , a large bar , and came at a good price.When I neglect to have soap made for personal use I will definately purchase this product again .	1
This soap has a smooth creamy texture that I love . I like to save it for special occasions to treat myself .	1
This is more thin than I thought it would be . I guess I was expecting Pond 's thickness , but I did n't want to buy Ponds which is a little greasy for me . Hydra Renewal smells so nice and feels good going on . It does n't go on oily and soaks into my skin well . I have no problems using it on my face , around my eyes and neck area . I have had no problems applying sunscreen directly after and did n't end up with a greasy mess on my face . I like the price , too , which is affordable . This product is available at Walmart , as well .	1
I have recently been suffering from dry skin and my face looked so dull . I changed up my cleanser and added this amazing moisture cream and its like I have new skin . It absorbs quickly and the results are amazing . Its made a definite positive impact on the look and feel of my skin . I put it on auto-delivery , cause I do n't ever expect to have to look for another moisturizer .	1
I 've been using this cream for about a year now , I 'm 44 , and due to an immune disorder , I have Vitiligo , a VERY mild version of it , meaning , I 'm still fairly pale but my skin is uneven and my face is darker than it used to be . I used to have peaches and cream skin ( Irish , German & Italian heritage ) but when I moved to Texas , it seemed like my skin disorder was activated . Anyway , even tho ' growing up I wanted darker skin and tanned ( I grew up in Long Island ) , as I got older I really realized the natural beauty of your true skin color . Well , too late ; - ( about 12 years after running around Lady Bird Lake here in Austin , I came home and my skin was a yellowish tint . It was almost as if I 'd gotten a sunburn but it did n't really go away ; - ( I immediately started to exfoliate as much as I could , and did my best to stay out of the sun but long story short , my skin was permanently darkened because my immune system was compromised . So back to this cream , Loreal has always been a good product and reasonably priced but I particularly like this cream because1 . It feels very cooling and soft when it goes on2 . No filmy feel to it on your skin3 . I actually like that it 's a little heavy in the sense it can make my skin a little oily looking but I prefer that to dry and cakey looking4 . It 's cheap ! 5 . It seems to help with my slight discoloration and does NOT add to my yellowish tone that I have acquiredDo NOT get this product if you like your skin very matte or a bit dry - or IF you get this - you 'll need foundation/powder - I do n't use foundation powder - as much as I struggle with my skin color ( mostly I notice it - not too many others ) I do n't like foundation . I like feeling natural and free with my skin.Overall ? This is my favorite day cream .	1
this product really work for me had no rash on my skin or bump..i notice about week using this product really skin change different..the seller ship it real good and fast too had no prob ...	1
I 've been using this moisturizer for years because it does n't make me break out like just about everything else does , and it keeps my face nicely hydrated all day .	1
This is a amazing moisturizing cream.. I use it in Winter as well as in summer ... its very smooth to apply ... I ordered it 4 times now ... an will order many more.. : )	1
This product is wondderfuum designed . Creamy and moist . It radiates the skin and keeps it glowing . You will love the results .	1
Love the smell and texture of this creme , a very small amount goes a very very long way . The smell is simply clean and makes you feel good , and I am very sensitive towards fragrances in lotions especially on my face.I did try this out under my make up , when i wear my Mac Studio Fix , I prefer to use Mac 's prep and prime , as with only the moisturizer it seems to make my make up just a bit uneven , not badly , but i saw a bit of a difference.Might try it under the Prep and Prime as I am not sure if the Prep and Prime will give my dry prone face enough moisture.But i do love using this moisturizer to use with my cinema secrets creme foundation pallet , ( must try ladies , and amazing beauty product ) Overall I love the creme , will definitely re order , and for my break out sensitive prone skin , no issue either . Definitely recommend	1
I 've only been using the product for a week morning and night and can say that it works for its intended purpose that I got it for . Within two days I saw drastically reduced puffiness and after four the dark circles were diminished enough that I felt okay without makeup to cover my severe dark circles.Granted , they are still there a little , but it has only been a week . All in all , I say it works pretty well considering I did n't really have high expectations at all . I 'll wait and see if it holds up over time.I do n't have any wrinkles around my eyes yet so I ca n't speak for that part , but maybe it 'll help keep them away .	1
I agree with the reviewer below me..I have used nothing else but this product for over 15 yrs . I have tried so many $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ nothing works better than this.Some products are much too aggressive for the eye area.Having very sensitive skin/eyes , everything I have ever tried irritates my eyes , or is to heavy & greasy.This removes the dark circles , feels extremely cool when applying , is not greasy , but moisturizes & keeps those lines in control .I use it morning & night , can be put in fridge also for hour or ( 2 ) before if your eyes are puffy , works wonderfully for that ! It 's perfect , I hope it never gets discontinued I would be lost without it.Thanks	1
I gave this 4 stars because of the mess of cleaning -- but its a thousand times better than a tampon or pad . Wo n't be going back to those ! Here are my impressions of using the Instead Softcup.Do not try to do this in a public bathroom -- it 's too difficult ( messy ) and may not be sanitary . And because these cups can be used for 12 hours , in my case , I was always home to do my changes.Follow the instructions ! Read them twice.I found I did n't have a hard time inserting the soft cup , but getting it out was another thing . Make sure your hands are clean and if you are having a hard time inserting your finger and pulling out the ring you need to RELAX.The first time I pulled it out ( after a lot of sweating ) , I made a mess trying to empty it out and dispose of it . By the third one , I was more prepared . After emptying the cup , I wrap it in toilet paper and then place it in a small plastic bag . If you have small plastic bags to reuse then put them in the bathroom where you will be doing your changes.If you insert it correctly , you will not feel anything there . If you have problems inserting due to dryness , then try some lubricating gel . The cup was so comfortable for me that I had to remind myself when I needed to change it.I had one time that it leaked . It was on the second day of my period ( the heaviest day for me ) and I had a cold . I coughed and coughed and suddenly , yep , you guessed it , I felt a warm gush -- good thing I was home . Like I said in the beginning -- READ the Instructions . I should have been changing it every four hours -- it was about six hours that I had it in . So that leakage was my fault ( operator error ) ; - ) .I wish I had known about this product while I was going to school -- would have made me a lot happier not to mess with pads and tampons at school .	1
I have been wanting to try a menstrual cup out but was hesitant . I decided to try these rather than the diva cup or reusable ones . I like the fact I can just throw it away . I was surprised I actually like this product ! When inserting push back and down not up . I have not had a leak with this technique . I have not had any issues with it coming out . If you bear down too hard it might come out though . I put the garbage can right in front of me when taking the cup out . I really do n't think it 's messy at all . I pull it out slowly and am careful not to spill . You will obviously get blood on your fingers but you could put gloves on if it bothers you . I have not tried taking out or inserting a new cup in a public restroom . I would rather do this at home . It is really nice not having to worry about changing a tampon all the time !	1
Thanks to all the reviewers that have shared with candid honesty ... I found them to be very helpful before buying this product . I 'll try to do the same , hoping someone will find it helpful.This product was definately a godsend for me , but it 's definately not for everyone . My sister , for one , would have tried it once and said , `` Yeah , good luck with that one ... '' . But I was deturmined to give it a chance because I no longer find tampons comfortable , and frankly end up wasting a lot of them because I think they need a change and then find that they do n't and it 's not like you can put those back in . I really liked how this product gave me the comfort of feeling clean and dry when I was wearing it , yet I could take it out and clean it and put it back in . Talk about reducing waste ! One of these could easily last an entire period . I still wear a decent panty liner or super thin pad as a back up ( like Always Dry Weave , which would give me time if I needed to get to a bathroom ) but at least I get to feel clean and dry while wearing it , as opposed to having to sit in the 'stuff ' I 'm menstruating . Also , I use to have a terrible time sleeping with a sanitary pad because I would get woken up by the sensation of the blood trickling gravity-style downward while I wondered if I was sufficiently covered to not stain the bed . Such a hassle and lots of restless sleep . The Instead allows me to not be awakened by that , yet not have to deal with tampons that never lasted all night anyway . So , now for the down side . It 's a bit tricky getting used to insertion and I 'm not so sure the one size fits all . It feels like it 's a bit big around , but maybe it would leak if it were n't so . I love how flexible and bendable it is and it 's not bulky . After trying this I KNOW I could never use one of the non-desposable bulkier Diva type models with a stem to grab . The Instead seems much more user friendly compared to those.The ideal bathroom would have a sink right next to the toilet so you could remove the Instead , rinse it and re-insert it . Or better yet , do it in the shower ! But that 's not usually the location you 'll find yourself in . Oddly , I found that many times I did n't actually need to remove it ! Something about the position of crouching over the seat in a public bathroom seems to lend to enabling the Instead to purge it 's contents into the toilet without me actually needing to remove the thing . Odd , but hey , who was I to look a gift horse in the mouth ? I just made sure it was situated back how it should be before finishing my business . Once , I did remove it in a public bathroom and wiped it down with a flat wad of toilet paper before re-inserting it . Gross , yes , but then so are pads with clots in them that I have to sit on until the next change , so it 's a trade off . Ahh the joys of womanhood . I do n't think I ever washed my hands so much before and after entering the bathroom until purchasing this product . So there 's always an up side to everything . I think every woman should try these to see if they 'll work for them . I wish I had found these 20 years ago . I bought a box of 24 and plan to give one to my niece and another to a close friend just so they can try it and see if it 'll work for them and make their lives easier . It 's definately better than the alturnatives if you can make it work . Good luck ladies !	1
Okay , , , so tmi review ! Seriously ! This product works perfect for days 3-5 ! It 's amazing ! I wore it on the airplane , used it during intercourse , and no blood at all ! But it really lacks in the first two days when I have a heavy cycle . Not surprised . I would suggest maybe wearing at least a panty liner or doing what you regularly do for your time of the month.Out of all of the options ( tampons , pads , softcups ) it 's is soo comfortable . Let 's be honest , pads feel like a weird diaper ( and I always feel like I smell with pads ) and tampons can be a pain to get in especially when you 're cramping ! I feel like you definitely have to be familiar with your body and comfortable with it to put it in . You have to stick it a little bit back in there . It 's more complex then a pad or tampon . But it really is amazing ! Clean up is probably the worse of all options . You have to pull the softcup back out and it acted as a bucket for the blood ( meaning you 're pulling a pool of blood out ) . It can be messy and awkward to dispose of in a plublic restroom . Lot 's of TP needed ! So idk ... it ultimately depends on what you like to deal with during you 're period . I wish females did n't have a period ! I would recommend anyone to give it a one time try ! : DPS never writing a review for a & # 34 ; feminine product & # 34 ; again . BYE ! : D	1
I use these mostly in the summer time when I go swimming . I do not wear tampons , and find these to be a much better alternative . They may take a little practice to insert , but it can be done . I recommend using a little bit of lube to make it easier . Sometimes they like to tilt the wrong way , but overall I like having these on hand . I do n't know why they are so hard to find at the store .	1
LOve the way it seals it up , no smell and you can use it for up to 12 hours at a time . However , getting it in place can be tricky and removal is best done in the shower . Actually insertion might be best done in the shower where you can squat down and get it in there correctly then wash off any mess left behind . Feels clean and comfortable when properly placed , you forget it is even there . Make sure to change every twelve hours though . Recommended .	1
Alright so I am going to be extremely open in this review . If you or any other female you know are in a wheelchair it makes that time of month even more unpleasant.I was using a large overnight pad and the super+ tampons and well when you bend over in a wheelchair it creates a very uncomfortable.. squish ... and it was not working and making me miserable.Now I still use a pad to catch accidental leaks since sitting doesnt allow for natural gravity flow . But with this product I can actually feel like I am able to go out of the house during that week each month . I do n't worry about what if I bend over.Pro 's : not recommended but i have used over 12hrs and it worked great . use longer at your own risk since there is little research with TSS and these.less smelleasy for those with less dexterity ( i couldnt use diva cup cuz i have issues with my hands and folding it while inserting was impossible ) sanitary just throw outcons : takes time to get used tocan be messy to remove but better after practicei think its only cuz i sit in a wheelchair but it sometimes sits on my urethra and after 8hrs hurts/makes me really have to pee.great product . i recommend to all !	1
I was nervous to try these but desperate because I would be on my period on my wedding day . It definitely takes some proper placement technique but I 'm getting better and better at it and managed to breeze through the wedding without any problems . I have major discomfort with tampons yet with the soft cup I do n't even notice it 's there . I am very happy with these and will continue to use this product .	1
I 'm prone to yeast infections , so I try to avoid tampons , which can be irritating . I 've tried two different brands of menstrual cups , both of which were a challenge to remove ! With Softcup , they 're super easy to insert and remove . And while they 're not reusable like menstrual cups , they hold just as much and , frankly , I do n't want to bother having to wash one . The fact that they 're disposable make them really convenient . Once they 're in , I ca n't feel them at all , and they do n't press on my urethra like menstrual cups do , so it 's no problem to pee with them in . I 've worn these on an off for years and have never had any problems with leaking either .	1
waaaaay awesome that you can use during intercourse . the boyfriend does n't like it so much for his purposes , but other lovers have n't seemed to notice or mind . easy to clean and toss ... i feel a bit guilty about the waste , but mother nature can suck it . we got ta deal with this bleeding , she can deal with my polluting . i make up for it in every other way anyway ; i do n't even use makeup remover wipes ! no bleached cotton growing bacteria all day , no changing every 4 hours , no drippy pee string , no dirty silicone cup to boil , no feeling it at all , no fuss at all , really .	1
A little messy at times ... .but it is super convenient if you do n't have the time or place to change pads/tampons throughout the day . I use a backup liner just in case . Clever idea . I do n't like using bleached cotton tampons ( who wants to stick bleach IN themselves ? ? ) Totally unnoticeable . Great for swimming , tight clothing , anything really . Make it part of your shower routine and you 'll have no issues .	1
Game-changer . These are just as simple to use as tampons , and a thousand times more comfortable . You can use them all day or all night easily , and I only change them at 12 hour intervals because the instructions say to , not because it 's really necessary . As others have said , you can definitely clean them off and use them again , so I tend to use one for all day , clean it , and then use it for all night , or vice versa . It 's quite easy to clean the current one during your daily shower , and then move on with your life ! I 've occasionally noticed that if it slips a little out of position , it can put a bit of pressure on my bladder , but overall , these are super comfortable to wear , and I 've never had a problem with leaks . I 've used these through 3 rounds of periods now.I 'm petite , and I 've never had kids , but these fit just fine.Seriously , GIVE THESE A TRY . It is so worth the day or two learning curve .	1
Last year I posted a comment on Jessica H 's review ( the first review here ) basically thanking her for the update she posted about using the Softcup with an IUD . Finally after a year of waiting , pondering and pondering some more I tried it last night . I 'm going to be completely honest I was extremely hesitant , not about assaulting my lady parts but already having the IUD and now throwing some other foreign device in the mix . If you have an IUD you 'll remember for the first week or two your uterus would make an attempt to force your body to expel the IUD well when you use the Softcup a similar process will happen . A little background on me I have had my Paragard IUD for 3 years , I have a tilted uterus and I have had one child ( vaginal birth ) . For me it was not to difficult to insert , I got it in on the 2nd attempt making sure to secure it behind the pelvic bone , I took 2 Aleve ( to reduce the slight cramping ) and went to bed , had no problems , discomfort or leakage overnight and I had just started my period . The Softcup will mold to your body and although the company says you wo n't feel it if it 's inserted correctly but you will specifically if you have a tilted uterus even if it is inserted correctly . You will also feel it if you have a full bladder.Now here 's the fun part , I seem to hear the most horror stories about taking it out . I took Jessica H 's advice and just used a glove and used my middle finger to find the ring and I slowly pulled it forward and low and behold it came out with no problems . Once you start pulling your body will pretty much help by forcing it out . I emptied it and wrapped the glove around it and threw it away , it was not a messy or uncomfortable experience . In all honestly I think this device works fine with an IUD , however I would not try it unless you 've had an IUD for at least a year . You just do n't want to many new foreign objects in the lady parts at once.Part 2 : I am on my second day and my heaviest day and I inserted at around 6:30 am and had to change around 2:45 pm , only to have to worry about changing 1 time at work on my heaviest day is unreal for me . The only downside was I forgot my glove so needless to say it was an adventure but I was able to grab the ring and pull it out with no problems . I was pretty confident in the product and my own insertion of it that I did not use any back up and I had no leaks the entire day . I can tell when I did remove it that it worked it 's way a little further than when I inserted it which is a good thing . As it did exactly as it was supposed to do.I did lots of research ( videos , Softcup website and forums ) to read other 's experiences and what they have done and product likes/dislikes . I suggest you read the instructions enclosed and you should be fine . As with every new product things will take time to use and perfect . Personally I like it and will continue to use it and I am completely sold on a product that nearly scared me to death I now think is the best thing to happen to me .	1
Clean and Clear Face Wash really works . I really love it . It has a cool minty tingle that makes your face feel refreshed , and it really prevents pimples . In general , I have pretty clear skin and this face wash keeps it that way . I go through this product so often that I am constantly buying it . Only , I have one recommendation . Be very careful with this product . It is very strong and it will bleach your clothes and towels . This happened even when I used it in the shower . Make sure to use a white towel or a towel you do n't care about . Besides for that problem , the product works great and I am very satisfied !	1
I have been using this cleanser since my late teens . It is one of the best OTC acne medicines available , and slightly cheaper than other drugstore cleansers like Neutrogena . When used twice a day , the Clean and Clear greatly reduces the number of pimples I get . Also , it contains menthol , so it feels pleasantly tingly on skin ( but do not get it into your eyes ; it burns like the flames of he11 ! ) . There are only two drawbacks to this product : 1 ) It will dry out your skin , so wear a lotion and 2 ) The active ingredient , benzoyl peroxide , is a bleaching agent , so it will bleach fabric . I recommend using old wash cloths to wash your face and be very careful not to get it on your clothes .	1
I 've been using this for about 6 months . Before I had been using Proactive . Proactive worked great for me for a while but eventually stopped clearing up my skin so I switched to Clean and Clear Continuous Control . My skin cleared right up and stays clear other than whiteheads . The only problem is that it 's a little harsh on my skin . Usually irritates it if I leave it on but for a second . It also dries out my skin a lot . So I use it every other day . I get a couple pimples by using it every other day but it is still better than Proactive and AcneFree .	1
Helps , nothing kills acne all together . I got this for my son . I know when I had acne as a teen , I went to the dermatologist for years . It comes and goes no matter what the treatment but these products help a little . Nothing is a miracle cure no matter what the ads say . Well , age is . You really will outgrow acne where it gets to the point you might have a zit every now and then .	1
I always seem to get pimples on my chin when I stress out . Well this has always gotten rid of them for me . I do n't use it continuously but when I do the pimples go away . I love it ! I compared it to other products and this is the only product that contains 10-percent benzoyl peroxide . Other acne products usually contain .5 - 2 % Salicylic acid which for me does n't get rid of pimples .	1
I have a busy life i am in front of the cameras with hot lights and tons of make up 5-6 days a week so its inevitable that i will get acne and this stuff not only gets rid of existing acne but keeps new acne from forming its a life saver	1
I am in my mid-20 's and have had mild inflammatory acne since my early teens . Over the years I have used a number of different topical benzoyl products to keep it at bay , but none of them ever totally eliminated the problem . Then I picked up Clean & Clear Continuous Control Acne Cleanser at the grocery store , and after a few weeks of daily use I have n't had another breakout and most of my preexisting acne has healed as well ( woot ! ) .Obviously I am very happy with the results that this cleanser has produced , but to be perfectly honest I do n't really care for the product itself . It 's VERY thick , more of a paste than a liquid really , which makes it difficult to lather and rinse off . It also stings my eyes no matter how carefully I avoid getting it near them , and the menthol sometimes makes my face uncomfortably `` tingly '' and raw afterward . Moisturizing is also a definite must when using this wash because it WILL dry you out no matter how accustomed your skin already is to 10 % BP products ( but honestly , moisturizing is a good idea regardless of what cleanser you use ) .In the big picture these issues are really a small price to pay for clear skin and I have every intention of continuing to use this product , but they are irksome enough that I had to give this cleanser 4 stars instead of 5 . My recommendation is that if you can find a more pleasant face wash that works for you , get that . If you are fed up with persistent acne and are ready to pull out the heavy artillery , buy this stuff .	1
Awesome deal ! I have those red bumps on my upper arms and I use this stuff every time I shower . I slather a bunch onto my arms and let it sit for about 45 seconds and rinse with warm water . Red bumps are almost gone ! It works great on my face during a breakout too . My skin feels really clean after rinsing off .	1
This stuff is amazing ! ! when u put this on it feels kinda of like mint ! It made my skin a lot better ! i use this at night and also a little goes a long way ! ! LOVE THIS & lt ; 3	1
I was using a Murad salicylic acid cleanser before this for a while , which was okay but it did n't do much to clear the minor breakouts I had . I decided to give this a try since it was a lot cheaper than Murad . It did n't take long to notice good results , and my face was finally starting to clear up . After about a month of using it , my face is pretty much free of blemishes . I 'll still get a few occasionally ranging from minor to large and painful ones , however it 's usually if I skip washing my face at night . I 've gotten a lot of compliments about my clear complexion.However , the only downside is that it can be fairly irritating to my face , specially if I use a little too much . My skin will be somewhat red and have a slight burning sensation after I wash my face . Which I was n't too shocked to experience , I do have pretty sensitive skin . I 'm thinking about alternating using this cleanser with a more gentle cleanser . Bottom line , if you have mild-moderate acne and your skin is n't too sensitive , this product will most likely work for you . Definitely ca n't beat the price	1
I dug this stuff out from under my cabinet ... I had vowed never to use Clean and Clear again after my disaster breakout with the blackhead cleanser . But since this had no beads to irritate my skin , I decided to give it a try and it really worked ! ! 2 days after putting it on once or twice daily , I could see breakouts that were starting to come had faded , and my blackheads were actually disappearing from my nose ! There 's a little bit of a stingy feeling , and if you get it in your eyes it hurts like a bitch , and your face is pretty red afterward , I 'm assuming from the chemical contents . But it makes your skin smooth as a baby 's bottom if you use it everyday , so your skin has a daily regimen and can fight breakouts . I highly recommend and will be back to buy more & lt ; 3 I 'm a 15 year old girl if that helps .	1
Left this on longer than the 30 seconds and felt I had better results . It 's a great cleanser , although it stings a bit . I think the fact that this cleanser has menthol makes it great , as menthol is known to reduce acne inflammation . It did n't get rid of acne but it definitely helped reduce outbreaks .	1
It was amazing to see my hormonal acne around my mouth disappear . It feels like I 've tried everything to get rid of it , even taking pills before . Nothing seemed to work until I decided to give this a try . It has n't worked for the acne in my tzone , but I 'll be buying Nature 's Cure acne system to see if that helps .	1
I just got this product and I still think it is too soon before I can accurately give an accurate review on what it has done for my skin . But I can say I LOVE the Vanishing Cream . This is the ONLY product I have ever put on my face that is completely scentless . So many products have claimed to be scentless yet have a weird smell . This product is super hydrating ( shocking ) considering this product contains acne medication that is known to dry out the skin .	1
In the last year or so my acne has gotten out of control , I do n't know if it 's hormones or what but changing my diet and excerise routine did n't help so I 've been trying different products . Nothing worked , Proactive , any of the drug store brand of washes/cleansers/systems . I remembered that I had used this awhile back but had to stop because it severely dried out my skin . I decided to try it out again . It 's only been 4 days and my acne is almost completely gone and what is left looks like it will be gone soon and no new break outs . I 'm using this with Garnier gel-cream moisturizer and so far it seems to be helping to keep the Vanishing cream that comes in this package from drying out my skin . As for the pills , I was worried they 'd taste horrible ( you 're supposed to chew them ) but they 're not even chalky and do n't taste like anything . For the price it is , it definitely was worth trying again . I sincerely hopes this works for you too .	1
I have a hormone imbalance and tend to get acne and a lot of oil production , I take this along with spironolactone , but ever since I started taking this along side with the spironolactone I have noticed a big difference , the bp/aloe vera cream is exactly what I needed not top drying ! will continue to order	1
This cream/gel does not seem to cause my skin to peel . Love that . I can usually see results overnight . I do n't really take the pills but have in the past and they seemed to be soothing - a little like resolving acid in the system . I do n't know that 's what they do , but , they do seem soothing .	1
This treatment has being really efective . My teenager girl was struggling with acne and tried lot of things , with no results . These tablets are doing its work and the topic cream is the best she has ever had .	1
I 'm a female that gets hormonal acne ... the kind of massive cyst that lasts 2-3 weeks ! I started using Nature 's Cure about 2 years ago because I was desperate . Well , within a couple of months , I really noticed a difference ! The pills are amazing . They really cut down on the cystic acne I get , and the cream that is included is great too . I feel it 's not as harsh as some other benzoyl peroxide creams , because it does n't dry me out as badly ( but if you use it regularly , use a moisturizer or jojoba oil 15 minutes after applying the cream so that your skin does n't dry out ) . Used in combination , my skin is clear ! I got lazy and stopped using this for a about 3 months , thinking my skin was going to stay clear , but my cysts came back , so this really is the thing that is helping me . It 's reasonably priced and I have a *very* sensitive stomach , and the pills have not upset my tummy at all . Overall , a wonderful product to try , just give it about 3 months to fully see results .	1
This product is not sold in the stores anymore as far as I can tell . I like it because the cream is not too strong , nor is it too gentle and the pills really work . I find I get less pimples , even during that time of the month , when I take them .	1
If you are looking for an acne treatment , definitely try this . It 's reasonably priced and has been very effective in our house .	1
This is the only thing that will keep my acne away ! I love this product so much . I have tried SO MANY products to help with my acne but this tops them all . I stopped using this and tried taking Zinc for acne but it made my acne worse . I will never make the same mistake and stick with what works . Thank you Nature 's Cure ! : D	1
Yeah , so I randomly started breaking out on my chin and under my nose after not having to worry about acne for the last 10+ years . Still do n't know what is going on - but I think I have been using this cream and taking the pill ( chewing it , as it suggests ) for 4 days now , and the acne I had is gone or totally & # 34 ; dried out & # 34 ; and on it 's way to being gone . And when I say dried out , I do not mean my skin is dry ... the zits are just shrunken down . No new break-outs.To help you decide if this is for you : -I am 28 , had acne as a teenager , and barely any since ( until now for some reason ) .-I have an only T-zone ( combination skin ) .-The amount of acne that diminished within the last 4-5 days was mild/moderate ; I would say I had a tiny cluster of zits , one big one , and a few other random tiny ones in my lower T-zone area.-My skin has not been dry or oily from the cream.-The pill is chewable and does n't really taste like anything ; has the consistency of Tums ( chalky ) but much smaller.-The pill is to be taken twice daily.-I have not been using anything but face wash in combination with the cream ( I use Earth Science gentle exfoliating scrub ) .I am always skeptical of things that get good reviews because for some reason they always end up not being as awesome as people say - but I am very pleased with this product . I will continue to buy as long as my skin is being a pain in the butt .	1
This stuff works great . it is well worth the money . I works better than proactive has worked for me and cheaper	1
I 've been using this for acne for about 7 years , it is great . It makes all my acne go away and it is completely inexpensive . The only bad thing is that it bleaches some of my clothes and pillow cases so I only wear it when I 'm at home and have something white on or something that I do n't mind if it gets stained . But overall it works great !	1
I have had acne when I was a teenager of course I went to the doctor and got creams for it . I wish they had this 15 years ago . The teenager acne went away over the years and I never really had a problem with it again . I 'm till about three months ago when my mother suddenly passed away . Flying overseas to see my family ( we are a family and I am German ) And all the stress and helping them with the funeral and everything , plus the time difference , bad food -everything ..took it 's toll on my skin.When we got back about a couple of days later I got the bill my skin broke out like I have never seen it before . It was worse than when I was a teenager and I 'm 30 years old.For as long as I can remember I have always I cleaned my face every day with `` clean & clear `` facial cleaner and I put acne spot treatment on pimples that just show up like everybody has them . Of course when I am close to getting my periode its worse . But I have never had it like this ! I had him on the temples of my head and my forehead and under my chin and on my jawbone . Also someone my cheeks , chest area and back..My husband had tried out Proactive the year before and I have tried it sometimes on my skin . but I have to say it always dried my skin out and burned and did n't really help . I sent it back and told them I am done.So when I have to outbreak I had no idea what to do . so I look on Amazon and read through a couple of things and I saw this and ordered it . because I thought I have nothing to loose.I took it and within two weeks my skin cleared up and of course I changed my eating habits again to my normal diet plan . But this really really helped ! ! felt that the cream also made a big difference in that and if you follow with it it really changes something in your body . After another week my acne was pretty much gone . Even when I 'm close or having my period My skin has less pimples than before ! I did n't even show any more than that iam on my periode ! My skin stays clear all month long and I will be reordering because I am done now with my 60 day pack.I have never seen anything this effective and I like I said you should try it . for $ 13 you have nothing to lose but only to gain clear skin.On a side note : I also bought the `` clearzine '' u can buy on Amazon too and took that the first week as well additionally to the natures cure . I think it made a big difference too but for the price it 's a little bit too expensive but like I said I was desperate.Also I bought the acne spray from natures plus for my back . Again for the price a little bit too expensive .I have to say you can also use any facial cleaner and rub down your neck if you have a partner or boyfriend to do it for you . If not the spray is perfect because you can use it on any angle .	1
this is one of my all time favorite products . It really evens out your skin tone and makes your skin glow ! I use it at night before I go to bed and when I go to apply my makeup in the morning after my shower you can really see how even this stuff has made my skin appear . I 'm 34 with no wrinkles and a few fine lines and I guess I had uneven skin tone because this stuff will make your skin looking absolutely amazing ! fast absorbent , no smell - great results !	1
Perfect amount of moisturizer , my skin is normal but I just felt like I needed a little bit of moisture so I tried this and it is the perfect amount . Not greasy , not too moisturizing ... just the PERFECT amount . I use it at night after I wash my face and in the morning after a shower with a sunscreen and it 's great . I will be ordering more when I get low on this and you do n't need much . GREAT BUY ! ! ! !	1
This product is not heavy and absorbs quickly into the skin - with no oily reside . After only a couple of weeks I can see a major difference !	1
Any product by this company is a winner . I have aging skin , well , I guess we all do , but , these products have reduced my fine lines and wrinkles , immensely . Be sure to purchase the under eye , lip cream . I am happy !	1
Skin feels softer and looks healthier . Was having a problem with using products that were breaking me out . This is not breaking me out . Will continue to purchase . Thanks !	1
This stuff is nice and moisturizing yet does n't feel heavy or greasy . I am acne prone and this has not broken me out . I use a glycolic acid peel and I use this as my moisturizer after for a few days . Keeps my skin nice and moist . Great price , will purchase again .	1
I 've only recently started incorporating toner into my facial cleansing program , but this is my favorite that I 've tried so far . This toner leaves my face feeling very clean , yet soft ( not tight or itchy ) , plus it has the benefits of an Alpha and Beta hydroxy . It really does help keep my pores cleaner , and therefore smaller over time . I find it to be perfect for my combination/oily skin , but for those with dry or sensitive skin the alcohol might be irritating or overly drying .	1
I have been looking for a product to help reduce the apperance of the pores on my cheeks . This stuff is awesome ! I noticed a difference within a week . I have gotten compliments that my skin looks the best it has in a long time ! I highly recommend giving it a try . I use it with the daily face wash. Will continue to use !	1
this product has been really suitable for my skin type . it helps me look brighter when used it for one week staright	1
I have used this product for a couple years . It exfoliates without drying out the skin . One tube lasts a long time , too . It is far less expensive than department store brands and just as good .	1
I did n't expect my pores to magically disappear , but I notice they truly do lessen immediately after using this product . What 's better is that my skin has cleared since I started using this : I used to get occasional breakouts , but now , that rarely happens . I 'd recommend using this before a nice occasion with a pore tightening moisturizer , and your pores will be out of sight for a few hours at least .	1
I purchased the Neutrogena Pore Refining Toner and was pleased that it did not sting and was not drying to my skin . My pores do appear to be smaller and my skin looks smoother . In the past , I have used toners that made my skin turn red and irritated , but after four weeks of using this product have not had this problem . This product is reasonably priced so I can afford it . I plan to continue using this product .	1
I have somewhat large pores , so I was really hoping this would help . I use it once a day and it immediately shrinks and clears them out considerably , though they get bad again the next day . Overall though , I 've seen an improvement in my complexion , so I 'd highly recommend this even though it 's not magic .	1
I love this stuff . It cleans your skin very thoroughly and leaves it very soft . I love the smell too ! Overall I 'm very please with this and will continue to buy .	1
I buy this because my pores are huge . Always have been . This product visibly reduces them . It 's a bit alcohol-ly . It stings when it gets close to your eyes . But I like the product .	1
I am a huge fan of most Neutrogena products , as they are generally very gentle for my somewhat sensitive skin . This toner is refreshing , and seems to pair nicely into my routine . It does appear to be mildly pore refining , but it 's a miracle worker . It 's just a great toner for a 20 something with relatively nice combination skin . I use it daily and it has n't ever given me any problems .	1
I always use a toner and have been sticking to the same one for a few years now that I love , but this was on sale and decided to try it because my skin tends to really like AHAs and BHAs.Pros : * Makes skin super soft . * Does n't dry skin out despite the pretty high alcohol content . * Did n't cause any redness or ittitation to my relatively sensitive skin . * Did n't break me out like some do upon first using them . * Could see the residue my cleanser left behind on the cotton square letting me know my face is clean.Cons : * Not convinced it did anything to shrink the appearance of my pores ( mine are n't a huge deal to me and I did n't buy it for that , but do n't expect it to perform miracles if you have large pores ) . * Pretty high alcohol content which I like to try and avoid for the most part ( at least ones that have alot of alcohol in it ; a little is ok for me ) . * Seemed to cause my already oily skin to be shinier . I 'm used to an oil controlling toner that keeps the shine on my forehead at bay whereas this did not control oil for me beyond an hour or so ( but it does not claim to be oil controlling and is most likely due to the high alcohol content that can make skin produce more oil ) .All-in-all , good toner for what it 's designed for . I would repurchase again . I 'm now using this as my nighttime toner or on days where i 'm not going anywhere where I wo n't need my forehead to remain shine-free . Your results may vary depending on the sensitivity and type of skin . For mine , there has been no adverse effects and I feel it does a pretty good job of leaving it clean and toned . Hope this helps .	1
I use this toner every night after I wash my face . I 've been using it for several months now and I see such a difference in my skin . My pores look smaller and my skin even looks a little less red ! My skin is clearer and just looks brighter . My skin is more on the dry side and I do n't find this toner drying at all . I always moisturize after the toner had completely soaked into my skin and it 's worked well for me . My skin is also on the sensitive side and this has n't irritated my skin at all . As soon as I run out , I will purchase this product again , because I love it so much !	1
This has always been my favorite face cleaner . Its been harder and harder to find . The only problem I have is the price . Too expensive so I may have to change to another product .	1
I really have n't noticed much of a difference in pore size from using this product alone , though other products in the Pore Refining line work really well to this effect . What I love about this toner , though is that it does n't dry out my skin at all , and it leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth . I do get fewer blackheads and blemishes when I use this product . Recommended .	1
The cleanser makes my face feel really clean after I use it and helps get rid of the oil and dirt in my pores . I have n't been using it long enough to see if it really reduces the size of my pores , but I trust Neutrogena products , so I 'm hoping this particular Neutrogena product will live up to its name .	1
I 've been using this toner for a few days now , but after 2-3 uses I 've noticed a difference in the the size of my pores . They shrink after a moment or two after putting it on , but the effects do n't last after I wash my face . I probably need to use it for a while longer like other people have said before I notice a somewhat permanent result.On the other hand , it successfully removes a lot of dirt that 's been clogging my pores ! I can see all of it on the cotton pad and I 'm surprised by how much junk is left on my skin after using my cleanser.I do have a problem with the smell . It 's probably because of the alcohol in the product that 's making it a little too strong for my taste . The alcohol also stung my skin the first use , but it 's gotten significantly better . Does not dry my skin out at all.I use it mainly in the morning before I head out and during the day when I need a pick me up for my skin ( : Overall I give this toner 4 stars ! Recommended for oily skin ( I see less oil on days that I use this toner )	1
I purchased this after reading reviews on multiple sites and seeing this toner ranked as one of the best when it comes to drug store brands.I 've been using this every night for three weeks ( I 've skipped it by accident roughly 4 times ) and my skin is noticeably clearer . Within a few days I noticed some of my trouble areas looked better and while the clearing process has been slow its noticeable and the progress steady . I also have n't seen a `` new '' blemish since adding this to my regimen.It has n't done much for blackheads so a few days ago I purchased an exfoliant to address that issue around my nose.Overall I am very happy and will likely repurchase this when it runs out .	1
I have been trying to find a toner that is n't as harsh on the skin . Came upon this one and gave it a try . Must say its the best toner I have gotten . Smells wonderful not a harsh chemical nasty smell , smells floral but clean . Leaves my face beautiful rarely have to put lotion on after and thats rare for my dry skin . Skin is smoother and I feel like its more even . A must have !	1
I 've used this product about 6 times since it arrived and I love it ! I was already using a toner after washing so I thought my face was clean ... ... until I used this toner . I never knew there was so much dirt and residue on my face after I washed it . This is really great stuff ; does what it says and the price is excellent . Now watch them stop making it ( as soon as I find something I like they always do : - )	1
Love the feel and smell of it when you first open the bottle and with the cleanser and toner my face seems to be getting back to the ph level for nice skin . Highly recommend	1
Love the way it leaves my skin , smooth and clean for me this is the best one I 've tried . Also purchased & # 34 ; Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub & # 34 ; did n't like the feeling it left on my skin . But this one is great and for me much better than any I have tried .	1
Neutrogena 's Pore Refining Cleanser is actually a wonderful 1 Step Cleanse/Exfoliate/Refine product that is perfect for traveling . Why take three products when one will work very well . In fact , my husband brought this product home when I asked him to buy me a similar product and I 'm even more impressed with the Alpha and Beta Hydroxy Formula than any of the formulas with Benzoyl Peroxide.While I 'm only testing this product at home , studies have shown that a combination of glycolic and salicylic acid is more effective than benzoyl peroxide . I read about it after I tried this product so my short time of personal experience proved the study was quite correct . Glycolic Acid is also found in many products sold to you by your Esthetician and it is known for stimulating collagen and elastin . It will even help to reduce acne scars and will keep dead skin cells from building up inside the hair follicles . Glycolic will also help the skin not to grow over the pores and so it prevents ingrown hairs . This product will be especially enjoyed by men who shave . Women will enjoy this product as it may prevent hormonal breakouts.This product contains `` Glycolic Acid '' which seems to prevent problems and is derived from fruit , whereas Benzoyl Peroxide has to fix the problems caused by a lack of exfoliation . So , using a product with Glycolic Acid seems to keep my skin exfoliated . While there are gentle microbeads , you do n't really feel them and this is much more like a facial gel wash than an abrasive cleanser.This product impressed me so much I even sent a tube to a friend in the mail . Not something I 'd normally do unless I was very impressed.For even better results , try a cream with Glycolic Acid or look for Vital Sciences Glycolic Liquid Exfoliator or Skin Eternal DMAE Serum . There are also quite a few Glycolic moisturizers for face and body from Peter Thomas Roth and Reviva . I also love the Derma E Glycolic Facial Cleanser.If you use a product with Glycolic Acid and one of the Derma E skin care creams or the Kiss My Face Under Age Organic Moisturizer , you should notice a much clearer complexion.Other essentials include : Derma E Tea Tree and E oilKiss My Face Acne GelAroma Land Problem Skin Blend - Essential oilDerma E Alpha Lipoderm with Green TeaDerma E Age-Defying Day CremeDerma E Clear Skin 2D'Arcy Drying LotionZia Sulphur MaskZia Papaya PeelDerma E Microdermabrasion ScrubJoey Pure Pores~The Rebecca Review	1
I do n't know much about beauty products but I 've been using this for a while . I 'm confident that it is working well .	1
I would order this product again . It does exactly as stated and I have sensitive skin , so do not be worried if that is a concern .	1
I use this approximately every other day due to the drying it causes but after a week or so , my pores were visibly reduced , not gone just not as noticeable . Just a splash on a cotton square and I go in upwards motions after my morning face wash and before I moisturize . I will continue to use but will not use everyday as my skin is prone to dryness . It worked in all areas of my face , my nose and forehead were most noticeable to me and now they are much smaller . Recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to reduce size of large pores .	1
My skin is pretty oily and the pores are larger than I 'd like . After using this cleanser for 3 months or so , I do notice a difference.Texture was what I picked up on the first time I used it . It is pretty thick , and the beads are definitely micro . It did n't feel real grainy , which I liked . A little goes a long way , and since this tube is so big it should last a while . I have n't even used a quarter of mine yet.I use this along with Origins Zero Oil Moisturizer and Origins Clear Improvements Charcoal Mask . I found them to be pretty effective at making my pores look smaller , cleaner and less overall oil production . It has a really good price point . Many a department store cleansers can cost 3-4X as much.It does work over time , so do n't expect to see much difference in the beginning . I will buy it again and continue my routine . I 've seen good improvement in the last few months .	1
I was surprised that it did so well . I guess I should n't have been . After all it is a Neutrogena product !	1
Neutrogena produces the best beauty and health products without a doubt . This product has worked wonders for my skin . I will continue to use it for a long time .	1
I am prone to breakouts and have tried Proactiv - which does work but it is too expensive for me to keep using , especially since my problem is hormonal/occasional . This product fits my needs perfectly . Whenever I see or feel a pimple coming on , I just take a Q-tip immersed in this astringent and clean that area - and that area only . I try not to wipe my whole face with it because it is drying . Last month my whole upper chest/neck area broke out for some reason . That was when I diligently wiped that area 2x a day , morning & night . Took care of the problem immediately .	1
I liked Neutrogena 's Blackhead Eliminating Astringent better . This stuff is very effective , but it does n't smell half as good or leave my face feeling wonderful like the Blackhead Eliminating Astringent . That said , I 'll probably continue buying this product because 1 ) it works well , despite the strong odor and 2 ) I believe Blackhead Eliminating Astringent has been discontinued by Neutrogena .	1
I 've tried other astringents , and this one is the perfect balance of effective cleansing without overdrying . Those who use this product alone probably do not get great results , but this is designed to be part of a skincare regimen , including moisturizing . I use a mild face wash , then I use this astringent to help remove any makeup that did not get removed by the face wash ( makeup remover gives me breakouts ) . After that , I use Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish lotion . It 's a very simple regimen , but extremely effective . I 've tried other astringents in the same regimen , but they dried out my skin and had noticeably higher alcohol content , likely the cause of the over-drying .	1
I continue to use Neutrogena Clear Pore Oil Eliminating Astringent because it works . The only problem that I had with this purchase is that it leaked in the mail . Fortunately , it was wrapped in plastic and the loss was minimal but it was disappointing not to receive the full amount of liquid .	1
I used to be a big fan of those Proactiv-style kits that contained multiple products ( i.e . cleanser , toner , lotion ) . But I always used the products at different rates , and ended up having to purchase new kits to replace one product when I still had a whole bunch of the other products left . I did n't have much choice but to throw some perfectly good products away , and this made me feel like I was n't getting a good deal for my money.I decided to start buying skin care lotions , cleansers , etc. , separately . I knew I wanted at least one of the items to contain salicylic acid as the active ingredient , so I chose this toner ( which has 2 % salicylic acid ) . I 'm happy enough with it that I will buy more when my current bottle runs out.This toner gives my face that extra clean feeling that washing/cleansing alone ca n't , and I do believe it cuts down on oil . I do n't think it dries out my skin ( although I am also using a moisturizer ) , and it does n't cause any sort of reaction , even though I have sensitive skin . It also works well as a second-pass makeup remover . I wear a Neutrogena foundation that is a bit difficult to remove , and this toner really seems to help get those last traces off that washing has left behind ( judging by the appearance of the cotton pad I use to apply the toner , at any rate ) .The only drawback I see is that this toner has some fumes ( possibly because it contains a large amount of alcohol ) . This sometimes makes my eyes water a little bit . ( I do n't get it in my eyes , but just getting it near my eyes is enough . ) Update : after using this for a few months , I do n't notice this effect any longer.My preferred method of applying : pour a little on a cotton pad ( dispensing is easy to control , by the way ) and wipe it over my face . I do this twice a day ; I 've been doing so for close to six months now , and my skin has never looked better . Pair this with a good moisturizer so the alcohol is n't drying .	1
I am 21 and have had combo skin for years and years , dry in the morning , oily throughout the day ! i love this product though ! i use it on my face every morning when my skin is a bit flakey , and it makes my skin so soft ! my moisturizer goes on smoothly finally ! a bottle lasts a long time , i very rarely break out , and i have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil on my face at the end of the day ! i still have some but much less ! my only complaint is that it does nothing for blackheads , i still have those ...	1
This is an excellent astringent , I had my doubts with products touting `` oil eliminating '' , `` oil free '' as they never seemed to work . This product does exactly what it 's supposed to . The smell is similar to theNeutrogena Clear Pore Scruband it does not burn like some astringents do . I follow this with theNeutrogena Visibly Even Daily Moisturizer , SPF 30in the morning . I consider this product my `` holy grail '' in my skin care regimen . I kills the bacteria without killing my skin cells . It 's an excellent product .	1
This is the best pore cleaner . Look who makes it . All there products are wonderful and will not ever change . I would recommend .	1
Works really well . For me almost to well as if i forget to wash my hands with regular soap after my hands start to peel after using for a month . It clears my skin up when it gets a little rough in the hot summer .	1
Daily used in the shower . I also use it on my face . Love the scent , and it helps to control my acne-prone skin . It does not make my skin sensitive .	1
I use Neutrogena Body Clear in lieu of other shower gel or soap rather than in combination with it . One thing I like about it is it takes much less of this scrub to be as effective as larger quantities some other body washes I 've used - one bottle lasts several months for me . It is also much harder to squeeze out of the bottle . Once you get down to the end of the bottle , you have to pry off the cap to get it out - not exactly convenient . The odor is a little bit too sterile for my tastes , but it seems effective as an exfoliator and leaves me feeling clean . While it has n't really combatted my minor body acne/KP that I can tell , it has kept it under control . I have n't found anything better in effectiveness or bang-for-buck in terms of shower gel or bar soap . I recommend it .	1
Neutrogena Body Clear body wash cleared up my back acne in just a few weeks.For years I 've been fighting the occasional breakout on my back . The incidents were never particularly bad , but every once in a while I would get small clusters of about 5-10 small pimples on my back . In the winter my skin would be dry and they would occur on my shoulders , and in summer they would occur on the sides of my back when I sweat a little . I 've been using Persa-Gel 10 on them , and while it helped a little it would take a long time for them to clear up completely.So on a whim I decided to try this body wash and I 'm glad I did . The Neutrogena Body Clear got rid of all of my back acne within about three weeks time . My back looks great , and I do n't see any new pimples forming . The thing that surprised me most about this body wash is that it does not dry out my sensitive skin at all . In fact , when rinsing it off in the shower , I feel like my skin gets softer . The body wash has a very slight fragrance , which to me smells like baby shampoo . The bottle is smaller than regular body wash , but a little bit goes a long way , and lathers up very nicely . I apply it with a plastic mesh sponge poof.All in all ... I 'm very happy I gave it a try ; it was just what I needed for my mild back acne .	1
This is the only body wash that has cleared up my skin . My breakouts are slowly going away . I have used this for two months now . I plan on to buy more . It smells great too . : D	1
This stuff works.I have been searching for a good body wash that would n't tear my shoulders up , and I 've finally found it ! I could tell from the first couple washes that it was a keeper ! I 've been using this product for about 3 weeks , and I 'm currently sporting acne-free shoulders ( save scars ) for the first time in YEARS.And as the bottle says , you do n't have to sacrifice an enjoyable shower with this ! It lathers very well & smells good.I suggest you try it !	1
Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash for Clean , Clear Skin , 8.5 Ounce works in the shower for clean , clear skin all over your body . It is good for those who do not have dry skin .	1
I am a hormonally challenged female and have been suffering from bacne lately , though it is n't typical . I decided to go ahead and try this body wash to see if it would help . What do you know -- just a day later and it was working quite well ! I still have little blackheads , but no more big , really noticeable zits . I combined it with a really great exfoliating loofah and the skin on my back has gotten much better . It does smell pretty gross though - my husband thought he smelled something rank this morning in the shower , but I told him it was probably the body wash and when he sniffed it he confirmed . If you can deal with the smelliness while you 're washing then it 's worth it . I do n't find that it leaves a residual smell at all .	1
I unfortunately forgot that I was allergic to neutrogena products and had ordered and used and broke out in a rash , but if not for that I would have loved this product . The smell is nice and it is a nice thick consistency that leaves you feeling nice and clean/refreshed .	1
After using this for a week or two , I noticed some improvement in my & # 34 ; backne & # 34 ; . Its not great , but it still is a good cleanser for your back and it helps enough for the price I paid .	1
I have had a really hard time finding an acne cleaning body wash that I like . They either smell terrible or leave my skin feeling filmy . For me this is the second best smelling one out there . It could , however , do without the silly little pink beads in the soap.I prefer Neutrogena 's Stress Control Body Wash for scent but I have a hard time finding it . It seems to be gentler as well . This , however , is really the only substitution if you ca n't find the Stress one .	1
I do not know how it works but it does work ! After showed with this for 2-3 times , the pimples on my back disappeared .	1
I use this to treat breakouts on my arms , chest and back . Using it once - twice a day has eliminated it completely . Be sure to pair with a good moisturizer that suites your skin type .	1
I used to break out on my back ( esp . since I have very long hair ) and ever since I started using this body wash my back really has cleared up .	1
I 've used this product for several years , and I love it . It smalles wonderful , it rinses clean , unlike some other body washes that I 've used that leave residue . It 's also not too drying , which is good , because my skin dries out really easily.During the summer , though , I tend to get blemishes on my shoulders and chest , and I 've switched to the Neutrogena Body Scrub , which I find deals with acne a little better . It comes in an identical bottle to this , and has some exfoliating beads in it as well . If you do n't have to wory about bodily acne , this is a great product .	1
i bought this for the summer and to use after a workout . omg its great it smells nice , doesnt make my skin dry , and deeply cleans my body after a workout and being out all day . i love that it comes in packs of 3. i gave one to my sister and she loves it too.great product i love neutrogena	1
I hate that this product is difficult to find . I love the smell and it does a a decent job of keeping my skin clear . I know that other reviews say it does n't work as well as the original , but the smell of the original is just to medical for me . I love this stuff and will use it forever .	1
I 've been using this wash for years since I have sensitive skins and my back breaks out bad . I use to use the regular wash but when the grapefruit scent came out , I 've been hooked . I love the fresh scent of grapefruit which is a great smell to help wake you up in the shower in the morning . Also , as I 've been using Neutrogena since I was a teenager ( like 15 years now ) ... I am a huge fan of this wash and works great ! I rarely break out and I attribute it to Neutrogena . The price on Amazon is comparatively priced to my local box stores but I have Prime so it 's a nice now to able to buy and have shipped directly to my house without having to make a special trip to the boxed stores . Thanks Amazon !	1
I use this scrub in the shower on the backs of my upper arms and it works well when I follow it with Salex , a prescription lotion . There is a foaming ingredient in it that helps it stay in place while you massage the skin . A lot of scrubs do n't have anything like that and end up in `` plops '' on the shower floor . Price is reasonable and it lasts a long time for me .	1
This actually helps with the acne I got on my back . I highly recommend it . I no longer have back acne or bumps.This body wash and loofah does magic !	1
* The Neutrogena Cleanser worked fine , but I found it a little to strong for my skin , would like to try the Aloe version* My Boyfriend likes it for the acne he gets on his back* A great buy for the price !	1
Good-Smells greatHelps to clear acneGoes a long wayBad-Does dry out skinI would recommend using it maybe every other day	1
I have been purchasing this from walmart , but I live 35 minutes away from it , and these are rather small bottles . So technically this is a pricier bodywash , there are many others that are more affordable I am sure , I just have n't found them yet ! However , as a mom of 3 , I still get occasional breakouts on my back and chest , but what mostly drives me crazy are the bumps . I have a mild case of Keratosis Pilaris ( small white or red bumps , on backs of arms , legs , knees and elbows ) and a aggravating fight with ingrown hairs on my legs ... Since I started using this , ( about 2 months ) I have not had one breakout and my keratosis is almost completely gone , as is the ingrown hairs . My legs have n't felt this 'bump-free ' since high school ! I use this in conjunction with my clarisonic pro , so maybe it is a combination of the two , but I am hooked for sure . Some people have said that it dries their skin out , I just be sure to coat myself in a good lotion after I scrub and I have n't noticed any drying .	1
It dries out skin quickly especially if you 're living in an area where there is low humidity . Works on face as well .	1
I 've used this product , and the plain , non-grapefruit smelling kind , on and off since Junior High . I have never had super bad body acne but every once and awhile ( especially when I 'm more active or playing sports ) I 'll have issues on my back between the shoulder blades where a sweaty sports bra rests . This soap keeps me in check . Squish some onto a back scrubbing sponge and go for it . The grapefruit smell is also nice .	1
This works , but if I stop using it my bacne comes back again =/It smells great and if you keep using it , it actually will work !	1
This body scrub is really good . It 's a little on the pricey side but the lather makes a little bit go a long way . For an acne scrub , the lather is amazing , and the scent is not overpowering or harsh . It 's a very light , neutral scent . After only about 4 days of use , I 've noticed that tiny bumps on my neck , back , and shoulders are gone or nearly gone . I initially bought this scrub because I thought it would help clear up the marks my acne left behind so hopefully with continued use the acne scars will be less visible . The skin smoothing has been a welcomed surprised . I plan on using this scrub in conjunction with vitamin e oil so that my skin is completely clear of marks and blemishes.My only complaint is that it makes the skin on my back and shoulders a little dry , but nothing that a little moisturizing oil and lotion wo n't fix . I would give it 5 stars if it were n't for that though . If you have really sensitive or dry skin this may irritate . I would recommend a thick moisturizer or lotion after showering to alleviate this . I would recommend this product again .	1
The beads make you feel super clean and the scent is really addicting . Depending on your climate , it can dry out your skin .	1
I usually have sensitive skin ; one of the few scented products I can still use is body wash ( probably because you rinse it off right after you apply it ) . I do n't really have issues with body acne , and never have , but I did have some issues with the appearance of the skin on my upper arms . I figured a body wash of this type would be less likely to aggravate the skin , and might actually lead to an improvement in my skin 's appearance ( for example , by killing bacteria on the skin 's surface ) . First I tried the regular ( orange-colored and unscented ) Neutrogena Body Clear wash and it did n't really do all that much for me . The grapefruit wash was a different story . In combination with some Amlactin body lotion , this stuff has made a huge difference in the appearance of the skin on my upper arms.I happen to like the fragrance , although I understand that 's going to differ from person to person . ( If you want to know what your own reaction will be , go sniff some in a drugstore before buying ! ) Because this does contain some plant extracts , colors , and fragrances , it may not be ideal for people who have reacted to other products with the same ingredients ( listed below for reference ) : Active Ingredients : Salicylic Acid ( 2 % ) ( Acne Treatment ) Inactive Ingredients : Water , Sodium C14 16 Olefin Sulfonate , Glycerin , Cocamidopropyl Betaine , Acrylates Crosspolymer , Cocamidopropyl PG-Dimonium Chloride Phosphate , Polyquaternium 7 , Citrus Grandis ( Grapefruit ) Fruit Extract , Anthemis Nobilis ( Roman Chamomile ) Flower Extract , Camellia Sinensis ( Green Tea ) Leaf Extract , Carrageenan ( Chondrus Crispus ) , Agar , Neopentyl Glycol Dicaprylate/Dicaprate , Ascorbyl Palmitate ( Vitamin C ) , Propylene Glycol , C12 15 Alkyl Lactate , Polysorbate 20 , Alumina , Butylene Glycol , Polyvinyl Alcohol , Disodium EDTA , Sodium Chloride , Sodium Hydroxide , Benzalkonium Chloride Solution , Sodium Benzotriazole Butylphenol Sulfonate , Titanium Dioxide , Iron Oxides , Red 30 ( CI 73360 ) , Red 40 Lake ( CI 16035 ) , Violet 2 , Mica , FragranceSome of the negative reviews have me puzzled . While I do n't dispute that someone might have an allergy to one of the ingredients or a sensitivity to salicylic acid , I 'd like to set the record straight about a couple of things.First , this is a body wash and should be treated as such . This means washing it off in the shower or bath after applying it ( and not leaving it on and letting it dry ) . It is not a spray or a cream . It does not contain any ingredients that cause bleaching effects ( I have a PhD in biochemistry and write patent applications for a living so I am familiar with the ingredients and what they do ) . It is not difficult to get the last portion out of the container ; simply store the container upside down when you are getting near the end.At any rate , I am quite happy with this body wash as it is having the intended effect in my case . I will purchase more when my current bottle is used up .	1
Love the smell of this . I ca n't say about its effectiveness , but I would think it is pretty good ( not miraculous ) . Just buy it for the smell if you 're in doubt .	1
I used to have acnes all over my back since I have really oily skin , but after using this there are only a few left . It is also very easy to wash off and have a really nice smell .	1
Great after a day in the sun or everyday use .	1
This lotion makes my skin tone look amazing , almost like a glow . It does appear to even out tone and fade dark marks . However , it takes a while to absorb I guess because when I first put it on , it feels like it 's just sitting on my face . A little does not go a very long way with this product . I still love the way it makes my skin look though .	1
Sometime a little more help is needed than a lotion offers - that 's where this Creme comes in . It 's especially beneficial for those with dry skin or delightful ladies of & quot ; a certain age. & quot ; Jason was one of the first natural personal care companies to manufacture Ester-C products , and they 've been doing it ever since . The Ester-C line offers a natural type of Vitamin C that helps skin form and maintain collagen thus serving to discourage fine lines and wrinkles .	1
I have tried numerous face creams , moisturizers but Jason 's product is excellent . It provides long lasting moisture to my skin , smells great , and I see a difference as far as minimizing fine lines This is a subscribe and save product for me .	1
I have tried other creams and keep coming back to this one.Nice Moisturizer ! I read some recent reviews saying theydid n't like the NEW upgraded version ... .but I assure you ... itis the same and does not have any weird odor ? ? I still love it !	1
This cream is so moisturizing , and creamy . I use it on my face , neck , and d & eacute ; colletage . It helps to soften the lines .	1
When buying skin care products lately , I 'm selecting items with antiaging ingredients . That would be a variety of antioxidants and healing herbal ingredients . This product has an impressive list.Ingredients : Aqua ( Purified Soft Water ) , Anthemus Nobilis ( Chamomile Extract ) , Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis ( Almond Oil ) , Helianthus Annuus ( Sunflower Oil ) , Glycine Soja ( Soybean Oil ) , Glycerin ( Vege ) , Ester-C Liquid ( Vitamin C ) , Stearyl Alcohol , Aloe Barbadensis Gel , Glyceryl Stearate , Symphytum Officinale ( Comfrey Extract ) , Stearic Acid , Dimethicone , Pinus Palustris ( Pine Needle Extract ) , Persea Gratissima ( Avocado Oil ) , Panthenol ( Vitamin B ) , Allantoin , Potassium Stearate , Retinyl Palmitate ( Vitamin A ) , Alpha-Bisabolol , Oxybenzone , Tocopherol Linoleate ( Vitamin E ) , Methylparaben , Beta-Carotene , Super Oxide Dismutase Liposome , Propylparaben , Tocopherol ( Natural Vitamin E ) , Vitis Vinifera ( Grape Seed Oil , Citrus Aurantium ( Citrus Oil . ) .Grape Seed Oil contains powerful antioxidants to limit free radical damage . The oligomeric proanthocyanins ( OPCs ) in grapeseed extract also strengthen blood vessel walls and reduce swelling . Chamomile Extract is known for its skin healing properties . Aloe helps the skin heal faster by stimulating the body 's repair process.I have to admit to seeing results after the first week of using this product . Needless to say I bought another container immediately . The Ester-C in this formula is eight times more effective than water soluble Vitamin C. That explains it ! I have never seen my skin change so rapidly.Benefits of this product : Protects the skin by neutralizing free radicalsPromotes cell renewalBoost CollagenMoisturizesReduces the appearance of fine lines and wrinklesEvens out skin tone - if you have sensitive skin , you might be rather impressed withhow smooth and even your complexion becomes.Gives you a radiant complexionJASON products feature only the finest food quality ingredients and they are a much higher quality than the chemical grade used by other cosmetic manufacturers . You can really tell the difference in the purity level.For all skin types.~The Rebecca Review	1
I ordered this because I needed a face moisturizer for nighttime wear . I have had great success with Ester C creams - I am not old enough to have any severe wrinkles but it seems to be stopping what little creasing I had starting in its tracks.This cream is heavy and smells good . I mixed some argan oil into it for an extra boost . So far , my face feels very good after using this and I 'm glad it comes in a very generous container for the price . I would definitely recommend trying it , especially if you 've been using stuff from a drugstore or supermarket - it 's definitely nicer .	1
i like that it does n't have any fragrance and all those harmful chemicals . though it 's those chemicals that make a shampoo super-sudsy , this one suds up enough , unlike other more natural shampoos . it 's gentle enough for daily use . though i do n't know about other folks ' hair habits , i do n't even use a conditioner - just shampoo and rinse .	1
I bought this product a while ago , and I was so happy with the outcome . After a couple weeks of using it my scalp was no longer itchy ( at all ) and the flakes went away . It also has a very nice scent . Although it does leave my hair a bit dry , you just need to use a good conditioner and you 're all set . I ran out and I had some head & shoulders stored so I used that . Head & Shoulders really sucks compared to the Jason brand . Once my Head & Shoulders is all gone I am going to go back to Jason and stick with it ! It works so great .	1
The Shampoo arrived yesterday and tried this morning . It was very nice and i think I will be glad I bought it .	1
We buy this all the time . Problem is some places no longer carry ti . I purchased on line however when I could not find it . However , I found it 's quite a bit more expensive on Amazon then the one I finally found at Whole Foods Stores . But the product is great . Gentle and helps winter itch scalp .	1
Works well to gradually relieve itch and flaking . The mild scent is also pleasant , kind of like eucalyptus . Though not a perfect cure-all , I would recommend this over Head and Shoulders .	1
My husband and I both use this shampoo - he for light dandruff control , and me just because I like the way it cleans my fine hair . It is paraben-free , and does not contain sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates . The scent is not as refreshing as the scent of Jason Natural Cosmetics - Satin Shower Body Wash/Tea Tree Oil 30 fl oz Gel , which is a fabulous body wash , but it is not a bad scent . You do need to watch that it does n't get in your eyes , since tea tree oil can sting a bit .	1
I was looking for a natural herbal shampoo that would keep lice away from my hair and wanted to try this shampoo . I used to have a flaky itchy hair scalp but not since using it , nor have I had any lice and my hair is soft and fuller . I 've gotten LOTS of compliments about my `` beautiful '' hair which I never comb or brush because i 'm too busy & lazy to fix my hair . It smells kind of mediciny ( because of the tea tree oil ) and very liquidy so I mix it with a nice fragrance shampoo like pomegranate , berry , etc or fragrant shower gel with a ratio of 1:2 or 1:3 of jason shampoo to other shampoo.I RUB IT WELL into even the deepest parts of my hair and onto my scalp and LEAVE IT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE in my hair while bathing for the best results.Be careful , though , the drawback is that it DOES sting and burn ( because of the tea tree oil ) when you leave it on very long . Oh well ... ..no pain , no gain ! ! Great product even if it does sting .	1
I have fine limp hair AND I am allergic to that toxic waste site leftovers that they label as `` fragrance . '' With this shampoo I get gentile cleaning that leaves my hair healthy and does n't send me into respiratory arrest .	1
The first thickening shampoo that works on my fine hair . I have tried all the expensive brands , and this one is the best by far .	1
I am crazy about this shampoo . The best quality on the planet and cruelty free ! YES ! Highest recommendation by me !	1
I found this shampoo at my local drugstore ( cost a little more ) and decided to give it a try . I was really surprised at how well it worked with my straight hair . It added lots of body to my hair . It did n't lather much , but that was expected . I need to try the conditioner now too . Great find !	1
My favorite wish is for Jason to make a bigger , less expensive bottle . This is my favorite shampoo but I rarely buy it because of the cost . If you have fine , wispy hair this will do wonders for the texture and feel of your hair ! It smells great and , as an added bonus , does great things for your scalp too ! Simply adore it . Wether it actually THICKENS your hair ... I do n't know about that , BUT my superfine hair certainly FEELS more lush and lustrous after using this shampoo and conditioner ... I just wish I could afford to use it exclusively , but for me this will have to remain a special occasion shampoo . : ( Note : This stuff is THICK . I mean it . Almost like honey .	1
I have problems with thinning hair . I have been using this product for about a month . I do believe that it has helped to make my very thin hair a bit thicker . I do n't expect miracles from a shampoo , but I 'm happy with the results I 've gotten from this product . I like the fact that it 's natural and leaves my hair feeling clean . The scent is a bit medicinal , but by the time I use my other styling products I do n't really notice it anymore . If you have a problem with thinning hair I 'd give this product a try .	1
I have not tried the product yet but i hope it as good as saying if so i will keep ordering more you i love when product work	1
After trying this product once , my husband noticed a difference in how his hair turned out after styling . He told me to buy this product again and now it is a favorite.This product is guaranteed to add at least 10 % fullness to your hair after the first application.It has mild botanical cleansing agents and fruit acids . It not only cleanses your hair , it helps to purify your scalp . Polysorbates free your scalp of excess cellular debris which can block hair follicles.He does n't use the conditioner , but I love usingit with this product.~The Rebecca Review	1
I absolutely love this shampoo and the matching conditioner . It makes my hair look GORGEOUS . Ever after the first use I noticed how much shinier and fuller my hair looked . I also find that my hair is easier to style when I use Jason shampoo and conditioner . While it really does make my hair shinier and seem thicker , it does seem to makes it less soft to the touch , but it LOOKS soft and touchable so that 's all that really matters , right ?	1
Jason ! Cruelty free and top-of-the-line . What more could you ask ? A small amount of this conditioner in the palm of your hand is all you need -- it is so luxe and a little bit goes far . My hair felt full and thick , but not weighed down by product !	1
OK the shampoo surprised me with how well it worked and then the conditioner surprised me too . Happily it worked great and made my hair very smooth . Glad I found these two products for my straight hair .	1
Love this conditioner . My hair is very fine and where I use this conditioner it gives my hair the body it needs . I also have theshampoo and it works great . I recommend it to anyone who has fine hair .	1
Here is the conditioner to compliment the Thin-to-thick shampoo that really does work . This also gives your hair UV protection.This conditioner will also strengthen fine and chemically processed hair by infusing it with 22 amino acids . Also helps to mend split ends and prevent damage.Jason 's exclusive hydrating complex , Planthenol-3 ( tm ) , Aloe Vera plus hair-loving proteins and seaweed extracts , thicken hair fibers by at least 10 % .Lusture , Body & Manageability.~The Rebecca Review	1
This body wash smells so good , that I feel that I must warn anyone with small children to be careful so that they do not try to eat this.Now for the rest of us , this smells great . We like to use this as a bubble bath . The whole bathroom smells heavenly , both during use and even afterwards .	1
So clean . So kind to my parched winter skin . Love it . You ca n't beat Amazon 's price and service . My local health food store charges three times more for this !	1
I 'm on my 2nd bottle of this stuff . Love the smell , especially after a long hot shower . Lathers well and my skin feels clean . Highly recommend this product .	1
This seems to be a very nice body wash . The pump was chipped when it arrived but replaced it with another pump I had ,	1
I am a real fan of the Jason line of products anyway , but , I had n't tried their Satin Shower Rose Water Body Wash . I am pleased to say that it smells terrific , brings my senses to life and offer moisture to my skin . All of these great benefits , and it made without garbage ingredients . Right on !	1
Not really smelling anything but `` Baby Powder '' when using this , but I love Baby Powder smell , so this is not a issue for me . I give it a 4 star rating due to the miss-leading name . I do love this Body Wash , it lathers really well when used with a scrunchy , but not with a wash cloth what so ever.The bottle size is impressive and can easily leave a family of 4 1 to 1.5 months . I feel like my skin is already starting to appreciate the `` All Natural '' effect of this product . I will order this again , but in a different scent to try.The texture is very creamy & you do not need a lot & it has the added bonus of the pump & the kids really think that is the coolest thing ever ( 4 & 5 yrs old ) Definetly would recommend this product or any of Jason 's Products to anyone looking for healthier skin/hair ( yes they make shampoo & conditioner ) .	1
Jason 's natural products are exceptional . I love the body wash and this product tends to be more expensive in stores so that 's why I purchase on amazon . If you like the smell of lavender , this product will tickle your fancy . Very nice during shower time . The soap feels great on your skin and nourishes because it contians Vitamin E , Pro-Vitamin B5 and aloe vera . Jason 's body washes are known for no or low sulfides which is good for sensitive skins and the main reason I purchase . I think what I love the most about this product is the bottle dispenser . It 's so easy to use in the shower and never had a problem with clogging . It despenses down to the bottom of the bottle.This is a prime product which is a plus too . Multiple purchase customer and I 'll be back again .	1
I love Jason products because they smell great and are safe for me and the environment . It 's not cheap , but it 's a luxury that 's worth it for me .	1
This is not for the lavender which is featured in the title . I found a really great buy 1 get 1 free at my grocery story of this . It does NOT smell like any tea tree oil I 've ever smelled , but it is really nice . I love the pump style . The smell is nice and does n't linger much after you get out of the shower , it keeps your skin soft and feels really clean . Both my husband and I use it .	1
I love the smell and it 's a natural product . Does n't leave a residue on my skin . I also use the Jason Healthy Mouth mouthwash religiously . Love Jason products !	1
I have used Jason products for many years , mainly because they do not test on animals . I believe that is very important to many people . This body wash lasts a long time , just one pump onto my fluffy wash thing , ( I never know what they call those little round net things we have so many of ) , anyway , one pump is enough to supply a ton of foaming suds that make you feel so clean and it rinses off so easily . Leaves my skin soft and not dry . I am a great fan of this body wash because I do like tea tree oil for it 's antiseptic properties , and I also buy the lavender one , for it 's soothing effect . I alternate between the two of them . It is a great bargin for the price considering how much body wash we use . I think it would be good for a large family of kids because the Koala bear is just too cute .	1
We actually use this body wash as hand soap . It is gentle on hands and has a really nice yet not overpowering scent of lavender . High quality . Also , fast shipping .	1
This is a great option for body wash if you are trying to go all-natural in your toiletries/cosmetics . The product contains no sodium lauryl/laureth sulfates , and no parabens . It has a nice thick consistency that sticks to your wash cloth , sponge , ( or hand ! ) , and it lathers up nicely . The scent is nice - not fantastic , but pleasant enough .	1
The lavender body wash smells so good and lathers up so rich that I call it my `` affordable luxury '' . I truly feel pampered each time I use it . The bottle is big and lasts a long time . The only reason I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I feel it could be a tad more moisturizing . It 's not drying by any means , but I do n't feel like I can skip my post-bath lotion application either .	1
I 've used most of the Jason Body Washes , and this has such a nice , light rose scent , plus it is very gentle on my sensitive skin . I 'd recommend this to anyone .	1
I bought this for my boyfriend , he loves it . I ended up taking a shine to it as well so now we use it all the time . Tea Tree oil is great for oily skin and this particular wash smells great . We use it as a face wash and have had less break outs since we started using it . Best thing about Jason products is that they are organic , all natural , not tested on animals and contain no animal ingredients . Perfect for vegans or those who just care about what they use on their skin and bodies .	1
My grandson was visiting recently , he has such bad eczema , I was desperate ! ! I had this soap for awhile , and thoughtit could n't hurt to try . I 'm so glad I did , he was n't scratching/itching or crying ( he 's 18 months ) . I was DESPERATE , toget him some relief , I ca n't say enough GOOD things about this soap . Except left no residue , no itching afterwards andthe biggest reward : he slept through the night ! God bless your soap ! I will DEFINITELY be reordering !	1
Honestly , this is a great body wash. Would it not be for the price ( too high ! ) I 'd only use this one and never switch.The scent is absolutely amazing ! It cleanses with out drying too !	1
In the past I 've purchased a ton of LUSH beauty products because they make them with lots of essential oils . What I 've realized is that I can make some scented liquid soaps myself by using essential oils and this Jason 's Body Wash . Simply put a combination of oils in a small plastic bottle and add in some body wash . Shake and use . Some of my favorite combinations are sweet orange , neroli and rose . I 've also tried Ylang Ylang , Patchouli , Lotus and Sandalwood . I 'm looking forward to trying out new combinations as I have a big collection of essential oils . I also like Balsam Fir Needle which is refreshing . I find the body wash works well with a body brush.~The Rebecca Review	1
Smell is so subjective it seems that it may not be a valid review point . One person may love the smell of something and another person hate it . That being said , I like the smell of the citrus body wash . It has a faint scent of oranges and is sweet . It does n't dry out my skin as much as other soaps do . It makes mounds of lather , so a little goes a long way . The ingredients listed on the product page are incorrect ; it does not contain lauryl or laureth sulfates .	1
Great product !	1
I enjoy this body wash . The smell is fresh and clean , and not overpowering like some Tea Tree products can be.It lathers up nicely , and did not irritate my sensitive skin . It also left my skin very soft and clean feeling , not dry .	1
I worked in cosmetic ingredient sales for several years meaning I sold the ingredients directly to large manufacturers and worked with the scientists.I learned much and try to share it.It 's rare to find so many natural and beneficial ingrdients in a soap or face wash . This is a cleanser for oily skin according to the bottle front but it actually is surprisingly mild and non-drying . But the big bonus for me is the tea tree . This is a natural antiseptic and blemish cure yet having to dilute a bottle of it and then apply that mixture to skin is n't all that convenient . This does it for you so you not only have cleaner hands , but better skin on your face as well.How can it clean the skin with an antiseptic without drying it ? It also contains olive oil , another great skin helper . So between the two you are cleaning , removing bacteria , as well as moisturizing.I have very sensitive skin and have had great results with this cleanser .	1
I really liked this soap . I 'm a germophobe n wash my hands constantly . It was gentle for my hands yet effective . also , it lasted me a long time which was great . I highly recommend this soap .	1
very good ingredient.. and smell was wonderful.. everything was good.. some people may do not like because it does not make enough forms.. but i knew more form means more chemical.. so i loved it..	1
I 've been using Jason 's products for over ten years and this is one of my favorite hand soaps . I like it because unlike other hand soaps this does n't dry out my skin . It also has comforting ingredients like aloe , lavender and chamomile . For those who care about such things this product does n't contain any petrolatum , sodium lauryl or laureth sulfates . Give this a try I 'm sure you will love it.~The Rebecca Review	1
I bought this product because it was one of the less expensive retinol products available , but it 's turned out to be my favorite so far.. I had read that retinol can help keep acne at bay , and I can attest to that . In addition to helping to keep the breakouts away , I definitely notice a smoother texture to my skin . And the results are pretty fast & # 8212 ; within just a few days I can tell that the skin on my forehead is a lot smoother.IF you are using this for acne , you need to know that you will get what a lot of people refer to as the & # 34 ; acne purge. & # 34 ; Retinol has the properties of increasing cell turnover , which is good in the long run , but it will usually cause your breakouts to be worse in the beginning . But tough it out ! Because after your initial breakouts go away , this stuff keeps your skin sooo nice . Not to mention being able to help stave off wrinkles.The cream itself is fairly thick , and moisturizing . I imagine it is due to the product containing glycerin . It is just a little bit harsh , so I recommend keeping it far away from your eyelid area .	1
These Alpha Hydrox products are terrific for mature skin . If you do some research you 'll see that this company is careful about the PH-balancing ( they have quite a few products to choose from ) .If you 've been practicing good skin care for a while , you 'll be fine tolerating this . If you 've only been using soap & water , toner , basics like that , then this product will be potent and may aggravate your skin ( uncomfortable ) .This , along with their resurfacing disks ( STRONG ! 14 % so be careful ) and then their AHA Souffle 12 % Glycolic AHA are wonderful . I do n't think my skin would look this good ( in my 50 's ) if I had n't used these products for several years now.I 've used the MD Forte line for several years before I discovered this . I love MD Forte , but it 's expensive . This is as good ( in my experience ) and way less $ $ .I use the Souffle during day , and Night ResQ at night . I try other products as well but this brand is my staple . Would give more stars if I could . ( and no , I do n't rep for this company ) . Excellent value and results .	1
I started using it only a few weeks ago . I have combination skin . I recommend using a moisturizer with it because I noticed my skin started peeling . Although , my skin looks clearer , some of my old freckles seem to be fading , and I just really notice a difference in my skin . I also feel it helps my vitamin C moisturizer absorb better . I used to use Retin-A and Retin-A micro , but I feel this stuff works just as well , plus it has other ingredients that help improve your skin .	1
I use this at night and the Alpha Hydrox 12 % Souffle for day . Between the two , I am definitely seeing an improvement in my skin . I am 45 years old and before starting Alpha Hydrox I had the lovely situation of aging skin which is still oily and breaking out ( am I lucky or what ? lol ) . My skin is still oily ( I do n't think anything is going to change that ) but I no longer break out . On my face , I wo n't say that I 'm looking younger , but I would say I have probably slowed the process that creates sagging & wrinkles - which is better than nothing for sure ! On my neck , I have experienced definite firming . I was getting that little sag just under my chin and that is definitely firmed up since I 've started using these products . Who knows , maybe my face will catch up ? At any rate , with stuff this inexpensive while still so effective , I say you ca n't go wrong !	1
My first tube of retinol was purchased on Amazon and it was made by another company . I was not really experienced with using retinol but that product did n't really impress me . I decided due to financial reasons to change my skin care routine to something more affordable and I chose the Alpha Hydrox line . I 'm happy with their line of products and the ResQ is so much better than what I was previously using . I do recommend this product as I have noticed a positive difference in my skin . Its smoother and softer now and I will continue to purchase and use the ResQ creme .	1
This tube will last me a lifetime considering that you need just a dab for the eye area . It feels pretty light and does n't smell too strong , although I have not noticed any significant reduction of wrinkles and fine lines within a month that I 've been using it . Or maybe I just do n't have enough of them to see anything significant . Going through the ingredient list , I was impressed to see a lot of good anti aging ingredients , but Parabens have to go .	1
AHHH HEAVENS Oh my ! This along with the day aha Souflee is a tag team duo fo POWER I can not live without ! SERIOUSKY , my skin color and tone and pores are now invisible , everyone tells me my skin is flawless with NO makeup on ! I used this a week and souflee in day time and after first 2 dys I could see Difference AFTER a week EVERYONE can see the smoothness , even tone , helps acne scars fade too ! ! I had one on my chin that is gone ! Also took away one ketaris pilaris I think its spelled . Just get it , I love 12 % or higher as this is 12 % .	1
I have used this product for years . I have a dermatological condition called keratosis pilaris which consists of small raised bumps that appear on one side of my forehead and on my arms . This rich cream is actually more effective in minimizing these bumps than the prescription lotion that I have used . I was extremely distressed to read that this company has been purchased by health food giant Hains and that other product formulas have been changed and are no longer effective for whatever they were supposed to do . When I purchased this bottle there was only one left and it is not a new product nor is it manufactured by Hains so I guess I was lucky . If this information is correct then I assume Amazon will be restocking another facial cream that is ineffective . Apart from my particular condition , this cream is a wonderful eye cream . It softens and smooths this area just as you should expect . Ca n't really recommend it if the formula is being manufactured by another company .	1
Love the smell , price and results from this product . Last a long while and it is less expensive than most products of its kind .	1
Aside from my standard Olay ORIGINAL moisturizer which I use faithfully every day -- this seems to be the ONLY other product that helps the & # 34 ; vertical & # 34 ; lines that are appearing on the top of my eyelids . I 'm 67 and have tried a lot of products - found most to be rather useless for the money except for the Olay ORIGINAL mositurizer which I have used all my life and now this . Nice touch before bed as well . Smell is faint but good . Very creamy . Use just a tiny dab -- and the pump is nice in that it only puts out a very small amount - just what you need for the small eye space -- so no waste of product.I have also tried the facial cream from Avalon Organics Vit C - like it , but this Revitalizing Eye Creme is the one that makes a visible difference on my lines above my eye with repeated daily use .	1
- Tommy Hilfiger name brand . Some reviewers seem to think certain colognes have been not authentic , but anytime I buy from Amazon directly , shipped from and sold by Amazon , I have always gotten a retail packaged item.- Smells great , fresh , clean , and not overpowering.- Price is a little high for what I like to spend , but this is a good size supply that should last long enough to justify the price.- Overall I 'm pleased with the product . Will I buy it again ? Maybe . I like to try different colognes and also look at which happen to have a lower price at the time I need to order , but if the price is right I 'll likely try this cologne at least once more.- Amazon delivered quickly w Prime .	1
I bought this for my son-in-law as a birthday gift because my daughter requested it . It smells really nice on him . Very masculine and clean . Excellent fragrance and great quality .	1
I bought it and I like it and I would buy it again . Goes on a little strong but after dry down it starts to mellow out and smells nice .	1
I always have liked Tommy Hilfiger products . I have used this cologne for over 2 years for my casual everyday situations .	1
I have used this with my last 2 pregnancies and have no stretch marks . Do n't know if it 's because of this oil , but I know it ca n't hurt ! I love that this oil does not stain , however , I only use it at night under my tank tops that I wear to bed . This oil does have a slight cocoa smell , but it 's not nauseating at all . I am easily turned off by strong odors , but it 's so faint that I do n't smell it for long . Would highly recommend !	1
I love this oil so much , I use it for after showers , as a suntan lotion , as a night time moisturizer , I actually threw out all of my other lotions and this is the only one I use now . Love it ! !	1
I 'm only 5 months pregnant but I have no stretchmarks ( so far ) , no itchy belly , and it 's kept dryness to a minimum in this cold weather . I use it once a day after the shower , all over . I 've been using it since I was 3 months pregnant . I took off one star because it 's a big oilier than I 'd like , but I did try another ( more expensive , lighter oil , mamma mio ) product and I started seeing dryness , so I switched back to this Mother 's Special Blend . The initial smell is nice ( chocolately ! ) but it goes away in a few minutes .	1
works well , has that smell but does n't last long , too bad amazon do n't carry it any more , would have been nice subscribing every 3 months on it . the consistency is thick , creamy like but i prefer it that way instead of watery-like . easy to blend .	1
I recently had a bad case of hives from an allergic reaction to a medicine.This product helped a lot in the short run , which was worth quite a bit . Cooling and soothing . However , I found that after a couple of applications over the course of half a day or so , the product buildup became an irritant in itself , and I had to shower and remove it , which I did n't necessarily feel well enough to want to do . I did n't have that problem with aloe vera gel.However , this product contains a mild local anesthetic , so it may be more helpful for some things . I did n't think of the aloe vera gel until the hives had improved somewhat , so it may not have compared as well in the beginning.I 'd buy this again , but I sure hope I do n't need to .	1
I had a allergic reaction to a new detergent and i bought this to use on my rashes . it helps stop the itches but if you mess with the rash no amount of lotion is gon na help . This stuff is pretty sticky too so try not to use it on your whole limb .	1
I have a condition which makes my arms itch intensly and nothing , I mean nothing has worked . Finally , I have found something that helps ! This lotion really does the trick as it has Calamine ( 3 % ) and Pramoxine HCl ( 1 % ) in it which seems to be the key . The calamine lotion does make the application appear a bit pink but rubbing it in well disguises this and helps the lotion work even better . I would recommend this for all itching , but if you have itching that nothing has helped , give this a try . It 's not greasy and works like a charm .	1
It greatly relived my itch skin . Although , it has some unique smell though.It is a bit expensive then regular lotion . If you are going to use it for your entire body , this 4 ounce bottle wo n't last long and it will be better to get bigger bottle .	1
For the past year I have been covering my skin from hives . I hated the sight of the patchy itchy redness that would appear on my skin . Since I purchased Aveeno 's Anti-Itch concentrated lotion , the hives have minimized and even disappear faster . I started applying the lotion after every bath . Within two days , the hives have been under control . I 'm happy to be living a more itch free life .	1
This product worked for my itchy rash when nothing else touched it . This product cleared up my itchy rash within 48 hours . The product soothes the itchy , burning sensation and clears up the problem . High Recommend !	1
I often recommend mixing a great lotion with a topical steroid to my patients to cover a large area of itchy skin . This is pretty thick stuff , so it could even be diluted some . Not fragrant .	1
I love Aveeno Anti-Itch Concentrated Lotion ! I 'm super allergic person . So I need somethingthat 's non-allergic . This one seems to work.I love it , Takako Masuda	1
This bar is less drying than most . Years ago when I was a young girl a dermatologist recommended an oatmeal bar . Then I had oily skin - now of course dry . It is not as moisturizing though as I would like now .	1
Cleans and moisturizes without drying , and without leaving skin oily . Minimizes acne flare ups . I have n't had any acne problems once I started using the product again . Natural - Not a lot of chemicals . Good for the skin .	1
I love this soap for after shave.Whats great about this bar is that is doesnt lather up bubbles but it melts onto your skin leaving it soft and if you have irritated skin like excema or razor bumps its gentle on the skin..Leaving skin soft ...	1
This is a great product to use if you at all suffer from any dry skin or skin irritations . If you find yourself washing your hands all day , use this one and you wo n't feel like you 're washing away all of your skin 's natural protection . I 've occasionally used it to wash my face , and it does a complete job of removing my make-up without leaving it red and irritated . Definitely worth a try if bar-soaps have disappointed you before !	1
I never thought a soap could make such a big difference . I switched to this soap about ten days ago and I ca n't believe how much better my skin feels , especially my face and hands.The Aveeno bar looks and feels completely different from any other bar soap . It does not lather to any great extent , which may bother some people , but the fact is that lather serves no cleaning purpose . It does feel creamy and pleasant . It also has a smell that , well , smells like oatmeal , so that is an adjustment . It is not unpleasant , just different . It does not transfer to the skin , nor can I smell the bar when I walk into the bathroom , which is important to me as I do not like perfumed or flowery soaps that ( to me ) stink up the room.I was worried that it would not be effective in removing makeup , especially mascara , but it works just fine.Aveeno also has a new product , a moisturizer for people with eczema Aveeno Active Naturals Eczema Care Moisturizing Cream , 6 Oz , that I also started using a week ago , and the effects of the combination of the two is a marvel . I occasionally have mild eczema outbreaks , so I can not speak for those with more severe cases or itching skin , but this bar and the moisturizer have worked wonders for me .	1
Not long ago , I started putting oatmeal in a little bit of cheesecloth and added it to my bath . Then , I added rosemary and other herbs for variety . The combination of oatmeal and rosemary seems to be very healing.While this soap contains oat flour , it does n't contain herbs . It is a nice soap to use in the tub but it has to be put in a dry place after your bath because it gets very creamy and soft and can be used up faster than you intend it to be used.Aveeno products heal the skin and are comforting , soothing products . You will start to notice your skin looking much more smooth and healthy after using products with oatmeal.If you love this product , you might also enjoy using the Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion , Aveeno Stress relief Body Wash or Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion.All the Aveeno items calm and relax . I especially love the Stress Relief Lotion in the 2.5 oz tube that can be kept in your purse . The burst of Lavender , Chamomile and Ylang-Ylang is healing at any time of the day.~The Rebecca ReviewLover of Long Baths with Essential Oils and a Poetry Book	1
This mascara is always perfect . Do n't use the waterproof ... Brownish Black works well with lighter eyes for a daytime look.Very Black gives a more intense lash for evening .	1
The spooly could be a little better but that 's what the spoolies are for in brush sets so no biggie .	1
I always go back to this mascara . I love the look it gives . Very soft and fluttery , my lashes but x10 better and not fake and clumpy looking like other mascaras . No gross smell either and I have no problems with flaking or smudging , lasts all day . I also have the waterproof version and it works but smells . Love both . Will always repurchase .	1
I love this mascara . I have been using it ever since Sarah-Michelle Gellar first hocked in 2000 ( ? ) . A friend of mine was in to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and soon , so was I. I think Gellar is gorgeous , even though she 's got an odd nose , and while she was Maybelline 's spokesmodel , I tried just about anything she modeled . This was the one product that has been faithful . It goes on nicely , builds well , does n't clump or make my lashes feel crispy . I have tried many higher end mascaras ( via Sephora 's trial-sized mascara kit ) and always come back to this . I hope they never discontinue it or & # 34 ; improve & # 34 ; the formula .	1
I always seem to come back to this mascara after trying many others . Now that I 'm older , I want a mascara that gives me a more natural , soft look , and this does the trick . It does n't clump , or smudge on me , and it 's always easy to remove . I 'm sure I 'll probably still try other mascaras to see how they are , but I 'll undoubtedly come back to this one !	1
I 've been using this mascara for a decade and have no intention of switching . Ever . I still remember the commercial with Sarah Michelle Gellar even : PIt delivers on it 's promises to not flake or clump and to feel more natural . That I love . I 've read many reviews that say it does n't build drama . When I want impact I do three coats , and if I want outrageous drama , I use a mascara primer first . I have zero problems making this mascara go from every day to big night out and everywhere in between . It also washes off easily without black residue lingering around . I do not use the waterproof version though , so I have no idea how well ( or not ) it washes off.I get complements on my lashes often , and when I tell people I use a cheap ole drugstore mascara that 's been around for years and years , people are shocked . But it 's 100 % true . I love this stuff . I wish I could fine the brownish black in stores , but I ca n't find anywhere that carries it but here . I like the very black , but sometimes I want a more natural look and like the brown/black .	1
I like this because it looks very natural . I have fine lashes and this helps . I also really like Revlon 3D photoready mascara .	1
i have small eye lashes and not too full . this mascara leaves my lashes looking full and the color makes the see thick..it dosnt separate my lashes to the point where they look like a rake.. and after the mascara dries my lashes feel soft	1
Several years ago I had some eyelashes actually break off because of a mascara that was too stiff . This one is extremely soft , yet noticeable and natural . I 've used it for years - since that break-off incident .	1
The never fail good old soft and full still thickens and darkensNs my lashes better than any other mascara I 've used .	1
I do n't usually wear makeup , as it 's not really a good fit for my occupation . I decided to try this out , and I like the way it works . It does n't leave my lashes think or clumpy . The company has fast shipping and great packaging .	1
I do n't normally wear mascara but I bought this for the few times I do . The product seems to be good and natural . I like this product .	1
This Full and Soft Mascara definitely lives up to its name ! It gives your lashes a natural look , but more amped-up and defined . When I 'm not in search of an almost-false-lashes look , this is what I 'll go for ! Very , very good product !	1
I love this mascara and have been using it for years . I try other brands and types and always go back to this natural looking mascara.Cons : Wo n't lengthen your lashes enough to look like falsies , and does n't build up super thick . If you have naturally longer lashes that simply fade away because they 're too pale , this wo n't be a big deal . If you have short lashes , this one wo n't give you much help.Pros : Darkens the lashes and thickens the thin tips so they 're more noticeable , without any clumps and very little flaking . If you have weepy eyes or cry easily , you 'll absolutely want the waterproof kind , since this version washes off super easy . But , I 've never had raccoon eyes from a little rain.This mascara does n't clump up as quickly in the tube as other brands and types . It goes on as smoothly on day one as it does after 6 months when it 's due for replacement.If you prefer your makeup more natural looking and less obvious , this mascara is a very good inexpensive choice . The `` black-brown '' is so close to black that it 's impossible to tell them apart on the lashes , so if one is cheaper , do n't worry that it wo n't be dark enough .	1
I 've used this mascara for years and it never disappoints . Adds lots of length and volume to my lashes . The first couple applications from a brand new tube are pretty thin and light , but it will thicken and give you the desired results thereafter . I used to go through these tubes so quickly because they would dry out pretty fast ... until a trick I learned : if your tube starts drying out , extend its life by adding 2 drops of contact solution/eye drops to the tube . It will instantly rehydrate it for continued use . I 've been using the same tube for 10 months now by doing this ! : )	1
MY LASHES ARE RATHER FINE & THIS PRODUCT GRABS HOLD ONTO THEM GIVING THEM VOLUME ! LOVE THE BRUSH & THE PRODUCT AND IT DOES N'T FLAKE OFF . IT HAS THE PERFECT NAME~ LEAVES YOUR LASHES LOOKING FULL & SOFT !	1
I 've been using this mascara for years and it 's my favorite . It very rarely clumps , makes my lashes look great and feel healthy . I 've tried many others and this is the one I always go back to .	1
BEST mascara I 've ever used . I recently had been following the advice of some beauty bloggers and tried a couple other brands only to be disappointed by their clumping , or inability to give me long , beautiful looking lashes ( mostly clumping - yuck ) .So I came back to my old favorite and it 's just as good as ever . This mascara goes on really well -- no clumping even if you slide the wand through your lashes a few times ( for complete , awesome coverage ) . It makes my eyes look great , does n't smudge for me . I have a friend who says she gets raccoon eyes from this -- so she uses their waterproof version and loves it . So if you touch your eyes a lot or have allergies/watery eyes , maybe go waterproof . I do n't prefer waterproof because I like that this comes off easy with soap and water without need for a special makeup remover .	1
I recently switched to Maybelline Full n Soft after using Dior mascara for the past 5 years . This product is reasonably priced and is fantastic . My lashes still feel soft after applying 3 coats . Love , Love , Love this product .	1
I do wish it stayed wetter in the tube but I love the way it thickens my lashes . The brush applicator is terrific . I do n't like waterproof because my lashes fall out . This last all day for me and washes off completely with soap and water.Never flakes , never smudges .	1
I have tried tons of mascara , yet I always come back to this one . This mascara is amazing . I almost NEVER get clumps , the brush is PERFECT so I never end up with thickly caked lashes and the mascara is thick enough to coat each lash and not coat groups of lashes in to one bulky mess . I just love it ! I just wish Amazon carried more of the brownish shades of this mascara ... I would highly recommend this mascara to anyone . I 've been using it for about 15 years now and have never found a decent alternative .	1
I 've been using it for about 10 years . It 's not clumpy , it lasts forever , it does n't flake , it 's easy to wash off ( even if you are a heavy mascara wearer like me : ) and its affordable . I do n't know what I 'll do if they ever disconntinue it ! LOVE THIS STUFF !	1
I ordered this for my sister in a different city , because I want her to try it . It 's my favorite mascara . It 's lengthening and natural-looking .	1
Why have n't I been singing the praises of this little beauty of a mascara ? ! I get courted away by $ 30+ mascaras that flake or never wash off ! Even the drugstore brands lured me away with their fancy brushes and promises of butterfly lashes . No more ! This stuff does n't flake , is inky and black , but can be removed w gentle soap and water . My lashes actually feel conditioned after using this for a few days . Do yourself a favor and buy this !	1
This has to be one of the best mascaras I have ever tried ( and I 've tried many ! ) . My lashes are both thin and short , and I 've found that this mascara adds plenty of fullness AND a bit of length , too . Plus , there are absolutely NO CLUMPS when I use this mascara ; the unique brush deposits just the right amount of product on my lashes , unlike other products that claim to be `` clump-free . '' I 've tried both the regular and the waterproof versions of this mascara ; I prefer the latter , as it stays on great yet washes off easily . The only thing that I think could make this product better would be a curling brush to give the lashes a bit more lift . Although Full 'N Soft is n't a dramatic mascara , it is perfect for everyday wear , and I would recommend highly to anyone .	1
Love this mascara ... .perfect for casual wear . Unfortunately they must not be making it any more ! Glad I was able to find this on Amazon . It was shipped quickly .	1
I am always on the lookout for the best mascara out there and this one is it ! It 's inexpensive and goes on so smooth and easy without having to coat and coat and coat .	1
I 've used this mascara for years and years . Lashes are full , they are not stiff or clumpy . To find the color brwn/blk is hard to find , but much more natural than stark black .	1
I used to spend $ 20 plus on mascara 's bc I have no eyelashes , well small blond ones anyways and this one is less then $ 7 and works just as good as the department store brand .	1
This is the greatest mascara formula I have ever tried - because of this , I 've been hooked for over 10 years . It makes my lashes very full , and never crunchy . The price on Amazon is much better that what you 'll find elsewhere - even at Walmart . Buy in bulk . It will save you money down the road .	1
Maybelline has n't failed me yet , and this mascara is no exception . I do n't wear mascara every day , but when I do , this is the one I choose . I like to look as natural as possible , and this mascara does the trick . It 's not incredibly black to the point where it 's obvious I have it on . It keeps my lashes up and thickens them the right amount . It does not clump and best of all I still look natural .	1
I have been using this mascara ever since it first came out . I tried several dozen other mascara both popular brands and high-end . And I could never find a mascara that gave good lash coverage without the clumps . This mascara allows you to either create a completely natural ( but beautiful look ) , or add an extra layer or two for a dramatic , almost fake lash look . Without mascara I look like I do n't have any lashes at all , but with the Maybelline Full 'N Soft on I get compliments on my eyes and sometimes even get asked where I buy my lashes ! What a difference ! ! Plus another BIG benefit of this mascara is that it comes in a `` brownish-black '' color , which looks black on but doesnt look awkward and fake . This is totally different from brown mascaras that I think only work for very fair blond people . I have hazel eyes and dark hair , this brownish black looks incredible on my eyes . Well , I just cant speak well enough about this magic product , I am SO IN LOVE WITH IT I do n't know what I would ever do without it ! !	1
I really feel guilty reviewing this product because I am 68 years old and have only sparse eyelashes . This , of course , should make mascara clump more , and most mascara does . This is one produce that is true to its advertisement , and a great color as well .	1
This is the best mascara I 've ever tried . And I 've tried a lot . I love the brush , this mascara goes on smooth every time and I never never never have clumps . Not even at the end of the tube . Lashes feel soft and look so natural ! LOVE this mascara ! ! ! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for something new .	1
i love this mascara , the brush and consistency work perfectly together to give a feathery fan of darkened lashes without looking like you obviously have mascara on , which when working in a professional setting is really important . what i love most is i have to be a huge lash comb fiend with most mascaras to avoid the awful spikes look or worse , clumps . this mascara does neither , i do n't have to comb at all and i 'm always in a rush so saving a another tool and step is great . probably not intense enough for night looks , but for day to day this is perfect .	1
As far as drugstore mascaras go , I have loved Full N Soft for years . Drugstore mascara is inexpensive , so I have often experimented with other brands/formulas - Maybelline , Revlon , L'Oreal , etc. , but Full N Soft is the one I come back to . It is great in a single coat and also builds well . If building , I recommend using a clean mascara brush to separate between coats . If during the day your lashes get bent ( this happens to me with sun and prescription glasses ) , use your finger to apply pressure and curve lashes back in place . The flexible formula will re-mold . No flakes , no mess.The brownish-black is natural and minky-coloured . The super black is dramatically black !	1
At 56-um-something I noticed my crow 's feet were getting pretty deep . I used this with two other products from Olay and am happy to say I can barely see them now . Not vain ... ..just like a clean fresh face without the early signs of aging . Great produce and the price is n't CRAZY ( you know the ones I 'm talking about ! )	1
No need to pay a fortune for moisturizer , ladies . Research shows ... . no significant improvement with $ 200 - $ 400 creams . Olay is the real deal . Enough said ? Oh , one more thing ... . the SPF version is just plain evil . Nasty smelling , nasty feeling , and WHITE ! ( This one is a faint pink color which looks less like suntan lotion when you apply it ) .	1
it does n't wear well under make-up . It 's just a little oily . Other than that ... I love this product . I use it mainly on my neck and chest ( and on my face on my days off ) and it has evened out my skin tone and faded my sun-spots ALOT . Especially on my chest ... HUGE difference from a few years ago ! It really is a great All-in-One Product- I 've been using it for years and have n't found a better one yet . I 'll keep on buying it !	1
Love this lotion . I use it daily after the shower . My skin soaks it up . Smells good , light weight . Love .	1
I had tried this moisturizer back in my 20 's a few times and did n't really like it , I felt it was n't `` doing anything '' ... Well I did n't have fine lines then lol . Now at 35 this stuff is great ! Creamy , easy to apply and leaves your skin feeling clean and moisturized . The smell is nice to ! Great buy : )	1
I love this stuff . My wrinkles have & # 34 ; faded & # 34 ; and folks have been asking me & # 34 ; what are doing , your skin looks so good ! & # 34 ; I 've started using this plus drinking my water every day . It works !	1
I 've used this product for several years and it helps to smooth out some of my small wrinkles ... ..sure beats paying outrageous prices for & # 34 ; designer & # 34 ; brands in the department stores !	1
i was n't happy with the cost but i love the product i just thought there would be more but i like it	1
Do n't want wrinkles ? Want to lessen wrinkles ? I have used this product since I was 16 . It 's great . I love it . You can see it work .	1
This is the only product that does not irritate my face.It really softens and protects your skin.I have tried the expensive ones out there , but this seems to be the best one for my skin .	1
I am crazy about the smell of this Olay Total Effects 7-in-1 . It is a wonderful soothing and unique smell . That alone has made me very happy . But for some reason , I was sure that a daily moisturizer would have SOME SPF . This one has none . I had another bottle of what I thought is exactly this brand and it has SPF and in fact , that 's why I ordered this , because I am out of the other one . Anyway , now I use it as a moisturizer only if I 'm home most of the day and away from sunlight or before bed . I do not use this when I go out even though it would do nicely under makeup simply because it does n't have SPF , ladies , and you want that sunscreen protection.Now the moisturizer itself is rich , creamy , feels absolutely wonderful on face and neck , and did I mention , it smells wonderful ? I 've been using Olay products after my esthetician friend told me that it is still one of the best and most researched brands on the market , and ironically , one of the most affordable ones . I have normal skin , but a very sensitive skin too and it works fine on my face . I 've enjoyed it so much over the years and this one is among one of my favorites now . ( Even without the SPF ) ! . Good luck and hope this helped . Take good care of your skin !	1
I have used Olay products since they only had & # 34 ; Oil of Olay & # 34 ; back when I was 16 yrs . old . At my age , 57 , I do n't have the wrinkles or dry skin that other people my age have . I occasionally have tried other products , but never twice . I always go back to Olay , because it feels the best on my skin and does what it says it will do .	1
olay product are allways so good if you have sensitive skin . their product line are so good . i have seen a different in my skin . my skin feel so good after i used it . will buy this again.and the fact that it cost less at amazon than at other stores	1
I 've tried more expensive lotions and creams on my face , but I really love this one . It leaves my face feeling and looking very soft . I also love the way you just pump the top and the moisturizer comes out ... .you do n't have to dip your fingers in a jar or touch what 's left in it . All creams and lotions and such should be this way ... I hate having to dig out cream in a jar with my fingers not knowing if I 've left any germs in the remaining cream . I recommend this .	1
With my dry skin , moisturizers are very important . Moisturizing my face after showering is very important . This light , silky moisturizer stays with me through the day . The sun protection is very important to me . I do n't know how I 'd manage without my Olay products .	1
I ordered this Olay product for the first time . The bottle seemed smaller than what is seen on the website . It did n't last me as long as I would 've liked . I did n't see any difference as far as its anti-aging goes . Sometimes you have to use a product at least 90 days to see some results . I guess I can continue to use it a while longer and hopefully see some anti-aging results in the near future .	1
Recently , while traveling , I ran out of my usual high-end facial moisturizer . I did n't panic , ( LOL ) ! I had heard from friends that Olay 's Regenerist Collection includes excellent products for face and body . One friend in particular mentioned that she was using Olay Total Effects 7-in-One Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer . So , I went into a nearby drugstore and bought a bottle . I have used it for a few weeks now as I wanted to finish the pump bottle lotion/cream before returning to my usual moisturizer . Then I realized that because I really like the effects Olay is having on my skin , why spend a small fortune on face care when the much less expensive Olay line works so well ? I am in my 60 's and this is a perfect lotion/cream for aging skin ... or at least for my aging skin.This is not a heavy moisturizer but sinks into my skin right away , leaving a smooth soft feel . Olay Total Effects 7-in-One Anti-Aging Daily Moisturizer . minimizes the appearance of pores and provides a free radical defense which helps prevent damage to the skin 's surface . It is dermatologically tested , non-comedogenic ( wo n't clog pores ) , and is oil-freeThe pump packaging is a real plus as it helps keep the product sanitary and reduces exposure to the air which can deteriorate some ingredients rendering them less effective.Ingredients include : Nicinamide ( Vitamin B3 ) , Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate ( Vitamin C ) , Panthenol ( Pro-Vitamin B5 ) , Tocopheryl Acetate ( Vitamin E ) , ( Vitamin E ) , Camellia Sinensis ( Green Tea ) Leaf Extract and Zinc Oxide . This formula includes some excellent anti-oxidants.If you are curious , ( as I was ) , about this skin care product , or the others in the Regenerist Collection , try this or another , like Olay & # 8217 ; s Pro-X Deep Wrinkle Treatment ... also excellent .	1
this is one of my tried and true beauty products ; it never fails me . The other night , after using a different ( and much more expensive ) cream for over a month , I reverted back to using this , and my gosh , I fell in love all over again ! I highly recommend this product . It 's rich and gives the right amount of moisture without a greasy feel or look . Due to it not having SPF , I use this at night , and use a BB cream during the day .	1
I was pleasantly surprised with this one . Feels very light and I think it really did make my skin look better . Just try it . With the prices here on Amazon , you ca n't afford not to . Go on just try it .	1
This is the best moisturiser for mom-age ever . But a little bit too heavy for me . Serve as good concealer .	1
This stuff is awesome . I use it in the morning , as part of my `` beauty '' treatment . It is super soft cream . Feels almost like putting whipped cream on your face . I love it . Afterward , my face just looks so radiant . Have been using it for about 2 weeks now and I just love the way it makes my face look.I have been using the Olay products since about July 2006 and am very pleased . I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment at night on my whole face and neck , after washing with Dove Regenerating Calming Night Soap ( liquid , navy colored bottle ) and I use Olay Smooth Skin Exfoliating Scrub about once or twice a week at night . In the morning , I use Avon ANew Eye Lift Cream around my eyes and then Olay Total Effects 7x Visible Anti-Aging Vitamin Complex Cream on my entire face and neck . I think this combo , particularly the Olay Regenerist products and Total Effects , have made me look YEARS younger -- with the grace of God , of course . I added the Regenerist Night Recovery about 2 months ago , and it made a difference for me . Lots of people at work tell me I look younger , too . My skin feels great ! It 's firm and velvet soft . And wait till I tell you , I have lost 53 pounds in the last 10 months ! Why do you care ? Well , my face should be sagging all over the place with that kind of a weight loss , especially since I carried that weight for years and my skin was well-stretched . I should need a crane just to hold the wrinkles up ! Guess what ? ? ? It 's firm and velvet soft . I wo n't say I do n't own a wrinkle , but they are very very minimal . I 've had people tell me I do n't have wrinkles , too , but there are little tiny ones there hiding in the makeup . Oh , I 'm 58 , too -- so do n't think I 'm 25 and telling you I do n't have wrinkles like they tell you in those adds on TV.Dec 2007 : Still using it . It 's like giving your face a drink in the morning.Guys : YOU can use this stuff too , if you want your face to look softer and firmer . ( Just do n't tell the women . Most of them will talk about you like a dog . Not me , though . What the heck . I know there are some guys out there that actually care what they look like . ) I am mighty pleased with these Olay products , BUT , use them awhile . Nuthin ' happens overnight , Hon ! ( We call everybody Hon in Balmer , Merlin ) ( That translates to Baltimore , Maryland -- sorry , I have an accent . ) Nov 2008 -- still using this in morning , in combination with other Olay and Victoria Principal products .	1
I 'm only 19 and I figured that I would start using moisturizer on a daily basis now to help cope with my dry skin.I ca n't attest to the anti-aging qualities of the product , but I will say that my hunt for the PERFECT daily moisturizer has come to an end ! My skin is always super dry and the skin on my nose would even flake sometimes . I apply this once a day in the morning after washing my face and I have seen SIGNIFICANT improvement after one week , my face is smoother and I do n't need to wear foundation anymore . I have n't had any breakouts or any discomfort , and it does not feel oily on my face either . I 've tried l'oreal and clinique and several brands inbetween but this beats them by miles ! Only thing I regret would be not stocking up on these when they were on sale for eleven bucks ( shipping included ) .UPDATE : May 1st , 2013I 've gone through the first bottle of this and am halfway through my second . For something that I use daily , this is a really good value . My skin has not acted up since I started using this , and I love how it absorbs really quickly so I can slap on my sunscreen and makeup without waiting in the morning .	1
I 've been using this and it works for me to stop places on my face from drying out . This was the second time I 've bought this product .	1
I have been using this product for years . It is the perfect amount of moisture . I have been buying it in the stores until recently when I realized its significantly cheaper via amazon . I recommend this cream 100 %	1
Love the feel of this product , I dont know if its stopping the aging process , but it is a light moisture product good to use under make up	1
I wanted a regular moisturizing cream for men . Searched on Amazon and this was one of the recommended products . I like that it does n't leave your skin oil . I am still pretty young , so did n't notice any difference in terms of anti-aging effects : P	1
i love olay products because it works well.i ve been using the olay total effects daily moisturizer and the night cream for 3 months now and my feel feels good.this product can not erase your wrinkles but it helps to reduce it .	1
I am older and my very oily skin has become quite dry . I never realized how much Olay 7 in 1 Effects was changing my skin until I saw how I looked after about two weeks . I initially thought that a problem I was having with itchy eyes might be due to Olay 7 in 1 but it was seasonal pollen ! I have VERY sensitive skin and Olay not only seems to be hypoallergenic it is the most fantastic product ( not counting Olay Regenerist ! ) I have ever used .	1
I do like this moisturizer . I 've been using it for a while now & it makes my skin really soft & seems like I will never run out of it . When I first got it & seemed like it would last me a week because it does n't weigh anything , it feels empty but it seems like I wo n't need to purchase more for a long time . : )	1
This product is just wonderful ! It does not clog my pores , cause blemishes or irritate my oily skin - after using it for almost a year now I have noticed my skin is much softer and more supple than it use to be , and the scent is luxurious but not overpowering - if you 're looking for a moisturizer that will refine and even out your skin-tone , this is for you , and the amazon price ca n't be beat !	1
All I can say is when I put this on my face ( as I do every day , I always find myself saying aaaaahhhh . It feels wonderful going on , and leaves my face so moisturized , soft and smooth . I have been using Olay for most of my life , and often have compiments on my skin . I 'm a believe in Olay , particularly this cream	1
Most of Olays productions are very moisturizing as well as this product . I have n't seen any changes in my slight wrinkles I have so we will see . It also has a light smell , not overpowering . I would buy it just for the hydration part .	1
The moisture part is great , but the anti aging part doesnt really show . The face wash for this line of products does a lot more for me . However , it smells very nice and glides on very smoothly and is n't greasy . I 'm going to get it again just because it 's a great moisturizer .	1
It goes on really smoothly . It keeps my face well hydrated . I have mature skin so this is really important to me . It 's really a great product ! ! !	1
My favorite low cost under make up moisturizer . I have used the lotion for about 4 years and I use Olay Regenerst for my eyes . I would recommend this product .	1
this is an ok product kept my face moisterized but a little on the pricey side for the size and the fact that it 's a pump not too keen on the pump thing .	1
This product changed my life . I had dry , flaky skin and now it 's perfect . I still have the occasional breakouts and some uneven tone ( I already had this though ) but I am very happy with this moisturizer . It smells so good ! I use it religiously every morning and I follow up in the evening with Olay Regenerist Night Effects .	1
Very good product for moisturing your face . It makes the face feel soft and it gives it a nice dewy glow .	1
I love this product ! I 've been using Oil of Olay since I was a teenager and dinosaurs roamed the earth . Oil of Olay has consistently been a great product all that time . But , my Oil of Olay disappeared from my area , so I bought this to try . I love it . It goes on smooth and creamy , not oily . It is unscented . Only one squirt is all you need to keep your face nourished and comfortable all day .	1
Love ! Ive been using olay products for years and Im still in my 20s . Neva too early to take precautions lol	1
Since I have been using my face is really smooth and clear , I am 39 years old and I have noticed a big change !	1
Around 30 , I started getting frown lines while still having pimples ( yay ! ) . I started using Olay Total Effects nightly for my combination skin ( stork bites around nose , too ) . What a difference ! It absorbs perfectly and leaves no film , and there 's no adjustment period where your skin breaks out . Helps fine lines APPEAR LESS ( not sure it can get rid of them ) and balances skin . You do n't need much so that helps the $ a bit . I do n't use it under makeup because I use mineral powder only and it gets in its way if i do n't wait 15 minutes ( time I do n't have in the morning , but you might ! ) .Lately I found that soap dried my skin too much so I grabbed some Olay Daily Wash too - perfect . No dry skin , redness gone , and no breakouts at all . Pretty affordable too ( compared to the moisturizer ) . Tone is overall evened out . Skin 's just a bit brighter.If you have average to sensitive skin with no major issues to contend with , Olay products are a perfect , SIMPLE solution to maintain healthy skin . It has never required an adjustment period for me , spreads well , and never leaves a film . They interact well with each other , too . No overnight miracles but overnight RELIEF with long-term improvement . Strongly recommend . Since it lets you keep it simple , it remains affordable enough and definitely available anywhere .	1
Olay Total Effect 's facial lotion is an excellent everyday lotion . It goes on smoothly and a little goes a long way . It has no fragrance and absorbs quickly . The one issue I have is that it leaves me looking a bit shiny.The bottle that it comes in is small and travels well . It 's easy to pump out the exact amount that you need.I have combination sensitive skin and I 've not noticed and issues or breakouts . I 've been using it for about a month now with good results .	1
It smooths and hydrates well but I think it is little greasy for my skin type . I have oily skin all over and oilier in T area.I apply powder on this to cover all the shine . So far ( 3 days use ) it has not no adverse reaction on my skin .	1
Ca n't stand perfume and its in everything . ( Perfumed toilet paper is just strange ! ) This is great for me , does n't take forever to be absorbed . I have it on auto ship . Sent to me every other month cause I have my husband use it too . He 's had a lot of skin cancer on his face and this spf 15 is just enough for regular daily use . I use this in the morning and a heavier one at night . The dermatologist says my 65 year old skin looks great even with her magnifying glass . Lets keep it that way !	1
I have acne prone , oily and sensitive skin . I 've used this product for a couple of months . It 's not a very light product . It leaves a residue and is absorbed very slowly . It could leave a greasy feeling all day long . Over time , I noticed my skin got softer but I did n't notice any other claimed benefits.At least it did n't cause acne . It could be a little bit better than regular moisturizers if you have a normal to dry skin .	1
I have been using this moisturizer for a few years now and I really like it . It smooths on nicely , keeps my face moisturized without being greasy , and does not cause me to break out . I generally put on a light coat after showering and then mix the moisturizer with my foundation when getting ready for the day . One of the best things about the product is that at the end of the day I do n't have that `` I ca n't wait to get this stuff off my face '' feeling . I also use their night cream ( Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment ) and like that too.As for the anti-aging claims - who really knows if any lotion is working ? This lotion keeps my face moisturized , so the lines probably do n't show as much and the UV element probably helps too . Ca n't say that I look younger than before I used this product and ca n't say that I have aged beyond my years since using it either . It is effective , but certainly not a miracle cream . ( When someone finds one of those would you let me know - lol . ) Effective product at a reasonable price .	1
I 've used this product for several years and it kept my face and skin soft . Not long ago , I tried an expensive & # 34 ; anti-aging & # 34 ; product that a relative had given me . Awful ! ! ! It smelled like paint stripper and after a couple days , my skin turned into sandpaper ! So ... ..now I 'm back to this moisturizer and hope to regain the soft skin I had .	1
I hate it when my moisturizer slithers of my face like an oil slick , or is so thick you almost have to add water to spread it onto your face . Just one pump of this covers my face , neck and d & eacute ; collet & eacute ; . Makeup application is smooth , and seems to stay put longer than usual when I use this . I have n't noticed any major changes in the appearance of my fine lines , etcBut I do like he way my skin feels when I use this . I 'd order it again for sure .	1
I am in love with this daily moisturizer . It smells so good I wish I could use it all over . It leaves my face very soft and with a nice natural glow . My skin has actually improved since I started using it about 3 weeks ago . I will most definitely keep buying . Its awesome !	1
I use this product every night on my face after washing it and I have seen some wonderful results and will order it again soon .	1
I first bought this Olay moisturizer cream because it 's unscented . ( Hurrah , if I want perfume , I prefer what I use ! ) I 've been very happy with it ever since . It 's not messy , is easy to apply and has sunscreen in it . If you wear make-up it 'll go over the moisturizer with no problem . The anti-aging must work as I get a lot of comments that I do n't look my age ! ( 85 ) I do n't wear make-up except for eyes and mouth , so what people see is what 's there , wrinkles and all.Recommend highly .	1
I am almost 33 but people says i look 20 something ... They also thought I am still single but I told them I even have a 2 year old daughter ! I used this product for 4 years already and until now I am amazed by how it works in my skin . It became smoother , tight and pore less . I love this with spf 15 , not only it hydrates the skin but protects as well . This is really my beauty secret for looking young ... I eat food so much , drink soda more than water but my skin still radiates plus the help of vitamins i take ... So i really thank olay total effects so much !	1
My sister originally told me about this product . She 's used so many different products for her sunspots and loves this one the best especially for the price . So far , I 'm loving it too .	1
I 've tried many different brands of moisturizer for my very sensitive skin and found this to be completely non-irritating and it moisturizes well . I do n't know what `` anti-aging '' means . I would n't say that I look any younger as a result of using it . I like that the same amount comes out each time with one press on the pump -- it helps prevent accidentally squirting out too much . And I sure would n't want to do that because this stuff costs a whole lot per ounce for those of us on a limited budget . The best deal around is to buy a two-pack on Amazon . That cost will beat a retail purchase by several dollars .	1
I will not use any other moisturizer after using this . it 's absolutely helped even out my skin tone and from someone who 's used a million different face moisturizers , this has boded as the best for my combination skin .	1
I liked this product as it worked at the time , but it contains alcohol and I do n't like to put alcohol on my face	1
UGH skin ! I have been on long term steroid therapy combined with winter 's harsh wind and cold made my face drier than the Sahara Desert . A merry go round of skin products later still no significant improvement . Then a few weeks ago I added a variety of Olay products to do battle . Although I must admit I was skeptical after lathering on much more expensive products with excellent reviews from Amazon . How could a product purchased in the supermarket do a better job ? Got news for you Olay trumps them . My skin was actually softer and looked less lizard like . Loved that it was fragrance free . Sometimes I overdid the amount I needed so just scooped it up and used it elsewhere . Experiment with the amount your particular skin texture needs . It is n't Crisco . This led me down the Olay path of skin care and I have n't looked back.I added the following to my arsenalOlay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum , Fragrance Free , 1.7-Fluid Ounces , Olay Complete Night Fortifying Moisture Cream 2 Oz , Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl OzandOlay Exfoliating Renewal Cleanser 6 Fl OzYay to better skin !	1
I 've used this moisturizer for a couple of years . Great daytime moisturizing product . Not at all greasy . Easily absorbed and does a great job . With Subscribe and Save the price and convenience only make this better !	1
This product is amazing . I am 33 years old with combination skin and have always struggled with breakouts . I was looking for something that would prevent aging and reduce the impact of smoking on my skin without causing acne . Olay Total Effects moisturizer has meant incredibly smooth , soft skin and no more breakouts ! Plus , it is SPF 15 so there is some sun protection included.Also , unlike most other moisturizers I have used , this absorbs well and does not cause unsightly beads of sweat to form on my forehead after application . The only thing I did not like was the scented version as the smell is insanely oppressive , but there is an unscented version available so that problem is easily solved.I highly reccommend this product !	1
This is non greasy and works just like the manufactures says it works . Use it mornings and at night . Also it is packaged well .	1
I love Olay skin care but I have sensitive skin and need fragrance free products . I was having trouble finding this in the stores but leave it to Amazon to come to the rescue . Great price and great moisturizer ! ! Thanks Amazon ! !	1
for a couple years i have been purchasing this oil of olay moisturizer for around 25 dollars at cvs and am amazed to find it at amazon for around 10 dollars ... wow ... now i can use it on my chest and hands in addition to my face and neck ...	1
this product works very well for me ... im 33 and keeps my face fresh looking ... love all olay products . Ive tried a lots of brands before ... Olay helped me decide to stick with it for a while..a long long while	1
i mix this with Booster C Powder and i 've notice a big difference in only two weeks . No foundation Needed .	1
I have always had normal to combination skin . I would often get many breakouts but needed a moisturizer for my face daily as I would get dry skin as well . I also get eczema on my skin in the winter . I have found when using this product you only need a pea size drop and just dot it in different areas on your face and blend lightly ( if you blend too hard or much you will irritate your skin ) . If you apply too much you get the oily effect and it does n't work as well . I found that is the right amount and if you use daily you do n't need anymore than that . I 've had many compliments since using this product saying my skin looks fabulous and with a glow . It has helped my face dramatically . I have tried many products and this one is the only one that does n't cause me breakouts and has improved my complexion . It 's definitely pricey and not much comes in the bottle , but if you do n't overuse and use a pea size amount everyday it should last a bit . I do wish it did n't cost as much as I would stock up on more of this moisturizer . I am in my mid-twenties and use the 7-in-1 fragrance free one . It does n't have any smell or does not leave skin oily .	1
It can be hard to find a moisturizer without fragrance , and especially without sunblock ( if I 'm not going in the sun , I do n't want sunblock ) ! It 's even harder to find these things in a product that actually makes a difference in your skin . This is good stuff !	1
silky texture and fragrance-free . packaging with pump will keep the ingredients stable during use . olay always provides good products with good prices .	1
It 's perfect for normal to oily skin and has SPF 15 in it : ) but wash your hands before you touch your eyeliner brush it really stings if it gets in your eyes , a lot of moisturizers in the past have n't .	1
I just joined the Amazon Prime this month after a 30 day trial ... I was surprised to find you can add 4 people to the account ... I added my Mom , and these items were for her..I can only speak from how easy all that was to do..I added , she ordered..no hassles , no worries , all done fast and right ... I have used this in the past , and of course never stayed with a product long enough to see any true results because in my mind it should have happened quicker than any change I was seeing.. that said using some really expensive facial cleansers , and creams , serums , and masks left me feeling the same way ... So I chose the items that really impressed me or put on a short list to try again..Some say to stay with all one line , but I 've found some agree with my skin others do n't ..So that 's how I got started on * The Path * { better shampoo , conditioner , skin care , nails , pedicures , hair removal products , the list goes on } I use a great toner , facial cleanser , day cream { this one rocks , I wear very little make-up , so I have had no problem with make-up flaking or melting off from the heat ..Is my quest over , probably not , as I hear a few new products are hitting the shelves..Now that I can order the ones I want , at a savings , with 2 day shipping , free to boot , if it is part of the Prime allowed items..I 'm pleased as punch..One thing I 'm not liking , on the save and subscribe items is that some items I like are not on the list yet ... hint , hint , add some more please.. : - ) )	1
I have only used this for the last couple of weeks . I break out very easily , and was worried this would break me out , but it has n't ! ! Yay ! ! I use this once a day in the morning under my makeup . I love the sunscreen smell . It is very light and feels good on my skin . I am mainly using it to prevent wrinkles . I do n't have any yet , so I ca n't comment on this making them less noticeable . I think my skin looks only better , though . I have had a male co-worker say I look `` fresh '' just out of the blue . It makes my skin look real healthy and dewy . No acne and just really nice looking skin . So I am very happy .	1
Ole Olay ! Olay is the only moisturizer I use these days . I admit I have tried others , I always go back to Olay . Well done , Olay , well done .	1
It 's light and helps my skin to look great . I recommend it to everyone I know . I especially love it for overnight .	1
I have been using this product for years and people always comment on how young-looking my skin is . It 's deceiving because it 's very rich feeling when it first goes on but it absorbs quickly and never feels greasy . An excellent product .	1
I am afan of olay 7in 1. it is perfect for my combination/dry skin . and it is non-greasy . and the spf is a plus .	1
I 've only been using this moisturizer for a little over a week and I can already feel the difference in my skin . My foundation goes on smoothly and my skin feels moisturized all day . I have been using Aveeno for years but I like this moisturizer so much better.I work at a skilled nursing facility and the residents with the nicest skin ALL say that they 've been using Oil of Olay for decades . If that does n't make you want to try it for yourself , I do n't know what will .	1
I have used this lotion for two years , it is comfortable lightweight and helps protect against sun damage . I trust the Olay brand .	1
After hearing so many great things about this moisturizer for the past few years , I really wanted to try it . I actually tried it about two or three years ago and found it to be too heavy . But I think my problem was not the moisturizer but the face wash I was using . I had always thought my skin was oily , so I was constantly using products designed for oily/acne prone skin . I think I was drying my skin out , causing it to produce extra oil to compensate . Anyway , I 'm now using the Olay Daily Facials for Normal skin , which work great . Up until about 3 months ago , I was using Olay Complete moisturizer for Normal skin , which was working fine but I wanted something with anti-aging properties , since I just turned 30.Since I 've been using the Total Effects , I 've noticed that my skin is softer . It also appears to be a little brighter . The tone is evened out some , as well . I sometimes get a little redness around my cheeks and nose . That has not completely gone away but it is diminished . I have some fine lines across my forhead that seem smaller now , especially if I moisturize before bedtime ( I use the Total Effects Night Firming Cream ) but more often than not , I go to bed without washing my face or moisturizing . Also , I use the Fragrance Free version ( with SPF ) and it truly is free of any perfumes . The only smell I get is from the SPF.I like the pump design but it is a little difficult to tell how much is left in the bottle . I have to hold it up against a light to judge the amount . One bottle has lasted me from the beginnng of August until now ( Oct. 21 ) and there is a little left , which I expect to run out any day now , so about 3 months . I was getting about a year out of the Olay Complete bottle , which is 6 oz , so it would be nice if this came in a larger bottle.I 'm very pleased with this moisturizer and will continue to use it , along with my other Olay products .	1
Love this..it 's a great moisturizer with no smell . I 'm highly sensitive to smells so this works great for me . I use it twice a day .	1
love this alot , I use this in the morning and micro sculpting at night my skin stays soft all through the winter and no drying !	1
Do n't laugh . My wife has been using this for years and I tried it on my face for my drying skin . Later I used it on my hair as a conditioner at night and the hair is not dry after shampooing and drying the next morning . Amazing . At Amazon prices you can do this . If I were buying from retailers the cost would be a little too high to do this although I still might since it makes hair shinny and easy to control without being greasy . I know I sound like a girl . So be it .	1
This moisturizer is PERFECT for me during the summer/spring/fall ! It is not oily at all , has spf in it , and is very moisturizing ! It does n't make your skin or hands greasy , which is great for me , as I have oily skin . However , in the winter , my skin does tend to dry out and I do find that I need something a bit heavier , so I use the night cream . For most days though , this is perfect !	1
I 've tried many different moisturizers . I 've been looking for something that helps with the fine lines , but does n't make my face greasy or clog my pores . I love this moisturizer ! It feels like velvet , absorbs quickly , and does n't cause my face to break out . The description says it 's unscented , but it does have a very , very light fragrance . It 's not perfumey , just fresh and clean . I 'm on my second bottle and I can absolutely see a difference in the texture of my skin .	1
If this was the version with SPF , I would have given this a 5 star . However , Amazon does n't sell the version with sun protection .	1
I love my Olay products . This moisturizer goes on great , is n't greasy and has an SPF which we ladies should use daily . The pump is nice because it helps prevent pouring out too much at once . Using this along with my other Olay products leaves my skin soft , tighter and protected .	1
This product definitely helps keep the face well moisturized all day . I even saw a nice improvement in my skin tone . It 's nice to not have to worry about UV rays when I have this on as well . There was no problems with acne at all - but I ca n't say it `` helped '' it either . Overall great investment .	1
I love this cream . My skin gets dryer in cool weather and this bit greasy cream is what i need ! No stretching feeling at all ! Drys very fast !	1
It 's hard to know how to review this . I 've been using it for a few months and while i have n't noticed any radical changes in my skin ( my fine lines are still there ) , it is still my favorite moisturizer . I decided on this product based on the review at beautypedia.com , it seems to be a reliable product . It goes on very smoothly and dries quickly , you do n't need to use too much . It does smell slightly like sunscreen lotion , but I do n't mind . I like the pump design , and if you have read up on moisturizers you might have heard that you should n't use any product in a jar because it is constantly being exposed to air and bacteria . The packaging , spf , and anti aging aspects are unbeatable at this price ( mine was $ 14 on Amazon at the time ) .	1
I offer no recommendation as to the effectiveness of this product . My wife likes it . Any husband , of long standing , who expresses an opinion on an anti-aging products effectiveness better make sure he weighs his words carefully . After careful consideration , my wife likes it .	1
My husband gets severely chapped hands during the winter . When our doctor saw his hands , he recommended the Aveeno . We have been very pleased with its effectiveness.One of the better lotions out there .	1
This is a good lotion/moisturizer . I use it on my face because I have extra sensitive and combination/oily skin . I am proud to say that this lotion does not break me out and it helps to control my oil in a way ( even though its not oil free ) . I recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin but if you have EXTREMELY oily skin I would say this may not be for you because it helps with oil about 85 % .	1
While I 'm not overly enthusiastic about the scent of this unscented product that is easily remedied by the addition of any essential oil I want to add before slathering this on my skin . The main ingredient seems to be Oat Kernel Flour and that is the main reason I buy this product.The skin calming and healing qualities of oatmeal are almost immediately apparent . Within a few days of using this product you will notice a difference in your skin.This lotion absorbs easily , it is smooth , healing and a creamy comforting addition to your day . If you enjoy scented lotions , try the Aveeno Stress Relief Moisturizing Lotion . I also enjoy using the Aveeno Body Wash and Soaps.If you want to scent this product , buy some rose oiland add a few drops . Rose oil helps to balance your emotionsand that in itself will help your skin.~The Rebecca Review	1
This is a nice alternative to the oily sunblocks out there on the market . Sure , it does n't have the scent of coconut oil , but some of us are allergic to that anyway.So , this is a nice sunblock for us sensitive skin types and it is oil-free and non-irritating , not to mention non-comedogenic . Basically , you can use this on your face and it wo n't block your pores.This cream seems really rich and creamy and then suddenly it just disappears into your skin and feels very light and not oily.Highly recommended for when you are out and about in the sun this summer ! ~The Rebecca Review	1
Good product if you are fair-skinned and burn easy . I took this lotion to Florida to the beach and I did not burn . There were no heavy scents and it absorbed well into the skin .	1
A lot of products claim to be made for sensitive skin , yet , I always found a sensitivity to them became apparent after a few uses , regardless of brand or pricing . Not with Neutrogena Sensitive Skin Sunscreen Lotion . I 'm into one year of use and absolutely NO reaction !	1
After the first night of using this product , I saw an obvious reduction in my pimple . The pimple was not gone completely , but it was definitley smaller and less visible . Although product says it 's a gel , it 's more of a white , pastey cream . The main con is that I paid $ 6.00 for the product on Amazon , and I have since seen the same product in the local dollar store for half the price .	1
I hope they never stop selling this acne medication because it is the best and is great under make-up to control the oil ... scrub is amazing too ! ! !	1
I 've had bad acne for some time and now its coming back again I started using this as soon as I got it and saw results overnight ! ! ! ! I 'm so thankful for this product	1
I dont care who you are , waking up with an unsightly blemish can ruin your day . There are so many products on the market that are supposed to help get rid of zits that zapzyt was just another one on the list for me to tackle and wait for results . without needing to go into nitty gritty details Ill break down the pros and cons of this particular treatment : pros:1 ) If you use this product on a daily basis you will notice a decrease in oil in areas that you have problems with . When Im feeling particularly hormonal I will place a small amount in my daily lotion and rub all over my face to help control the oil and bacteria that my skin is coming in contact with,2 ) It is very inexpensive . for someone like myself that does not suffer from acne all the time and just has an occasional pimple here or there the size and price are just right3 ) many acne medications are too harsh , using acid bases to dry up your blemish , which in turn ALWAYS drys out my face . this product is basically an aspirin substance and I dont wake up with dry patches.4 ) there are no miracle creams that make your pimples fall off , and preventative steps are always the most helpful in controlling breakouts . I tested this on a pimple that was fairly deep and painful on my jawline and it reduced the swelling and redness and the next day it was basically gone.cons:1 ) I noticed that after I had rubbed some in , and I was in public , that I had a white outline where it had dried . luckily this was not that noticeable but non the less embarassing when i realized I had gone half my day with weird white chalky stuff on my face nicely highlighting my pimple.2 ) This is not available everywhere and I have only seen it sold on Amazon.this is a solid 4 out of 5 star product !	1
This stuff helps me with my zits . It works ! And there 's more in the tube than the moreexpensive stuff , and it 's the same thing ! I recommend it .	1
I ordered this product to combat acne both for my face and body ( arms shoulders etc ) So far it has worked wonderfully and I am pleased with the decrease in breakouts and how quickly existing acne is fading . I am not using three times a day as reccomended as I have extremely sensitive skin and tend to be conserative with any new creams , but so far so good no irritation !	1
I basically lived in the isles of Rite Aid before I found this thing.If you combine it with a sacylic acid cream is it amazing.at night when I have a zit , I clean the area with alochol and apply the cream in the morning wash it off and its shrunk.I repeat everynight until it is completely gone . of course I rub my face in shea butter every morning~ and sometimes bio oil.But , this product is amazing and the price is a lot less than clearisil and others . it really isnt a bad product it is the SAME as clearisiljust less money . ( SAME INGREDIENTS ) do n't be fooled by impaitent and oblivious people . this product works ! ! : ) and if you apply it during day time be sure to rub it in good and apply a moisturizer over it lightly~ hope this helps ! ! this dosent cure dark spots but it will have yuor face smooth within weeks~ ( for me 1 week ... for you ; mabye more ( 3weeks ? ) )	1
I picked ip a tube of this when I could n't find my usual , more expensive Benzoyl Peroxide foam at the drug store . This treatment gel worked just as well for my mild acne . It took me a while to figure out , but I would highly recommend Benzoyl Peroxide over Salicylic Acid , which usually just made my skin worse .	1
this is a super product for people who dont get a lot of acne and just need a spot clear up ... This is super get rid of the acne without over drying .	1
My husband has been using this product on his back acne for years . First time I saw it in Maximum Strength . It 's the only product that worked for him and we tried many of them . All over the counter . He 's 55 so it might work on anyone will body acne .	1
Nothing is better than to be slapped with bay rum after a hot shave . Well , something is better but I ca n't say it out loud . But it does involve bodily fluids . Every man should have a bottle of bay rum in their arsenal.Women love bay rum . If she does n't love it then you need to find a new woman .	1
Clubman Bay Rum is one of the very few bargain priced after shaves that can still be found at some local drug stores . ( It 's available at Walgreen 's here locally ) . Over the years I have tried a lot of different bay rum after shaves . Its one of those old time scents that never seems to go out of style , and is widely available under many different brand names . Clubman 's bay rum is a blend apart from the rest . Its dark color reflects its strength . Both in its oil base and its alcohol content . It is in my opinion the strongest bay rum after shave I have ever tried . I would hesitate to recommend the Clubman if you 're one that tends to avoid after shaves with a lot of sting to them , irregardless of whether you enjoy its scent or not . However if its a strong , vibrant , stimulating after shave you happen to enjoy , I highly recommend the Clubman 's . Its the strongest most refreshing you will find if that is your preference . And at 12 0z for what Amazon asks for it , it remains a solid bargain ...	1
Very gentle on my skin and surprisingly cleared up my acne . Before I had always used things like proactive , clearasil and other medicated washes to clear it up , but they were very damaging to my skin and it was n't clearing it up . Now my skin is almost completely clear , no longer oily and nice and smooth . Very gentle and removes all of my makeup as well .	1
My face is oily but it can gets really dry during the winter . This cleanser is perfect for both situations . I would like this even more if it comes with fragrance but Cetaphil products normally do n't come with fragrance .	1
smells great and easy on the face ... cleans off all makeup and face feels clean , and smooth . plus its all natural !	1
Sick of wasting money on hoity-toity lines that only managed to make my oily skin oiler or worse yet scaly ( ! ) I decided to find a cheaper , more effective option . I 've been using my bottle of & quot ; Cetaphil Daily Facial Cleanser & quot ; for months now and though the big clunky bottle is n't pretty , I can easily stuff it in my closet away from all but the most nosiest guests . My nose has been spoiled by the fruity stuff I 've tried in the past and this cleanser is a bit stinky , a little chemically , but this stuff does the job ! It 's a clear , liquid soap-like formulation that does n't foam or even bubble up all that much but it does a great job of removing makeup excepting , of course , that pesky waterproof stuff that requires days of scrubbing to remove all remnants . My skin does n't feel tight after washing only exceptionally clean . My oiliness is about the same as it 's always been but it takes more than a cleanser to cure that particular problem . I will buy this as long as the company continues to make it but I 'll probably buy a nice decanter to dump it into ; )	1
Ca n't remember how I stumbled onto this product , but am very glad I did . It works really well and I like that it removes my makeup well too .	1
Love it ... ... ... ... ... it cleans skin wounderful , if u boil hot water on the stove.steam it , take a hot washcloth and let it soak for about 1 min , cool the cloth down it a lilcold water.. put the cloth on your face let it sit there for about 1 min to open your pores.take a lil bit of facial cleanser and rub it on your face , then rinse of with cold water ... skin comes outlooking like milk.. wait about 2 mins then put your favorite moisturizer on your skin , head out the door.and start your day.. trus me .	1
Superior product . Should never be more than $ 5 , do not get overcharged ! Thick and concentrated , but not greasy . I apply 2x a day to my thighs and stomach to help improve my skin 's stretching power . Also , I layer this over the Massage Lotion for Stretch Marks , as suggested . Smells good and moisturizes all night until I shower next morning . Make sure to apply when your skin is already moist , otherwise will have no effect . Have gone through 4 tubes so far in my pregnancy . Highly recommend .	1
I bought this for my friend . She says thhe massage cream is very good , and the price is also good too .	1
I still got stretchmarks even with religious use of this product . After asking my doctor and reading books and online articles , I 'm not sure if stretchmarks is something you can avoid by rubbing in some cream . I think genetics and your body shape plays a factor , too . I mean I have friends who just used plain old olive oil and coconut oil and did n't get stretchmarks . I had friends who did n't do anything and did n't get stretchmarks . Then there are gals that tried everything and still got stretchmarks.I still give it 4 stars because it 's inexpensive enough that if you want to try it , it 's very affordable . Plus it smells great and has a great texture . Rubs in easily and is a nice way to relax and bond with you baby in utero while giving yourself a little R & R ; time and a belly massage . And this cream is very hydrating . I sometimes apply to hands and feet as well and it works great.If you want to try , go for it . Ca n't hurt !	1
I love this cream ! I used it during my first pregnancy and I did n't get any stretch marks and I 'm using it again .	1
This product is perfect after shaving , it leaves the skin very soft and hydrated all day long . I really enjoy it .	1
Product arrived damaged . Other than that , a good item to add to my bathwater during my pregnancy to provide some moisture during a long soak . Not really effective as a standalone moisturizer , though . Light fragrance and non-greasy feel . Would purchase again , exclusively for use in bath or shower .	1
I am Indian and convinced my genes have left me with dry skin . Living in the northeast makes it no better . I have been using this oil for years throughout the winter . Got my dad hooked on it too . Bought 5 bottles at once to make sure I do n't run out !	1
I 've been wanting to purchase a body oil ever since I received one as a sample . I went to Target one day & unexpectedly found this with the rest of the Palmer 's stuff . I did n't even know they had a body oil ! I saw the price & quickly put it in my basket . This stuff works so well ! Ever since using this after every shower my boyfriend now says all the time how soft my skin is ( he does n't even know I use body oil ! ) . 4 reasons you should purchase this : Palmer 's does n't test on animals , low price , smells so good , & it works !	1
Does a great job of moisturizing my dry skin . I use it every day . Has a great scent , too . Highly recommend it .	1
I bought this oil to make bath bombs . It is a good oil to use as there is no smell or greasiness to it . It was reasonably priced . I got it quickly thru Amazon . I would buy again .	1
I like this a lot . I always use this right before I get out of the shower and put lotion afterwards . It will make your skin feeling soft and smooth and it last really long .	1
I have very dry skin in the winter , I have tried all kinds of oil when I get out of the shower . So far this is the best one I have tried . It smells great , goes on smoothly and blends in easily . I live that is also has Vitamin E. I would highly recommend this oil . I also use the Palmers cocoa butter lotion which is also very good .	1
This oil moisturized great and was really silky going on and made my skin feel very silky as well and moisturized especially after showerin while skin is still damp . It smells like all cocoa butter products a chocolatey smell and it was a decent size bottle to last for a while . I love this oil	1
My skin is feeling and looking so much better after using Palmer 's Cocoa Butter Formula moisturizing body oil ; it really does softens and has a very light scent .	1
I love this stuff ! I put it on after the shower and before I put on cocoa butter and my skin is soft ! Smells nice but does not linger .	1
My favorite oil ever . For some reason they do n't sell it in stores anymore ? I do n't know why . THis is the only oil I 'll use on my skin !	1
I use this in my bath and I love how soft it makes my skin and it has helped fade the scar and marks I do have so I am always pleased with this	1
I love this oil . Its like crack . I use it in the tub when I take baths and when I get out . I have very dry skin and this keeps me moisterized	1
I have had a few of these and I love it ! ! ! I ordered their newer model and ended up giving it to a friend . I have very thick hair and it tends to be puffy and on the wavy side . After I blow dry my hair , I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully . I can also flip my sides back and the bottom length under . I hope that this is n't going to be discontinued . It works way better than their newer model ! Please keep making these . I recently ordered another because it works so well !	1
I love and live by this tool . I have been using this since I was in junior high and I am now 27 . I have a layered hair cut , and this gives me he right amount of curl in towards the face that I have always loved . It smoothes my hair , gives it bounce and body , and gives me the layered around my face look . I love it . It makes my hair look so much better than any old hair dryer and brush combo could . I have always gotten compliments on my hair , and I always attribute it to this hair tool . It is my beauty secret , if you will . It is something I will never be without . I use it daily and my hair is still healthy , so I believe it is less damaging than a normal curler . I ca n't live without it.I took off a star because these things do not last long at all . Some break within 2 months , some last almost a year . I 've been using these for so long and I have gone through a tone . However , I have yet to find a product that compares with my hair , and I can usually pick one up for fifteen to twenty dollars , so I feel it is well worth the bargain.I should also point out that I only always use the stiff bristled brush that comes with it . It combs out all the tangles and locks them that way , so it leaves the hair great looking all day.I also do find that after the initial curling that my hair relaxes a tiny bit through out the day , but that just makes the curl and body look more natural.I have also had my hair all different lengths from hitting just at my shoulder to down the middle of my back and have always used this - no matter then length , it always smoothes and pefects . It 's a wonderful tool , even if it does n't last long . Although , it might not last because I use it almomst daily ! Also , I would like to point out , I often switch between different types of shampoo/conditioner , from Pantene , Tresemee , Pureology , Biolage ... and no matter which type I use , I always get the same results ... from cheap to expensive.Give it a shot for salon perfect hair !	1
Although this says that this item is a Curling combo I use this to straighten my hair . I find that straighteners pull my hair out and cause it to be flat and lifeless and times . However I find that when I use this to straighten my hair I am able to have more body and volume . I found it easy to use and it did what I wanted it to do !	1
I like this hair tool so much I purchased another one to keep in my travel case . It 's the perfect , easy to use styler for my hair .	1
I have been looking for a replacement for my Jilbere including contacting the company . A friend told me about this one and I ordered 2 , will likely order 2 more for back ups . This is a perfect finish styler as long as u do n't use the brush bristles which can tear the ends of your hair . I recommend this unit to all my clients that have hair 4 inches or longer . Again , this is a FINISH styler and not intended to drive your hair from the beginning .	1
very good hot air brush . it 's easy to use and make your hair shiny and curly too . it 's very worth your money . the quality is more than the price ! ! ! ! love it .	1
I bought this hoping I would n't have to blow out my hair and then flat iron or curl it . It does work but my hair is not as FULL as it would be if I blow it out first however it does come out really shinny ! Both attachments give a different look so try them both . I gave it 4 starts only because it 's really LOUD and I wish it had my power but I still like it .	1
It 's a great product . I have had two before and my last one , of three years , died finally so I went to buy a replacement but could not find one anywhere . This Hot Air curling iron is a great price and it works great for my hair , which is on the thicker side and wavy . I can do anything from baby-doll curls with this thing to soft shiny waves or use it to shine my hair and give it some shape after straightening . It 's a good multipurpose tool.The shipment on this thing was crazy fast . I ordered it and the third day it came to me . I did a test just now to see if it works and it does . Nothing was wrong with the packaging or the product . When I need one again I will defiantly buy from this person/business again .	1
There are those of us , of a certain age , who never managed the technique of holding a hair dryer and a round brush at the same time . We grew up in the era of long natural straight hair . Now we live at a time when more styling devices are required . This is a great tool for getting curl or body into hair while holding only one object . Be sure to have your hair damp-dry before you start , or styling will take forever . The motor is small , and does n't & # 34 ; blow & # 34 ; very strongly . Get the majority of the water out of hair first , and you will be ok .	1
My recommendation for this hair dry is that the customers try . I really like to use it when my hair is wet . It dries your hair quickly , the hair is shinny , soft and manageable . I 've had it for a few months now and I like it so far . I do n't have anything negative to say about this product .	1
I 'm so glad Conair still makes this item . I 've tried other brands and other sizes , but this one is perfect for mid length , fine hair and the options of 2 sizes allow you to style hair in various ways .	1
I like the mirror , it lights up but the light is n't that bright in my opinion it 's kind of small but it 's a gd beginner mirror .	1
WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY VANITY AREA ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM . CAN USE IT FOR MAKE UP AND FIXING MY HAIR . GREAT BUY ! ! VERY STURDY .	1
Quick shipping which I enjoy.Plus the mirror is so cute defenitely something I like.Made my eyebrow plucking and makeup application much easier .	1
Received product in perfect condition and timely . Use it every day.Second one I have owned as I find the older you get the more you need magnification . I broke my other one and plan on being more careful with this one . Would order from company again .	1
Since I started using it my skin has definitely gotten clearer . I would recommend this to anyone , negative reviews are over exaggerated . This is easy to use , very straight forward .	1
I love this , my mom purchased it for my birthday . I use it when I want to give my face special treatment . It also help to open up my sinuses , it 's nice to have this on hand !	1
I needed a facial steamer because I got tired of using hot rags or awkwardly placing myself over a boiling hot sink . I steam my face daily to help open pores and before I do any at-home facials . 10 minutes with this steamer will do the trick . It does take a while to get going ( about 10 minutes ) but holds enough water to steam your face for at least 20 minutes at a time.Not bad for the price .	1
I 've had a conair facial sauna for years ( and it was still working fine when I lost/misplced it ) so I had to try another Conair.Well , this is perfect , even better than the first one I got . Why ? It 's got that safety timer , it tells you when it 's ready , it comes with two cones to choose from . Plus , it comes with this free exfoliating brush and sponge . So nice . I used it last night and now my skin 's glowing beautifully , like it got a polishing . It 's a nice way to pamper yourself.Great price too !	1
I bought mine a few years ago . It 's absolutely great . Even my kid ( boy age 15 ) loves it . It 's very therapeutic and relaxing . I love steaming my face and then cleansing with a clay mask or using the oil cleansing method . Very good buy and I do n't feel the need to spend almost $ 200 for a `` professional '' brush . This works well enough for me and I am quite satisfied .	1
I purchased this product to alleviate symptoms from seasonal allergies . Every spring my eyes itch and I 'm constantly sneezing . Most allergy medications are too expensive and/or ineffective or cause drowiness . After researching the benefits of steam treatements for people like me I purchased the Conair Facial Sauna . I realize this product is designed for cosmetic reasons but it does the same thing the more expensive allergy/sinus steam machines do for a third of the price . I used it at night for 5 minutes and my eyes stop itching and I get restful sleep . I do n't know if this product makes the skin glow as some other reviewers have claimed but it could n't hurt . I would purchase again .	1
i love using this before i use a face mask , let it open up my pores so they can get in deep . i use it with a towel over my head to get more of the steam without resting my face on it . its not too hot . it feels really really good .	1
I purchased this in the middle of a head cold and pounced on using it . I was finally able to get some relief that I could get in the shower or in a closed bathroom with the hot water steaming up the room . This concentrated the steam where I needed it . I did not find it too hot , so that is great . It is also great for opening pores before I do a mask or use a strip to remove those pesky blackhead that get in one 's nose .	1
Great product ... good price ... .Conair Facial Sauna Systems with Timer ... .Very nice for `` Me '' time works well and I would recommend to others . The brush is a bonus item ! ~	1
I love this product and quite frankly I 'm kinda mad it took me this long to discover it . I have extremely oily skin and constantly struggle with acne . With this product I am able to get a deeper clean for my skin and improve my complexion . It is very relaxing as well . I play some soothing music in the background and I feel like I 'm at the spa ! Excellent way to end a busy day .	1
I 've used this 4x already and it works well ; it is very relaxing . It was just the cheap little steamer unit I was looking for . I steam my face then cleanse it while my pores are open ... or steam my face with my favorite mask on ( Eminence Clear Skin Probiotic Masque Skin Care , 2 Ounce ) to help it penetrate more deeply . I 'll update this review if the unit ever fails so folks can see how long it lasted . : )	1
The first one arrived & the facial sauna worked fine , but the little facial scrubber did n't . Amazon replaced the entire package and everything works fine . Is it like going to the spa and getting a facial ? No . But then I did n't pay as much for this little device as the spa paid for the one they use . The steam is n't a lot , it 's gentle . I did put a towel over my head & that helped . The sinus attachment works well . I am pleased with the purchase .	1
Super fast shipping and great price.It Works amazing for my little spaDays and Everything was just whatI thought they would be .	1
This piece piece is great . You absolutely need it for a great and healthy skin . j k k k k	1
I love this machine . Could I say anymore ... I will . I like to keep my face clean , and steam is the easiest , safest and more effective way to do this . It really clears the pores and gets all the gunk out , while adding moisture to the skin , then I rinse with cool water and put on a mask and my skin is happy and clean . You can use it every day , or night and the results will be amazing.It works well for your sinuses too . I put this on my counter and lean over it , just do n't wiggle it or hit it while it is on . It has been safe for me and heats up fast . I really love my machine.The brush was great , it worked well to cleanse before the steam , but it is n't waterproof and eventually broke .	1
I love love love this sauna . It is very relaxing w/some tranquil music playing before you wash/moisturize your face . thanks	1
When you have a cloged nose or just want to relax in general it 's a great . It helps you think and unwind . Great product and well worth the buy !	1
I absolutely love this ! I 'm even buying another one for my aunt ! If you have ever gotten a true facial before you would know that they do n't just drown your face with the steam it 's light and moved around different areas , and that is what this sauna does ! Just loved it ! Probably would like it to be somehow I did n't have to bend over for it , but if you stack it up right it 's much easier !	1
This works amazing . I had no idea it was going to be so professional . Will be buying more as gifts .	1
This was exactly what I wanted , at an unbeatable price.I was looking for a sinus solution ( Neti Pots work great , but sometimes I want something more soothing ) . I looked at all the different facial saunas/steamers , and the Conair was the best value ( at $ 22/free shipping ) , with the two attachments , and some extras.This works great for me - just put in a couple ounces of water , wait about 60 seconds , and it pumps out steam.I 've used the facial attachment , and also the sinus attachment - and have had nice , soft pores this winter ! Just inhale deeply for about 3-5 minutes , then blow your nose gently , and all those irritants and particles will come out . Repeat if you still feel some `` junk '' up in your sinus passages . It even works when you 're stopped up - the steam will definitely work its way through your sinus passages and loosen any mucus . For me , the sinus pressure almost always goes away within a few minutes.One more note - I 'm not necessarily loyal to the Conair brand . This just seemed like the best value , and it 's worked well . It seems to be a durable machine , and has performed flawlessly . But whatever you do , please consider using steam , neti pot , saline sprays , or something other than chemicals and prescription drugs to deal with sinus pressure . Be kind to your body ! One family member developed permanent health problems from over-reliance on things like prescription drugs & Tylenol Sinus , when natural options like this are faster , safer , and cheaper.As I said , the Conair also works great as a facial spa/sauna , though my family uses it primarily to clean sinuses . Hope this helps in your purchasing decision !	1
Good for skin and sinuses . My skin is so smooth afterwards , so clean . Especially if you follow witha mask . And during allergy season , you 'll breathe better .	1
Personally I think that this sauna works great . I 've used it for a facial steamer and it heats up fast and gives out a great amount of steam . Also when my sister was sick we used it as a vaporizer and added some liquid camomile and mint to the water to help sooth her head cold .	1
I love this little thing ! For the price it work great ! Makes you feel like you are in a spa .	1
We all know that when you buy a product , you should n't actually expect it to do what the ads claim it will do . At best , you can hope for a mildly effective effort on its part . Not with this sauna . After one use I was astonished at how smooth and glowing my face was , and kept touching my cheeks all day to feel how soft they were ! The steam is just right -- not too hot , yet effective -- although I had to put my face down into the opening in order to really get the benefit . The microderm abrasion tool also works as advertised to scrub your skin without causing any pain , and the moisturizer pad did a great job of working moisturizer into my skin . And , as I said , afterward my skin looked better than it ever has , and my pores looked cleaner than they have in years . In fact , I had a professional facial at a good day spa not a year ago , and I do n't remember having had results this good ! I recommend this product to everyone , without hesitation !	1
I 've been using this steamer for the last 9 years . My first lasted about 8 years , but got a little crusty by the end of it . The timer option is great so I do n't have to keep track of time . This one includes a convenient measuring cup . I was n't crazy about the exfoliation tool ( prefer to use a combo of Cetaphil and baking soda ) , but I guess it does the job . I use the steamer about 2x a week for blackheads .	1
Good for both males and females . It works well and we hope it continues to perform as well after time . Arrived on time .	1
I love this product . Its great for facials or if you are stuffed up and need to clear your sinuses . Makes your skin look good . Be careful not to get to close . Read the directions so you wont get a steam burn .	1
I use this with the Alba papaya peel and it work really well . The steam along with a peel helps my skin look and feel younger . The exfoliating brush is just meh though	1
They are very small , so they are good for on the go . They do n't pick up very much oil so if you have very oily skin they are not for you , if not they are fine . I do n't use them very often because they do n't do too much for me because I have decently oily skin .	1
I 've been using these for several years , and I try never to be without them . My face tends to get oily in the afternoons , and a quick dab all over with one of these completely takes care of it without disturbing my makeup . I took off one star because they are n't quite as big as I would like . If you 're oily enough that you need to use the whole sheet , you end up having to hold it by a spot that is already used and then you have your face oil on your fingers . If the sheets were a little bigger , that would n't be a problem . Overall , though , one of my favorite products .	1
I have combination skin , my chin and cheeks are quite dry , but my forehead can be rather oily ( especially with bangs ! ) This product works so great . It really helps take away the shine from my forehead and temples . I will definitely purchase again - great price !	1
Love these blotting papers - they work amazingly well ! I 've used a number of different brands ( blotting papers are a must have for me , otherwise my face turns into a disco ball mid-day ) and these are by far the best I 've ever used . I like that there 's no transfer of residue , since powder coated blotting papers can make you 're skin look blotchy , and that they really do pick up a ton of oil for a shine free look . Make-up for the most part remains undisturbed so long as you 'pat ' ( do n't rub ) . The Top Care Brand is the other blotter sheets that I carry when I find them in stores and they 're nearly identical in ingredients and packaging , except they run about a $ 1 less.Not that I 've seen anyone complain about this on Amazon , but every now and then you 'll find a review on Makeupalley where someone gets all in a tizzy over 'mineral oil ' being one of the listed ingredients . I 'm quite certain that these sheets do not contain mineral oil in the sense that they 've been 'coated ' with oil . The sheets themselves are polypropylene based ( plastic ) as opposed to traditional paper blotting papers and I believe the mineral oil is one of the ingredients in the manufacturing of these plastic sheets ( just as oil is often used in the manufacturing of other 'plastics ' ) . Just as one would n't worry about a plastic water bottle leaving an oily residue in their beverage , I would n't worry about the mineral oil used in making these sheets leeching out onto your skin . These sheets have never caused me to break out - highly recommend !	1
I do n't use too much makeup , maybe concealer sometimes , but my skin is super duper oily . So even if I use a sunblock , after a few hours , my skin will be very oily . So I use this sheets to remove the oil from my face . Its very easy to use- just take a sheet from the package and press it against your skin and that 's it ! The sheet will turn transparent as soon as it absorbs the oil from your skin . It saves so much time since applying powder foundation to your skin after every 2-3 hours is such a hassle .	1
I 've been using this product for years , and people tell me I look fabulous for my age . This lotion is cheap and effective and absorbs into the skin immediately . I 've tried other expensive creams and they do n't work as well as this one .	1
I had noticable difference in just a week ! I 've been using it for a year now and it 's an awesome product that absorbs well and leaves the skin soft and younger looking .	1
One of the sensitive skin products that I can use on my face without irritation . A decent product from a well-known company .	1
Recommend it does n't make my face oily like a lot of lotions on the market . Built in SPF is awesome also.Try it	1
I used this during the day for a couple months in conjunction with the Q10 night cream and it seemed to help soften the wrinkles I had started to notice . Does n't aggravate my acne prone skin and I like this lotion better than the night cream since the consistency is light and absorbs well and the smell is very minimal ( plain suntan/lotion smell ) . Works fine under my makeup . Would be great if they offered it with a slightly higher spf to last just a bit longer ( since I do n't reapply over my makeup ) .	1
It sometimes tough to find a good face lotion that protects you from the sun . I use this as a daytime lotion and it gets the job done !	1
I started using Eucerin products 25 years ago when my child 's pediatrician recommended it . They are all quality products that are consistently good for my skin and my children 's skin , and do n't cost a fortune . It is not always easy to get a good selection of Eucerin products where I live , so was thrilled to find them on Amazon .	1
i LOVE this product . i have been buying it for years , but lately have had trouble finding it in the local stores . i like this version , as it has Q-10 in it . i really think it help smooth fine lines . It is NOT greasy , it does n't have a fragrance , and a little goes a long way . I have SUPER-SENSITIVE skin and I have never had a problem with this moisturizer . It also does not clog your pores .	1
I have been using this lotion for quite some time - probably about 9 months now , and I absolutely love it . It 's lightweight and oil free and it makes a great base under foundation too . I love that it contains SPF too . A nice feature this product has is that it does n't leave that whitened look on your skin after application as a lot of lotions with sunscreen do . As far as the wrinkle prevention Q10 is concerned I have n't noticed any lessening of my lines of my face , but I also have n't noticed any new ones either so maybe it 's preventing new wrinkles ? Anyhow , this is a very nice lightweight SPF that feels nice on your face and wo n't break you out .	1
This works pretty well , but I have n't used it very much at all because I do n't have very long hair .	1
Gets the Job Done perfectly ! Curls my hair like a 100 dollar curling Iron , does an excellent job and it is also ceramic which makes my hair hair feel healthier !	1
This curling iron is pretty good , but it does not have a strong enough spring to keep hair in place when curling . I have learned to correct this by hair-spraying the strands of hair I am about to curl . Then I clamp the hair under the metal clip about an inch or two up from the end of the strand . If you try to clamp your hair at the tip -- it will not hold . You have to start an inch or two up from the edge to get it to hold . But if you do that , and if you hair spray it first -- this curler can make some excellent spirals . I give this item 4 stars because it was basically the cheapest ringlet curler I could find . And this product does give me the curl I want , it just takes a little bit of finesse . But if you want something stronger and easier to use , look elsewhere .	1
I recently purchased this curling iron at a mega-discount store while shopping for groceries . It was an impulse purchase . My usual pattern is to first check out reviews before I buy many new items . In that particular case , I am very , very glad that I did not check out the reviews first , because they would have prevented me from making this purchase ! I 'll never understand all the negative reviews here . Perhaps Revlon has updated this curling iron , and worked out all the bugs that reviewers are talking about.However , my experience is that this is a great product . First of all , it heats up immediately . It has a GREAT hold on the hair , so that it does not slip out of the iron as you work with it . That is a huge bonus for me . It helped me do my hair in half the time.If I am not doing anything special , I look for the easiest ways to do my hair without finishing up looking unkempt . With the Revlon Perfect Heat Professional Styling Iron , I was able to fluff-dry my hair ( without the pulling of a styling brush ) and finish off by taking several sections with the iron , letting them cool , and PRESTO -- my hair was done . I used a head band , back-combed the crown a bit and my hair fell into jumbo curls and waves without a too-poofy look.You ca n't ask for better than this .	1
This is the second curling iron of this type that I have purchased . After purchasing 3 other brands this is the only one that holds my hair . All of the others my hair slid right out of the iron . The price is very reasonable and gets hot very quickly .	1
While this curling iron is pretty standard I LOVE the heat resistant cover and auto off features . With teens using it , all the extra safety features are really nice to have .	1
I decided to drastically cut my hair last summer . It was to the middle of my back and I had it cut all the way up to around my chin . After I realized that my old curling iron ( 1.25 inch ) was n't really giving me the curls I wanted I bought this one . I had n't really thought about the fact that a larger barrell would only produce waves . My hair has since grown out to about shoulder length and this iron really does the trick . It heats up quickly , gives me great curls that last all day and was an exceptional value .	1
Anything I every purchase by revlon was cheap and works great as high pricey products . Packaging was great as if it was just light books were inside and delivery was perfect timing for me . If you have n't tried anything by revlon then I really recommend all there products and purchasing them from this seller when needed to . It 's really worth every cent you worked for and heats up in seconds when your on the go . I really have to complete the whole entire set by getting the other size barrels by revlon that works wonders on any type of hair.Thanks !	1
I really like this . It heats up quickly , stays hot , and that is all I need ! It is easy to handle , also . What more can I say ?	1
I own two of these , and I 'm looking to expand my collection as my hair grows out . I 've literally had 0 problems with it . I 've never owned a curling iron before this , so I admit , it 's something of a learning curve . But , it was simple enough and I look goooooodddd .	1
Love this iron , it heats up super fast and maintains the correct heat , wo n't cook your hair . It has tons of different heat settings . Its a must have .	1
Great spiral curling iron , reasonably priced , easy to use . This curling iron has lots of features . I would recommend this item .	1
This is my second iron from Revlon . I love it with the thick plastic ring at the end of the iron which leaves enough space for my fingers to turn the curler without burning my hand . I love it	1
i love this curling iron its amazing but i hate how your hair can get stuck in it but the price was amazing .	1
um.. well the only thing i can complain about this spiral iron would be that when i put it on its highest setting 30 i think it is , the little light that lets you know when it reaches that point that of heat mine never stops . a little frustrating but its no big deal	1
Would have given it a 5 but it does n't have have instant heat and the automatic turn-off [ a very nice feature ] sometimes turns off before I 'm finished . I 've had it 2 months and find it to be a nice size for my semi-short hair . It is easy to use , does the job and does n't tangle . I recommend it -- but buy it on sale .	1
I have been using this scrub ( sensitive skin , original , and the acne varieties ) for over 10 years now . It 's a great basic scrub that is inexpensive . I use it every morning in the shower and my makeup goes on a lot more evenly once I 've exfoliated with it . My best friend tried it out when she stayed over my place and has been using it ever since as well . Even my boyfriend loves it and says that it prevents ingrown hairs on his face and neck from shaving . This is a great scrub and I 'm going to keep buying it as long as St. Ives is making it . Try it , you wo n't be disappointed !	1
This scrub is amazing . Forget the other wannabes and stick with this brand . My skin is so smooth after I use this . I keep it in my shower and exfoliate twice per week .	1
I use to use this products some years ago and it worked great . Do n't know why I stop using it . I went to another product that was more expensive . However I went back to this product a week ago . I purchased it from Walmart for 3.00 a tube.It has worked great I use this scrub to clean my face , neck , body and my feet . This worked better than the scrub item that I had for my feet . I am telling you soak your feet and use this with a pumice stone and you will be amazed . I use Cetaphil lotion as the moisturizer for my face , body and feet . I am loving this inexpensive new regimen . I am telling you it works . My body looks so refreshed with all the dead skin gone . I even have got compliments on my skin in less than a week ... .I am going to buy the six tubes on Amazon because it will save me a couple of dollars from Walmart price.I am purchasing this not because it is inexpensive but I am purchasing it because it works ... ...	1
St. Ives does the job for me . I used the regular apricot scrub but turned to the gentle one after wondering if the product was to harsh on my skin on an everyday basis . I used this Gentle product everyday and have great results . My skin is clear and soft . It seems to do the job of the regular apricot scrub without the general harshness of it !	1
This stuff is awesome . I have sensitive skin and this really helps to exfoliate but is gentle on my skin .	1
Okay , so I 'm a guy ... but yes , once a week I scrub my face with St Ives Swiss Formula Apricot Scrub . I have gone through this ritual for about 20 years now . I 'm not crazy about the new scent , but this brand name item is the best out there . ( I 've used the generic ) . I 'm 45 years old while writing this review ... but I look at least 10 years younger . Is it because of St Ives or is it genetic ? I 'll never know ... but I 'm going to continue to use this product until I die . Keeps my face smooth ( makes it easier to shave with an electric ) and keeps my pores open . That 's about all I ever wanted to use this for and I believe it serves it 's purpose .	1
I 've been using this product for years . There is a lot of rough scrub in it but yet it really is good on sensitive and dry skin . Which I have both of . I do n't see myself changing from this product anytime soon . Probably a lifer on this one .	1
This is the best moisturizer for sensitive skin . I find that this product takes care of some of my skin ailments and produces a better complexion .	1
The first time I used this product ( over a year ago ) , I almost cried . A hypoallergenic moisturizer that was hydrating AND brightening AND from a brand that is organic and eco-friendly ? ? Heck yes ! It worked wonders for my dry , hypersensitive skin.However , this is the second time I 've purchased this and something seems & # 8230 ; different . It 's less hydrating ( I have to apply at least two layer for any moisture benefits ) and almost feels itchy ( although that may be due to the lack of moisturizing powers it has , not the formula itself ) . However , it still brightens and smells nice . I just use it in combination with another hypoallergenic moisturizer .	1
Avalon Organic Botanicals has created a rather smooth exfoliating enzyme scrub . This is a non-irritating product . In fact , the exfoliating granules are so small , they really are more of a secret ingredient . That makes this perfect for sensitive skin . It was interesting to see how well this product worked , when the gel looked so smooth . The fruit enzymes and gentle exfoliating granules do really smooth away all those dull surface cells.Ingredients : Certified Organic Lavender Floral Water ( lavandula officinalis ) , Certified Organic Aloe Barbadensis , Multi-Fruit Enzymes , Silica , Powdered Corn Meal ( zea mays ) , Certified Organic Extracts of Chamomile ( chamomilla recutita ) , Echinacea ( echinacea purpurea ) , Ginkgo Biloba , Green Tea ( camellia sinensis ) , and Lavender ( lavandula officinalis ) , Organic Sea Kelp Extract ( laminaria digitata ) , Methyl/Propylparaben , Pure Essential Oils100 % Vegetarian IngredientsIf you love lavender scented products , this will be a healing experience . Keep this in the shower for improved skin texture and clarity . If you are tired of dry flaky skin , give this a try.~The Rebecca Review	1
While I do like this product , it has n't seemed to lessen my acne at all . Also , the granules in the scrub are not fine ( as in small ) at all so if you have very sensitive skin this might not be for you . I like how my skin does feel more soft after using it and it does not dry it out at all .	1
I love this face wash ! It has a great scent and is made up of organic , natural ingredients ! Would recommend to anyone !	1
I 'll start by saying I have very sensitive skin , and this did not bother me , so that 's definitely a positive ! My skin is also very dry , and this is a nice thick , unscented cream that moisturizes without leaving a greasy feel . As far as the wrinkle reducing power , we 'll have to see . It claims visible results within 5 weeks , so I 'll have to wait a little longer . In the meantime , it 's a great moisturizer for sensitive skin for before bed and under my makeup in the morning .	1
I brought it reading the review and worth it , as it worked very good on my skin and keeps it moisturised all teh time .	1
This works great as wrinkle cream and just lotion . I use am and pm . Sometimes mixed with sunscreen . It is pretty thick so does not take much . Does not irritate my skin like a lot of lotions do . Will buy again .	1
Nice moisturizer , under makeup , I also use Olay regerist serum , underneath the cream . It works well , and has SPF too .	1
I have very sensitive facial skin . The slightest fragrance or unassuming offending chemical can cause rashes , stinging and all sorts of unpleasantness.I have tried many , many products . From high end premium brands to drugstore brands . I have found some high end brands that are truly great , but also very expensive.So based on reviews her on Amazon , and the reasonable price , I decided to try Eucerin Q10 . I have been using it for five days , and I love it . It is a thick , rich cream goes on smoothly and is absorbed rapidly . Skin feels really moisturized after application . I use it in the morning before makeup application and again at night before bed . Smooth skin and no irritations ! I ca n't say if it will deliver on promise to reduce facial line . I 'll let you know in six months.For those who are paraben sensitive , this creme does contain parabens . The creme is also a yellow color , which the box describes as being the intended color ( result of natural ingredients ) .	1
This creme is priced well , very hydrating , is not perfumey , and it does n't clog my pores . It wo n't make old wrinkles disappear , but since it 's so hydrating I do notice my wrinkles stand out a lot more when I do n't use it . Whether or not it prevents new wrinkles , I do n't know ; but , I do get told frequently I look much younger than I am . As a side note , I think it feels very nice and refreshing on the skin .	1
i have oily and acne prone skin . this is the only moisturizer that doesnt make me break out . i hope eucerin never stops making this !	1
Creamy texture is just right for my face -- not too heavy nor too light . I use it as night creme , and I wake up with my face smooth and no irritation ! I especially like its sensitive skin feature .	1
I 'm a cashier at Rite aid , and this guy came to my check stand and bought 2 of the Eucerin Q10 cremes . I asked him if it worked well , and his answer was pretty much `` it 's amazing and only rite aid sells it ! `` So since it was buy one get the second one 50 % off I decided to get the Q10 and the night creme.I get very dry skin , def when the whether is cold . It gets peely and red and it 's awful to deal with . Also , I tend to break out with this whether . I opened the container and I was happy that is was truly fragrance free ( my skin will break out with fragrances ) . The yellow color is from all the natural ingredients , it 's not bad at all . It 's a thicker cream , but when I apply it in the morning I can put make up over it and work all day and everything is good ! My dry , red skin is gone too . This creme is amazing . : )	1
I love it . This is my favorite creme . Going to buy day line with SPF . Read the reviews for far they are good .	1
A good product good value . It works as well as some of the really high priced department store brands . I would recomend this for night time and day time use .	1
I use this under my eyes and its works better than most eye cream yet its great for the whole face .	1
Used for about 2 months . Did seem to help soften the wrinkles that I had started to notice . Product absorbs quite well and is n't overly greasy although consistency is rather thick . I have acne prone skin and dry skin areas and while it did not aggravate my acne it did n't really help the dry areas either ( surprising considering the consistency ) . I hate strong perfume-y night cream on my face when I 'm trying to sleep ( which is one of the reasons I do n't care for olay products ) and this product could pass exactly for a tub of margarine or butter for color , smell , and texture . It was better than perfume but I did n't exactly love it , either .	1
I bought this for my sis because she has sensitive skin and most anti aging products irritate her skin , but Eucerin is very gentle and does n't irritate the skin at all .	1
This is a lot like the Nivea Visage Q10 that stopped coming to the US and you can buy online still ( made by the same company , Beiersdorf , in their factory in Poland ) . It 's impressively cheap , it moisturizes really well , you can use it morning or night , it has no fragrance or dye , so you can use it around your eyes without them getting red or swollen.Negatives - it does n't have the immediate effectiveness that retinol products do , then again you ca n't use those during the day . Also , an sunscnreen would make this more useful . I 'm not a fan of using many different lotions , so I 'm unlikely to buy this again , as it 's neither an ideal night nor day lotion , even if it is a great value and a solid product .	1
This cream works well on my face , neck and hands . It goes on smoothly . Does n't leave residue or grease on the surface . I have been using it for a few months and the outcome is positive . Recently , I had to purchase a few extra jars because my daughters were stealing from my stash . LOL . Would definitely recommend this cream to others .	1
I have oily skin and breaks out easily . I 've been using this cream every night for about for a month . It does n't make my face shinier in the morning , instead it makes my skin on my face and neck plumper & firmer .	1
I have very dry skin and also psoriasis . Some areas of my face are too delicate for my prescribed psoriasis cream so I use this and it works like a dream . It is very creamy , does not make me break out ( a lot of other products do ) and keeps my skin in great condition . It scares me that I am having trouble finding this in stores now . Thankfully amazon has it . great price too !	1
I did break out when I first used this but otherwise it 's fantastic . It is the richest cream I 've ever used . We 'll see if it helps my wrinkes .	1
this stuff works noticeably well and very quickly . great bang for the buck . just a dab goes a long way .	1
I 've used this 1-2 times daily for over a month or so with no noticeable change in my wrinkles , but I like that it does n't irritate my skin as other moisturizers tend to do .	1
Better late than never ! This cream is amazing , it 's rich without being super greasy and has vitamins ( A , C , E ) , no oils , no parabens , fragrance free it 's very gentle yet effective . I love it and its now a staple for me . I do n't know why Eucerin dosent advertise this face cream especally since it has vitamin C and E which is all the rage in anti-aging face products.My only gripe is that it needs to be in a tube not a jar because of the vitamins.Ingrediants : Water , Glycerin , Ethylhexyl Cocoate , Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides , Stearyl Alcohol , Butylene Glycol , Cetyl Alcohol , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Butyrospermum Parkii ( Shea Butter ) , Glyceryl Stearate Citrate , Octyldodecanol , Tocopheryl Acetate , Ubiquinone , Biotin , Biosaccharide Gum-1 , Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate , Zea Mays ( Corn ) Oil , Beta-Carotine , Tocopherol , 1,2-Hexanediol , Carbomer , Sodium Hydroxide , Trisodium EDTA , Dehydroacetic Acid , Phenoxyethanol .	1
I 've read too many articles by doctors who say that high-priced creams are useless , and I agree , so this product is great for me . It 's thick and creamy and truly fragrance free . I use it at night and use the SPF 30 lotion by day . I have n't noticed visible changes , but then again I 'm not expecting anything dramatic . But for a good , sensitive skin night cream , this does the trick . No reason to pay more .	1
I have been using this product for almost a year now and as with all Eucerin products it is the best . There are products on the market that are selling for 5 times what this cost and this is every bit as good . I 'm 70 years old and look 10 to 20 years younger . This product makes my facial skin soft and moist looking . The first few times I applied it I could feel my skin tightening particularly around the eyes . I use about a jar a month as I apply it morning and evening .	1
I bought this a couple months ago from Fred Meyers as a night cream ( Olay Sensitive Skin SPF30 during the day , and I try to stay out of the sun for extended periods of time ) , and I really like it . It does n't irritate my skin , it does n't have a weird consistency ( it 's a bit like butter in colour and consistency , but it does n't leave a tint and it absorbs in the skin as you massage it in ) , and it does n't give me acne . My mother thought it a little weird that I 'm using it because I 'm only 20 , but I believe that it 's important to start taking care of skin and body at a young age with a proper beauty/wellness regime , clean diet , and regular exercise . I would recommend trying this for a month or two to people with sensitive skin like myself because overall , it 's a great product .	1
I have used an entire jar of this cream & I really like the way it makes my skin look and feel , especially my neck area . It works very well to moisturize , minimize fine lines & wrinkles , & does not irritate my sensitive skin . I will definitely purchase this product again .	1
Not greasy at all ! No scent . Thank God . Goes on easily and absorbs just as easily . Last long , too . good night cream . Or day . But I used at night .	1
Makes your skin look and feel moist with no smell or stinging .great for sensitive skin at a decent price .would reccomend to a friend	1
As a woman in her 70 's , my skin has become quite dry . My face cream i 've used for some years was discontinued & it took some time to find a good rich-enough cream for sensitive skin ... & was totally unsuccessful til I tried this Eucerin facial cream . It 's a definite winner for me ! ! !	1
This cream soaks in immediately and leaves no sticky or gummy residue . I break out quite easily and this cream has been great for my skin . I was feeling a bit depressed about my skin at 60 because I was breaking out . . .with this cream my skin is much better . GREAT CREAM ! ! !	1
This creme is soft and creamy . I use it every night , it 's not greasy . When I wake up in the morning my skin feels smooth . My skin type is normal to dry , and this is perfect for that .	1
if you buy with eSource Wellness never regret I love their customer service everything they sell is good and cheap , I love the technical support for client were always given me any problems and if ahy they resolve without any inconvenience	1
It 's bitterly cold and dry this winter - no news , I know - and I was noticing that after showers I was feeling even more itchy and dry than usual . I use Cetaphil liquid soap to wash my face , Cetaphil lotion for moisturizing face and body - so I thought I 'd give the bar soap a try in the shower before I dried up and vanished from the face of the earth before Spring . I bought it , I used it , have used it for a week now , and it 's made a big difference in how comfortable my skin feels . I 'm very happy I finally tried the bar soap , and I have no plans of switching back to my previous soap ( Ivory ) in bath , shower , or next to the sink for handwashing . Great brand , Cetaphil , and I 've no qualms at all at recommending it to anyone and everyone . Also : this Cetaphil bar soap , fragrance wise , is either fragrance free or if it does have added fragrance , I ca n't discern anything and I 'm super sensitive to fragrances , so if you prefer no fragrance in your soap for whatever reason , you can rest assured that this soap wo n't bother you in that regard , either .	1
It 's expensive , but it is the best . It leaves my skin feeling wonderful after every shower . Ca n't wait to try the lotion next .	1
... this soap is wonderful for dry skin ... because it is not soap ... try it ... you 'll like it ... get a few bars as they go quickly ...	1
I love this soap ... .the bar is very hard so it lasts a long time ... it is great for sensitive skin and even those with rosacea ... .It is all I use for cleanser on my face ...	1
It 's a sorry state of affairs when your doctor points out dry skin to you ! Because my hands are so smooth , I had n't noticed my `` shedding '' legs . When Doc commented about it , I hung my head in shame . As a person dubbed `` Legs '' by certain old friends , that would never do ! So when I saw a trusted Amazon reviewer praise Body Lotion With Pump-Vanilla - 8.5 oz . - Lotion , I decided to nurture my skin with this yummy lotion . I 've been using it for three months now and I love it . It 's not only rich and creamy , it smells good too : VANILLA , one of my favorite scents . But best of all -- it actually works ! Thanks to reviewer Kasia for pointing this out to me . I ca n't wait to see the look of appreciation on my doctor 's face ; for once , I do n't dread my routine appointment . Perhaps by then I 'll begin to look more like Kasia too . That would be a huge bonus . ; > ) Reviewed by Betty Dravis , February 2009	1
Just the scent and lotion I 've been looking for . Ecco Bella Vanilla is amazingly creamy and luxurious . It 's gourmet lotion ! I absolutely love the feel of it on my skin . It 's not greasy yet it delivers fabulous moisture to dry skin . The vanilla smells heavenly . It 's subtle and natural but you wo n't be able to stop smelling your own arms because the scent is SO intoxicating . It DOES NOT leave you smelling like a cupcake . It 's a sexy vanilla scent . I will purchase more before this runs completely out .	1
Is it just me or is it nearly impossible to pump any lotion out of the bottle ? The lotion itself is very very good ... ..but it takes about 10 to 20 pumps to get any lotion out ... .I think the tube needs to be thicker . If that issue were fixed I would give it 5 stars .	1
I have spent hundreds of dollars on lotions and have a cabinet full that just did n't seem to do the job . Rich and creamy this lotion is the only lotion I will use now . I have bought the lavender and the vanilla for my mom . My aunt saw my arms and legs and asked how do I keep them looking so great ! Ecco Bella i told her . Now Ecco Bella is the only lotion she uses also . A little goes a long way so although it may feel expensive it is worth it . The vanilla scent stays all day long . Even when I use a vanilla based perfume like Shalimar , it will fade but the lotion scent will come though . I have found i get the most compliments when I use the Ecco Bella Bouboun Vanilla Perfume along with the lotion . I use this every morning . My skin does not feel the dryness I used to always experience . My doctor told me to take care of my feet as they were cracking . **blush** Last time she saw my feet she was impressed and is now an EccoBella lotion fan herself . My skin is so soft and supple . Really the best lotion i have ever used .	1
I bought this because it is water-free and organic . Water-free lotion is so much better . You do n't have to use as much and it lasts and does n't evaporate like cheap water based lotions . The smell is wonderful . Highly recommend and will buy again .	1
Thick , rich and creamy , almost resembling custard , this lotion not only gives an intense and healing comfort to the skin but the scent is pure heaven ! I also adore the fact that the brand is holistic and cares about animals , no cruel testing and it uses pure plants and botanicals to produce a truly nourishing product.Brimming with goodies such as aloe , sunflower , coconut , safflower , sesame , babasu oils , vitamins E and A , organic calendula and chamomile and a yummy burst of vanilla , this lotion hydrates all day and well into the night . The scent was the best part of it , slightly smoky at first , little plasticky ( I know it sounds weird ) it mellows into a cake like aroma within minutes of putting it on , and I swear I could smell the vanilla bean all day long . It was quite an experience to smell like a cupcake until the nightly shower , I might have to stock up since the bottles are small but I ca n't seem to get enough of it . I skip wearing perfume the days when I use this so that I can enjoy the strong , delicious scent exuding from the skin . This brand has a few other fragrances that I want to try , but first I have to satisfy my vanilla craving which are being fueled every time I wear this.Also this lotion has no water in it , making it really luxurious and very emollient , great for anyone with dry skin who likes scented lotions . Lack of preservatives is also a plus , something I pay more attention to as I get older and wiser : ) - Kasia S .	1
I will put my review here , although the product I 've been using is their Grapefruit scented lotion . This lotion is rich , creamy , and long lasting . I can apply it in the morning after my shower , and it lasts all day . The smell is quite neutral ( very mild ) - which is helpful because I like to wear perfumes & essential oils . It leaves the slightest oily residue , but it really is n't noticeable - I even apply the lotion to my face . If you find it to be oily , just add a little bit of water when rubbing into the skin and you will feel quite tender & juicy - a naturally supple feel to the skin . A little bit goes a long way . My 8 oz bottle lasted me 1 year , and sadly my store stopped carrying it - so I have recently tried numerous other natural lotions , only to be disappointed . I will stick to Ecco Bella lotions from now on . Nothing else compares . No Parabens , SLS , etc either !	1
Overall this was a good lotion . The scent stays around for a long time but for use over the entire body it just ran out to fast for me . It is good as a hand lotion .	1
I suffer from dry hands ... My own fault - I hate to wear rubber gloves when I do things . This lotion is a saver . It has NO water whatsoever and all the good stuff . So , a good sugar scrub and an application of this later , my hands look like I 've never done any housework in my life . Highly recommended . I know it 's a body lotion , but the rest of me is not dry enough to waste this on ... It is rich , so if your legs are dry from shaving , it will probably save them too .	1
This is my favorite lotion . It 's rich enough for the winter and to be used as hand lotion . And it smells incredible . It 's one of those products I 'm afraid will go off the market some day . Sometimes , usually when it 's freezing , it 's too thick to get out of the bottle with the provided pump . When that happens I cut 'er open and put it in a jar . And I do n't mind at all , because this lotion is that good .	1
I love this so much ! This mask is everything I was looking for : thick , not too pungent , great ingredients , and best of all , IT WORKS ! I use this mask whenever I 've had a long day and I know the oil/dirt buildup on my skin is a lot or if I fell asleep the night before and was too lazy and tired to wash my face.You simply apply it , let it dry , rinse , then continue to wash your face with you normal cleanse.I paired this mask along with the Freeman Pineapple Enzyme mask ( which smells amazing might I add ! ) and with my normal Neutrogena cleanser/toner and together they have brought my skin ( which was blemished and damaged ) back to life.I truly love this and recommend this to anyone whose skin easily gets oily just like mine .	1
This one is soooo GREAN ! And I love it ... my daughter stole it from me after one use . My face feels so smooth ... we love it !	1
I like this mask a lot because it smells yummy ! And it works well to clean the pores . I would for sure get this again .	1
I like this mask a lot . I wanted something a little less drying than my purifying mint mask and since this has avocado in it I thought it would be a nice alternative . It 's very nice and applies easily and my skin feels softer after I use it without feeling like it 's stripped me of all moisture . Do n't get me wrong , it 's not the same effect as using a moisturizer or anything - you 're still going to lose some moisture - but it 's not nearly as drying as some masks I 've used before .	1
My skin is oily in some spots and acne prone almost everywhere . This mask smoothes out my skin somehow and makes a bit clearer . I like it .	1
I love this mask , I 'm at the end of my first bottle and just ordered another . I have very oily skin and it does n't not dry it out or create excess oil . It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean . I would definitely recommend this product as it is one of my favorites .	1
I got a packet of this in a product sample box and thought I 'd give it a go . I had a small whitehead forming that was painful and red . By the time the product had dried on my skin , it had drained , and the next morning it was healing . I 've never had a blemish with such a short lifespan ! This product draws oil out of your pores like nothing else I 've tried . My skin is left soft and supple . I usually throw on alpha hydroxy moisturizer right after , and have n't noticed any adverse affects from that . The morning after I use this on any blemishes , they are greatly improved and healing at a much quicker pace than without.I did n't have any irritation or redness when I used it , but my husband tried it on a spot and did have redness afterward . he said he did have a bit of tingling , which I 've never had.This is the best clay mask I 've ever used , and the price is just an unexpected bonus.If I 'm in a hurry , I 'll throw it on my problem areas and jump in the tub and wipe it off when it dries . It does a good job of evening out my oiliness , and keeping any blemishes at bay .	1
I use clinique products on a daily basis , but I love doing this mask either weekly or every other week depending on how my skin is feeling . It makes things feel nice and tight and supper soft !	1
This mask is one of the best I 've used . I even like it better than LUSH masks . The smell is very nice and mild , it smells almost like candy . Very sweet but not intrusive . The mask itself it easy to apply and dries very quickly . Remove it quickly or else it can get uncomfortable when it 's completely dry . Other than that this will fix your acne . Great ! !	1
i went to the drugstore looking for queen helene 's mint julep mask , but i could n't find it , so i picked this up instead . i really like this mask as well , it leaves my skin feeling really clean and soft and it 's very easy to rinse off . i have sensitive skin and i have n't had any breakouts or adverse reactions to it after using it . the only things i do n't like about it are that it makes my eyes burn a lot if i put too much of the product around them , and it 's a little itchy when it dries .	1
I have extremely sensitive skin , as well a huge pores . So , I was really happy when this mask not only made my face look more refreshed and healthy , but did n't even irritate it a little bit !	1
This makes my skin feel like a baby 's butt . I love it . It smells great and is easy to use .	1
I always love this stuff . It smells really good and works awesome ! Once you put it on it 's soothing , it dries , and then you scrub it off . I would only do it once a week to start to make sure your skin can handle it .	1
I saw this clay mask at CVS and it had a rebate thing stating `` Try For Free '' . I gave it a try because I love free products . This thing is actually good . I have watched Youtube and saw reviews here that say this thing is wonderful . I might have to agree with everyone . It applies like a regular mask and after a few minutes , it dries up and you wash it off and voila , you 'll feel great afterwards . I took off one star because this mask does have a strong smell that even for a non-sensitive person like me , I would like for the manufacturer to chill with the scent . It 's a strong smell of baby powder with a tinge of hair perm ? ? Some of you guys might disagree but personally , that 's what comes to mind when I apply it on my face . Overall it 's not bad of a product because I do feel my face being cleaner after use .	1
I have struggled with acne , blackheads , and scars since age 11 . I have tried lots of products and seen dermatologists with little help . Now , about to turn 30 and still dealing with these issues , I tried this product after all of the reviews . I can not tell you how amazing this is . It 's so affordable , too . Admittedly , I use it 1 to 2 times a day for my best results . My pores are much clearer and squeezing the blackheads on the nose , which my esthetician used to do , ( the only place I would squeeze d/t scarring ) , has become much easier and I have to do it less frequently with regular use . For the price , I would recommend everyone try it until the product is gone and see how it goes for you !	1
I have pretty sensitive skin and have tried a number of different masks through out the years and they almost always either make my face itchy , or cause me to break out after using them ( in those horrible , big and painful zits ! ) ... this one does n't ! It seems like it both dries out the extra oil in my skin , and moisturizes at the same time . After washing it off my skin is always a lot softer . If my skin is a little dried out I tend to get those little bumps on the outer edges of my cheeks , but they always clear up when I use this . It has a good consistency and is easy to apply , though if you wash it off with a wash cloth it looks sort of nasty , but no big deal . It does have a little bit of a scent to it , but it 's not a fake perfumey type of scent , it 's a more natural one . And one of my favorite things about this mask , it 's cheap ! Definitely recommend !	1
I used this before , and hope this is the same thing but they changed the outside look of the tube . I really enjoy this mask and think it works great ... but my package was supposed to be here at the latest the 8th and I still have yet to receive it . After not even hearing anything from them I decided to contact seller and they were nice , telling me that it is almost here . Just frustrating I can get a foot spa bath , facail sauna system and many more larger items from other sellers on time , but not this little mask tube . But end of story is this is a great product and I would recommend it to anyone ! Just order way early from when you expect it to be there !	1
It goes on easily and feels silky , it isnt thick and heavy like other mask . I could pick up no scent so its a neutral there . It dries quickly , within 15 mins , removes easily and actually made my face smoother . I am 42 with combo skin so it works for me , going to be part of my regimen .	1
First off , if you have an Ulta near by , you can find this product there for four dollars in the same size . I used to use the Biore oil control clay mask which is an excellent product but they 're no longer selling it anywhere . I was going to buy another expensive mask to replace the Biore but decided to try the Freeman brand since it was so inexpensive . It 's not as good as the higher priced masks of course but it works well enough for me to purchase again . It leaves my face feeling soft and tightens up my pores . The results do n't last very long for me ; I have a very oily face due to hormone imbalances and it 's very hard to control this for more than one day . I use this mask every three days and use an oil-control cream cleanser the rest of the time . My favorite thing about the Freeman mask is that it does n't cost much . If it were more than ten dollars , I would never buy it .	1
This is okay . I like the actual mask but the smell is sooo so overwhelming . It smells like liquid antibiotics .	1
The colorful containers lured me to buy one while I was at the store today . Got this one because the name sounded refreshing . I 'm wearing it right now and I love how it 's creamier and goes on easier than my thick , chunky , queen helene masque . Do n't know why it 's so much more expensive on amazon since all these 6oz masques were 3.99 at my nearby makeup store .	1
This avocado & oatmeal masque is super cheap and I know some people complain about the ingredients . People ! You get what you pay , if you want something better , pay extra to get something fancy to suit your needs . This tube is big enough so this should last me longer than 6 months really since I use it maybe once a week.I like how this helped me a little with reducing the size of pores . My face feels fresh and tight after I use this . My only complains are that whenever I apply this on my face , it stings my eyes so much although I did not apply it close around the eyes either , just around cheek area . Overall , I like it .	1
I LOVE this mask . I have extremely oily , rough and acne prone skin , as well as large pores . After I 've had this mask on , my pores are much much smaller , my blackheads are much much better and my skin is softer . I also break out less . Ca n't beat this price , either ! !	1
I absolutely love this face mask , its the best one i have used.It evens out my skin , soothes it and makes my skin feel clean and feel really nice . I use this product once and a while and do spot treatment on places where i am prone to get breakouts ( i touch my face a lot on my chin and i use this to wash this area to prevent breakouts ) I have been using this product for years now , and I still have n't run out . I dont use it too often but when i do its really nice and refreshing for my skin . its lasted so long that my bottle is n't updated to this photo , but its the same ingredients . I will be re purchasing this product as im almost finally running out . I would recommend this to anyone .	1
So I 'm going to come right out and say it , I did n't want to use this mask because I 'm a die hard fan of Queen Helena Mint Julep Mask . There , now the cat is out of the bag . I decided to give Freeman a chance because my best friend is always using this mask and swears by it . I 'm so happy I finally gave it a chance , I could seriously see the dirt and oil coming out of my pores when the mask was drying . It was really easy to apply and was super smooth on my skin . I let it dry for about 10-20 minutes just to make sure it picked up as much as it possibly could and used a wash cloth to take it off . The after effects were great ! My skin felt smooth , refreshed , and tight . I did feel a little dry , but some face moisturizer put that to rest almost immediately . I 'm not sure if I 'll leave Mint julep because I love that mask but I would definitely recommend this mask : ] ! !	1
Even though I am pushing 50 , and my skin is pretty dry , I still keep this clay masque on hand . Why ? Because I have large pores that are getting ( ack ! ) even bigger as I age . With one use , I can see my pores visibly reduced . With two I 'm almost back to `` Pores ? What pores ? '' This stuff is super cheap , you get a lot for your money and it works.General 411 : I usually put this all over my face ( except eyes and mouth , of course ) , leave it on 20-ish minutes to let it dry . Rinse with a wash cloth then follow with a good moisturizer on my drier bits . The next day I exfoliate really well to get rid of any dry skin flakes . After this 1-2 procedure , I look like I 've had a professional facial ! Unfortunately , there 's no way to `` cure '' large pores , but this masque certainly helps keep them in check .	1
I like to start with a facial wash , then I use this mask , and finish off with moisturizer.I think this has to be my favorite mask so far.My skin feels so soft and I love how it 's a peel mask , it makes the clean up so much easier .	1
Another awesome face mask ... peel off this time . It has a cooling effect as soon as you apply it . Feels great on the skin..it 's perfect after a hot summer day or a day on the beach . Smells like fresh cucumber ... I was surprised how much I loved it !	1
I use the Freeman Cucumber Facial Mask religiously , once a week , followed by Queen Helene 's Mint Julep mud mask . After exfoliating I apply this mask for fifteen minutes - it 's kind of fun marching around the house looking like a burn victim ( the mask goes on clear and shiny , and dries clear and shiny ) - before peeling it off and applying the mud mask for fifteen minutes . The mud mask is excellent for standing in clear view by your front window as the neighbor mows his lawn or answering the door for the FedEx guy so you can sign for a package . It 's such a conversation starter.Anyhow , after moisturizing my skin is good to go for the week , and it 's consistently clear and fresh thanks to this mask .	1
I 'm 17 and love this stuff . Spas are kinda expensive so I say why not give myself a facial mask at home . So I went searching on here and found a whole lot of masks to try , but this interested me the most because of the natural cucumber and what it claimed to do . So I ordered it and when it finally came , I just had to use it that night . And let me tell you ! I 've been using this mask twice a week for a few months now , and my face looks and feels great . It also helped to reduce some of the puffiness under my eyes . They 're invisible now ! It makes me feel like I 've been to a spa . The only reason I gave it one less of a star is because when the mask is left on overtime , it 's hard to peel off . But if you leave it on for the right amount of time , it peels off easily . Other than that , I 'm really happy with this product .	1
I really like this product , it is my go-to peel off mask . All of Freeman 's products are amazing , and this one is no different . It smells just like cucumbers , and it is not difficult to remove at all . It 's kind of a thicker consistency so its a little hard to spread onto your skin but its not an impossible task . I just removed it from my face about ten minutes ago and it feels fresh and clean . I recommend this to anyone looking for a peel-off mask , and if you 're just shopping for masks in general , I recommend any of the Freeman products , especially this one , the lemon and mint clay mask , and the anti-stress dead sea minerals mask .	1
This product make your skin feel so tight once you remove it . I am glad I decided to purchased this item .	1
If you are looking for a peeling mask this one is pretty good . It dries fast and you can get a good peel with it - all in one sheet . It seems to help to control my sons acne a little.I made the mistake of after the mask , using a blackhead tool and clearing out anything that came to the surface -- - well everything came out easily but he was left with a face full of red marks and scabs for like a week , so I felt terrible . It draws everything to the surface and leaves the skin extra soft and sensitive and more easy to tear and damage.So I 'd recommend just using the mask - and not picking after ! I 've used it several times without picking and it 's been fine .	1
very good at bringing out your skins color and giving you a healthy glow . I would recommend this to anyone	1
This is a fun product to buy and it actually works well . If you are going to use this I would suggest applying the product liberally so that you do not have a thin layer but a nice thick one . I also suggest leaving this product on for longer than 10 minutes , maybe around 15 so that it really gets to dry . Before you apply the product pull back your hair because it can get a little annoying when the product gets stuck to your hair . I would also be mindful not to get any on your eyebrows cause it can get inbetween the little hairs.Once you remove the mask you 'll find that your skin is nice and soft and less oily . It does remove dead skin but do not anticipate removal of blackheads . It also leaves you with a nice soothing/cooling sensation afterwards .	1
I love this peel off mask not only is it fun but its like a liquid form of pore strips . I use this after my mint julep mask because the sebum goes to the surface of the skin and become easy to peel off .	1
I felt a bit of a tingle with this mask . Not bad though . This is exactly the stuff I was looking for . My mom used to use this when I was little and we would have fun peeling off together . Great product . Fresh and light and love the softness of my skin afterwards.I like to alternate Freeman 's grape seed peel off one night , clay/avacado/oatmeal 2nd night , cucumber peel 3rd ... .rotation . Always using a moisturizer and spf and occasion retinol eye cream by ROC . People tell me all the time that I look 23 and I am 36 . Skin needs to be babied .	1
ALL I could 've hoped for in a genuine peel-off mask . I 've looked for years for another peel-off mask that other beauty lines discontinued . Left my face feeling silky soft and I know this type of peel-mask with have my complexion clear , glowing and mar-free from old scratches & pimple scars from the past by using it once a week . Love it !	1
I have always loved Freeman products but when I used this I really fell in love . It has a great smell , easy on my sensitive skin and removes the junk that can get in your pores . You do have to be generous with the application so it will be easy to peel off . I would buy it again .	1
One of my favorite peel-off masks . A treat for my face . Exfoliates/peels and leaves my skin feeling super clean and soft . It 's gentle on skin but cleans effectively . The cucumber mask feels great in the hot summer months for deep cleaning and leaves my face feeling refreshed and renewed . Dries fairly quickly and peels easily . I use a cucumber toner after peeling off and my skin feels calmed and soothed . I have better results with moisturizing when I use this peel a couple times per week .	1
Well , peel-off masks are just fun to use . This one is very nice -- smells good and leaves the skin feeling very smooth and fresh . Freeman products are priced economically but are of very good quality .	1
I love the way this smells and how it clears my poors . this is great for a once a week home treatment . i just wish it was stronger on blackheads .	1
It 's like getting a real facial for less . It leaves my skin feeling smooth , radiant and less ashy . Its so worth it !	1
Cucumber cool facial that is just what I wanted . My favorite was discontinued years ago and the Freeman brand is n't one I was familiar with until Amazon . Use a thin layer for best results . . . drying time is 10 min . or less . Soothing for sensitive and mature skin . Can be used daily . Product information and description is accurate . It does feel a bit sticky so just rinse your hands and remember that a thin layer accomplishes the desired results . The tube makes it easy to use and store.Consider the other peel masks offered by Freeman . . . Pomegranate is another good choice from this line of products.Definitely recommended !	1
I love this item ! I have really sensitive skin and i am very careful to what i put in my face because some items make my face burn , this item makes my face feel fresh and once i peel of the mask my face looks brighter and cleaner , it works really well ! It works good on taking your black heads off .	1
I 've only used it two times , but it seems to be helping . The consistency of the mask feels like honey and once it dries , it is easy to peel off . I really enjoyed peeling off the mask . Overall , it 's a good product .	1
I have very dry , very oily skin ... not sure how oily and dry exist at the same time but it does and it exists on my face . I 've tried creams , face washes and it seems they are only temporary solutions - sooner or later the signs of dry skin appear and it drives me nuts ! I 've never had a facial nor have I ever been to a spa , I hate trying new things I do n't know the first thing about so I decided to opt for an & # 34 ; at home & # 34 ; solution . The directions on this bottle say to use it once every few days or as needed so I decided the first week of use should be an & # 34 ; every day & # 34 ; type deal and I was n't disappointed . After 7 days of every-day use my skin was more hydrated looking and felt a heckofalot smoother . My hunny commented that the redness in my face ( from dry skin ) had subsided and it was a miracle ! I did leave the mask on a lot longer than instructed , the bottle says to leave it on 10 minutes or until dry ... I tend to leave it on a good half hour.It 's a bit difficult to put on and can be messy . First day I had it I tried to use my fingers but it went on too thick an started to drip off my face , I looked like my face was melting off . The second day I got wise and used a makeup sponge to try and apply the thick , gooey paste and that worked much better . Still got some on my hands and what not but overall MUCH tidier and easier ti spread it out thinly.You do NOT need to apply this product generously - seriously , spread it very , very thin and you will see when it dries that it 's plenty strong enough to peel in one piece.The peeling process is by far the coolest part lol . I start by stretching my face by making all sorts of grimaces - that is usually enough to loosen it around the edges making it easier to grab and peel . It 's pretty strong and stretchy so if you 've given it enough time to dry . It peels pretty cleanly off skin but small hairs tend to get stuck and pieces of the mask will be a headache to get off . Sometimes even after a shower little pieces of the mask are stuck in my hairline.Overall I am pleased with this product and I will keep using it . You ca n't go wrong .	1
I 've been using this product for a little over a week now and I 've got to say , I am extremely impressed . I 'm in the midst of starting a new skincare regimen ( let 's just say that Gunthy Renther 's `` X-Out '' did far more harm than good ) , and so I was looking for something to soothe my skin and help clear up a nasty breakout . This product has done that and so much more . When I first started using this mask , I had 4 huge pimples and inflamed skin due to a bad reaction to the aforementioned X-Out . After the first use , this mask got rid of the inflammation and within the next two days all my pimples had dried out ! I 've just been using regular bar soap and this product until I can figure out a new cleanser to try , and my skin is once again clear and soft . This is a fantastic product , and a total aside from its effectiveness : it 's a lot of fun to use , it just peels right off after it dries . Way fun ! Th label says use once or twice a week for optimal results - but I 've taken to using it as a spot treatment in addition to that .	1
Skeptical at first , great price , face feels so refreshed I use it once a week , twice would be better but still giving it a try . So far so good	1
This wo n't take off blackheads or renew your skin overnight , but for what you pay for its ok . It does make my skin softer , reduce some redness , and has a calming smell . I mainly use this with my younger sisters when I visit from College . It breaks a bit when you peel unless you are very slow about it . When applying to your face you might want to make sure you have water on the side to start washing your hands off , its very sticky and needs a bit of soap to get off ! Imagine applying it then turning the water on , you 'll get the handle nasty . If that happens just wait to peel it off when it dries , but kinda annoying if you have OCD !	1
I just brought this product yesterday at Walgreens for $ 4.29 and I love it . It smells great , it 's a little sticky but it works . When I opened the top I was n't expecting a clear gel like substance , I was a little hesitant at first but I followed the directions . It will dry fast so smooth it over your face fast and wait about 20 minutes and peel it off and then wash your face . 5-10 minutes is not long enough in my opinion and make sure to not put it on your eyebrows or sideburns because when your peeling it off it will be very hard to get it off your hair . If you do run into this problem do not panic just simply wash it off your face with warm water . Your face will be left feeling smooth and smelling great . The bumps on my face are smaller but not as noticeable but I will continue to use this product .	1
My kids have been using this mask . I have 3 teenagers , 2 boys and a girl and they all like the smell and peeling off of their skin . Really cleans up their skin nicely . I would definitely recommend this product .	1
It 's a real peel-off mask . Easy to remove the peel from my face . The only thing is that it 's not as moisturizing as I think . Just fine on hydrating .	1
I love this dryer - it does what it says and conditions the hair as it is drying . I originally bought this one for my daughter and she liked mine better , so we traded and I am happy with it .	1
This Conair Ionic was purchased after my other hair dryer fell into the pool . Do n't ask.Anyway , thinking the ionic part was just a gimmick but still hoping it was for real , I got this . It 's a pretty thing , and on the small side which I like.I actually DID see a big improvement in the shine of my hair from using this ! My hair has more body bounce and shine , and just looks much healthier . This seems to be less hot on the highest setting , and it takes a slightly longer time to dry my hair with this but I do n't mind a bit because whatever `` ionic '' means , it works . I am extremely pleased with this . I do n't find this any heavier than other hairdryers , as some reviews stated.I highly recommend this dryer . My hair loves this . Finally a hair dryer that seems to improve the condition of my hair instead of damaging it . I 'm so happy I got this !	1
so glad I purchased this one , so many options out there , but I did n't want to spend a lot , so I choose this based off the reviews , so glad I did . it works great , is super fast compared to all other driers ive had , which is many , and I love the ion , I wont buy one without it , and can tell a difference with ion ! if you hold in the blue button it will give you cold air , which is great , you do n't have to change the switch to cool air , just hole in the blue button on any setting ! GREAT ! it gets hot , but not so hot that it burns your neck ( or my daughters neck , which is always a problem with the girls , she used to hate the hair dryer cus it was so hot it burned her neck ect ) , however it is hot enough to dry hair very quickly , which is a great deal for her , since that was her other problem with them . and its great for me too , since a lot of time I barely have time to even halfway dry my hair , now I can fully dry it in that amount of time ! it is easy to hold/handle , and has all the options that an expensive dryer would , with the add ons ( 2 different ones ! ) , they clip on and off easy also ! it is sturdy , I have had it for a couple months , and I am very rough with them , leave them in the bathroom , laying out , or tucked beside the makeup table , laying in floor , or just through under the cabnit , , and I have had no issues at all , it does n't have a scratch on it ! amazing ! i would recommend this to everybody , my sis already got the same one , after using mine , since she loved it , and still does after a month , and now my mom has the same one as well , and we all bought them on here , to be sure it was the exact same one , since in the stores it gets kinda confussing since so many are similar but not the exact same ! so , yes , recommended , love it , love it , love it !	1
Powerful , and my hair looks good . No complaints on this hairdryer so far . I do n't use any of the attachments though .	1
Great Hair dyer . It works for all of our family with no complaints . We have hair ranging from short to long thin to thick . The extra attachments are nice as well . no complaints from this family .	1
I have long wavy hair and I bought this because it came with a diffuser attachment . It clicks in no problem ( as well as the concentrator but I 've only used it once ) and you can easily take it off . The cord is longer so if you have a larger bathroom , it helps . It also has a hook on the base of the handle , you can kind of see it in the picture , which helps with storage if you choose to hang it up . I use it on the hot heat , low setting and I do n't see a lot of frizz even without product . It dries my hair quickly without it being noisy . But if you use it on the high setting , it gets noisy . Overall , I love this dryer . So far . I 'll post another review if anything bad happens to the dryer .	1
This little hair dryer really does the trick ! I will admit for those with a thick head of hair this may not be the best option , but for me , with my long , thin and falling out hair its perfect . It does n't get SUPER hot which is good because my hair is easily damaged so having a hair dryer that does not scorch my hair is a plus . I have not owned a hair dryer for the last 10 years but I was told that by blow drying my hair it will help natural oils come out that air drying does n't release and so far I am very happy with the product . It comes with a diffuser and other small attachment as well . I love it !	1
Its just what I needed . Its a simple blow dryer but it works just fine for being so cheap . I like how its effective in the mornings after a long shower .	1
I have not owned a blow dryer since 197 ? . However , after seeing so many products for curly blow dried hair in Ulta , Target etc I thought maybe I should reconsider the blow dryer . I went on youtube to see what the latest info was on blow dryers . After watching lots of vids on youtube and reading amazon reviews I bought this from my local drug store . I thought if it did n't work for me I could keep it on hand for folks with straight hair when they stayed over at my house . I tried it and love the result . I have coarse curly hair and it took less than 20 min to dry . The button placement was a bit odd , but it is an easy thing to learn . Additionally , it is not very noisy and my bathroom does n't smell like burnt hair . I could nit pick and give this product 3 or 4 stars but I think with operator practice and a phenomenal price point it warrants 5 stars .	1
I was n't expecting alot from this product based on the price . In fact i was going to use this a back up blowdryer to use on my dogs after their baths . I was pleasantly surprised by it though . I have now made this my number one blowdryer and have down graded my more expensive one to the dogs cause even though this is CHEAP its a GREAT product and drys my hair SO MUCH FASTER then my 50 $ dryer !	1
For me , I have tried so many different blow dryers for me baby fine and hard to manage hair . And these previously tried blow dryers blew my hair dry fast of course ( I have thin hair ) , however , they dulled my hair and also damaged my hair as the drying velocity was much too strong and the heating was just too hot ! So I tried the Conair 1875 blow dryer and was AMAZED and BLOWN AWAY ( no pun intended ) ! This dryer I have found to dry my hair quickly and gently . Also , my hair is shinier and much more manageable.If you have baby fine hair like I do , this is the blow dryer for you !	1
I bought this hair dryer after my old one seemed to be taking a long time to dry my very long hair . I also had just bought another ionic hair drying tool and I loved how it helped prevent my hair from getting frizzy . I went to the store and tried out a bunch of hair dryers ranging up to $ 200 and this one seemed to be just as powerful as some of these very expensive dryers . I also loved that it was ionic . It does a great job at drying my hair and the attachments are really great too . I also paid double in the store for what it is listed at here .	1
I bought this for my teenage girl for one reason only ... .hoping it would be less noisy than her old one . The bathroom is separated from our bedroom by just a wall , and when she dries her hair EVERY morning it was like the alarm going off ! Anything had to be better . All the other gimmicks advertised ... about frizz , volume , etc . I just did n't worry about it . Every hair product advertises they add volume , they make hair shiny , they get rid of frizz , they make you look like Jennifer Aniston . Rarely do they do any of that , or at least none seems superior to the others in many ways.This dryer is quiet ! Unless I am already awake and listening for it , I can not hear it running . Less noisy than her electric toothbrush , just a quiet hum . And , joy of joys , she loves it . She says it does actually cut down on the amount of frizz , and with the diffuser , she gets the volume look she wants.So , in every way , I heartily recommend this Conair Dryer !	1
Reasonably priced , light , works well , you can turn off the heat so that it 's just blowing room temperature air which is safer for your hair ... got it for the GF who loves it . Amazon 's price is much better than anything I could find locally .	1
I have very thick wavy hair , and this has been the best hair drier ever . I bought two in fact so that I do not have to carry with me when I visit with my friends .	1
NO complaints here ! I say buy this one . Its a great hairdryer . and I go thru them . SO good product ! !	1
This dryer works well with a round brush . I almost do n't need to straighten it . It takes and extra few minutes but saves flat iron time.It 's not too heavy but it feels well put together .	1
First of all , let 's put things in perspective -- I am not a stylist . I do n't use a blow dryer to `` style '' my hair , but rather to dry it after showering . I have very thin , fine hair that dries quickly but easily gets frizzy and fly-away . The hand dryer I 've had for over 15 years did the job , but unless I used a leave-in conditioner before drying , my hair would often end up looking like shredded wheat . Not attractive ! So when it came time to buy a new dryer , I took a look at the ionic ones , which claim to leave hair soft and silky instead of frizzy and fly-away . And since this one was so inexpensive , I figured I 'd give it a try.Well , it 's fabulous ! When dried with this dryer , my hair actually feels silky . And my hair has NEVER felt silky ! And to make things even better , that silkiness lasts between shampoos.I 've read a few complaints here that the blower on this dryer is n't strong enough , or it does n't get hot enough . They may have a point -- the air emitted does seem to be less hot than my much older Conair . But the blower seems strong enough for me . My hair dries in about the same amount of time as it did with my old dryer.But what makes this so great is n't the heat or the amount of air , it 's the ionic thing . I do n't know why it works , or how it works , but I love this thing , and the fact that it actually costs LESS than the one I bought fifteen years ago is just icing on the cake.It 's a great dryer and it wo n't set you back much . What 's better than that ?	1
Just what I was looking for to replace my old hair dryer ! The options of hot air at a LOW speed is perfect . Most other hair dryers require tornado force air to have hit air to dry hair . This is the best of both worlds	1
This hair dryer is easy to use and dries hair fast but its a little too big so if you have small hands this hair dryer is definitely not for you .	1
Was given as a gift to a teen . She loves it . This is normally a good product . I 'm sure it will perform as described although I have n't spoken to her since she received it . I will post an update future .	1
I love the ionic conditioning feature of this hairdryer . It works ! Other than that , it 's pretty much your average hair dryer . I do keep accidentally turning it off because of the way the switch is located , but I expect I 'll eventually adapt to that .	1
i needed a blow dryer for college this was cheapest one i found and it has a cool setting works perfect for me	1
With below the shoulder hair , I found this to dry it quickly and without burning . I have fine , thick hair so usually it takes 10 minutes or more to dry ... and other dryers run so hot that they burn if focused in one spot for more than a moment ( to set a wave , for instance ) . This gets just hot enough to be safe and pleasant to use.The finger-attachment might be useful if someone else is styling your hair , but my arms ( I 'm 5'9 '' ) are n't long enough to make its use practicable.Two speeds , two heat settings ( plus cold-shot button ) actually give a very usable range for drying efficiently . Took me less time than with my previous dryer .	1
Use this for my dog . It has a mild setting that is just right for him after his bath . He hates baths . He would not give any thing associated with it 5 .	1
Amazing price for a great performing product . Quiet.Ships on time from a great vendor . Now is the time to upgrade your outdated hair dryer .	1
I really love this hair dryer . I mean , for the price I paid it 's comparable to a high end salon dryer . My hair frizz is DEFINITELY reduced . It works fast without damaging the hair . Highly recommend .	1
This hair dryer was EXACTLY what I was looking for ! ! I needed a wide mouth dryer for when I straighten my bangs and this one is perfect . I 'm actually thinking about buying like 6 more in case they stop making them . lol I straighten and then feather my bangs ( shut up do n't make fun -the 80 's will never go out of style ) and this hair dryer works perfectly ! ! Buy with confidence ! ! -hot 80 's hair chic : )	1
This blow dryer is a little on the heavy side , and the sound is n't exactly quiet either . BUT , like most people said , I do feel a difference in the way my hair looks and feels when I use this one compared to other regular dryers . My hair tends to be dry to begin with , so maybe that 's why i notice the change . But if you already have smooth hair , I would n't know how the product performs . Another plus is that it dries my hair quickly ... takes about 1/2 the time I usually need .	1
In terms of how well this gets the job done , I would say this product is 3 stars . It does n't get as hot as my pricier Conair ( both are the same watts ) , and it is much heavier.However , I guess it is not really that reasonable to expect a hairdryer this cheap to perform as well as a hairdryer that is 10-20 dollars more . You can definitely use it to style your hair , but it might take longer . Considering the price , I would say this item is a 4/5.I mainly bought it to use it at the gym/for travel . It is a good spare dryer but I would n't recommend using it as your main dryer .	1
its good my arms get tired of holding it so idk but its a nice blow dryer bu it doe	1
This is a very nice hair dryer . I like the size . It has a high and low heat which is very comfortable . It 's not too noisy which is nice . It can be cleaned too which is very easy . The price is very good I have bought others at twice the price and only half as good ! Very happy with it .	1
I started using this on my elbows which were dark and this product has lightened the area well . It also removed the blemish marks on my back . This is something I heard about through my friend at work so I searched on Amazon for it . The fragrance is pretty . This is something I will continue to buy .	1
IT LIGHTENED MY MARKS AND IS VERY GOOD RO THE SKIN INSTEAD OF BUYING THE SEPARATE ONE I USE THIS ON MY FACE . GREAT .	1
It smells pretty good does a good job with fading so I 'll be ordering more I 'm almost out and it last a long time to..	1
I have been using this product for 6 months . This product does work , my skin has lighten by 1 shade and brighten leaving me glowing . After my bath i put this lotion all over my body . You must keep using it over and over again to see results . The problem with lotion and creams is I get tired of rubbing it on . Lol .	1
I purchased this over a year ago because I had so many post-acne hyperpigmentation marks on my face , including really dark and noticeable spots . I used this product for some time and for whatever reason , I moved on from it and stopped using it . I do remember it being decent , I do n't remember why I did halt using this . Fast forward many months , I decided , `` I purchased this , why not employ the contents to completion ? '' I 've been utilizing this for a few weeks now ( solely on my face ) , and have really seen a difference . I 'm not exaggerating when I say that every day in the last few weeks that I 've applied this to my face , when I wake up and look in the mirror to see if any changes have occurred , I do observe that the post-acne spots have either disappeared or have diminished some what in tone . So people might want to know , what is my skin color ? Because this product might have a greater impact on some skin tones over others . This is probably true , probably not . My facial skin color is that of a tanned brown skin-color.For the people who 've recorded no results and have seen no visible improvement in their appearance here are some tips that I 've carried out in hopes of ameliorating my post-acne skin condition:1 ) Wash your face at least twice a day ( especially if you have either oily skin or medium-oily skin ) . I know this is difficult to do . For me , I come home after 11pm many times , and I 'm too tired to brush my teeth , let alone wash my face , but this is vital in keeping up the fight for advancing the changes you want to see on your face.2 ) You have to allow the fade milk product to sit on your face for many hours at a time . For me , if I 'm not leaving the house for whatever reason , I try to keep this on my face for AT LEAST 7-8 hours . I can keep it on for as much as 10 hours . You want the maximum effect of this item , and the only way it can do that is if you allow it contact with your face for a substantial period of time . 4-5 hours is n't going to cut it and I would n't be surprised if the results produced were n't too noticeable or impressive.3 ) Ignore the `` sunscreen '' claim on this product . Firstly , it does n't tell you how much SPF is on this thing , so you do n't know how much time this fade milk is allowing you protection from the sun . Secondly , and this is important , it makes no mention of UVA and UVB protection , because it does n't have any . And third of all , and this is also a significant point : this has hydroquinone in it . Hydroquinone is the lightening/bleaching agent . Anybody who 's done some of the most basic research on lightening agents , like hydroquinone , knows that you 're not supposed to be out in the sun when it 's sitting on your skin . It 's counterproductive . In fact , they warn you that bleaching agents can have the opposite effect when you 're exposed to the sun , it can actually make your skin darker , not lighter . When I know that I 'm going to go outside , especially for an extended period of time , I almost never use this product , and certainly never for its sunscreen purposes.4 ) When you sleep , sleep on your back . This goes for any product that you apply topically . I used to apply so many products on my face only to consciously sleep on my sides a few hours later . Like using bleaching agents and then exposing yourself to the sun , this also defeats the purpose . Most of the product is going to be swept away on your pillow case as opposed to being on your face , working . I know that sleeping on your back is not the most comfortable position for some people , especially if you , like me , have suffered with asthma before . First control your asthma ( this is vital ) and sleep on your back . This will ensure that the probability of the contents of the product staying on your face as opposed to being scraped away is higher.5 ) The directions instructs you to `` apply a small amount as a thin layer on the affected area ... '' Booooooring . I usually apply a liberal amount on the hyperpigmentation spots after each time I wash my face.6 ) Drink a lot of water . It does not matter what product you use , using them is only part of the battle . Your skin is like a child , you have to constantly tend to it by hydrating it . I drink so much water , my urine is more clear than the polluted tap water I drink.7 ) Think also about purchasing a sunscreen like AMBI ( Skincare Even & Clear Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 ) . It 's a legit sunscreen that also evens your skin tone , so that should complement this product , when you 're looking to go outside . It also contains vitamins C & E ( which are important for the skin ) and it 's also recommended by the Skin Care Foundation.8 ) For the guys , shave your face at least every other day . The facial hair catches the product as opposed to the skin , so applying this product on a face that has facial hair is not as effective as it would be if your face were smooth and free from any facial obstacles.9 ) Lastly , you MUST get sufficient sleep ( at least 8 hours worth ) . Sleeping rejuvenates both your body and especially your skin . I 've had episodes where I washed my face , coated it with facial products and then woke up some hours later , horrified with what was staring back at me . I did n't allow my body and skin enough time to relax and recover.It annoys me when people rate products on here and yet do n't explain in details why they graded it the way they did . I rated this product four stars out of five due to my perception of this product working properly . The reason why I did n't award it the full five stars is because this is n't a perfect solution . You do have to give it time to work . Also , I 'm not convinced that this alone will lighten your skin and diminish the post-acne marks . This is only one part of a larger process that should include both natural and supplemental means to enhance your skin 's appearance , from drinking a sufficient amount of water daily to eating healthily to using other ( hopefully safe ) even-toned/lightening skin products when you 're not utilizing this one , to getting a sufficient amount of sleep , etc . So this alone wo n't do.The company recommends that you use it for 3 months and discontinue use if you see no apparent results . Most people are n't going to wait 3 months , let 's face it . We live in an instant-gratification era where we want what we want when we want it . And here , we want to see results and quickly . Use this for 2-3 weeks constantly , like I advised above . Wash your face twice a day , apply this twice a day ( if you can ) , leave it on for many hours at a time , sleep on your back ( and get at least 8 hours ) , etc . If you do n't think you 'll be able to decipher whether or not your skin has improved , take pictures beforehand and use that as a measurement .	1
I use to use this Fade Milk 3 years ago and it worked but ca n't remember why I stopped until recently when I started using it again . I take a star off because I got a small rash on my left elbow , that 's when I remember that it use to give me rashes on my elbows . I would n't recommend using this during the day if you 're going to be outside in the sun . When you 're wearing this lotion and sweat its not a pleasant feeling , it makes me feel sticky and want to shower all the time . Using it once daily before bed made a big difference and now I love it . It makes my skin feel soft and smooth , the smell is n't bad either . In the beginning my left elbow was itchy and I got a small rash , but after a week of ignoring it , I guess my skin adopt . The lotion is white but when I shower in the morning after using it at night , the washcloth/soap sud/water have a dirty pinkish color , this only happens when I use the lotion . I would assume that 's fading my skin tone , that 's the only explanation I can come up with . Over all this lotion works in lightening the skin , as well as making skin feel smooth and well hydrated . I only use it on my body and so far my tan is lightening and my skin is slowly going back to my natural light tone . I highly recommend if you 're not allergic to hydroquinone .	1
I am a dark skinned African American women and I can honestly say that this product really did help to lighten the spots on my face , however the container that it is made can EASILY break or crack just from even placing down too hard on the counter . Also the only reason I stopped using this product was due to the smell . After a while it began to make me nauseous and I just could n't bare with it any longer . But overall the product really does work . : )	1
I 've been using this product for about 2 months now . I try to use it 7 days a week , once in the morning and evening but that does n't always happen . I 'm using it to fade acne scars on lighter skinned african-american skin ( similar shade to beyonce ) . I 've noticed a huge improvement on the acne scars that I have had for years.the one con is that this product stinks . : ( but you are only using this product for a couple of minutes a day so you can suck it up and deal with it.you do n't have to use a whole lot of this product at all . a little bit goes a long way so you could have it for several months . i would say that theres at least 95 % of the product left after having it for 2 months .	1
I do n't have any particular scars but I wanted my skin tone to even out so I did n't have to bother with makeup . This stuff does n't smell great nor is the texture wonderful but I do like the way my skin looks . I usually wear it at night and in the morning I use a Vita C lotion ( which smells and feels great ) and a simple face lotion with sunscreen . This does n't make me break out and is n't drying . I am a lucky adult with acne so some lotions are trouble . I also have the skin tone evening face mask by palmers , which I notice more impact from than the face cream . My skin always looks fantastic after I use it .	1
I 'd used 2 % hydroquinone creams in the past without noticing results , so I was wary about this one ; but it was cheap and I was getting desperate . I used it for the purpose of removing unsightly freckles on my chest . A lot of lotions make me get pimples on my chest if I use them , but after nearly 2 months I have n't had such a problem with this one at all -- woo hoo ! As to its fading properties , it 's been very slow and for a while I was n't sure if it was working or not . As of this time , it seems to have removed the lighter freckles , but the large dark ones are still plainly visible ( I am unsure whether they lightened at all or not -- the package does warn results might not be noticeable on `` very dark skin '' and perhaps freckles are included in that designation . ) I have also more recently begun to spot-apply it to a great big dark freckle I have right on the end of my nose , so that one might be a better test for whether it lightens these darker freckles or not . I intend to update the review with results on that . For now I give the product 4 stars though I think if I could I 'd really rather give 3 and a half.UPDATE : So shortly after I wrote the review , I ended up spending 6 weeks traveling , during which time I left the fade cream at home . I was a little disappointed that the freckles seemed to all come back rather quickly , even though I was in a cold climate and was almost always covered up . Nevertheless , when I returned I resumed the use , along with someLikas Papaya Herbal Whitening Soap . The two of them together were amazing , and after only about week I began to observe improvement with the freckles .	1
my face changed for good , so i recomend all palmers products i have been using since i was a teen .	1
I used to use this entire line , and it 's like a cruelty-free , vegan ProActive , perfect for my oily teen skin !	1
I saw this moisturizer in a & # 34 ; green & # 34 ; store and it was priced out of my beauty budget range so I looked for it on Amazon and liked how it was priced . I like this moisturizer , it is light and glides on nice and smooth ... I think I may even notice a sense of my skin looking a bit more even ... I am still new to this product line and will continue to use it..	1
I 've recently switched SPF moisturizers and am so very pleasantly pleased with this purchase . It fits all my requirements , does the job quite well , and is within budget .	1
I love Alba products for being natural and wonderful ! I also love the micro nutrients in the sea minerals . This moisturizer is great for my dry skin , it tones and leaves my skin feeling great and nice and soft . It takes a little bit of time to sink in , but it does sink in eventually , and the moisturizing properties last and last . I love this stuff.I 've tried the Olay total effects , and I hated it . It was heavily perfumed , greasy , and never seemed to sink in . Alba 's is light and MUCH nicer without being greasy , it is much better . Alba 's products are always nice , cruelty free , and natural as well , a MUST HAVE for me . Great product ! Also you can apply make up cleanly over it once its absorbed after a few minutes . Really great . ^^	1
Wow , never thought I would purchase anything else but Origins and this product proved me otherwise . So far it has moisturized my face very well during the day ( I have dry skin and sometimes flaky on my forehead , chin area and lightly on my cheeks during the winter season in the east coast ) . You would have to try it since everyone 's face will respond to it differently and depending on what season and where you are residing will also make a difference . This is my first time being in the east coast during the winter season so my face is a lot more dehydrated ( it has not yet acclimated to the east coast winter weather , if it will ever be ) in any case this product has done it 's job and I have been very happy of it .	1
I love this stuff ! It hydrates well , absorbs quickly and smells great . It has natural ingredients and is made in the USA , which I appreciate . I was n't sure if I should try it but I am so glad that I did ! The tube also has lasted longer than I anticipated it would , though I would personally prefer a pump-dispenser to a tube . I plan to purchase this again .	1
I 've used Alba See Moss Moisturizer daily religiously for over a year - no problems and you ca n't beat the price . I apply after morning wash , before applying foundation . I do n't use the coordinating wash all the time . Most of Alba 's products have impressed me for the price , this line is formulated especially for malasma , which is what drew me to it in the first place . I use the Alba Sea Moss night cream also with a hyaluronic acid gel from Reviva Labs to help with tone and discoloration . My skin looks great and I always get compliments on how nice my skin looks . Definitely recommend for women who are 35+ and have skin discoloration from too much sun or hormonal changes . So until this causes problems or Alba discontinues it , I 'll keep doing what I 'm doing .	1
I have very sensitive skin that is prone to redness and dryness . I 've been using this as part of a skin care regime and so far it seems to be helping . It has a very light smell to it but its pleasant . Very light to wear and is n't greasy .	1
Too bad it does not have the ingredients to protect you from the range of damaging UVA rays . It is otherwise a good lotion in terms of application and smell . I ended up using it as a night time lotion .	1
I 'm trying a couple of different moisturizers because I do n't really see a difference in my skin with Cerave . This one smells nice , has a sunscreen and is not too heavy . If anything , it might be too light for those of us who experience various skin conditions in the winter . Good for the price .	1
I like the creamy texture of this moisturizer as well as the light pleasant smell . I try to use SPF products so this is perfect especially with the upcoming Summer season .	1
I love everything about this moisturizer - it leaves my skin feeling great , protected from the sun and smells good to boot !	1
I like Alba products . We always try to use organic products around the house . This soap smells very nice . However , it was leaking inside the box when it arrived .	1
This is gentle enough for my child to use in the bath each night . I order the lavender kind also .	1
This is the best shower gel I have ever owned . It smells great and it makes my skin so moist and it stays that way until I shower or bathe the next day . This is also a great buy for a 32 ounce size . It should last a long time . I would recommend this product to anyone .	1
IT IS GOOD , NATURAL , ECONOMICAL FAIRLY SMOOTH ON MY SKIN AND LOTS OF BUBBLES . SMELLS NICE BUT NOT LONG ENOUGH THE SCENT GOES AWAY QUICKLY .	1
Nice gentle body clean	1
It is a good cleanser with a heavenly smell that has some moisturizing properties although it does n't replace lotion , particularly in the winter a whole lot of lotion is still required if you have dry skin . I find in the summer when my skin is n't dry this is a gentle cleanser that supplies that bit of hydration that might be all I need that day .	1
I see some of these reviews talking about rosemary and lavender.The honey mango scent is not lavender rosemary . Its fruity and sweet smelling . I 've been using this for yrs and I love it . Good lather . Natural ingredients . Bottle lasts a while .	1
I happen to like this shower gel and will continue to purchase it on a regular basis . It is very emollient and smells good too .	1
Love Alba , love this gel , love this scent . I will buy again and again . And you will love it too !	1
First off , The description states that is had a paraben it it . IT DOES NOT ! ! Parabens are harmful to us , manufacturers like them because they preserve the shelf life of a product which is cancerous to our bodies . Alba botanica products do not contain parabens especially not this item . It is written in big bold letters on the bottle : No animal testing , artificial colors , prabens , phthalates , sodium lauryl/lareth or methyl sulfate . ! ! When I step out the shower , my skin looked so well moisturized , I didnt even need to lotion . It was radiant , as if I went to the spa . I loved the shine so much , Im excited everytime I use it . Unlike the minty version of this product this one has actual moisturizing benefits and I suffer from dry skin so that 's a plus ! It smells wonderful and what can I say its a great NATURAL product ! !	1
This product smells great and I love Alba products . I 've been using this product since finding out I was pregnant . I feel good about the ingredients and will continue to use this product .	1
Alba Botanica 's Honey Mango shower gel smells really good , without being overpowering . It cleans just as well as any other shower gel . Great price for a soap with natural ingredients .	1
Love the smell , love how it lathers , love how it feels on my very sensitive skin ... .if you have sensitive skin you must try this product . I hate the fact that I am usually forced to buy unscented products because of my sensitive skin . You would think that in 2012 there would be more unscented products on the market . I am excited about this product and I am hooked ... ... .smelling good is a must ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Alba in general makes great products . This is a great value for the size . It smells wonderful and it 's not over powering . Most sented soaps leave you with an over powering sent , and this does not , if you like suds , this does it ! I would however check vitacost for a price on this and I know Amazon seems to not always have it in stock .	1
The smell is fantastic but I wished it was stronger and lasted longer ; though maybe this would be good for someone who wants scented body wash but who are sensitive to overpowering scents . My husband even loves the smell . I was happy that there is a good amount of lather since most shampoos that are sulfate free do not have any lather . I even used it as a shampoo and it did not dry my hair out at all ! I have since tried the tropical scent of this body wash and I prefer it more over the honey mango .	1
I just purchased and used this body wash from Alba today . I bought it from Super Supplements for around $ 14 . I figured the larger size would last me longer then the smaller bottle.The smell is very pleasant , and after showering with this product my skin is soft and not overdried . ( Like with most organic products ) I am a fan of Albas other products so this one was a must try , of course.My Husband wont mind using this one either , and its much better for him to use then Axe ! ; )	1
I mostly bought this because I was looking for a shower gel that had a bottle with a pump.The smells is good . I would not say it smells very mango-like , but I can smell the honey . The gel has an opalescent look to it and rinses cleanly . Because the gel is made without sulfates , it does not lather a lot , but that does not stop me from using it as a shave gel !	1
A few years ago , I purchased this Skin Success Fade cream along with the Eventone body lotion , hoping to recover from an uneven tan/ sunburn gone stale ( read greyish ! ) before a long awaited wedding of a close relative . My complexion is a light medium with a neutral tone , and in the sun I tend to burn on my face , shoulders and feet and tan and burn on my arms and legs- like a lobster left on the fire too long on one side only , not good and VERY uncomfortable ! Once the skin burn had healed , I used the fade cream right after cleansing my face with the Clarisonic- it stung for a minute or two the first week and I got used to it after that . The results in just a week were extraordinary . Not only was all the grey gone , but my skin was transformed- I looked airbrushed right out of bed and had the bride from that wedding I attended ask me what I was doing ! My skin was never perfect with an acned past , but this fade cream seemed to have exfoliated a layer or two of it away ! I 've never seen such results with any of the expensive Caudalie/ Organics/Estee Lauder/Artistry/ Clinique skin care products I 've used in the past , and especially so much so fast . Needless to say , I 'm taking it easy and do not use this cream constantly as I do n't want to overdo it and harm or burn my skin . I use it for a month every alternate night and then quit for another 2 months , skipping it in Winter altogether . As I use the Clarisonic regularly , I would think that the results last longer than if I were to use the fade cream alone.The Even tone body lotion is just as good as the fade cream and I use it through Spring and Summer- it truly does seem like I exercise every day even though this just brightens my skin !	1
It says that you should see results in 2 weeks . Well , I did n't , but I guess we all have different skin . I could start seeing results within the first month ( right cheek & forehead ) . It truly works.Make sure you use it with a sunscreen though . Fade creams can potentially damage skin when the profuct is on and the skin is exposed to sunlight.Along with the fade cream , I used Alba 's Skin Lotion w/h SPF 15 as well as Palmer 's Cocoa Butter Lotion during the night . On nights were it got really cold , I used Bio Oil on my face with the fade cream underneath.Will definitely buy a second bottle ( well , jar ) soon .	1
I 've already have this product and ordered it in January . I decided to come online and write about how well its working and I plan to order more soon ! I am a dark skinned african american women and have had discoloration on my face for years until I began to use this product . I only use this product , suncreen , along with carbolic soap and have seen a DRASTIC improvement . I was scared this would burn my skin or make me itch because I suffer from eczema and tend to have sensitive skin but no problems whatsoever ! : )	1
I 'm on my second jar . I could reall see a difference is a few weeks . I keep using it everyday and continue to see improvement . I thought it make my face a little red in the beginning but it dose n't do that any more .	1
I decided to write a review because I use this fade cream . I started noticing results within the first week or less for me . I have to admit reading 3 months to see results bothered me a great deal but I do n't have to wait more then 1-2 weeks to get the results for an even skin tone . I 'm happy I purchased this product and sorry to the ones who had no luck with this cream .	1
It is ok especially in this cold climate , i rub it on my elbows and it makes them soft and darkness on my elbows are pretty hard to remove , but it makes it look a bit cool , hope to see more progress .	1
I have been using this on my stretch marks ( stretch marks are old ones , about 8 yrs old ) and on my scars ( scars are recent , just a few months ) . It seems to help lighten the redness . I have noticed enough of a difference that I will continue to use it . It does not take away the stretch marks or scars , it just lightens them and makes them less visible .	1
Wow this is truly amazing I can feel it starting to work already and its only been a few days but my skin is definitely more smooth than before so I say this is an excellent product	1
I have been using this as a body soap for years ( never on my face ) and that 's a keeper , it keeps my skin smooth even when I do not use body lotion after . I notice it also gives my skin a glow that I do not get when I use other body washes . However , I do n't know about clearing scars , clearing anything for that matter . For me this is just a good smooth soap , nothing more .	1
i love it , would not use any other soap again .i even use it on my face and my face feels smooth	1
I 'm loving this soap . I 've been using it exclusively on my face for the past couple of months and it 's performing beautifully . I have combination skin and this works well with it . It is non-drying , lathers well ( rich , creamy lather ) , and I find the scent to be light and non-offensive . After use , my skin is super clean but it does n't make my skin feel tight at all .	1
This soap is super as are all of Palmer 's products . It really smells delicious , is creamy and makes your skin feel pampered . Because of his job , my husband showers twice and day and he loves this soap . We live in the southwest and the climate is harsh on skin . This soap keeps it with a more & # 34 ; normal skin & # 34 ; texture instead of dry and flaky .	1
I love Palmer 's products . They keep your skin so soft and smell GREAT ! They got this to me super quick . I use it all the time .	1
use this one your face on your body ... .. leaves your face and body smelling good and your face is clean and cocoa buttered up	1
I love Palmers Cocoa butter anything/ it smells so rich and feels super silky . I wish I could fill a tub with their cocoa butter moisturizer . it will make you smell like chocolate .	1
It 's a Palmer 's product and I like basically everything they offer . This bar of soap is no different . I like the way my skin feels after using it in the shower . Would recommend this product .	1
i have been using these for years to relax and this is the best quality one for the price . i love the sage color and the smell is to die for . i close my eyes and put this one and it relaxes me so much i fall asleep within ten minutes and it usually takes me 30 minutes . best buy in awhile	1
ok so first of all it has a VERY Strong odor . its not going to fade so do n't worry about that . when I first got it the smell was actually a little overwhelming but it has calmed down a little over the months . this is a great product to relax with , this is not a good product to try to sleep with as it slides all over the place . I am sure some people who sleep on their backs would love this but I sleep on my side so I am constantly doing a balancing act with it until I fall asleep . For headaches or just general relaxation when you are laying on your back I highly advise !	1
Years ago someone gave me one of this type eye pillow and I have loved it . The fragrance was very soothing and really aided my relief from migraines . The company that manufactured it has since been sold and I was looking for a replacement . DreamTime is the perfect replacement . It has the exact aroma and is well made as was the first one . I also have ordered one for my daughter and she enjoys hers as well . I recommend to these to everyone I know who has migraines .	1
I had an eye pillow made by a different manufacturer for about 10 years before it finally tore open . Unable to see how I could live without it , I repaired it with duct tape ( hey , I 'm a guy , what do you expect ) , but I figured it was time to get a new one . I was pleased to see on Amazon that many eye pillows , such as the DreamTime eye pillow on this page , come with zippers so the contents can be removed and the material hand-washed . I got a different color than the one on this page ( I got the `` DreamTime Inner Peace Eye Pillow , Sage Velvet , '' also sold here at Amazon ) . The eye pillow that tore open on me was unscented and I was hesitant about getting a scented eye pillow ; I was afraid it would be too perfumy . But the scent of the DreamTime eye pillow is quite pleasant and to my liking and I do n't find it perfumy at all . It has a mild chamomile smell , and when I use it , it is easy for me to imagine that I am reclining in a field of wild chamomile . Having an eye pillow means not having to put my arm or arms over my eyes ( or a folded up t-shirt or a towel or whatever is handy ) when I want total darkness . The eye pillow gives me total darkness -- 100 % absolute blackness . It also imparts the pleasant sensation that I get when I gently press my palms to my eyes . The scent is relaxing , the sensation of having the pillow over my eyes is relaxing , the absolute darkness is relaxing , and I highly recommend this inexpensive product ( especially at the sale price ) to anyone who is looking for a natural way to get some deep relaxation . DreamTimes 's eye pillow comes in a sturdy reusable cardboard box ( with a ribbon carrying handle ) . DreamTime eye pillows are obviously marketed to women and that 's too bad for guys who might not consider trying them because of how they 're marketed . Maybe if they make some with a camo design ( just kidding ) . Highly recommended for anyone who wants a natural aid to deep relaxation .	1
Excellent value , excellent quality.Gentle scent.Even the packaging is great , as it opens easily , does n't fall apart like flimsy corrugated cardboard , and even has a nice rope handle.A wonderful present for a budding yogi , or anyone who wants to spend more time relaxing or meditating .	1
At the end of each yoga class , my teacher would put one of these over my eyes . I was concerned that others had used the pillow and did n't know what germs I might get ( no I 'm really not a germaphobe , but I 'm careful with my eyes ) . Anyway , now I have my own and can wash the cover whenever I wish . I really like this pillow . Just the right size and weight with a wonderful , subtle fragrance .	1
Gels are great when used with sponges and washcloths . You can easily get the gel into all the nooks and crannies of your scrubbie or sponge and then ensure it lathers well so you get both the cleaning power and the gentle exfoliation . In general this is much easier to do with a gel than with a hard soap.I 'm very pleased with the Suave Naturals gel . It is almost like a jello-consistency which means when you turn the container upside down it ALL comes out ! One of my key gripes with many soaps and gels that come in containers is you always waste the remnants of it . There is always residue inside which you ca n't get out and have to throw away ( or try to get water into the container to rinse it out that way ) . With the Suave , there 's no issue at all . Turn the container upside down , it all comes out VERY easily and you use every little last drop of it . Brilliant.I really enjoy the aroma of this as well . It is fragrant but not overpowering or sickly . I enjoy the blend of the sweet pea plus the hint of violet . I 'm sure there are different people who would like more of X or more of Y , but that always comes down to personal preferences . For me the balance is just right.Highly recommended !	1
I 've used many Suave products and I always tend to think of them as generic . Almost every product I 've used has surprised me and has left my wallet in a healthy state.The Sweet Pea and violet body wash is affordable , definitely . It also has a wonderful but not overpowering Sweet Pea scent apparently borrowed from Bath and Body Works . While I 've always like BBWs Sweet Pea scent , all their products have been far too overpowering , which this body wash is n't luckily . However , if you want to smell more Violet , this product probably is n't for you as I ca n't even smell it at all.This pretty pink body wash foams easily to wash your skin . I 've found it feels nice and definitely leaves my skin soft and moisturized . My skin 's softer than it has been with some pricier products ; even my husband has taken notice.I also have some troubles with body acne which seem to not be an issue with this product , which is a definite plus.I 'm not sure why I forget that Suave makes wonderful products for a great price , but it 's always a pleasant surprise to be reminded of that fact as I was with this product that I highly recommend .	1
Suave is value for the money . It 's not watered down like some other inexpensive brands . Thick and rich , smooth and silky . I just love how my hand just glides over my skin in the shower , like I had just buttered myself all up ! It 's the same sensation as showering in very soft water -- only I live in an area with nothing but hard water . I feel clean and moisturized when I 'm done . I 've always been a fan of Suave products and this one just reaffirms my loyalty .	1
This body wash has a nice scent and you do n't need very much for a good lather . A good value and lasts a long time .	1
I keep coming back to the EO products for my showering needs . The scents are not strong but just enough Aroma-Escape therapy . Its a quality *alternative to shampooing & no'poo . Would like to see larger sizes .	1
Good shampoo , especially for the summer it deep cleans , without stripping color from your hair , and gives you hair wonderful shine and body !	1
I have always spent a lot of money on shampoo . I am a fan of the original Pureology lines ( not the cheap crap you get now at Target ) and I love LUSH but they 're both so *expensive* . It was the case that the only vegan/cruelty-free/high-quality ingredient/environmentally safe/people safe shampoos were hard to find and pay for . But . . .Finally ! A shampoo that is : -good for oily scalp without stripping the life out of the rest of your hair-ok for color treated ( mine is bleached ) -smells and feels wonderfully cool and refreshing without a hint of fakey perfume-affordable ( ! ) -good for the environment , animals , and people-made by an ethically empowered company you can feel good about supporting-responsibly packaged with post consumer recycled content-lacking in artificial colors , scentsThis is not quite the experience you get from a $ 70 bottle of shampoo , but it 's darned good anyhow and you ca n't beat the price tag at a fraction of the cost of the salon bottles . If you have oily scalp but do n't want to turn the rest of your hair into straw , this is worth a try and if you do n't like it you wo n't be so broke you ca n't buy something else .	1
EO 's Refreshing Sweet Orange shampoo is scented with an especially beautiful orange fragrance that is not overwhelming , but subtle like a botanical bouquet of herbs and oranges.Organic White Tea , Dandelion , Lemongrass , Elder Flower , Hops mingle in a coconut cleansing infusion . This is a nutrient rich formula with vitamins and amino acids to give your hair the shine , body and nourishment it deserves.This is one of the few shampoos my husband asked me to buy again , so now we buy three at time.~The Rebecca Review	1
A really good shampoo . I have tried other non sulfate shampoos but they either have a smell or do n't really lather . So I did not expect the luxurious later of this shampoo . The scent of the hibiscus is very invigorating . Would recommend tis shampoo to daughter for my grandson who has a sensitivity to most shamoos she uses on his hair .	1
I recently read the book Curly Girl and have been trying out different organic/natural products for my hair that are free of sulfates ( very drying ) , silicones , alcohols and parabens . This shampoo is amazing ! It smells fantastic and cleans very well . I use EO 's restorative conditioner after and my hair looks fabulous and my curls are magazine-worthy ! ! I purchased an entire line of EO hair products - shampoo , conditioner , pre-shampoo and styling cream and the gel for curly hair . I love every single product.It is so refreshing to find a company that offers AFFORDABLE chemical-free hair products that actually work extremely well . Thanks EO Products ! ! ! !	1
Smell not so appealing , watered down lavender . But this shampoo is great , makes hair very soft , shiny and it seems to really protect it from damage . Would recommend it again , and would buy it , price so reasonable for such a good shampoo .	1
I have tried several brands of sun screen looking for one I can use forever and be happy with . Diagnosed with a Melanoma in Aug. 2011 it 's extremely important for me to wear sun screen almost all the time . Neutrogena goes on easy , it 's greasy , and actually feels good on my skin . I mostly use the Baby version though . It 's exactly the same SPF just not as controversial ingredients in the Baby version .	1
Non-greasy sun protection and face moisturizer in one , great product . I would definitely recommend this to anyone . No detectable fragrance .	1
This has got to be my most favorite moisturizer , hands down . It 's light weight and does n't feel greasy at all . My boyfriend will even use it . Just the right amount of SPF as well .	1
I loved it ! I use it daily , and will definitely be buying again when this runs out . Thank you very much .	1
I was looking for a lotion with decent full-spectrum protection that was also not oily , would not clog pores , and gave me good moisture . I sometimes still use a thicker moisturizer on my T-zone , but I have this on hand at all times .	1
Highly recommended per research organizations . I like that it 's a light feel , and knowing that it has SPF of 50 keeps my fair skin from burning .	1
This is my 4th time buying this product . I meant to get the tinted but , missed that button : ( . Still a great product providing SPF protection . Will buy again .	1
I 've used this cream for the past 10 years and I love it ! I mix it 1:1 with my foundation and it gives my skin a fantastic glow . It 's also great on its own . Highly recommended !	1
I use this when I go out into the sun because it has that SPF 50 thing . I do burn terrible in the sun without it . It feels lovely on my skin . It does not have that terrible fragrance that most suntan lotions have . It does have a minute fragrance that my sinuses are able to tolerate . I do love the feel of it on my skin . I 'm very happy with this product .	1
Not clumpy , never thick and the small brush lets me grab even the tiny lashes on the inner edge of my eyes without smearing . My favorite mascara .	1
I use this mascara for the hard to reach places like the back of my upper lashes and the corners of my eyelashes . I still use my favorite mascara for the rest of my lashes , but this is fantistic for getting full coverage . I always keep some on hand !	1
I waited to review to make sure I liked it This is a good mascara . The wand is thin so that the mascara applies nicely without clumping .	1
I 've tried so many different mascaras , but always come back to this one . I love the narrow brush , which deposits lots of mascara . Plus , since I like to get the mascara right down to the very roots of my eyelashes , the narrow brush does n't smudge it all over my eyelids in the process .	1
This mascara is perfect for daytime . It never clumps until it 's old and time to throw out . I like that it 's really washable .	1
This is definitely one of my favourite mascaras so far . The wand is very small and thin which takes a little getting used to but the results are rather impressive .	1
I am clumsy when it comes to applying mascara - I sweat , I hold my breath , yet I always manage to put mascara on my cornea - with regular mascara , that is . So I spent a long time looking for a mascara with the tiniest wand possible and one that does n't smudge and sting my extremely sensitive eyes . I am glad that I found the perfect one for my with this Maybelline Lash Discovery Mascara ! Since the wand is so small , it picks up just enough mascara to coat my lashes both top and bottom and it lasts all day even when my eyes get watery . I 'll never look at another mascara again !	1
This is my `` everyday '' mascara . I do n't actually use it everyday ( because I do n't wear make-up everyday ) , but whenever I do during the daytime , this is my `` go to '' mascara . It is great because it separates lashes well , looks more `` natural '' than other products ( sometimes , people ca n't tell I am wearing it ... and that is a good thing ) , applies evenly , and lasts a long time . I have also found it to be economical , not only because it is cheap , but also because the applicator holds enough mascara to cover all my lashes ( both bottom and both top ) with just one application ( no double dipping needed ) .A couple downsides : 1 ) It does sometimes clump in places . The way that I prevent clumping as much as possible is that I get a clean tissue and gently roll the applicator on it . It removes any excess mascara and goes on more evenly . 2 ) Sometimes , at the end of the day , I 'll see little flakes of mascara on my cheek . It is n't too bad , but does happen.One last thing - if you are looking for a mascara to really lengthen and thicken lashes , this is n't really it . This mascara is simply provides your lashes with color and a little thickening/lengthening - which is why I use it for my `` everyday '' mascara because it provides a more natural look . But , when I want something more dramatic , I use another mascara .	1
I will admit I did n't realize I was buying a & # 34 ; skinny & # 34 ; mascara ... But once I started using it I was pretty happy . I find it easier to use than the standard size handle . Only downside is that I think this is going to run soon out due to the small size of the packaging .	1
My lashes are long , thick but unfortunately straight I only use the mascara to highlight them and keep them curled after using the curler on them.I have been using Estee Lauder & iexcl ; s product for but a friend insisted this is just as good . Estee & iexcl ; s mascara is $ 20+ for a new tube . I figured I have only $ 5 to lose if this works just as well.I & iexcl ; m impressed . I really like this product . I now own both the regular and waterproof . No clumping or flaking. Can not believe I & iexcl ; ve been paying for Estee Lauder all these years when this works just as well for me . The only negative is I really dislike the tiny , hard brush and prefer Estee & iexcl ; s brush but for this price I can definitely get past that .	1
I am happy with this mascara over all . If I apply it carefully it does n't clump ; it never burns my eyes . It does run if I sleep with it on . It comes off more easily with eye makeup remover .	1
Quick service ! This mascara came out in the 90s and I can still remember the commercials with Sarah Michelle Gellar . Or was that full n ' soft ? Any who ... this product is great . It gets the lashes other brushes wont reach and it is gentle on my lashes , not cakey .	1
Love the product ! it really does work for the lower eye lashes ! in love with it . Hope u guys like it as well	1
I have been using this powder foundation for 5 years and I have tried others along the way , but nothing compares . Living in Hawaii where the weather is very humid forced me to back off the liquid foundation because it would just melt off and look awful . So in searching for a powder , I decided to try this one . I 've always had a little bit of light acne and redness on my face . This powder does a great job of covering up blemishes and redness with out looking like you 've caked on liquid foundation . Its definitely not full or heavy coverage , but it makes imperfections on the face way less noticeable . After I moved back to the mainland I wanted to go back to liquid foundation because I knew I could get full coverage and hide everything . Well the problem with liquid foundation is it makes you break out and it gets messed up every time you want to wear sunglasses . PLUS it takes a while to apply ... . So I save a lot of time and I save my face from loads of acne by just going minimal with this product . If you are someone that insists on using liquid foundation , this is a great setting powder for it as well , you get some serious coverage .	1
I am fair , and oily and this is the best powder i have found for my problem . I love love love it !	1
I 've always liked this as a final part of my make-up regime . It really seems to set my base make up and it 's a great powder . After finding the right shade you 'll be in love with this product .	1
Right amount of coverage ! Not too much , but if you need more you can just apply some more !	1
I loved this one , I used it for many years all thru highschool because it covered all my acne and flaws.Unlike the cream liquid foundation this press foundation doesnt take too long to put on.Its really easy and you can carry it with you if you need to reapply it in the afternoon.I dont like the newer maybellines liquid foundation dont bother buying it .	1
This product gives you good coverage without looking heavy or leaving a line of demarcation at your neckline . It does n't have a chalky or powdery look , and has an added bonus of sunscreen . I usually prefer a cream matte foundation , but this Maybelline Purestay Powder & Foundation gives me excellent results as well . If you find that you need a little extra coverage for whatever reason , this powder also goes on looking natural on top of other cosmetics -- just use a light touch in applying.This makeup has excellent staying power , and that 's what really counts . Who has time to keep checking in a mirror and retouching your face all day long ? I never once felt the need to do my face again during the day ! This is a good value at a fair price . Recommended !	1
this is the best foundation . I use to use clinique but it during the winter when i lost my tan they did not make a shade light enough to match my skin tone . This is great , it matches my skin tone , controls my oily skin , stays on all day , and looks super natural . i 'll never swtich again	1
It makes my complexion look so smooth & lasts for hours . I 'm so sad it was discontinued . It 's my favorite .	1
I 'm a product junky . When I 'm not wanting to wear heavy makeup , I put on some BB cream and some powder . This looks pretty natural , not cakey at all , but has a bit more coverage than the ones I 'm used to . I have sensitive skin , and this causes no issues . I ordered in Ivory , and my face is not pale white , it definitely has color . The color in the pictures is very true to the actual product . I would definitely reorder this .	1
I am VERY fair-skinned , and this matches my skin tone perfectly . It sits well on top of my liquid foundation and does n't give me the crazy face-one-color-neck-another phenomenon that some other products have . It 's not a heavy foundation , but it provides seamless coverage . I also appreciate the SPF 15 built right into it !	1
My favorite powder EVER ! SPF 15 is hard to find too !	1
Best makeup ever . Unfortunately , I ca n't find it anywhere anymore for less than $ 30 . If you 're looking for a good replacement , you might want to try Covergirl Fresh Complexion Powder Foundation . I used to buy it when this makeup was out of stock at my local store . It provides similar coverage , though being quite pale ( ivory ) , their lightest shade was a tad yellow on me , which is why I always preferred Maybelline .	1
I used to use liquid foundation when I was younger and my pores were much smaller . Now that I am in my 40 's I find that liquid foundation does n't apply well and leaves my face looking flaky . This product is perfect to use in place of liquid , applies evenly and covers blemishes well . It can be applied throughout the day to reduce shininess and does n't cake or build up . This is the only product I use unless I am going for a more dramatic look , in which case I use a silicone primer and liquid but , even then I apply this on top of the liquid with a brush to reduce shine	1
I very much wish that Maybelline had n't discontinued this foundation , it 's easy to apply and the color ( # 10 ) is just right for my very fair skin color . It has a nice matte finish and provides sheer-medium coverage .	1
I really like this product . They offer several shades and it has an SPF in it . A hugeplus ... NO SPARKLE like a lot of the other powders have . It softens and blurs lines too.The only problem , I 'm having a harder time finding it in the stores . Now , I 'll be gettingit online if I ca n't find it there .	1
This is the best foundation I have ever used . It is easy to apply , completely covers and evens the skin tone , and stays on all day without clumping up . Like the other reviewers , I appreciate that it dries matte . I tried it because I have lupus and live at a high altitude , so I need extra UV protection . So far so good . The ability to lighten and darken the tone is great , although I do wish there were a way to add cooler/pink tones , since it is a tad yellowish . That being said , I get lots of compliments about my skin when I wear this and , hey , I feel pretty !	1
This sunblock provides great physical sun protection . It is good for people who have normal or combination to oily skin . It feels a little heavy on your face but not as gross or greasy as regular sunblock or sunscreen . It actually provides decent coverage and evens out your skin tone quite nicely . The concept of being able to adjust the color of the foundation is pretty cool . I wish cosmetic companies would provide regular foundations with this concept . The color is pretty neutral , neither warm nor cool toned . I could see , however , that on darker skin tones it could possibly be a little ashy due to the mineral sunblock content .	1
I ordered and used the `` clear '' Total Block last summer and while it worked fine , it did lend a somewhat pale affect to the face . I had read all the rave reviews on Amazon about this product , and I must say it lives up to the hype . I do set it with powder , there are no claims to water-resistance or long-wearing ; it feels silky smooth and the color is virtually perfect for me , right out of the bottle ! The color as-is seems to be a light honey after shaking well ; there are two bottles of pigment to lighten or darken to your preference , and instructions are included . I have n't added any of the color yet ; could see myself adding a drop of darkening as the summer progresses . It offers full-coverage , but somehow does not draw attention to my over-40 lines , and I do n't usually need to wear concealer , the coverage is that good . I tan easily all over , but get the ugliest dark blotches on my jawline and upper lip if I do n't keep heavy duty SPF on all the time . Even the texture is leathery , whereas my unaffected skin is smooth . So , I use PCA Phaze 13 which works wonders to reduce the discoloration and texture of the affected skin , then I put this product on , and do n't have to put make up on top of it ! In Texas , where it is 100+ degrees already , I need as few layers as possible .	1
I had use Total block 65 and now 60 . Total Block 65 is a great but 60 is even better . It give a light cover up . Since not many of us have even skin tone . This product provide great result and yet does n't have the unnatural look . I love it and I will buy it again .	1
This is to be used for serious sun exposure where protecting yourself is more important than a slight white layer on your skin . I kayak every week and I am under the sun for 3 to 5 hours . I know this works because I forgot to apply this on my hands and they were the only part of my body that tanned and burned . Yes , there is a light white shade . Big deal . Also , this is n't meant to go on your face as well , not matter what anyone says . They have another product that is meant for sensitive skin that does n't have a noticeable white shade.I just got back from a whole day of Kayaking under very intense sun here in Newport Beach , CA . I did n't even have a noticeable tan . Since I was paddling the whole time , I did n't have a chance to reapply it . Since there is a slight white shade , I could still see it on my skin even with water splashing on me.I still recommend using a hat and long sleeve rash guard with SPF if you intend to stay under the sun for a long time , but if you can not , this is the next best choice .	1
Found this highest rated on Consumer Reports so ordered it . Was not too thrilled with it . Regular ones are OK too .	1
I have trouble with sunscreen causing breakouts and this almost never causes blemishes . I also have come to hate the smell of typical sunscreen and this does n't have that smell . I have light to medium tone Caucasian skin with some yellow undertones and this is so thick it can double as foundation makeup . It says it dries clear , but it 's a little chalky and would probably really look bad if you have dark or ethnic skin . I have read that the tinted kind does n't blend well with Asian skin .	1
A friend turned me onto this product and overall , I like it . Only four stars because my face feels dry after application , and the price is high . The Amazon subscribe and save helps you save more . It 's worth the money if you want a sunblock/skin concealer/foundation in one . It comes with a darker pigment , so you can match up your coloring . It 's the only product of it 's type , which is why it 's a bit pricey .	1
This is by far the best sun block I have ever used . It goes on well and does the job it says it will , totally blocks the sun . I used it in Florida recently and never burned and I have skin that burns within 20 to 30 minutes of strong sunlight . Also this did not cause any irritation to my super sensitive skin . I use in whenever I see that we are having a sunny day as UV rays penetrate car windows . The key to using this product is to put it on about 20 to 30 minutes before going out and to reapply every three hours or so .	1
I & lt ; 3 Fallene 's Total Block UVA/UVM sunblock ! ! I 've been using it for a little over two years now . I have slightly acne prone skin and this is one of the few sunblocks/sun protection lotions that does NOT cause me to break out at all - regardless of how sweaty or oily I may get while I am wearing this . The sunblock is super thick and requires a decent amount of shaking before application in order to mix the fluids . As other reviewers have stated , this sunblock DOES leave a pasty film - it definitely lightens/whitens my skin while I am wearing it . However , I actually really like this effect ( particularly as an Asian-American woman ) . : ) There is n't really any smell to the sunblock , which is also nice and makes the lotion even more wearable . My only complaint is that , the sunblock is so heavy and thick that I have to wipe my eyebrows after application ; otherwise , my eyebrows will also be lightly tinted / paler . Also , if I do happen to sweat a lot while wearing this , sometimes little pale-ish white ( albeit , translucent ) beads will run down my face because the sweat is mixing with the sunblock . Not the prettiest effect but , this really only happens when I am at the gym and sweating profusely . I highly recommend this sunblock if you 're looking for a heavy-duty sunblock that will not break you out .	1
This is one of those low-key , under-the-radar products in a ho-hum package sold mostly thru doctor 's offices . It reminds me of my Asian BB creams or Kevyn Aucoin 's Sensual Skin Enhancer -- a thick , dense , full-bodied texture but just a thin layer is needed b/c it 's LOADED with pigment -- - It comes in a beigey neutral shade that is very similar to BB creams , and then two mini tubes of adjustable color to make it lighter or darker ( custom matching to your skintone ) .The greatest thing is that you do n't need to layer on foundation afterwards , building up layers of cakey product . I just put on my antioxidant serums , then Fallene . That 's it . I wore it in extreme heat , exposed to the blazing sun for 5+hours , and it protected me all day.My HG is normally Elta UV Physical , which i still love , but it 's too sheer for the heat of summer , and I had to add my BE or other foundation for more coverage == cakey layers . So in the warm months , just my serums + Fallene -- nothing else . It 's soooo covering , makes my skin look flawless and porcelain , and i feel so protected that i just had to rave.How 'd I hear of this cult product ? I met two prominent NYC socialites at an event here in manhattan and their equally prominent derms/plastic surgeons told them to use Fallene Total Block 60 Tint to wear instead of foundation . These women can afford anything and do whatever they can to maintain appearances . So when they told me that Fallene is all the rage in their `` circle '' , i had to check it out.Unfortunately the box does n't list ingredients in proper order ( like Elta , *sigh* ) but the website gives all the info on the combo of physical + chemical blockers and Z-Cote , patented boosters.If you 're looking for a doctor-recommended high level SS with physical and chemical blockers AND something that acts as foundation/concealer ( seriously covers blemishes and everything ) -- this is it .	1
The zinc molecules are too large to absorb into your skin leaving the skin with a `` chalk `` like look . Will without a doubt block the harmful UVA / UVB rays.If you 're into protection 100 % this is for you . If you 're vain ... ... .do n't complain .	1
I started using this product about 4-5 months ago and I must say , I love this scrub ! Its better than most scrubs I 've used . Its gentle on skin , beads are very fine and it doesnt irritate my skin , smells heavenly and best of all , it does n't make my skin break out nor makes it more oily . I 've always had acne and had mild to moderate amount of acne scars on my face as well , with daily use for several months , I 've started to notice that the scars are fading away , not completely gone but much less visible than before . Will definitely repurchase this ! Also , price is great and a lasts a good while .	1
I really enjoy the Aveeno line . Nice products . Now if I could just look like Jennifer Aniston ( spokesperson for Aveeno if you did n't know . ) .	1
I 've used the Olay Regenerist cleanser , St. Ives scrub , Neutrogena , Estee Lauder , Ahava - need I go on ? But I really like this Aveeno scrub ( though `` scrub '' is a bit of an overstatement considering how small the beads are ) . I like the citrusy smell and the way it cleans gently . I wish it were a little more scrubby but I ca n't seem to find something that 's about half way between this and the super-rough St. Ives so I 'll stick with this until I do .	1
I love these . Minus one star because they are almost either too large , or too soapy . I cut them in half because I feel like I am wasting product at the end because their is a lot left in the pad . The cleanser is very gentle , and I really like the exfoliating side of the pad . Very useful for when I am in a hurry and do n't have time to do my whole skin care routine . I also like to use them in the morning if I need a quick cleanse or if I wake up and my face is a little oily .	1
This makes you glow . Evens skin tone and just gives your skin a beautiful look . Used for years . I hope they never change it or discontinue it .	1
My dermatologist recommended this brand of spf 30 for daily use because I have Rosecea . I love this brand because it gives me a nice fresh glow if I do n't wear makeup and it is easily worn under makeup because it 's not greasy . I 've tried many other brands and probably my 2nd choice would be Eucerine 's spf30 for face . But I still say this is the best because it does n't feel like you 've got sunscreen on . It seems to stay on well during exercise too , because I alway put it on when I go for bike rides and never burn .	1
This scrub replaces the Neutrogena scrub that my daughter and I used . I bought the Neutrogena for myself and as she progressed into a tween she needed a scrub too . She did n't care for the smell of the Neutrogena but it did work very well . I had been buying the Aveeno acne pads for her and decided to get this for the night time routine . She loves the smell and the texture and I love the great price . It leaves a soft glow to her skin and her face never feels oily.This combined with the Aveeno pads , a daily moisturizer with SPF 15 UV protector in the morning , followed by this at night , seems to be doing the trick for keeping acne at bay and keeping her young face bright and healthy.Do n't tell her but , dad is using it too now .	1
I started buying this as a lighter option for both sun protection and moisturizer . I also wanted to even out the ruddiness in my cheeks . It was n't awful , but I felt like my skin could be more even . I 've been buying this product ever since.Not only has my skin become more even toned and better moisturized , I 've actually found that daily use reduces the number of pimples I get . I 've never had full-blown acne , just the occasional pimple or two in my t-zone , especially around my nose and mouth . With this moisturizer , my skin is able to relax a bit with oil production , or at least produce it more evenly throughout the day , and I almost never break out anymore . I think it also helps keep me from getting mild sunburns , which dry the skin out and then cause it to overproduce oils to replace it.Basically , this lotion is awesome and you should buy like 10 of them.For general reference : I 'm a 23 year old female with fair , combination skin .	1
I decided to try this product when I came across it to see how well it works since everything else that I have tried tend to dry my face out and make it feel tight and stiff . This does the exact opposite , my face does n't feel dry after using it and it has a certain glow to my skin after using it . The best part of it all is that I can use it daily without it irritating my skin . Love it and would suggest anyone to try it .	1
Product is not greasy and has a nice tint to it . Works great under my makeup and does n't feel greasy or look shiny .	1
I like how my face feels after use , but it makes my skin dry so I must use moisturizer . I use this product 2 times daily and I think the pads are made way too big . I actually cut the pads in sixths and that 's really all you need for facial use .	1
This works great as a makeup and as a moisturizer , make you skin look perfect not too shiny not to matte , it 's just great if you are looking for a natural look and fair means fair , not chalky white	1
Just do n't get it in your eye . Clean , fresh smell and this product works great on my complexion . Few scrubs are better in my opinion .	1
Yes i am a middle age woman and i never used to use moisterizers and now i find i need to , and i do notice the difference in my skin as i used this daily .	1
My doctor recommended this because it provides good moisture and a safe physical ( non-chemical ) barrier to the sun . Love it .	1
I want to try out a new product . I have used olay . It was the best one . I wanted to try something different . So I gave this one a try . I have liked it . I would use this for now . It is cheaper at amazon . Liked it so much . I would recommend it .	1
THIS AVEENO SOAP MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH AND BABYLIKE . THIS IS THE ONLY SOAP I TRUST MY FACE WITH , & I 'M VERY PICKY WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL CLEANSING . IT ALSO MADE MY FACE A LITTLE LIGHTER , BUT OVERALL I 'M A SATISFIED CUSTOMER . DELIVERY WAS EXTREMELY FAST ...	1
I use a lot of acne treatment products for my frustrating adult acne , which dries my skin out quite a bit . I love this moisturizer because it 's not greasy nor too heavy , but it really does make my skin feel more supple and look better immediately after use . I use it every morning for sure , and sometimes at night before bed.I also like that it has light SPF , which should help with the wrinkles over the years , right ? RIGHT ? ; )	1
I have this tinted moisturizer in light/fair and I thought it was decent , but not great . It has a lot of sparkles in it , and I find that they rub off easily . At first I did n't notice the sparkles , and thought I was secretly a stripper at night ( Sleep stripping ? ) . Turns out it was this product . The bottle is very poorly designed ; product builds up on the outside , and then dries up , and has to be removed . It 's kind of gross . It wastes product , too . I ended up discontinuing use of this product before I ran out , because of how much glitter it contains .	1
I keep this bottle packed in my swim bag . My skin can get dry with swim workouts and I like to have a nice compact moisturizer along . This is nice and smooth and does the job ! Chris WodkeAuthor : Running for My Life-Winning for CMT	1
Love this because it is not heavy at all , goes on smoothand produces a natural look ( mine was light to medium ) .Not sure how well it lightens age spots , but mine do n't seemas prominent after a few weeks ' use .	1
This is definitely thick and kind of orange but if I am really careful about blending it looks pretty good . Sometimes I find it helpful to mix it with just a little bit of plain face lotion so it is easier to blend .	1
covers well , so creamy and not drippy at all . pretty color and coverage is excellent . does n't rub off or oil up like makeup . I use it everyday .	1
I love aveeno and this product last for a long time ( 4 months ) altough I use daily with my mia clarisonic still not harming my skin . However , I am giving 4 stars because I love the soft feeling ( luxus ) that regular foaming aveeno leaves in my skin . Yes , you must try ... will safe you some $ , since last longer than the foaming aveeno.xoxo	1
I have been using this cream for the past 6 months and I noticed how radiant it made my skin look in just days ! I wanted that summer glow and smooth skin , and it works perfect ! I always loved aveeno products !	1
This is one of the better acne products out there . I use it almost everyday to gently exfoliate and clean my skin . Some people , like my brother , prefer the large beads in a facial scrub , but I like the smaller beads in this one . Because the beads are finer , it feels like it 's exfoliating more evenly . It can also be used in combination with other products , where as other facial scrubs might be too harsh for combination with anything else in the day . I would recommend trying it out ; It 's effective , cheap , and the tube lasts for a really long time .	1
I love this product . Just enough color and great moisture . Does n't clog pores and at the end of the day still looks good . I do n't have to apply it again into the evening . Love Aveeno products and especially this one . Good service , arrived quickly almost as fast as if I went to a brick and mortor store and no waiting in line .	1
Aveeno is the only brand I buy for my self , it is the best for my skin . I have tried other and it does n't do as well .	1
I feel that women are really being taken for a ride by the cosmetics industry . I am always looking for excellent products that are truthfully , reasonably priced This moisturizer fits the bill . It smells wonderful , my skin sucks it right up , it does not cause acne or breakouts , and is very reasonably priced . If you are tired of sticker shock at other moisturizers , look no further.VERY pleased .	1
I love these cleansing pads , they feel good and make your skin feel super clean and healthy . My only complaint is the size-it is too big ! I usually cut them in half which makes them not round anymore and a little more difficult to use . I wish they would make these about 3/4 of the size and add a few extra pads .	1
I originally purchased this after getting a Clarisonic . The face wash that came with it was great , but a little pricy , and everyone recommended Philosophy ... but it was also too expensive.I knew I wanted a gel based cleanser and Aveeno is usually great on my very moody skin . This was perfect ! It 's hard to tell by the packaging , but yes , it is a gel.I have combination skin and this has really helped even everything out . My redness is gone ( also with help from the Clarisonic ) . It 's consistency and the way my skin feels immediately after rinsing are really similar to the expensive , department store brands.One of my favorite parts : I used this daily and it lasted me for several MONTHS . I could n't believe it . You really only need one pump , maybe two.It 's definitely an inexpensive partner to a Clarisonic system , but an absolutely perfect face wash on it 's own . I 'm usually not brand loyal in this area , but I wo n't be trying any others any time soon .	1
love it . affordable , nice coverage , nice color , and I think there is something to the soy in it , my skin feels softer . very pleased .	1
Even dry skin responds to this gentle 'body scrub . ' Aveeno products are usually affordable and effective so I have a tendency to purchase products from a brand name that I am familiar with and have used before . This will be another addition to 'my favorites list . ' Recommended for normal , dry and sensitive skin . If you have skin allergies , be sure to read the ingredient list !	1
I started using this product about 9 months ago . Love the way it feels when appliedto my face and neck . Love that is SPF 15 for daily use . No heavy scent a plus .	1
I have fibromyalgia so I am very sensitive to all these kinds of products.My mother recommended this to me and I have been using it for over a year.It is very lightly scented and has micro beads to exfoliate . I use itwith my Clarisonic and LOVE it ! ! Thanks Aveeno , you are the only company I havenever had problems with ! Yay ! !	1
I have very sensitive skin and this lotion works great with my skin , it does not irritate it at all . It makes it smooth , and silky and very even in tone . It does n't clog my pores , and handles my dry t-zone . I am a huge fan of Aveeno and have now found my new face lotion !	1
I 'm a 29 year old active male with moderately oily skin and I generally like this product . The exfoliation is more gentle than most `` scrubs '' due to the very tiny beads . It almost feels like you are rubbing fine grit sand on your face . The actual cleansing portion is fairly gentle and smells nice . Just a little dab of this will easily cover your face and I find one bottle lasting me over a month.One thing I will note is that this tends to be a tad harsh for normal skin - especially during the winter months . I like to mix usage of this withAveeno Smart Essentials Scrub , since the latter is a little more gentle on the skin for when you do n't need much exfoliation .	1
Ca n't beat that . It 's thicker than other moisturizers but it also has the light makeup in it . It goes on nicely and is not a heavy coverage light foundation . Very nice and smooth . My skin is quite fair and this provides just enough color .	1
Fantastic coverage . Hydrates and makes my face look youthful and energized with a glow . Slightly tinted and has sunblock SPF 30 . This is a keeper for me . Better than foundation !	1
I like the cream but I have been to Israel and LOVE some Ahava products I could only buy there so I did n't rate this 5 stars as I am comparing it to very high-end creams . My skin seems to be softer after using this consistently for the past 3 weeks . I wanted to wait until I used it for a few weeks before writing a review . I will buy it again and it was a decent price for the product !	1
I have been using these pads for quite some time now . I use the soft side of the pad and literally use them every day . If I run out and have to skip a day my face feels dirty . I love the softness and overall texture of my skin after using this product . I really hope they never discontinue them . A must have product and an awesome price !	1
I love this product , for its SPF quality as well as the light coverage it provides . It goes on smoothly and I use it every morning after I wash my face . It blends seamlessly with my skin color and provides a good base for my makeup .	1
I absolutely love this product ! Finally , a tinted moisturizer that actually has some coverage to it . I would definitely say this falls more into the BB cream category without all of the marketing gimmicks . I use this as my daily makeup , use some color correcting concealer if needed , and set with a translucent powder . I love that it is actually light enough for me , but be aware that there is nothing medium about this product , unless you are in the middle of the fair skin tones . I love that the product helps even out skin tone & has SPF 30 . This product is 14.99 at my local Target so be sure to price compare !	1
Great product . Cleanses as promised , no harsh ingredients and the scrubber side is effective . I continue with subscribe & save and recommend highly .	1
These were a gift . I am unsure as to how well the person likes them . However , we have not heard anything back from them so we can assume that they are being enjoyed .	1
I love this product as part of my weekly skin care . It 's a great mild exfoliant and does n't damage my fragile aging skin .	1
Bought this today at Publix ( our local grocery ) on clearance for $ 8.00 . I really didnt need a sunscreen , just a tinted moisturizer as I dont like to wear foundation in Fla. in the hot humid season . I read the other reviews and ( 1 ) The texture is due to the spf30 and quickly absorbs into the skin . ( 2 ) Dont buy this if you have very dry skin as it is a lighweight moisturizer . The fair to light works fine for me .	1
Very nice face cream . I have never tried Aveeno before and I love it . I can feel the softness of my skin after the first week .	1
This worked very well for me . I am so bummed that they stopped offering it . I do n't like the new formula as much .	1
It works great ! My face looks fresher after I use it . The skin looks like the stale layer of skin has been removed .	1
PROS- I LOVE the way this makes my skin look ! It has light reflectors that highlight parts of my face and gives my skin this gorgeous sheen.- SPF- Skin looks more even after continuous use . *CONS- *Unfortunately , it clogs my pores and causes me to break out if I leave it on all day ; on the other hand , if I wash it off immediately when I get home after a few hours , my skin looks better.- Not water resistant . It will & # 34 ; melt & # 34 ; when it comes in contact with water.I 've recently started trying to use more natural , eco-friendly products . Aveeno Positively Radiant Tinted Moisturizer is n't 100 % natural and I believe it has an EWG rating of 3 with limited information from Aveeno . Although it seems to clog my pores and melts when it comes in contact with water , I REALLY like the way it looks . I use it when I know that I wo n't be out all day , that I wo n't be around water and I want to look fresh .	1
Makes skin feel and look more visibly soft . Noticed after 2nd use . I 've been using this and clinique face wash for almost 2 weeks now and my deep dark very noticeable acne marks are almost invisible . One of my favs ! ! !	1
I do n't like heavy foundations , at all . I 've been trying to stick strictly to bare minerals , but in the desert heat that I live in it 's impossible for the minerals to stick to my dry skin . This moisturizer is the perfect remedy ! The coverage is n't total , but that 's what I love most about it ! It minimizes flaws so you do n't look like you 're trying too hard , it really makes your skin look natural . The light reflectors are nice too because they give my skin that youthful dewy look . I tone it down a bit with my bare minerals powder , but it 's nice to feel like your skin looks healthy , and that 's exactly what this product does.Also , I never felt that this moisturizer was too thick . One pump gave me total coverage and spread really easily . They only had medium in my store , and I have fair skin , but I still found it to blend really well with my skin color . I love , Love , LOVE this product ! ! !	1
These are perfect and gentle enough to use in place of facial scrubs . I cut these in half and use them once a week or so just as if I was using a facial scrub .	1
it makes my skin so bright and smooth ! ! i love this product , I just wish it were in a larger oz bottle rather than having to order a bunch of small ones , but it does last quite a while if you do n't use more than you need ( like i tend to do )	1
Great product . Love that is can help exfoliate your skin . I noticed a difference in my skin texture . It 's not horribly priced , but I still wish it was cheaper . The pads are super big , so I normally cut them into fours to get more use out of them . Would recommend .	1
I have tried facial creams priced from 200 dollars to 4.99 ! Aveeno is the very best without question . It hydrates , smooths , lightens dark areas , and is never greasy . Just try it once ~ you wont regret it ! NOTE : I recently discovered I have a wheat intolerance . SOME , not all , Aveeno product use wheat and oats . Even on my skin , I had problems with reactions . If you do not have wheat issue ... The Aveeno line is excellent in both results and social responsibility .	1
I have been using Aveeno for a long time . It is my favorite cleanser . What can I say about it , other than it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do . But just like anything else , you have to find the cleanser that works best for you . I do not wear liquid make up . I sometimes wear powder and blush , and I have tried other cleansers ( Oreal , Neutrogena ) , but I like this best .	1
I bought this because I love the Aveeno Positively Radiant ( non-tinted ) moisturizer that is SPF 15 and now that winter is here , my pale skin needs some color . I also use the Jergens Natural Glow facial moisturizer , but it just does n't keep my makeup in place throughout the day like Aveeno does . So , I bought this product thinking it was more like a gradual tanner . At first I was taken aback when I saw how thick the lotion is but I am pleasantly surprised . The Fair to Light is perfect for my skin and it evens it out nicely before I apply my daily makeup . I 've typically tried BB creams in the past for this purpose but they all make me break out . I 'd highly recommend this over a BB cream . Great product !	1
I have used this moisturizer for two years . My skin is combination with oily t zones and dry cheeks . This moisturizer works to even my skin out . The dark spots that I have from acne fade a lot quicker when I I use this also . I love that it has some level of sun protection but not enough to look white . The rough spots on my skin have also become smoother and my skin looks plumper when I let it soak in . Definitely a must in my skincare routine .	1
gave my skin a radiant tone , great to hide burns or eczema on face or neck area..love it .wow	1
Just the right shade when I go to church or any place I go out . I do not get out , except for church mainly .	1
I got this as a free sample with another purchase . It 's creamy and works as a sunscreen . I have oily skin and after several hours , my skin looks `` dewy '' but not as oily as with other more expensive moisturizers I have tried . My skin also got more even colored ( I tend to have redness in the cheeks ) . I ca n't give it 5 stars because my skin still feels oily to the touch , but otherwise I am pleased with it .	1
Not exactly what I was looking for , but it is a great scrub for gentle skin because the beads are so small . My sis likes that it is so gentle . I did n't realize that it did n't have any salicylic acid , though , until I arrived . If I were n't looking for a product with salicylic acid , this would have been perfect .	1
I work fast food so you can imagine how terrible that is for someone with sensitive oily acne prone skin . I went to spend some time with my sister straight after work one day and she had me use these and WOW is the best way to describe these wonderful things . My face felt completely clean like it cleaned away all of my makeup and i felt it cleaning my pores . I looked at my face the next day and it looked so much clearer than it has in years . I will definitely be buying some of my own and i recommend these to everyone who want a clear and clean face .	1
I 've used a lot of tinted moisturizers and as a rule I LOVE Aveno prouducts . To due skin cancer and using Renova , I have got to SPF my skin all year.I love Aveno products & my skin lady uses them after treatment . I am a natural platinum blonde so i go from very pale in the winter to a light tan as the weather warms.In general , this is a good quality product with adequate coverage & excellent SPF protection & while transparent it also evens out the complexion . I believe it has a powder base as this seems to sink into large pores and deep lines . TO avoid this , I put 3 drops of a higher SPF & mix it into the Aveno and then apply . This takes care of the problem.I also bought the light and medium and mix the two together to get the perfect shade . I store it mixed in a clean glass baby food jar & capped tight .	1
**Update from my last review : I absolutely love this stuff ! Yes , the price has gone up a little , but most things have . I have no complaints about this product , and I have substituted with other products on impulse in order to save money and/or try something different . All that did was solidify that I love this product . Aveeno products are consistently known for being gentle yet effective products . Almost all of my skincare regimen is Aveeno and I could n't be happier . It 's best to purchase from Amazon , especially when you have Prime membership which just makes it even more awesome . I use this as a daily moisturizer and a foundation for makeup . It provides just enough cover up to even my skin tone without leaving residue , buildup , or causing my skin to feel weighed down . Regardless of the weather , it does n't wear off either . It provides sunscreen , and overall continually moisturizes my skin during the harsh cold season and dry summer season also . This product wo n't ever let you down ! **From my teens into my early thirties now , I still have combination/oily skin that is incredibly sensitive to the point where it becomes bothersome . I 've been using this product for years , and for good reason ! I needed a quick morning makeup routine that would even out my skin tone , provide sunscreen , Moisturize and of course simple to use . I 've tried many , and this is the only product that works best for me . It blends in smoothly ( I have very fair skin so that 's the shade I choose ) . I use 1 pump and it 's more than enough to cover my entire face evenly , not too much and not too little . A little pressed powder and lipstick , and I 'm done ! ! Now , for the important reasons why I chose this brand over all the others.Makeup tends to be too heavy , which causes my already oily prone skin to feel weighed down . Others are too light , fading away into oblivion before I walk out the door in the morning.This product has multiple benefits:1 ) A little goes a long way , so the cost really is n't an issue for me.2 ) It contains sunscreen so my skin is protected.3 ) It 's dermatologist recommended , so I can trust that it 's safe for my sensitive skin because it 's free from harsh irritants ( everything says 'dermatologist recommended ' , so I did research to confirm it ) .4 ) It 's hypoallergenic . This ties in with reason # 3 , but this is a completely separate issue for me . Having sensitive skin requires a product that 's hypoallergenic . If it 's truly not , who knows what in it ? I do n't like taking those kinds of risks.Three years and going this product will always be part of my morning makeup routine .	1
I have been using this for several weeks now in the morning ( I use something else at night ) and it works well . The bottle is very nice but one pump does n't seem like enough so I always have to do at lest two . I use this with my Clarisonic face brush and it lathers up very nice . Everyone has different skin and everyone 's skin reacts differently to products . This product has n't broken me and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth . It does n't hydrate it as by the time I have my hair dried with the hair dryer I feel like I need some face lotion on . But I feel this is pretty typical for my skin during the winter months as it gets pretty dry . I would repurchase this cleaner in the future and would recommend it .	1
Aveeno Positively Radiant scrub is easy on my skin yet also effective at brightening my skin tone . It 's not all that easy to find products as compatible as this with sensitive skin . Recommended .	1
It smoothed my skin and left a nice non-glittery summer glow , but when washing it off there was a LOT of pigment on the cloth - which leads me to consider this more of a light makeup than a moisturizer.Update - it definitely leaves shimmeriness on my hands , not terrible , did n't notice until wearing it in the sun . I used this as my sunscreen on a trip to the beach and it worked well !	1
Very oily and creamy . Not at all what I expected ... ordered this to try to highlight and contour and it just looked awful ! ! ! Plus , took FOREVER to arrive .	-1
I really ca n't tell what exactly this thing is . It 's not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid . And so far I tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face .	-1
PLEASE DONT DO IT ! this just rachett the palette size is not like in the picture , the colors go on sheer , slides on face like wax do n't expect your makeup to stay put with this one . just spend the money for the good stuff . 2 thumbs down	-1
Chalky , Not Pigmented , Wears off easily , Not a Coastal Scents Dupe , Too many highlighter colors , Does not show up on dark skinned women.I would not recommend.The coastal scents is currently on sale . It 's worth the few extra bucks .	-1
Did nothing for me . Stings when I put it on . I used the whole tube and it just did nothing , no Lightening , no Brightening , ... ... NOTHING . Also it tends to dry out my skin and made my face feel weird the next day . I stuck with it hoping it would LIGHTEN , ... ..but it did n't .	-1
Did nothing for my skin . Used as suggested and no signs of brightness . Wish it worked for me , but it did n't .	-1
This gell did nothing at all . I religiously put it on specific areas for weeks and nothing changed . DO N'T WASTE YOUR TIME	-1
I used it for anal bleaching and it burned a bit there are no directions on it about time and how long to wear it	-1
I am not a perfume wearer , but I heard that this is very light and unlike any other perfume . I got this in the roll-on and I do n't care for it at all . Just like all other perfumes , it makes me nauseated . I 'll be giving this to a relative for Christmas .	-1
We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner . Had high hopes for it , and it did not deliver.The smell was okay.It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling , but not in a good way , more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.Even in using the conditioner , my hair still looked frizzy . And I do not have frizzy hair ! Mine is fine , thin , and straight . If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.Just can not recommend this product .	-1
I washed and conditioned 1 a week but did n't see much difference . No thickening . May work for thinning but I have actual loss of hair .	-1
Please avoid this product . The conditional is so thick that it does not flow out when you want to use it . As for quality , it is horrible . It makes your hair sticky as if you have n't rinsed your hair for days . I do n't see any good using it . I finally use Dove that I bought at Costco . It is cheaper and make your hair soft and weightless as well .	-1
I have thin fine hair and I am always searching for the `` miracle '' to a beautiful head of hair . This is not it . It may be organic and have less surfactants but , it 's the thinnest shampoo I 've ever used . Ca n't get it from bottle to hand to head without losing it down the drain . Stupid purchase . Oh well , next time .	-1
Rather than leaving my hair softer and more manageable ( which is a conditioner 's most basic function ) , this conditioner left a noticeable , waxy residue in my hair . I wonder if this gross waxy film is what makes your hair feel `` thicker and fuller '' . It does not glide on to hair very smoothly and smells like Pine Sol . Major disappointment . I wo n't be ordering this again and I would hesitate to try any other hair products offered by this company .	-1
I BOUGHT THIS Avalon Organics : Biotin B Complex Thickening Conditioner , 14 oz AND THE SHAMPOO AND USED IT DURING THE WHOLE 2012 AND NOT ONLY DID NOT THICKENED MY HAIR BUT IT MADE IT VERY DRIED .	-1
Product dried out my hair . I was disappointed since this is organic . I expected it to be better . But , Pantene works better than this and does not dry my hair out . Smell was ok . It was not overwhelming , but it did not smell great either . It did make my hair look thicker , but dried out .	-1
I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner . I had such high hopes , but in only two shampooings , my hair was noticeably stripped of oils , had that & # 34 ; squeaky clean & # 34 ; feeling you get when using a very harsh product , and it became dry and brittle . It started looking very dull . They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair , like orange oil and lemon oil . You might think because it says , 'oil ' that it might add to your hair 's shine , but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers . This product only damaged my hair . Avalon is only 70 % organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me . Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap . Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair . I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price , but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos , I ca n't imagine what it might do to yours . Although my hair is very fine , so perhaps ethnic girls , and women with coarser hair might benefit ? I honestly would n't recommend it . I 'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately , rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me , it blows Avalon out of the water . In just one shampoo my hair regained it 's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair . I ca n't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident . They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues , or who have an increase in DHT . You do pay more than double for that shampoo , but having something that supports your hair , improves the texture , and smells fantastic , was worth it to me . I 'm now quite confident in what I 'm using and plan to go on using it , regardless of the cost . I 'd pay 5x what I 'm paying for it now , I love it so much . And their treatment spray is oil based . I use the system twice a day and I 'm shocked at how long it is lasting . It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system . This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients , can only do so much . Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT . By helping to combat it twice a day , you have a better chance of seeing results sooner . This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on . Once a day just never cut it for me . Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight , can also work wonders . I use it during the day too if I 'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair , and your self-esteem , a little faster and more efficiently . : o )	-1
I was using these in my shower , but got tired of the pumps not working , especially with conditioner . It took so many pumps to get all the conditioner I needed . Worked great for shampoo . Anything thicker than shampoo , forget it . I went back to sticking with the bottles the shampoo and conditioner came in . Yes , it saved space in the shower , but I 'm standing in the shower for 10 minutes trying to get all the conditioner out .	-1
This is the second Better Living Classic Dispenser IV I 've purchased in the last twelve months and these things suuuuuuck . So why , you ask did I buy a second one ? ? ? Because one day recently as soon as I 'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles , one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces . I 'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid would n't have closed in the first place . Also , the unit was never bumped , jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose . So ... manufacturing defect ? I think so.Anyway , I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous , & # 34 ; we 'll send you one free of charge since it 's our crappy product 's fault. & # 34 ; Instead , I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts ( this is likely where they make most of their money ) . At over $ 5 for a cheap plastic bottle that I now know will shatter if dropped three feet , I was loath to buy one but basically had no choice . I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they do n't ship to military APO addresses ( which have California zip codes , BTW ) . I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost . Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break . Do yourself a huge favor and avoid Better Living products altogether as there are many other & # 34 ; better & # 34 ; options out there .	-1
I bought a similar type of dispenser back in 1995 , when I was outfitting my new apartment . Perhaps that was the Dispenser Classic I . That one lasted 11 years without a problem and I threw it out only because it looked old and I was moving . Flash forward to 2011 . I decided to buy one for my condo . A day or two after I put in the bottles , I noticed shampoo from the dispenser dripping onto the faucet . It turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it . It was tiny but enough to cause a serious leak . I examined the bottles closely and realized how thin and cheap the plastic containers really are . Unbelievable . Now I have to decide whether to use Crazy Glue or go through the hassle of emptying the two other containers and sending the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund . If this is the Classic III , I wonder how bad IV will be . I 'd be hesitate to order this again .	-1
I have long , thick , and straight hair . I bought this curling iron because I wanted to curl my hair for special occasions . This curling iron does n't curl my hair much at all . All it does is make a little wave at the very end of my hair and that is when it 's set to the highest setting . Pass this curling iron , especially if you have hard to curl hair .	-1
It gets too hot and is hard to handle without burning myself . It will go out for a garage sale .	-1
I like the size of the barrel on this iron and I like the results I got with it . However the design of the kickstand and its location are horrible and unsafe.When you heat the iron up on the higher settings the kickstand gets very , very hot and it 's very difficult to use the iron without touching that kickstand because of where it 's located . I burned my hand on it while holding the iron and then I burned my face with the kickstand while curing my hair.I 'm not at all happy with this product and I 'm returning it after using it only twice .	-1
I absolutely love this conair instant heat curling iron ! I ordered it on amazon because of the great price . It did not come in the packaging I 'm used to seeing in stores but figured it may have just changed since my last curling iron purchase ( last year ) . The first time I used it it worked great . The second it kept turning off or shorting out on me . I changed outlets and still the problem continued.I would recommend this curling iron to a friend but perhaps not through the internet.I re-ordered thinking it was just a defective one and the second time , it would n't even heat up enough to hold a curl . I think Conair has changed it 's product and I will not buy again .	-1
I asked my husband to go out and get me a curling iron with a fat barrel and this is what he got me . It has a large barrel , it heats up extremely quickly , and it has automatic shut-off . Those are some definite pluses , but there are a few things that bother me . The barrel is short compared to my other curling irons . The stand gets in the way , though I can fold it back ; and the the way the handle is designed , it 's not comfortable to hold . I accidentally change the heat settings just trying to curl my bangs.It works , but all the little details make this my least desirable curling iron of all time .	-1
It wo n't curl my hair . I set it at 15 and I wait and wait and wait and my hair falls flat . My hair can curl with curling irons but not this one !	-1
The pencil part is so hard I can not line the rim of my eyes at all and it 's also difficult to use it on my eyelids . It 's fine for the eyebrow if that 's all you want it for .	-1
This is not doing the job I thought it would . Should an emergency occur I may try it again , but to date it has fallen below my expectations.It is hard to apply to the actual area where it is needed and seems only to want to cover ( and stick to ) unblemished skin ... which is kind of useless .	-1
I picked up this concealer to cover up acne , blemishes , pimples , the works . I was trying to decided between this one and the light one but decided to go with this one as the green is supposed to cancel out the redness . This stick concealer is near impossible to blend to a nice finish and it leaves a sticky and waxy residue on your skin . As to no surprise , the packaging is just as flawed as the product itself . Within a week of using this product the concealer stuck to the top of the tube and I could n't get it out . Ick !	-1
It is very hard to blend in to your skin . I have to add moisturizer to it in order to blend it in . Will not buy again .	-1
I 'm no expert at beauty , so this is just one regular user 's experience . However , I put it on and it stayed green , which had me worried . I blended it , and could see the blemish ( red ) peeking through , while the green remained stubbornly green . Given that it 's a stick of concealer , it 's a little insulting to think I did it wrong . Nevertheless , I removed it and tried again . Same result.So I went ahead and did my usual powder foundation/settling veil powder routine , and lo and behold - I could still see the blemish AND the green through my makeup.I 'm not really sure what 's going on . Perhaps I 'm using the wrong color concealer ? Either way , it really did n't behave or perform the way I expected or hoped it would . Good thing it was cheap because it has been sitting , unused in a drawer since day 1 .	-1
I purchased this product to conceal redness . Unfortunately , it cakes so much that it ca n't be blended . On any area where there is not a spot of redness , this product actually makes you look green . Just try to blend it -- if you can imagine trying to budge a layer of crayon mixed with cake frosting smoothly over your skin . Not happening . Also , the scent is a bit unattractive , almost like some kind of clay . Not for me .	-1
I had been usingSheer Cover SHEERCOVER duo concealer LIGHT/MEDIUM 3gthat was gifted to me but when I ran out a couple of months ago , and did n't want to shell a load of money , I decided to try OTC versions.Overall , this version provides 'okay ' coverage but it 's not as dark as I 'd consider 'Medium Beige ' . It 's more like Fair or light Beige . The product is creamy and blends well enough and it lasted for most of the day but I do have dry spots and it could end up looking flaky . I use a mineral or loose power over my foundation and concealed spots but it was a nightmare on any delicate areas where my fine lines exist , such as around the eyes , mouth , nose and even the chin area , made for a scary end result when using loose or mineral powder over it . In other words , the lines become more prominent and it looked really caky , especially under my eyes to cover the circles . It was obvious I was wearing concealer no matter where I was using it . It did best on the smoother planes of my face , just not in the spots I needed the coverage.The lipstick tube shape makes for an easy application and control , but that 's all I really liked about it . Waterproof ? Meh . For the price and results , I was n't impressed and will throw out this one and try something new .	-1
This does n't blend into the skin well and it do n't seem to cover my redness any better than a regular concealer . If you use too much it also leaves a green hue to your face so you have to be very careful . I would n't recommend for large areas .	-1
Unless you have very fair skin , this concealer is to light for Asian color skin . It does n't blend very well with your foundation and looks caky on your face .	-1
So i was pretty excited that i got this in the mail , but seriously ... ..i think its just the color of mine , i do n't know , not good cover stick ... Received it sticking to the top ... so basically it was broken when i opened it because of the air mail looks very pasty ... very white i shall say ... im never buying this product ever..	-1
I have a lot of redness on my face , so I thought I would try this concealer . It is so hard and dry that you pull your skin applying it , especially around the tender eye area . It needs to be a bit creamer to be able to spread . Maybe I got an old one ? ? Anyway , wo n't bother to buy this again .	-1
Ok but am not using it . Does n't seem to cover the scar on my face like I thought it would . Possibly my skin is to fair for it . Just not satisfied .	-1
Not my favorite eye makeup remover ... . It is a bit oily and I was still left with raccoon eyes after using it . I will not purchase this kind again	-1
It does remove most of my eye makeup but not all . When I use it , it seems to remove it all but then I wash my face and see black mascara rings under my eyes . I 'm using as directed , so I feel it 's not that effective . Also , it is moisturizing but too 'oily ' for me . I find myself wiping my eyes on my face towel but still feel a residue around my eyes . I think it 's all right but I would n't purchase again . Almay 's makeup remover pads did a much better job but they were somewhat drying ... so I 'm still on the lookout for an ideal mascara remover	-1
I am not trying to make advertise for the Mary Kay one I was just using it before I bought this Maybelline branded one , this one can do nothing with my waterproof Eye mascara also this bottle is so small , can be only used as a trave sized item ! !	-1
This eyeliner was completely useless . It felt like the inside of the bottle was dried out or the liner was just so light and useless that you could n't even see it . Also , the brush sucks . Overall , terrible .	-1
I heard that this eyeliner had super staying power , and it was super cheap , so I decided to give it a try.This stuff is awful . It smells bad , and the brush is kind of gloppy . I 've been wearing eyeliner for years ( gel is my preference ) , but this stuff was awful especially once it dried . It dried into this plastic strip on my eye , and it just felt awful .	-1
I tried this because honestly it was n't that expensive , but I found the brush applicator to be a DISASTER to apply , it went all over my eye except where I was aiming it to go , not good ! ! ! ! its like a long thin nail polish brush tip at the end , I had no control over the brush because of that ! this is a disaster in a bottle for me	-1
Goes are great ! Unfortunately , the tip is n't a felt tip , its more like a mini-paint brush , so it tends to get all over if you 're not careful.Pros : *Great color ( for a little while ) *Dries QuicklyCons : *Smudges*Rubs off easily*Do n't recommend with OILY eyelids	-1
The brush for this eyeliner is horrible . I LOVE brushes , and prefer them over felt tips but this is the exception . The brush for this eyeliner is VERY small and too soft . It 's hard to make a straight line because the bristles are just all over the place . Additionally , when you go over to reapply liner in some places - when it dries , it tends to look very clumpy and unflattering . I had such high hopes for this liner because of the brush applicator and how beautifully matte the color was but this is a total fail .	-1
I feel bad giving this two stars- because it really is my fault that I do not like this . I have a hard time doing the quick swipe across the eyelid and typically do short strokes from corner of the eye out , but you need to be fast with this one . It dries too quickly for me and going over , even slightly , removes it or makes it clump up .	-1
For having a bunch of promises about how well it 'll work , this bottle is only about a two-week supply , and it makes no difference in anything -- sweat , breath , etc . Save your money and just use perfume and lots of soap and mints !	-1
I dont like this stuff at all . I dont feel fresh . I have tried other brand that actually works . I will be going back to that one . Very disappointed : - (	-1
The smell is so bad and it honestly reminds me of moth balls , which I can not stand . I was recently diagnosed with Guttate Psoriasis , and only have a few small patches on my scalp . Decided to try this stuff , bought it at a local grocery store because I had a $ 2 off coupon . It seems to help a little , but honestly , I just ca n't stand the smell . Along with the smell , the shampoo makes my hair feel nasty , not greasy or dry , just weird . When trying to style my hair after using this , I have really bad results . So if you have very short hair and do n't need any body in your style , this may not be a problem for you . If you can stand the smell and the bad hair style , go for it . Would never buy this again and I try never to waste stuff , so I may try what one other reviewer suggested and mix this with another shampoo , to help hide the smell . I am doubtful that it will work , but may give it a try .	-1
This product burns my scalp and doesnt get rid of my dandruff.Ive tried cutting down my use of this product so that I wouldnt cause irritation to my scalp but Im deciding to give up on it because I dont need to be in pain when I wash my hair for no results anyway.I have contacted the company because I am that unsatisified with this product . Its a shame because I really love nuetrogena products and this is the only time that I have had an issue with something they make .	-1
I was instructed to use this 3-4 times a week . It has Not cleared up my dandruff . In despiration I switched to Selson blue deep cleasning shampoo with deep cleasning beads . The selson blue works so much better . I am sticking with the selson blue . My dandruff is not an issue now . This coal tar shampoo did n't do anything for it . A waste of money for me .	-1
I am usually not sensitive with the smells . I am talking about I was never bothered by the Selsun Blue Shampoo smell or even the Blue bottle of Head and Shoulders and they are pretty strong ( that medicated smell lingering on your scalp ) . BUTTTT ... this shampoo is over-the-top smelly and after three days , I could not stand that burning rubber stench on my scalp . I totally understand it 's made partly with tar but I am sure even if you are n't phased by the smell yourself , others might go.. '' Whoa '' . On the first or second day , after a trial/change of shampoo , I would feel my hair or scalp `` feel '' a bit better ( not 100 % , but FEEL ) . I felt like my hair smelled really bad and scalp got a bit more inflamed but that could just be me , individually . If you are out of options beyond the usual scalp treatment shampoos , give it a try , it might work for you . The smell was obviously the factor to say NUH UH for me.By the way , I did n't experience extreme dandruff ( the type that flakes all over clothes ) . I just noticed for the past days , my scalp had patches of red and it was sort of scaly and it had a tad of itchiness . It could have been some weather changes or something but I am better now after going back to the usual OTC dandruff shampoos .	-1
I bought a bottle of this , and they sent me two , by accident I imagine . I have psoriasis , with a few spots on my scalp . Hoped this would help out , but I did n't see a difference , I used both bottles , and let it soak in my hair for plenty of time when showering . Did n't see any results . Decent shampoo though , hair feels clean .	-1
I bought this because the price was good . I was using a store brand for the same item , but since the price was good , thought I would try the name brand . I hated the smell ! It is so bad ! I went back to the store brand .	-1
I very badly want to leave this product a good review , but in the interest of honesty , here goes ... I bought this shampoo solely on the basis of excellent reviews . Many of the reviewers mentioned this product 's ability to deal with their itchy and often oily scalp . This was my concern too . A huge benefit I noticed right away was that it made my hair ( not my scalp ) feel really really clean- it would even squeak when I would squeeze out the water , post-shower . So , I was excited about how well it worked and how quickly.But I noticed within a day of using it that I now had a problem I never had before : flakes ! So many of them , and so disgustingly visible ! Further , after a day of washing , my scalp got extremely oily- more so than it did before . Still , I 've been using it and giving it a chance , at least until I am done with this entire ( small ) bottle.I am about half way through the bottle , washing my hair every other day , and have experienced the same results consistently . However , I will use it until the bottle is empty , and if results change , I will update this review . I am hoping the negative results are just an initial reaction to new treatment . If anyone else has had this reaction and wants to share any tips , I 'm all ears !	-1
I buy the DHS fragrance-free shampoo and love it ( DHS Clear Shampoo , Fragrance Free - 8 fl oz ) . I bought this along with it the first time . Unfortunately , I 'm highly chemically sensitive and could n't use this product because it still has a chemical smell . The shampoo has no discernible smell to me .	-1
This is too light ... did n't do anything for my hair . I also found the shampoo terrible ... left my hair dry . I would n't recommend it .	-1
Williams Lectirc Shave is a great product that has served men 's electric shaving needs for several decades ! BUT DO N'T buy it here ! WHY ? I did n't pay close enough attention to the prices vs weight and when it arrived I was really angry ! This is the 3 ounce travel bottle that you can sometimes find in you local drug store for about $ 2.50 , NOT $ 5.62 ! ! ! For $ 5.48 - $ 5.85 you can buy the 7 ounce bottle at every drugstore in your town or on line at CVS.com or Drugstore.com or any other online national drug store chain . DO N'T GET RIPPED OFF BY THIS SELLER ! ! YOU ARE PAYING TOO MUCH FOR WHAT YOU GET ! THE PRICE SHOULD BE FOR THE 7 OUNCE BOTTLE AND NOT THE 3 OUNCE BOTTLE . RIP OFF ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
I bought this Extra gentle sponge in search of a certain texture . I seems like a great sponge but it just too rough for my sensitive skin . I ended up using this as a body sponge so as not to waste my purchase .	-1
It has sylisic Acid in it..It 's really hard on your skin . My Skin was in horrible shape after I used this..	-1
I like putting on face lotion before I put my makeup on . This lotion just does n't feel like it even moisturizes your face ) : stopped using after one use	-1
As the title says , it broke me out really bad . I finally had figured out what worked for my skin and had a semi clear face with a pimple or two here and there ( that time of the month , stress ) but I needed just a bit more of moisture so I decided to try this moisturizer -- BIG mistake . I usually brake out on my chin/jaw and in between my eyebrows/forehead so when I woke up the next day I had so many little white in those exact spots . I can not tell you how upset I was and how itchy my face was . I hate this product and would not recommend this to somebody who has acne-prone , sensitive , oily skin.I only gave it a star because I could not give it zero stars !	-1
I have combination skin and have been using this daily for the past 2 weeks . However , there has n't been any noticeable difference on my skin . I still break out , and my dark spots do n't seem to be going anywhere soon . It moisturizes okay ( nothing special ) , but in terms of treating pimples , this dual-action product leaves its promise unfulfilled .	-1
Seems to rub in well but after about an hour or two my face is greasy all over . After a long time I realized it was this product . I gave it away .	-1
Between this Neutrogena Spot Treatment and Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum , there is no contest ! The Oxy works and the Neutrogena does not , pure and simple . I have only the occasional pimple these days , but want a treatment that quickly dries up the oil and inflammation . The Oxy costs more but is worth the price , the Neutrogena does nothing ( as far as I can tell ) as a spot treatment . A better medicine will prevent scarring and disfiguring marks on your face ! Early application of effective medicine can stop an emerging blemish before it becomes much worse . The Oxy Spot Treatment Maximum did a far better job for me .	-1
Everyone has different skin , but mine tends to dry out and get easily irritated . I thought Neutrogena On-the-Spot would be a good solution because of the lower concentration of benzoyl peroxide . Unfortunately the product made my skin red and flaky , so much so that it is taking a few days for my skin to get back to normal . I usually have pretty good luck with Neutrogena products , but I think I 'll be getting my skin care items elsewhere .	-1
I hate this stuff ! It did n't do anything to help my acne . All it did was make my skin so painfully sensitive all over ! I wish I could get a refund . I used it for a good week . I have hormonal acne , and this had no impact on it . It was as if I 'd put nothing at all on ( aside from the horrible dryness and burning ) .	-1
These recent reviews are correct.I never tried the past formula but this one is no good.I did n't care for it the first couple times I tried it , but I had to give this another shot because my usual moisturizer ran out . I was slow in picking that one up because it 's $ 15 ( pretty pricey but oh so worth it ) . I should have just broke the bank because this stuff broke my face.I was wondering why I was breaking out more than usual . I typically break out along my lower cheeks , but it was spreading to my temples and forehead.I just bought my usual moisturizer yesterday , and I already see an improvement overnight . It 's gon na take a couple weeks to get rid of the mess this caused , I 'm sure.Seriously , try to look for a more natural product . Do n't waste your time & money on this.On a good note for Purpose , I do use their gentle cleansing wash which is A-OK !	-1
This product is really runny and watery . I do n't like the consistency of it and does not seem to clean my face as well as other products . I think I will stick to expensive facial cleansers , such as philosophy	-1
I really have only one complaint ; so far as I can tell , in essentials , this bar cleanser is much the same as it ever was , but I could SWEAR that the bar I used several years ago was fragrance-free . I know I would never have even tried it if it had smelled like this then . I mean , part of the Cetaphil brand 's selling point is that its skincare products have no fragrance added to them that would irritate sensitive skin . So why does this Cetaphil product have any fragrance at all ? I usually have no problems with lightly-scented skincare products , provided they are only LIGHTLY scented . I 'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients , but I still have to avoid most of them because for me , strong perfumes set off major migraines . Other than that , some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice . But this ... THIS was like my worst nightmare of every ancient , long-expired bottle of old-lady perfume dumped into a single bar . It 's intolerable . I could n't even just throw it away ; it still stunk up the whole bathroom from the bathroom trash can . I ended up taking it straight outside to the dumpster . And I still had to empty the half-full bathroom garbage to get rid of that sickening , cloying , unbearable scent that sparked off a 2-day migraine.Maybe I 'm just missing something obvious . I would appreciate it if someone could let me know IF Cetaphil still makes a fragrance-free bar soap/cleanser . I 'd like to go back to using an old favorite , but I ca n't find the `` old '' favorite .	-1
I 've been looking for a soap to clear my breakouts and this one was kind of a disappointment . I used it on my body and my face , and did n't get the results I was hoping for at all . It was n't the worst soap I 've tried , but it 's low on the list .	-1
I am so unhappy with this item , I oredered it because It said 100 % aloe , I fell for thepackage info , this is n't 100 % aloe , and when I put it on my face after a derma roll , oh my god , it burned , real aloe does n't burn , because I have used other brands and real aloe . I am returning this , Ica n't believe the waste of money and time getting it through the mail . consumers need tostop deceiving to sell . : (	-1
UHG . How did I fall for & # 34 ; 100 % Gel. & # 34 ; Yuck . As another reviewer pointed out , that does not mean 100 % Aloe ... I tried to use this once , but it just did n't even feel right . Waste of money ! ! !	-1
This product does come with warnings and you should heed them . I used it and noticed immediately that my skin did not like it . It probably is a great product but not on my skin .	-1
I bought several of the Alpha Hydrox line of products and there are a few I really won & # 34 ; t buy again . This is one of them I do not like the consistency of this product . The night replenishing cream is much better .	-1
Alpha Hydrox might as well close it 's doors . I do n't know what happened because twenty years ago they had amazing products for a cheap price . Now they cost twice what they did then , understandable with inflation , but do n't work worth a darn . Yet another epic fail . I am so disappointed in this product line . I purchased several different products a few months ago and after finishing the bottles am still convinced they are absolute garbage . They do not do what they claim but if you just want a lotion ... here you go . They are just like any other plain old lotion .	-1
You can not use this under make up you can not use this at all . Now I sound like Dr. Suess lol . It peels off as you rub it in I was not happy w/ this at all	-1
I have been searching for a lower cost alternative to DDF 's glycolic acid cleanser and I ordered this one . I found the product to be so weak as to not make much difference in how clean and clear my face was after using it .	-1
Got a very bad rush from it . I might have very sensitive skin.Used it two days and I started noticing my face was itching and a small swelling near my cheeks . I thought it was something I ate or just a bad day.I continued using face wash for 3 days and rash would n't go away . I stopped using it and notice rash disappeared . This is just my experience.I was worried that since is a care product I would n't be able to return it and that I was stuck with the face wash but Thanks to the great customer service of Amazon I was able to get a refund and dispose of the face wash .	-1
I purchased this product because I was so impressed with the Alpha Hydroxy Face Lotion , as it leaves my skin bright and clear and I have minimal break outs , so I figured the facial wash would do the same.. So I stopped using my normal face wash and I used this product instead for about a month and I noticed more irritation if anything ... It was n't really stopping my breakouts just leaving my skin red with more bumps than normal . I thought using the both in conjunction would just work best but I 'm starting to think my skin is too sensitive and can not take too much of the same thing ? I am not quite sure ... but I 'm going back to my old facial wash and sticking to the alpha hydroxy face lotion . Another thing is that facial washes really do not exfoliate your skin.. They just tone it.. and I think I need more exfoliation or I wish they had exfoliation beads in this product.. Maybe it would 've worked better ? Idk..	-1
I had high hopes for this product because of all the amazing reviews , but it really let me down ! I switched over from Bliss No Zit Sherlock face wash because this one was cheaper but unfortunately I 've experienced horrible breakouts ever since . My pores are clogged and I 'm getting zits all around my hairline and chin.I would n't recommend this product to anyone who has acne . Very disappointed !	-1
I have suspicions that this may be a counterfeit . I purchased this because it was rated so high . After washing and drying my face , my face starts to burn . I then have to rush and put moisturizer on my face as quick as possible to avoid/eliminate the burning . I have also noticed some dry patches on my face since beginning to use this . Finally , my face burns during the day if I happened to sweat outside.All three of these experiences are new to me . I have never experienced any of these things with any other cleanser .	-1
I have very sensitive facial skin prone to acne . I began using this night and day , as directed , for about 1 week . It cleanses well and thoroughly , but after about a week of usage ( washing twice a day ( as indicated in directions ) , I developed dry skin with red rosacea-like patchy bumpy areas on my skin . I think washing twice a day or even once a day with this cleanser , may be too much for very sensitive skin . It may be OK to use a few times a week during the night . After stopping using it , I continued to have red patches and bumps on my skin which took about a few weeks to heal . If your skin is NOT sensitive to alpha hydroxy acid , it may be OK to use , but I have decided after using this , that my skin must be sensitive to the ingredients , so I returned it.Note : you should make sure to wear a good sunscreen since using any products with AHA ( alpha hydroxy acid ) can make your skin more sensitive to the sun .	-1
I was eager to try this after such high recommendations . I was hoping it might help get rid of the post-acne red marks on my very pale sensitive skin . Unfortunately this was waaay too drying ( even for my relatively oily skin ) and gave me a terrible reaction right away . It made me break out in painful rash like bumps on my face . I think I must just be allergic to AHA ... I know it works amazingly for others , but just wanted to share my experience .	-1
I do n't think my skin is overly sensitive or anything but this product caused my neck to start burning and itching , I had to wash the product off of my neck immediately.It also caused my face to break out , I gave it a few tries to see if my skin just needed to get used to it but my skin was not happy.For me this was a waste of money . It also has this chemical smell that even my fiance noticed after I put it on.I would not recommend this .	-1
didnt like it i prob will keep it and later throw it out or give my mum see if it works for her was waste of money !	-1
read the reviews and tried it . used for a month and saw no difference at all . i am over 60 with a few fine lines on my face . i really like dr graf the best which really showed a big improvement on my skin	-1
Should n't really comment because I stopped using this after a week . it stung my face a little . I started using Jan Marini 's Bioglycolic face lotion , a little more expensive but great product .	-1
If you want to live your life like a vampire ... this is the right product for you ! Why ? Well , I found out the hard way , Glycolic Acid increases your skins sensitivity to the sun . A warning was issued on the lable , but silly me did n't think it would be that big of a deal . I burnt horribly the next day from 20 min . of sun exposure ! YIKES ! Not worth it.It does , however , improve the look of the skin , the price is great , and there is no fragrance ( YAY ) . BUT , like most beauty products , it has dimethicone , which is an acne irritant . If you have horrible acne like me , dimethicone is TERRIBLE for you ! Find something with out it ! If you do n't , than this might work nicely for you . Dimethicone is bad no matter what , but it wont hurt your skin appearance if you have no acne .	-1
This product did n't say whether it could or could not be used on the face , however , I chose to use it on the face because the active ingredient was Glycolic-AHA . It broke me out on the forehead and scattered acne on my cheeks and jawline . I recommend acne.org 's AHA lotion . I 've been using ACNE.ORG 's skin line for a year and they have an AHA lotion along with acne care and it works amazingly . I actually had to go back to it and it cleared my acne up again .	-1
The product arrived in a timely manner , but the packaging it was in could use some improvements . First of all , it came one of those yellow manilla envelopes lined with bubble wrap . Inside , the product box was crushed . I believe the seller should start shipping the product in a small box instead of an envelope to prevent this from happening in the future.Secondly , the product I received did not match the one in the picture . The one in the picture seems `` newer '' - newer , more modern packaging and font . The one I received looked like a lotion bottle from the 90 's . I 'm not sure if I received an outdated product or it was just in outdated packaging , but the lotion itself left much to be desired . I followed the instructions and applied the lotion to a clean face , morning and night . My face looked really smooth in the morning when I first woke up ... until I had to wash it again and reapply the lotion . It made my face red and made all my imperfections stand out more . Definitely will not be buying/using again .	-1
I usually use luxury products . A beauty book convinced me to try this . I found it sticky and smelly . Did n't use long enough to see if it worked or not . Back to my Kiehl 's , Lush , Dermatologica , and Origins staples .	-1
I do n't know what it is about AHA products but they all make me break out insanely . I thought maybe it was just the face wash so I tried the lotion because of all the amazing reviews but it was horrible . First , it does n't blend well into the skin . Within two days of using it I have acne all over my face , blackheads and huge cysts . I definitely would n't recommend this to anyone who has acne . There are waaayy better products , like Bliss No Zit Sherlock.Edit : I had 2 people say this review was `` unhelpful '' so maybe I should clarify . I DO NOT have sensitive skin at all , I 've never had a rash or any type of allergic reaction to a face product before . Maybe this is an allergic reaction , there 's a first time for everything ! Personally , I just think this product is not good for people who have acne , but it could just be me .	-1
This product seems to be doing its job , my skin is soft and smooth and feels great ! However the downside would be the smell of this product . It 's not horrible ... just unpleasant . The offensive odor does n't linger overly long , it 's mostly gone within 15-30 minutes , but it really takes away from the enjoyment of this product.I also purchased the Alpha Hydrox Night Replenishing Cream , which has almost no odor at all .	-1
I bought this to try because it seemed to have some good active ingredients at a fair price . Alas , as I already know , you get what you pay for . First , the smell is pretty off putting , but that 's not the deal breaker for me . What I really dislike is the watery texture and how it seems to just sit on my skin in white streaks that do n't seem to absorb so much as dry on the face . This just feels icky yo use before bed and it 's definitely not right for under makeup . Once it finally dries , it does sort of tighten the skin , but leaves it feeling sort of tuggy , not soft and smooth.I am generously giving this 2 stars because at least it does n't seem to cause any adverse reactions .	-1
I have what is called kp on my upper arms after the birth of my third child . I read the reviews and was so excited this could be the answer to my prayers ! ! ! ! ! Wrong answer , it did not go away and worst of of looks like it got worst ... I would not advise anyone who wants to buy this for kp , it did n't work for me ... ... ..	-1
I used this twice and had to give up . After using it , I got horribly painful cystic pimples . Not sure if it 's supposed to work like that , but it 's not worth it to me . Wish the seller would refund me , but no luck.I just started using a 40 % glycolic peel and it 's already worked 200 % better than this . If you can handle an at home peel , I suggest it !	-1
I tried this product because I feel like I 've tried everything else for my acne prone skin . While other people reported great results , I did not see any improvement .	-1
I 'm trying to find someone that I know that I can give this to . It did nothing for me . I have other products that I 'm using now that I can tell a difference from right away this lotion did nothing .	-1
I bought this product based on the rave reviews about using it as a treatment for acne . I currently have a strict regimen I stick to every morning and every night that is the only thing that works for me . I added the Alpha in and have seen no significant difference . It 's on par with using 2 % salicylic acid , which does n't do much . I wo n't be repurchasing this as I do n't feel it 's worth the money.My products : Morning- 15 % Benzoyl Peroxide face wash , 1 % clindamycin lotion ( prescription ) Afternoon - 1 % Clindamycin lotionNight - 10 % Benzoyl peroxide creamI tried using this in the morning before applying my clindamycin lotion and then again in the afternoon after washing my make up off . It 's better than using nothing but barely .	-1
AHA products break some people out terribly , and that 's what happened to me . At least now I know to be extra wary of AHA . I used it for a month , and reduced the number weekly applications once my face started freaking out . Unfortunately it did not get better from there . Based on the research I did prior to purchasing , this is probably a good product to buy if you already know AHA does n't give you evil acne , and you do n't mind a bunch of parabens .	-1
Did n't like the texture of this lotion . I was using it to remove my make up and did n't have any success . I would wash my face with it , then use Bioderma Sensibio H2O and I could see all the makeup I had left on my face . I gave it to a friend that uses it in the morning .	-1
I have normal skin with very minor `` acne '' this mosturizer made my face look so greasy . If you have extreme dry skin then this is totally for you .	-1
Uhh , did I get a bad batch ? I love Cetaphil 's face wash , but this was a dud . I could n't use it on my face because it made me break out . It also was impossible to blend into the skin , leaving a white film for a few minutes until it soaked in on its own . When it did soak in it left a sticky feeling on my skin . Cetaphil failed me here .	-1
I do n't know why people use crap like this.It is full of chemicals that I would not put on my body because those chemicals you put ON your body go into your body.So what does one use instead ? Well just about EVERY brand you can buy online or at the drugstore uses bad ingredients.So it 's better to use natural stuff like : shea butterCoastal Scents Unrefined Shea Butter , 16 Ouncejojoba oilorganic coconut oilYou can easily mix this stuff together and make your own 100 % natural and CHEAPER creams and oils for your face and body and not risk getting cancer from all those bad chemicals.Check out this info : beautyoffood.com/ ? hop=nfopowerUnfortunately the `` beauty industry '' will put any crap into a product if it will make your skin look or feel better but they do n't give a dang about how it might affect your overall health.Do n't be a chump , use your own cheaper better creams and oils - some stuff like cucumbers which you can rub on your face , are So cheap and work better than anything !	-1
This product was delivered on time , however , it made me breakout more . I got more blemishes after using this stuff.It seems to have a greasy feel to it . I found that & # 34 ; Suki pure facial moisture-balancing moisturizer & # 34 ; works much better . It 's very mild on the skin and did not make me breakout .	-1
This product is decent if your skin is mildly dry , but it does n't effectively heal the skin of the moderate-high dry-flaky kind . Even after I apply this to my face or neck , where my skin is dry and flaky , it 's as though it dismally staved off and forestall the inevitable shedding of the skin . I apply this `` liberally '' both in the morning and at night , like it suggests , but have n't had impressive results . I gave this product two stars , because it is decent against mild-dryness , but that 's the limit of Cetaphil 's capability . Also , I will admit , one jar lasts me a very long time . Even after applying a liberal amount , twice a day , it 's taken me months to topically consume the entire jar . It 's probably the most long-lasting/durable product I 've possessed . But there may be a reason for this . One reviewer noticed that his did n't contain a foil seal and may have been a counterfeit product . Looking back , I also do n't remember ripping open a foil seal on mine .	-1
I do n't hate or like this product , but it has n't benefit meAnd I would n't purchase it in the future .	-1
This lotion is the worst lotion that I have ever bought because it leaves my hands sticky and gross feeling . It 's a useless lotion because after I apply it , I have to wash my hands because I ca n't stand that sticky and gross feel . Urg ! ! Going back to ucerin .	-1
Wow this stuff is garbage . I am so perplexed by all the great reviews . I have very fair , sensitive skin with mild/moderate acne . I have been looking for a good facial moisturizer for years and thought this would be my answer . Nope . It 's not a cream , it 's runnier than regular lotion and upon application it feels like a gel . After 10 minutes it feels like I put nothing on my face , in fact it makes my face feel a little tight . I look in the mirror and see dry patches . I am so disappointed , I just ca n't trust reviews anymore . Only good thing about this product is that it has no fragrance and does n't irritate my skin .	-1
I have used the cream all the way to the end . It caused my skin to break out . I will not buy this item again .	-1
you can put make up on after you put on this lotion on . it will cause he make up ( eyeliner or shadow ) smearit is expensive too for just a tiny tubewill not buy again	-1
Given all the great reviews I was disappointed in this cream . It was heavy and left my greasy . The SPF smell is horrible . Cause me to break out and made my roseaca flare up . I could probably use this as a cream for my hands when going to the beach but that 's about it .	-1
I have asked 50 dermatologist about this lotion . Not one of them knows what it is ! It was hard for me to believe anyone recommended this lotion . I saw no hydration . Absolutely none ! I have very dry mature skin . Save your hard earned money ! Do n't spend it on hype !	-1
This applies smoothly and feels good on my skin right after application but it ends up making my skin feel oily and greasy . This breaks me out when I use it on my face but I do n't want to let the tube go to waste so I started using it on my neck . It does n't irritate my neck because my skin is n't as sensitive there .	-1
I have oily acne prone skin and I started getting fine lines around my eyes . I usually like Neutrogena products but this one is a dud . First , it does n't lather at all . I 've had an issue w/ it actually sliding off my hands a few times since it does n't lather . Second it has a weird smell . Third it does n't work . I 'm delusional in thinking that a few months using the product will suddenly make my fine lines disappear but there is no difference at all . Plus my skin is still oily and I 've broken out several times since I started using it . After this bottle I 'm done . I 'm in the market for something new .	-1
The product information says that it may cause some irritation , and it did . I 'll try using it once or twice a week , but I need a moisturizer I can use every night , so I wo n't buy this again .	-1
I have very dry skin and tried this after all the great reviews . I am sad to report that this is not as emollient or humectant as my skin needs to find comfort . The oil feels nice and it spreads well . It takes a while for it to absorb even though it is lightweight , but that did n't bother me . I thought an oil would be extremely moisturizing , but my skin did n't feel or look very hydrated at all . In fact , it felt equally as dry ( as if I had applied a dry oil ) with a bit of a sheen . With a cream or lotion , the skin smoothes and plumps up with moisture . I tried this bc I was looking for something like that but even more effective , but this does n't work . I may try this under a thicker lotion or cream to see if it adds anything as un under-layer . On it 's own , it is not effective.UPDATE ON PREVIOUS REVIEW : I have found that using it in the shower helps it absorb into the skin without leaving a dry oil residue behind . However , even when I tried it with the matching lotion on top , it still did not fully hydrate my dry skin . I 'll try it again in the summer .	-1
PRODUCT HAS PARABEN IN IT . PARABENS ARE LINKED TO OPENING THE BODY TO CANCER , PER ONCOLOGISTS . DO NOT USE ANY PRODUCTS WITH PARABENS . SHAME ON NEUTROGENA FOR USING PARABENS !	-1
Not an effective moisturizer ( for me , anyway ) . It feels and smells perfectly nice . After use , my skin feels even drier and itchier than it did before I used it ; it also seems to create a barrier on my skin : lotion applied after the oil ( later in the day , for example ) does n't help at all . Looks like I 'll be getting rid of this and going back to a shea butter-heavy lotion .	-1
I used to use the Neutrogena moisturizer for sensitive skin , but decided to try this since my skin does tend to be oily . The lotion itself is very thin . Instead of my normal one application , with this lotion I need to apply twice , otherwise my face is dry and flaky -- once after getting out of the shower , and another time before putting on my make up . The 2 stars is for the fact that my skin does look and feel good using this lotion , but there are plenty others that do just as good a job with just half the amount .	-1
I purchased this facial moisturizer recently , as well as farther back a year or so . Both times I have ended up returning it , mind you I did n't purchase this on Amazon , but rather stores in-person at stores like Walmart and Target . This moisturizer says it is hypo-allergenic although I do n't buy it . I am allergic to basically everything and rely on mainly baby products . I have very fair , sensitive skin and acne . I do not find this moisturizes , but rather burns one 's skin horribly . After using the moisturizer , I had eroded , scabby sores all over my face . I think it made my skin much worse , although I am not supposed to be allergic to any of the ingredients . Also , for you fellow fair-skinned folks , it makes your skin look very red and ruddy in a bad way . Do not buy this , you will regret it , or at least I did .	-1
I typically love Neutrogena products , so I was really disappointed in this . My biggest issues are : -It 's kind of watery , yet leaves your face looking/feeling very greasy . Almost like applying sunscreen.-It has a really nasty , cloying smell ( like sunscreen ) .-Does n't seem to really moisturize , just sits on top of your skin . This makes it difficult to apply make up over it.I now use Clinique dramatically different lotion , and I LOVE it . I do not recommend this product .	-1
I bought this for use on my face which has really bad Rosacea . It made things much worse and really did not help with moisture .	-1
This hand cream is too thick and not spreadable for me . It does n't absorb as well as other hand creams I 've used . The only time I like using this is before bed , when I do n't touch anything throughout the night , I then wakeup with soft hands . It 's just too much for day time use . I end up getting everything sticky . I prefer Eucerin Intensive Therapy Hand Cream to this , at least that spreads and absorbs in to my hands .	-1
I have to agree with the other person it is to heavy and has grease fill you can use it better on your feet but still grease fill not the right lotion for my hands	-1
I applied the cream correctly every time , and it soothes effectively and provides a protective barrier for the skin , BUT does not deliver moisture to the skin The product does n't have much moisture in it in the first place because it is `` concentrated '' apparently but i need moisture ! ! WHY ELSE WOULD I BUY HAND CREAM ? obviously i want to moisturize my dry hands.The texture is grainy , I 'm guessing it 's the concentrated bits of dried cream or something , but it 's very unpleasant feeling . It smells like plastic even though it 's fragrance free .	-1
This item does n't adequately moisturize and is greasy for my combination skin . I only put it on my dry cheeks , avoiding my t zone since that 's oily . It makes my dry cheeks greasy and I do n't need that . However , it works well for my mom , who has normal skin .	-1
I do n't understand why they put fragrance in a facial cleanser . I am allergic and am not able to use this cold cream . It gave me a migraine and an asthma flare-up.Also I am disappointed that it did not remove my mascara and did NOT do a good job at removing my eyeliner either . I do n't wear heavy makeup so this should not have been an issue for this product . It 's really too bad because it is a good price and I ca n't afford more expensive products .	-1
I admit I havent tried this but I do n't have to in order to know it only derserves ONE star ! I have been researching skin care products trying to find out what the ingredients actually are because I am looking for the perfect face wash/moisturizer for my skin . I have gotten so tired of reading labels and having no idea what I am about to be putting on my skin ( and as a result , into my bloodstream ) I have sensitive skin which happens to also be acne-prone and have had a really difficult time with trial & error on different skin care products . TIRED of wasting money ! I want something affordable AND safe ! Is this too much to ask ? ? ? I loved the idea of this cream and was really wanting to give it a try until I got to the 5th ingredient in this product list- Triethanolamine . After a little research on this ingredient I need not go any further with my Ponds Cold Cream research and will not be using this product ! ! ! Here [ ... ] a link to the alarming article I found on this ingredient : I would rather not risk it & if you read the facts on it you probably wo n't either ! If ANYONE out there has any recommendations for skin products that are mostly natural & non-comedogenic ( I mean ALL the ingredients are ) ( NO salicylic acid or any other FOR acne ( DRYING ) agents in them , I am open ! PS-SOMEONE please create a fragrance-FREE , all natural , non-comedogenic , NON-drying face wash that also serves as a moisturizer ( as cold cream does ) ! Thanks !	-1
When I was beginning to look into cold creams a while back , I came across this because of all of the raving reviews about how excellent this product was . Upon looking closer at the ingredients though , I changed my mind . There are formaldehyde agents in the formula -- which is something that anyone should avoid ( unless you are a specimen about to be preserved in a jar ) .	-1
Trying it on face but still has perfume added to it so it 's a no go for me . It did n't do anything but make face sticky .	-1
This product did nothing for me . It is basically a lotion . This did not wash my face or moisturize it . It is not what I expected .	-1
I remember trying this a year and a half ago . Essentially , it made my face red and burn , and small bumps appear near my jaw . This is most likely because it is a cream-based cleanser and it contains menthol , which is not recommended for sensitive skin ( granted , I sometimes use Vick 's Vapo Rub on the very rare cystic blemish , but it is always on a small space ) .	-1
I used this product for a week , my skin ended up extremely dry and burning . It took a good week for my skin to return to normal . I would not recommend this to people that have sensative skin	-1
These smell like rubbing alcohol , and nothing else . It stings slightly as I use the towelette on my face . I am afraid to use these near my eyes to remove my eye makeup . I will not buy again . These wipes leave my skin too dry . And the makeup still seems hard to remove with these wipes.I like the neutrogena hydrating towelettes much better ! They seem better for sensitive skin .	-1
I am 23 years old with combination skin . I have used this cleanser the past two weeks and I had immediate acne flair ups as well as over drying . I was unimpressed with this product and disappointed after the reviews . Just did n't work for me .	-1
Neutrogena has altered the scent of its `` Refreshing '' aka Classic Rainbath formula , probably in an attempt to make the product more appealing to women . What was once a clean , soft and slightly musk fragrance has been replaced with a sweet , grapefruit-citrus fragrance with a floral character . Compared to the product I 've used for over 20 years , this Rainbath smells different when you use it and when you rinse it off - now the fragrance left behind after rinsing is flowery and powder-sweet , not clean . It has some of the character of the old fragrance , but is considerably changed , so much so that I suspect most men who used it previously , as I did , wo n't be using it anymore . I have not confused this product with their other , `` Revitalizing '' scent , which has a pronounced grapefruit fragrance . This is their so-called Classic , but it is no longer classic . Why could n't Neutrogena roll out a new variety , rather than ruining an old and popular one ? Wanted to let everybody know so you would n't waste your time and money buying something that is n't what you expect.Update 12/09 : Called Neutrogena twice ( long story ) about the formula change . The CSRs avoided the topic of `` formula change '' as if they 'd received training in enduring torture . In other words , they would not admit that the formula is changed . What they would say is , `` We 're sorry you do n't like the fragrance . '' Then they asked me to describe the fragrance , and what I thought of it . They asked many in-depth questions about it , like , `` Would you describe the fragrance as being 'classic ' ? '' `` Would you describe it as luxurious ? '' `` Describe what you smell , '' etcetera . I asked them in reply , `` Why did n't you do market research before you launched the product ? '' Then , without my even requesting it , they offered me a cash refund for the product I 'd bought ( I 've already received the check ) . The best part was when one CSR accidentally started to say `` How would you describe the new -- I mean , how would you describe the fragrance of the product ? '' It 's clear that Neutrogena has made the decision to deliberately deceive its customers by rolling out this product while claiming they have n't altered it . Along with the check , Neutrogena sent me a $ 20 coupon for any product , but there 's nothing I want .	-1
The wand is short and the mascara seems too thick . I guess that 's why it 's & # 34 ; thickening & # 34 ; . Will go back to Maybelline Great Lash next time .	-1
Almay make-up remover towelette like wipes are much better than these Almay pads . These pads irritated my eyes because they are scratchy and they have soooooo much oil on them . One word : Horrible ! I have to use a paper towel to soak up the oil first before I put these on my eyes and it 's still that bad . I only got them because I love Almay make-up towellete like wipes . Boy was that a big mistake . Stay-away from these pads .	-1
I have very dry skin and could n't use these , but I have really sensitive skin . I just can not take off my makeup before bed or my eyes get a rash .	-1
I recently bought some more Q-tips . I use them every day . You known when you 're all dry from the shower but your ears are still wet ? Well , these are the only things that will do the job . So , as I said , I recently bought some more . And may I say that I hate the generic versions of Q-tips : the CVS brand or Target version of Q-tips are weak . They bend when you apply any pressure to them . I like Q-tips because they are much stiffer and hold up perfectly when used.~Q-Tips , you have let me down.~My recent purchase has led me to discover that Q-tips have changed their formula : The shafts are now much weaker than before and are identical to those knock-off brands I mentioned earlier . This is a travesty . It 's obvious that they are trying to save money by using less paper in the design of these things , but it 's terrible . They do n't hold up like they used to and it 's driving me nuts . I now HATE Q-tips and will be buying the cheaper knock-off brands since they are now equal in quality.~Q-Tips , shame on you .	-1
The cotton on these unravels every single time I use them ! I did n't have any troubles with the stick bending etc , but the cotton issue is terrible ! ! I bought these since they were on sale so cheap - 2 bucks - but now I regret it.I usually buy generic ones at the Dollar Tree , for a dollar of course , and those work perfectly well and NEVER unravel on me . I figured for the price , I 'd buy these QTip brand , but boy was that a mistake . I ca n't even believe these things are so poor in quality , but yet the price is premium . Ripoff .	-1
Color is okay . It made my hair a medium brown shade and it did seem to have highlights as advertised . It really dried my hair out and damaged it . It has a strong chemical scent and my hair was shedding out twice as much as it usually does after I used this dye .	-1
I have very dark brown hair and for some reason it took me a while to learn that these feria blacks are just not good for your hair . not only does it strip my color out of my hair ( my hair starts turning medium brown in spots after a week of this product ) but my hair absolutely feels awful ( course , dry , brittle ) immediately after usage . loreals `` last through 28 shampoos '' creme gloss product is longer lasting than this so called permanent hair color . I think this crap needs to be taken off the shelves and they need to try again .	-1
My hair colour is the same dark brown as shown on the box before colouring . I really liked the promised colour shown on the box , Hi-Lift Cool Brown ( almost a caramel colour ) , and so wanted my hair to be the lighter brown shade promised . The actual results are nothing like the colour on the box . At best it evened out and and coloured my natural highlights to a darker shade of brown.I picked up two boxes , since I have thick hair , and took them to my beautician to ask her opinion on the colour . After talking with her I decided to let her do the colouring for me since the shade difference was so drastic . I wanted to make sure it was applied correctly . After applying as directed , 20 minutes in , my beautician checked my hair and said `` it 's not making your hair lighter , if anything it 's darker , even toned , but darker . '' I was quite disappointed as I had flip-flopped back and forth trying to talk myself into this `` extremely '' lighter shade for almost a month.The box promises Extreme Lightening-a promise that did n't deliver . While the resulting colour is not awful ( it 's very similar to the natural colour of my hair in my teens ) , I was really wanting the lighter shade shown on the box .	-1
I used this dye on my sister who dyes her hair red a lot . She 's currently out of work ( recently had a baby ) and had n't dyed her hair in months ( pregnant ) , so we decided it would be fun to do . She chose this color because it 's a bit deeper than she normally does , and she wanted to have a more intense red than she can get away with at work while she does n't have to work . Our plan was to use this and use something like Manic Panic over some pieces to make them even more red ( which we 've done before with her usual reds , and it always works out well ) , but this came out soooo dark it looks black until it 's in the light . It 's like purple-red black . It 's lightened up after a wash or two , but still much darker than she anticipated . We did n't even bother with step 2 , adding Manic Panic over sections , because we know it 's so dark it wo n't make much of , if any , difference . It 's a nice color , but not anything like it looks on the box . She 's very fair ( like me , which you can see in some of my other reviews of hair dyes I 've used personally ) , so it 's a much starker contrast than she anticipated.That said , the dye itself works well , processes quickly , and was n't overly damaging to her hair . The shampoo/conditioner combo that comes with it seems to be working well for her also ( she has very long , thick , curly hair ) . The dye starts out a deep cherry red which lead us to originally believe it would be much brighter than we expected , but it then turned purple-ish as it processed .	-1
The bottle to small to mix products together , my hair was falling apart after just 30 min , did not lighten my roots as described , product is not on my future list , try at your own risk .	-1
This hair color i think is ok.I think it has way too much blue though and should have more black.Everyone was telling me you have blue hair ! ! ! And another negative was that it faded the second day , a week later my dark brown hair was back and my bangs were still blue . Not a good black hair dye . Try ultimate black instead does not fade ! ! !	-1
I have purchased this color from the store before and it came out great , a deep , bright red . But when I ordered it on amazon , NOPE . My hair came out an ugly brown ( my hair was already a medium brown ) . The mixture went on red but my hair did n't come out nowhere near that color , and that usually happens when the product has been sitting forever . Yes , I left it on the recommended amount of time .	-1
Bought this product at walmart for $ 10 ... waste of money ! ! I am mosltly platinum and had a few yellow tones and brassy streaks that I wanted toned out.. I 've used feria before but just the darker brown colors . It did tone out the yellow.. not so much the brass though ... . the damage is horrid ! ! It feels like it did the first day a bleached it from black.. save your money and your hair and go to sally 's and get a quality lightening cream .	-1
I recieved this and put it in my hair , the color turned out really odd , and the conditioner that came with this was gritty and did n't really condition . It looked so odd I had to go to a stylist to get the color evened out . I have used bottle color before and have never had this happen .	-1
I will start of by saying that it is difficult to do at home root touch ups for blonde hair . This product turned by light brown roots organish-redish . Although the organish-redish is better then my natural brown roots with my blonde lowlights & highlights it still is not what I wanted nor was it what the box stated . In addition , the conditioner supplied to use after the touch up made my hair feeling as though product was left behind . I have used it twice and made sure I washed the conditioner out the second time and still ended up with the same feeling in my hair and incorrect color . I would not recommend this product for somebody who is doing a root touch up with naturally light brown ( or any shade of brown hair ) . If you 're trying to save money by not going to to hair saloon , I would still advise to choose another product.I give it a 2 star only because my hair was still lightened by the color , even though it was not what I was looking for .	-1
I bleached my hair to a mostly yellow , slightly orange color and then applied this product to take it to the next level , to the color I wanted my hair to be . Instead , my hair is yellow-blond . Do n't get me wrong , it 's a nice color , just not the one I was hoping for . For that reason , I would say it 's not worth the time or money . However , I gave it 2 stars because the conditioner it comes with is FANTASTIC ! It 's a nice purple anti-brass conditioner that works like a miracle at toning brassiness ( to some degree anyway ... ) and leaves your hair feeling healthy and smelling like heaven . But other than that , I 'm disappointed with my result and I 'm sure it 's human error to some degree but I was n't that far off and expected the tone of my hair to cool somewhat to be closer to what was on the package . Will not purchase again .	-1
My hair was already platinum and I was simply trying to get the last of the extremely faint neon-ish banana yellow out , as my toners were not doing the trick and I did not want to bleach again . I thought for sure this would do it , as it was really only ONE LEVEL to lift and this dye promises seven . My hair STILL came out with yellow in it . It 's a VERY THICK substance and even with my extremely short and thin hair , I think it may have worked better if I had purchased 3-4 ... however at that point I may as well go to a salon or just bleach it again , it 'd be cheaper and end in better results . Basically , unless you are already an extreme platinum , this dye will not make your hair the colour on the box . Furthermore , my dark blonde roots turned out neon orange .	-1
I used the cool medium brown color and it 's awful ! I have medium brown hair and always use a medium ash brown color on it . That usually takes it 1-2 shades darker than my natural color . I thought Feria looked interesting because of the highlights . Well , it 's trashed my hair . My roots are oddly lighter than the rest of my hair ( lighter than my natural color ) and the grey hairs did n't take the color AT ALL ! So , now I have this weird looking hair color AND still have greys . I 'll never use this hair color again .	-1
The color is much darker than what is pictured . I am a level 6 1/2 or 7 . It took me to a level 10 1/2 or 11 . It has a yellow cast to it . I was going to try this on my natural non-colored hair before using bleach . I was hopeful to get a bleach blonde color but it was not as pictured . It took me about 3-4 shades lighter but I was hopeful to get past the yellow stage .	-1
1 . I have been using this color ( 74 deep copper ) for a while . I still like it but the shade is different everytime . Sometimes more towards strawberry blonde , sometimes more copper , sometimes more red hues ... 2 . It fades away very fast . Faster than other red tones I 've used.Even if I am lucky enough to get the color advertised on the packaging , it lasts only for a day or two . After about 10 days the hair looses all the luster .	-1
I used Feria 's Starry Night because I wanted to make my dark brown hair a gloss black . After I washed the dye out , I noticed I had brown spots on the back crown of my head . It 's very odd since I 've never had this problem before with the other brands . I thought it was a fluke like I did n't follow the instructions properly . So I tried it again . Same thing happened . I 'm really disappointed .	-1
I wanted a coppery orange color and i had dyed black hair so i picked this up to strip the color out ( this is something i 've done before with other brands with no problem ) however , this formula is so crazy thick it didnt spread at all and my hair turned out so splotchy because of it . This product was not meant to be your standard bleaching kit , its for people with already light hair who want to go lighter , If your dark like me and wanted to go lighter i suggest manic panic bleaching kit or splat .	-1
The color of this is so lovely , a black blue that looks beautiful.The downside is , it lasts barely a week and if you wash your hair even once it will all come out.If it lasted a bit longer then I would definitely use it again .	-1
The R57 is such a lush red color . It looks a bit darker than what 's on the box ( more like the color at her roots ) , but that may be because my hair has been previously bleached . I still like it , its even better looking than the box ! Before using the Loreal Feria , I had tried the Garnier Olia , which ruined my hair . Olia is crap in a box-it will fry your hair like nobody 's business , and the color lasts exactly three shampoos . Anyway , I purchased the Feria to try and cover over the damaged and faded Olia . The Feria did a great job , coloring my multi-shaded and faded hair a deep , uniform auburn color with highlights here and there . I also add jojoba to my conditioner , which is excellent for dry , damaged hair . It has lasted longer than any red box dye , and even longer than some salon colors . In the directions , it says to shampoo hair twice when rinsing out the red dye-I did n't do that . I just rinsed it . This color will continue to bleed down the drain and onto your towels , as any red dye does , but it just has a staying power that most reds do n't have . Always use cool water , as cold as you can tolerate , on your red hair.I am trying to find a more natural red henna dye , and tried one from Mendahi on a sample of my hair , but have had no luck with that . I used only one box , and my hair is fine , dry , and to the bottom of my shoulder blades . I also do n't use shampoo . Once or twice a week , I dissolve a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of tepid water ( make very sure it 's dissolved , or you will end up with white granules remaining in your dried hair ! ) . I wet my hair in the shower , pour this into my roots , massage , rinse , and condition with 100 % pure coconut conditioner mixed with jojoba oil . The first time you sub the baking soda for shampoo , you might not love the results . Just try it once or twice more ; I did , and my roots are silky soft and very clean . It 's also been kinder to my red color , which has the largest dye molecule , making it the most difficult color to maintain.UPDATE ! Please use henna instead of chemical haircolor , it 's such a better option ! My hair is overprocessed , I have been bleaching it for years and had dyed it red with a box dye a few months ago ( loreal r57 cherry crush ) . My hair was breaking , falling out like crazy and I am trying to eliminate chemicals from all of my beauty products , and typical box hair dye is overloaded with nasty toxins.I was afraid to try henna , because people will tell you that your hair will turn orange-its not true ! Henna has saved my hair and I have never received so many complements ! I ordered the burgandy 100 gram from HENNA GUYS , they have a website and sell here on amazon , and it provided me with two applications ( my hair is past my shoulder blades ) . I mixed half of the package with water and a plastic spoon ( no metal ! ) , put it in an empty jumbo hair dye applicator bottle from Sallys , and applied it . It was so easy ! It 's not even messy , just make sure you have a damp washcloth handy to wipe up spills on your face or sink immediately . I saturated my hair , wrapped my head up in saran wrap , and went to sleep . I left it in for 11 hours , then washed it out and conditioned it . When it was dry , it had a bit of a brown orange tone , so I prepared the remaining mix , added a raw egg , and reapplied it on my hair . I left it on for five hours , heated it with a blow dryer for about five minutes , then washed it out . Remember that henna takes two days to fully develop , so be patient . It looked good when I washed and dried it , but WOW , it looked even better two days later ! It has a gorgeous deep burgandy tone , its shiny and soft , and I have not had a bad hair day since ! My scalp does not itch like it does after using chemical dyes , and it looks so rich and healthy ! I am so in love with henna , I just can even describe the difference that it has made ! I will forever be faithful to this henna brand ! Customer service is so helpful , and will respond quickly to any questions about the product . Henna is addictive ! I am trying the blend of burgandy and deep red next ! Love it ! Remember that if you are n't getting the deepness of color you want , or it looks orange , henna it again and again until you achieve the color you want ! Also , if your hair has been bleached in the past , as mine has , it does take more reapplications to keep the color . It 's just something you have to live with until the bleached portion of your hair grows out and you can cut it off . Henna is excellent for controlling oily scalp , which was not a problem of mine , but would be very beneficial for some people . I did n't have any problem with the smell that some people comment about , and even though I left it on for over 11 hours , I did not get a headache . *I have added a picture of my hair with the Feria . You can find it on the main product page , scroll way down toward the bottom and you will see it on the right . I did not have my flash on , so it appears a bit darker than it actually was .	-1
but once I got it it looked reddish so I could n't use it - beware buying dye since when I tried to return itit came up as & # 34 ; hazardous waste & # 34 ; material and not returnable . I have several of these colors now I have to throw out .	-1
Do n't bother ! What a waste of time . On the side of the box it states what color your hair will turn out based on the color of your hair . My hair is dark brown/ black . The turnout color would be a bright intense red , exactly what I wanted . What color did my hair come out ? Dark brown/ black with a hint of red in the sunlight . Nothing like it states on the side of the box . I pursed this product over another based on the color chart and spent extra to get it . Wo n't ever buy from L'Oreal again !	-1
this review does not address how well the product works or not because I only tried this out one day as a stand alone for the follwoing reasons : The scent of this is reminds me of the beach , sunscreen , or a tanning bed . Since I do n't live/work near a beach or have a need to wear sunscreen all day or smell like coconut I choose not to use this daily by itself.On to condition weight : it 's a light condition the does n't weigh your hair down or make it appear oily in any way . On the negative I have very prone to frizzy hair and this does n't help with that at all.Because I ca n't just use this product by itself due to the reason above , I will not review this any further .	-1
In my quest to find the best products for my hair , I purchased this leave-in on a whim , thinking the spray bottle would add convenience to my overall hair regimen . I was so wrong . This product left my hair extremely dry and difficult to manage . I expected it to work like other leave-ins and provide moisture , but all it did was suck the moisture out and leave behind something resembling a helmet . lol The bottle states that the product contains silk protein , but I think there is more protein than moisturizing ingredients , hence the hard hair . I will not be purchasing this again in the future and would not recommend it to anyone .	-1
This stuff never really worked for me . I have dry , thick hair that 's damaged and comes with frizz and the like . This did absolutely nothing for my hair .	-1
You sent me the wrong shampoo . You sent the Naturals shampoo come on Amazon , get with it . All my orders lately have problems .	-1
I have relied on Suave Daily Clarifying Shampoo for many years for its ability to clean my hair and slightly oily scalp at a reasonable price . It was an excellent alternative to theNeutrogena Anti-Residue Formula Shampoo.The last time I purchased this , I noticed that it was in a fancy new bottle and was tinted pale blue rather than being colorless . When I got home , I was dismayed to find that Suave has also added a vaguely floral and unfortunately artificial chemical perfume to the formulation that irritates my eyes and sinuses and gives me a headache.I can no longer use this product . I certainly hope that Suave will reconsider this change and go back to the original , almost-odorless formula .	-1
This is not a clarifying shampoo . Avalon Lemon is much better and the Old Pantene Clarifying shampoo which is no longer available was the best is you have a greasy scalp and dermatitis .	-1
I do n't know if this shampoo works as well as it used to , and I will probably never find out . This is not the same as the Suave Naturals Shampoo Daily Clarifying formula that I used to purchase . Pleeeeeze , Suave ... . remove the scent which burns the back of the throat of other people in the next room , and replace it with ... . well ... . nothing ! By the way , what is the point of the blue coloring ?	-1
I got this shampoo hoping that it would help my dried out winter hair . Well , it made it worse ! I looked like Broomhilda afterwards ; it stripped my hair of anything that it had left and I looked as if I 'd stuck my finger in an electrical socket wet . I do n't recommend it at all if you have dry hair . If your hair is oily , then I think this would be fine . It sure smells nice and clean though ! Save your money for a professional brand - they definitely overshot the marketing on these !	-1
Sorry I purchased so much of this product ... when you apply it ... it looks shiny on ... so you ca n't use it during the day when you need for the puffiness to be reduced . I will use it at night ... and never buy it again .	-1
A total waste of money ( though it 's pretty cheap ) . I do n't know what the rave with this eye gel is all about . The gel is quite thick and hard to spread . It 's shiny and does not get absorbed quickly . Two or three days after I used this eye gel once at night , both my eyes look more puffy and tired-looking . An , for an unknown reason , my eyes are rheum-filled each morning when I woke up after using this . Disgusting .	-1
Olay Age Defying Classic Eye Gel . This popularly-priced product by Olay claims that it is a soothing , cooling gel that will revitalize and moisturize the eye area to minimize the appearance of signs of aging , and that it will work on normal , dry , combination/oily , oily skin . It will , the manufacturers state , replenish moisture in the eye area , helping to minimize the look of fine lines and wrinkles , or puffy areas . It contains a rather odd list of ingredients , old-fashioned witch hazel , cucumber extract , , fruit extract and flower oil , as well as variations on glycol/glycerine , B Vitamins , and some more advanced ingredients . The makers advise that it should be dotted around the eye area and smoothed in until absorbed.I know it has nothing to do with the important issues of the day , but I have gone through years of problems in my eye area : redness , swelling , tearing up , sparse lashes , and have tried most eye creams out there , I think , from drug store price to department store price to cosmoceutical . I actually tried two bottles of this product , and found its effects to be odd indeed . On the one hand it did feel comfortingly cool . But it did not feel rich and emollient enough ; and it further upset the sensitive skin of my eye area . Not recommended .	-1
This is only for washable makeup not waterproof makeup learned thr hard way still not a good buy it seems like im just using soapy water ill stick to my almond oil removes makeup faster and is gentle on skin	-1
Either i received an old worn out , defective piece or it doesnt do what it claims . It cudnt even hold the oil for an hour for me . Also i broke out in two places . Not pleased at all .	-1
Please do n't buy this product , I bought it and it was completely dry even though the packaging was completely sealed ... . I have n't see it sold anywhere else , so I am guessing its really old , i 'm really disappointed in this	-1
Lies lies lies . I should n't have believed these positive reviews ! ! This is like mascara from early 90s or something , just black stain on your lashes , that put your lashes TOGETHER and clump . Oh yes it 's waterproof so it gets a one star , thats the only good thing about it ... .it definitely is n't pretty ! ! ! ! And NO IT DOES NOT ADD ANY VOLUME . Wasted my money thank u very much ! Sigh . I want my money backkkkkkkkkk ! ! Grrrrrrrr and I bought this for my wedding ! ! ! D : & lt ; I should 've gotten l'oreal voluminous waterproof mascara instead ... ...	-1
I 've used the water proof mascara in the pink and green tube 4 ever . this does n't cover well nor does it stay on . you can barely see I have anything on . the only plus is no raccoon eyes and it 's gone by bedtime .	-1
I would not use this simply because it pulls out your lashes and is impossible to remove . I used eye makeup remover as recommended . I still have it on my lashes after scrubbing it of with a cotton balls . My eyes are all red now . DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT ! ! !	-1
I guess the coverage is ok , but I do n't like the texture . It does n't feel creamy and glide on like I want it to . It has a dry feel to it during application , but your skin does n't look dry after you apply it . As I 'm applying it , it dries up too quickly , and then I have to get more from the bottle . A little does not go a long way and I have to really rub to get it on . It also looks streaky after I 'm done . It 's hard to explain , but I just do n't like it . I prefer cover girl .	-1
This is definitely not new , The cover is broken , the product is totaly not new . I really do n't want to buy this product again !	-1
THOUGHT THIS COLOR WOULD BE A PERFECT CHOICE FOR ME BUT IT PALED ME OUT.IT WORKED A LONG TIME AGO - BUT NOT NOW . : )	-1
I sent this back immediately . There is absolutely NOTHING even remotely `` silver '' or `` red '' about this lip shade . It is pink with orange which means it 's CORAL , not red . Very disappointing !	-1
I am not a fan of this lipstick 's consistency and formula . It easily feathers if you apply on slightly dry lips . I also have to layer it on because the formula isnt creamy enough and tends to slide off the lips . Make sure to exfoliate your lips well before applying this lipstick if you want good color payoff .	-1
The lipstick is a ok color.. but definitely not Certainly red . It comes off so easily even with liner and blotting . I would n't buy it again..	-1
This stuff was expensive and did n't absorb with a darn . No mater how little I used or how much I tried to rub/pat it into my skin , there was a greasy layer on my skin . When I woke up in the morning , my skin was n't particularly soft or hydrated . It has an & # 34 ; old lady & # 34 ; scent and just seemed very & # 34 ; old school & # 34 ; to me. , Like something my grandmother would use . There are better products out there for my money .	-1
The item I received was for a different curler with a black insert and black grips on the handle . It pinched my eyelid . Would not recommend .	-1
I have a Revlon eyelash curler from several years ago that is wonderful and this is not similar . I did n't need to replace my old curler but wanted 2 curlers ( one for my makeup at home and one for travel or purse ) . I thought this would be similar since it looks like my original Revlon one but it is not at all . The handle for your fingers is very awkward- I 'm talking it 's hard for me to use because the handles are so spread out and slide together weirdly . I am a fairly petite woman but I feel this would be a similar problem for most women . The handles themselves are at an awkward angle so it 's weird trying to move the curler to get your eyelashes in it . I literally thought I was going to hurt my eye trying it . Very disappointing - just going to stick to my one curler.The product itself seemed well made and had extra curler pads . I guess that 's nice if you replace them but I never do - I just use baby oil ( buy small travel size at Target ) to get the mascara off then rinse with hand soap and water . Then I thoroughly dry before using . I have used that method since I first bought my curler MANY years and it cleans the curler pad like it 's new . No need to waste money on replacements and it curls just as great as always.I would n't suggest this curler for anyone . Seems like Revlon tried to improve their curler but it 's been at the expense of making it difficult to use .	-1
YUCK ! ! ! Too bad there 's no option for zero star reviews , 'cause this soap deserves one.After three uses , I have broken out in one of the nastiest cases of contact dermatitis that I 've had in years . If you 're even slightly sensitive , I 've avoid this one like the Plague.Two Weeks Later : I still have remnants of the rash on my extremities . I fully expect another week to pass before it all goes away.I contacted Kiss My Face customer service . Here 's their response : Thank for taking the time to write and for your feedback . Sorry that you are less than pleased with this KISS product . I 'll definitely pass your feedback on to our product development team . We love hearing from our customers even when it is less than stellar , and we absolutely do take your input into consideration when developing new products or when tweaking our current line of products . Please feel free to contact me if I can be of further help .	-1
this soap was a completely waste of my money , first of all it does not moisturize at all , it left my skin ashy , dried and pretty much upset . I would not recommend this soap , the soap smell like palm oil soap instead of olive oil soap .	-1
I 've bought this before at the drugstore and used it until it was gone . The smell is light , the formula is light ; it was just a good option for using a dab to stay hydrated without feeling greasy.Problem is , either they changed the formula or I got a bad batch . Now , even if I apply the thinnest layer to my face , using a dot smaller than the size of a pencil eraser , I get this weird greasy feeling all over . Shortly after that is what I call `` the water stage , '' where as if by magic , my entire face seems to have a fine sheen of water just sitting right on top . I seriously have to go pat dry with a towel , because it looks like I 've worked up a sincere sweat . I do n't know what 's wrong with this product , and I 'm holding onto it to try in the dry winter months , but I 'm not optimistic . At this point , I would not order it again .	-1
I bought this to get rid of the crow 's feet and fine lines under my eyes . I 've used this now for about three months with absolutely no improvement whatsoever . It is pleasant to use and does n't irritate my eyes , but just did n't do a thing for me .	-1
I was so hopeful about these . I wanted an alternative to tampons that was healthy and environmentally-friendly ( and cheaper ! ) So I was excited to try them . But it was n't at all what I was expecting . I do n't want to get into vivid details . But basically , I was not warned that this would be such a MESSY ordeal . Not to mention it 's not at all convenient . I do not want to leave it in for too long , because if I do , I know it 's not absorbing any fluid , so I worry about leakage , or the horrible mess that it will make all over my hands when I try to take it out . GROSS ! Also , the thing itself is absolutely huge . I imagine most people would look at it and be terrified to try to put it in their bodies . I believe there was a reason tampons became so much more popular than these methods . Sorry , but I 've got to switch back .	-1
I had been using the DivaCup for a while and had a lot of success with it , but when I lost it a friend gave me a pack of the softcups she had used once and did n't like . I thought since I had liked the other brand this would be much the same way ... it was n't I do n't know how many times I tried to readjust things and try different angles or higher/lower inside the vaginal walls , I could n't stop the cup from leaking . It was n't horrible , but it was enough to ruin a couple of pairs of panties which ensured that I was n't saving money on this alternative item and that I wo n't be using the brand again . It was an utter disappointment ... I 'd say try another brand instead like DivaCup or Lunette , I had good experiences with both .	-1
Retrieving these requires gymnastic ability that i sadly do not possess . They are also very messy to remove . I tried them because i have a dermatological sensitivity to rayon , but no . In the trash and done . Never again .	-1
I recently tried Instead after seeing a positive review for it in fashion magazine . I read the back of the box and saw the informational video on their website prior to use so I would know exactly how to insert and remove the softcup . However , I could never actually get the cup in the proper place ! Instead is supposed to be inserted completely into the vagina with the end of the cup 's rim touching the back of the vagina and resting just under the cervix . The front of the cup 's rim is supposed to be pushed up gently behind the pubic bone so that it stay in place . However , I have small hands and short fingers and could only just BARELY push the rim and position it behind the pubic bone . Or so I thought . Perhaps my anatomy does n't hold the cup in place as securely as it 's supposed to ( according to the video ) , but throughout the day the cup would continually dislodge and would not catch everything it was supposed to . Instead only caught maybe 50 % of the blood , and I would spot the rest.I think this may be a really great product for someone else , but I think I 'll stick with regular tampons .	-1
I absolutely love this product . it does n't dry my skin like it did to other reviewers . but , after about two weeks of using the product , i noticed the expiration date . It expired in 2005. that was SEVEN years ago . ( It is Dec 2012 now ) .	-1
it is way to strong for my face , i had use a dime size all over my wet face and then rinse , after i look in the mirror my face was red all over.it went straight in the garbage , but what i do like is clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub , it smell really good and leaves my face super soft , so i will continue to use clean and clear blackhead eraser scrub , as for the clean and clear continuous control acne cleanser never again will i put that crap on my face .	-1
I 've had some luck with Clean & Clear products so I had no qualms picking up the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser from the store . However , as soon as I used it I became a bit frustrated.To begin with , the formula is very watery and thin . I prefer something a little thicker and this did n't feel like it stayed on my skin long enough to do a very good job . While it might have helped with acne a little , it definitely does not live up to its name.I also felt that it made my skin more oily and I quickly stopped using it to switch to a different product . Over the course of the day , my skin would become uncomfortably oily . Where is the continuous control in that ? Clean & Clear 's Continuous Control Acne cleanser sat in my shower for quite some time before I finally picked it up again , a sure sign that this product was no doing its job adequately.There are definitely other acne products , some even from Clean & clear , that I prefer of the Continuous Control Acne Cleanser .	-1
While this may work on your skin issues , it will RUIN your towels and sheets that are n't white . The benzol peroxide ingredient seeps into your skin and ruins towels , sheets , pillowcases , and clothes - left our gray towels blotched with pink and purple spots and ruined our sheets.Definitely recommend trying a product with salicylic acid instead - same results , no damage to your linens .	-1
I will admit -- I do feel this product was helping reduce my acne . However , I developed a really nasty yeast infection about two weeks in ( sorry to be gross but want to give an honest review ) and I also noticed a weird stinging sensation in my lower abdomen . I did some online searching and noticed some people say they develop gastro issues with this product . I did n't add anything else new to my routine and have n't had a yeast infection in years . May be totally un-related but once I stopped the product , my stomach issues stopped . I think this is a good product , but for me , the side effects were not worth it .	-1
i used all of these and the creme i actually ended up getting few months worth and took them for 3 months and its not worth the money these did nothing for me	-1
Since I am allergic to Benzyl Peroxide , I did not use the cream , so this is a review of the tablets only.I used the tablets religiously twice a day , in the morning and at night . No change in my acne at all . I really wanted it to work , but the truth is that it did not work for me .	-1
Did nothing for my acne ... Used it for 2 months , The pills are surger pills..Do n't wast your money on this itemDo your homework first ...	-1
It 's whatever.Been using the whole month but see no difference , maybe it 's just me ? Anyways , it should n't take more than 2 weeks to clear up your acne and maybe 2 months to completely rid of the scars . The pills did n't do much as far as I can see , but the cream helped a bit . But you have to mix it with moisturizer or you get SO DRY ! And do n't even think about putting make-up on over it because you 'll get cakey as as a burnt biscuit.idk , guess some ppl had success ? It 's cheap so you have a 50-50 chance of it working , it may be worth a shot . but did n't work for me =/	-1
I tried this a few years ago as a teenager , when I had some acne . It was nothing horrible , just a few pimples here and there . I saw this at the store and gave it a try , did everything I was supposed to and the pores under my eyes increased in size . I had larger pores after using this product and it took me a while to reduce their size . I did n't have much acne to begin with and this did seem to help , but the increased pores were a negative .	-1
I tried this product for 2 months and i have to say it didnt do anything for my acne . I am the type that breaks out when my period is about to start and using this pill did n't change a thing . I broke out just as i normally would and this last month even while using the pill was nearly the worst i 've had . I 'm sure must just be a coincidence . I am not saying this is not a good product as we have to keep in mind one thing ca n't and wo n't work for everyone as we all have different skin types . This just is n't for me and i have discontinued using this product and can not really recommend it .	-1
CAN NOT TELL THAT THIS PRODUCT HAS ANY AFFECT ON MY SKIN AT ALL . IHAVE USED IT NOW FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS . IT DOES HAVE A BURNING SENSATION SO THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE DOING SOMETHING ? ? ?	-1
I do not like the consistency . It is like the consistency of yogurt , only with lots of oils . I did not like it .	-1
I did n't read the Ingredients and found this product contain Mineral oil which can clog your pores . The Vitimin E it claims to have is 18th on the list.. my bad for not reading this first . Mineral oil is basically a petro oil , which is something that can make your car run in certain forms . It does not allow your skin to breath..	-1
I washed my face with this once yesterday , and once the day before and yesterday in the evening , a good portion of the right side of my face and a few under my chin broke out in ugly hives ! It itches horribly and it really hurts . To make matters worse , I had to go to work looking like this . I did n't want to put on makeup that would irritate my skin so I was forced to leave the house looking like a pepperoni pizza . : ( And also , when I was washing my face with this , I noticed that the scrubbing beads in this were SCRATCHING my face . Not a comfortable exfoliation , but like sandpaper . And this cleanser has a very noticeable chemical smell to it . I wish that I had never wasted my money on this product , and I wish that I had never put this on my face !	-1
Made me break out like crazy ... in places I never used to get zits . I have pimples on my upper lip , cheeks , underside of nose . Horrible . Waste of money . Cheaper in stores , but still not worth it . This has never happened to me before . I have loved all other Neutrogena products , but this one just does n't work . Now I have to find another cleanser that can get rid of the zits this gave me . zero stars .	-1
i have really sensitive skin , and this was really harsh on my face . it burnt every time i applied it .	-1
The number 2 ingredient in this toner is SD Alcohol which does a great job of immediately degreasing your skin , but in the long run , it will cause your oil glands to produce more oil to make up for the drying effect of the alcohol . I like that it has AHA and beta hydroxy acids , but looking for another toner without alcohol . Any suggestions ? I 've tried the Neutrogena alcohol free toner and need something a little stronger for my slightly oily , more acne prone skin .	-1
I have noticed over the last few years my pore sizes has increased . It is crazy and now it really bothers me ! I tried this along with many other products but I did not notice any difference ! If you like a toner its not a bad one pretty gentle but do n't expect no more pores !	-1
This stuff broke my face out . Maybe my skin is too sensitive or something , but this stuff did n't work at all for me .	-1
I did n't notice any true results from this . In addition , it really , really stings my eyes . My husband tried it as well and said the same .	-1
I have combination skin and this dries it out to the point of being painful . I did n't notice any difference with the appearance of my pores , which are still big . I suffered for nothing .	-1
I have oily , acne-prone skin that is also sensitive and prone to redness when trying new products . Since Neutrogena 's whole advertising campaign from pretty much day one has been all about how gentle their products are , I decided to try this stuff . Well ... my face did n't like it . I used it nightly for 3 days , and on day 4 noticed red , dry patches on my face . By day 5 the patches began to flake , and I stopped using it.Since I did n't use this toner long enough to see whether it made a difference in my pore size , I ca n't speak as to its effectiveness . But if you 're like me and have tried many acne products on your face , and have developed sensitive skin as a result , this is not the product for you .	-1
As a young adult , I have acne-prone skin with some enlarged pores around around my nose . I bought this hoping it would help clear me up , when , in fact , it did quite the opposite . When I first squeezed some into my hand I noticed that it had a very chemically odor . After I used it and rinsed my face , as soon as I opened my eyes they burned like I had just been rubbing peppers on them , so I rinsed , rinsed , rinsed some more until the burning stopped . My face felt clean , but smelled like chemicals , and in the morning I woke up with a few new zits . I was n't sure the cleanser was causing the breakout , so I kept using it . I slowly developed terrible acne and had to stop using it . About a week after I did , I was back to normal . I gave this cleanser to my sister to try and she had very good results , but stopped using it because she was concerned about the chemical odor . I would not recommend a product that has the potential to cause the problems I experienced .	-1
I used this twice just to make sure I was n't imagining the smell . To me , it smells exactly like urine . My fingers reek of it and I can even smell it on my face . I only bought this because it was $ 1 or more cheaper than the others . It is probably just a bad reaction to my own skin oils because in the bottle or on the cotton ball , it smells great.I 'll be buying another brand this evening and NEVER buying this again .	-1
I have pretty sensitive and oily skin , and it burns so much ! I usually love Neutrogena stuff but this is bad !	-1
I tried this a while ago , back when I had bad body acne in my teens . The fragrance only irritated my skin and it was only after using the facial wash that I realized that I was sensitive to salicylic acid . I gave this to a friend , and it worked very well for her because she does n't have sensitive skin .	-1
I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and it has absolutely made no difference . I 'm Asian and I have acne on both my chest and back . It did n't make my skin worse , but nevertheless I am very disappointed in this product .	-1
This cream will give you acne if you have sensitive skin . Instead of buying a cream , I tried a vitamin C serum . That has worked out perfectly . I so wish I did n't try this and get the horrible acne breakout from it .	-1
This product broke my skin out and I have very strong skin . I am unsure what happened but I got horrible acne . My skin is not sensitive and I use other products without any issues . So be cautious if you have sensitive skin when using this product .	-1
This shampoo works as a cleanser , but it does n't smell good , leaves my hair feeling dry with a very slight filminess that will likely build up over time . I will use it occasionally to purify my scalp with tea tree oil , but I will not use it very often .	-1
I typically use Burt 's Bees shampoo and love what it does for my hair , but not for my scalp ( dry and itchy ) . I purchased this shampoo to use on occasion to prevent the itchy scalp it seems to cause . Plus , I love the refreshing tingle of tea tree shampoos.Let me just say , I honestly felt like I was being dipped for fleas the first time I used this product . It has a horrible chemical odor ... EXACTLY like pesticide . I tried a few more times to stomach it , but just ca n't do it . Plus , you would think it would at least tingle a bit , with it smelling like Raid and all , but nope ; NADA.Also , if you are looking for a shampoo that is organic with no SLS ... READ THE LABEL ! This product is not what it is marketed to be .	-1
I bought this hoping that the tea tree would help stop the dandruff and stop the flaking on my scalp ... it did n't . It also left my hair tangled after washing . Would not buy again .	-1
I did n't care for this at all . Not only did I not notice any difference in the thickness of my hair , I did n't care for the way it cleaned my hair either .	-1
I love the foam and how soothing it feels , I do not follow after the first poo since all the product , oils , and dirt is washed out in its first application . My only knock on the product it has way too much protein that causes my hair to tangle and knot up . That 's why the product only got 2 stars , now if you are not protein-sensitive go for it .	-1
Good 4 house hold , but not for the skin.What u pay is what u get	-1
, sodium benzoate , benzyl benzoate , citronellol , fragrance ( parfum ) . Fake fragrance and sodium benzoate . Never understand why they sell this at whole foods and how it continues to pass as `` natural '' . I guess petroleum is natural , too . Too bad they do n't list the multiple chemicals that are in the `` parfum '' .	-1
This smelled wonderful but did not clean me at all . I ended up just using it to clean my bath tub after I took a bath . I would not buy this again !	-1
Sorry but I have to give this product a low rating for pretending to be something it is n't . Sorry , but this stuff smells nothing like lavender . It smells like a chemical cocktail . The `` parfum '' at the end must be the part that makes it smell like chemicals , but do n't expect anything resembling the smell of Lavender . This is closer to the smell of Tide with bleach . I 'll use Jason toothpaste but their soap is n't `` clean '' .	-1
Do n't think there is a significant enough concentration of retinol in this cream to make any difference whatsoever . It has a nice texture and light feel , so I 've used it up as a day cream but that 's about it . No results to report . If you are seeking results , go with Babyface 2 % retinol Night Renewal cream .	-1
The first time I used Avalon 's Vitamin C eye cream , my eyes began to sting so badly that I was uncomfortable for 24 hours . I thought that maybe I had used too much , so I tried again several days later with only a tiny amount , being careful to keep it away from my lashes . My eyes still became uncomfortable . This is the exact opposite of what an eye cream should do . The whole point of eye cream is to be thick enough not to melt and get into your eyes and , if it does , it should not sting . That 's why eye cream is different than face cream . This one fails . I wo n't be using it again .	-1
I tried this product with a lot of hope for quite sometime . I did n't see any improvement what so ever . I would not recommend buying it .	-1
How can people market such crap . It does nothing . Absolutely nothing . Total waste of money . I have tried alot of eye creams . This one is right there on the bottom .	-1
same as all natural oils i think pure coconut oil works better then this i saw no difference using this product	-1
The packaging and delivery time were excellent . But it was not effective for my rashes . Other Aveeno product like skin relief ones has been a great product for their own purpose though and I have been using them for a few years .	-1
Nope . Purchased it a couple weeks ago and every time I 've used it , about 5 times , it has made my eyes burn and water . Like the bestseller and highly-rated Maybelline Great Lash ( in the pink and green bottle ) , this also burns my eyes . I 've read many reviews of the Great Lash , and this happens with quite a few people . No idea what ingredient ( s ) are doing this , but consistent every time , and it does n't happen with my L'Oreal mascaras.As far as the rest of its performance , I find this to be nothing special . If it truly made eyelashes full and soft , I 'd be happy , but I do n't notice either of these things . It seems quite sparse in what it deposits on the eyelashes . I did a test with L'Oreal on one side and Maybelline on the other , and both felt crispy once dried.I do like that the brush is fiber , and not hard plastic like so many are nowadays . It goes on easily and comfortably , though I would prefer the wand to be curved and longer.So all in all , there is nothing here to recommend , and all the other minor points become moot , because burning is not acceptable . It claims to be hypoallergenic but it is not .	-1
It looks ok when you initially put it on , then within an hr or so the lashes start to look dull ( not much length or volume ) .	-1
This product does not live up to its name . While the mascara is soft , it is not full . To get a desired full effect , I have to apply the mascara at least three times . The mascara also takes a long time to set and dry . I will not be buying this product again .	-1
I purchased this based on the good reviews I read , and had confidence that it would live up to them . It did n't . This mascara smudges and smears very easily . It 's allergy season , so my eyes tear a little ... but just from that it streaked under my eyes ! Other mascaras do n't do this at all . The mascara goes on nicely and separates your lashes well , but I ca n't give it a three-star rating because I ca n't use it and had to throw it in the trash .	-1
I ended up not even opening the packaging ; I could tell by the look of them they had to be pretty old ; one was actually very yellowed and they both looked like they 'd come from a discount sales bin somewhere . I looked up the product codes from the bottom of the tubes and learned that they had been produced in 2005 and 2007 , respectively . This is clearly well past the `` safe '' three-year shelf life . Now I have to return them in the hopes of getting my $ 20 refunded . This company should not be allowed to sell on Amazon.UPDATE : Third-party seller ( BeautyTime ) claims the product `` never expires '' ( contrary to Maybelline 's website , even ) , and has accused me of lying and that the product `` did n't exist in 2005 & 2007 , '' which is not true ( I 've been using this mascara for YEARS ) . I have ordered this mascara on Amazon before , and not had this same experience . Be careful as to who the third-party seller is . This company is clearly shady .	-1
I 'm in my twenties and just getting started on my anti aging regimen . I used this for a month or so and did n't really see or feel any results . I do n't think it went well with my skin either . I switched to St. Ives moisturizer with collagen and I like it a lot better .	-1
I have used Olay since I was 16 and I never notice any firming or any difference . Perhaps because I am still young but I do notice some eye wrinkles and this has not helped at all . It is however , a great moisturizer : )	-1
Caused break-outs after first use . Applies very thick and sticky . Will not be purchasing again . Makes a good body moisturizer though .	-1
cheap . oily . and makes my skin break out . I do n't even see an expiration date . Its like wearing a mask on your face all day . Just go to cosco and buy the new stuff , it prolly works better in the long run . I do n't even use this anymore . Does anyone check for the expiration date anyway ?	-1
I wo n't lie , I am very new to a skin care regimen . I started up recently because now that I 'm in law school , I feel I should ... because the other women are doing it . I have always had a young face but apparently there is always room for improvement.I started using this the day after I received it . I am using it this in the morning following my Olay recommended regimen . They are : Olay Pro-XOlay Pro-X Microdermabrasion Plus Advanced Cleansing System ( twice a week for microdermabrasion , twice a day to clean my face on non-microdermabrasion days , once a day to clean my face on microdermabrasion days ) Olay Total Effects Nourishing Cream Cleanser Skin Care ( twice a day ) Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Eye Treatment ( twice a day ) Olay Total Effects Anti-Aging Night Firming Treatment ( at night ) I had originally signed up to get it through the Subscribe and Save because , well , 15 % off is n't bad . I had read reviews that said it was a light moisturizer , they saw results in two weeks , this that and the other . I have seen no results from this . After the night treatment at least I can say I like the way my face feels . This makes my skin feel oily , makes me extremely shiny , and has caused me to break out . I am giving it 1 star for the sunscreen since , well , it 's sunscreen and I ca n't complain too much about being protected on my 20-minute drive to school . I am giving it 1 more star because Olay has a money-back guarantee I 'm going to try to go after.I am reducing this a star because even though the most often subscribed amount is 3 months , I am in no way sure how you get even one month out of this . There 's not very much in this container and unless you 're up to smooshing your face , it does not go very far . I am reducing this another star because I hate the way that it dispenses . I never know how much I 'm going to get per pump so I have to watch it and go slow . Even though I use the same amount every day , I use between 1 and 8 pumps due to the erratic nature of the delivery system . I also know that toward the end of this , there 's going to be some left in the bottom that I 'll never be able to access or use . This would n't bother me except that I do like the way the other creams are just in a jar and I can take or leave whatever I need . My guess this delivery system is because of the sunscreen , since that has to be in a light-proof container to prevent a reaction . I am reducing this one last star because every time I use it , I break out . While I certainly ca n't fault being protected from the sun for 20 minutes a day , I can not in my life imagine how anyone can put this on every two hours per the directions . I put it on once in the morning and I am oily all day . I thought that this would go down as my skin became used to it but I was admittedly wrong . I did not start out by doing the every two hours when I realized how deep this did not go . Many days I have to blot it off . I know what you 're thinking -- & # 34 ; Oh , that 's your makeup ! & # 34 ; I do n't wear makeup . I really can not stand the feeling of something on or around my face . Do n't want , do n't like . I honestly am only two weeks into the regimen but for that last reason alone , I ca n't do it anymore .	-1
Smells terrible ! I can not believe Olay would sell a product that smelled so strong.Very disappointed ! Good moisturizer ! Smells very strong .	-1
It was too thick and did not spread well . The & # 34 ; touch of foundation & # 34 ; was more heavily colored than some of the regular foundations I have used in the past AND it just seemed to sit on top of the skin . As a result , the color would rub off in spot and look blotchy . Also , it started making my skin peel after a few uses in a row . In other words , it was terrible . I did give it a second star , though . The reason is that it did seem to make my skin look and feel a little nicer after you would wash it off . I am only 30 years old , but I noticed a slight discoloration around my eyes from years of the sun starting to show through . I also have a bit more discoloration from previous acne as well . Overall , I would say my skin is average . Not too bad , but not exceptional.If you want an AMAZING cream ( although no foundation ) , see my review of the L'Oreal Ideal Moisture Even Tone cream . I really love it . http : //www.amazon.com/review/R1P4OWBH1VSBUF/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm ? ie=UTF8 & ASIN ; =B00AYWN8OY	-1
This is not my favorite product from Olay . I love all of the others I have tried . It is toooo sticky . I do not recommend .	-1
I bought this hoping to spend less on a daily facial cream with SPF . I 've been using Ole Henricksen 's `` truth revealed super creme SPF 15 '' , which is $ 55 a jar . Well , you definitely get what you pay for . The smell of this `` unscented '' cream is so chemically ( is that a word ? ) and sunscreeny , that it 's almost unbearable to wear . It is thick , so only a little bit is needed , but it is n't fully absorbed by my skin . My makeup brushes have to be washed more frequently because of the residue and the smell ( I do n't want it to cross-contaminate into my blush/powder foundation ) . I will not purchase again .	-1
I read all the reviews so I thought it had to be good . I will never buy this product again , it left a residue on my face that made my makeup roll off . I did n't have large pores untill I used this product , it makes my skin look hard and greasy . The best thing I 've used is Olay regenerating serum , and I will stick to that from now on .	-1
I 've been suffering from combination acne prone skin and thought that this would be the answer to my problems , with Salicylic acid as one of the ingredients and other multiple promises this moisturizer said it would do . However , I was horribly wrong ; this not only made me break out in little pimples all over my face but left my face even more oily . This was also expensive so I was even more disappointed . In conclusion , I will NEVER purchase this again .	-1
I did not seem much improvement with this product . I was surprised because Olay has some good products out there . Would not buy again .	-1
I shiver at the thought , remembering when I last used this product . I have sensitive skin but did n't think that this product would effect it since everyone said how `` moisturizing '' Olay products are . First day I used it I did n't think much of it only that it 's pretty thick and greasy feeling . Used it again the next day and by about the third day I had completely broken out in a rash and acne ! It was so bad , I discontinued the use but it took couple weeks for my skin to return back to normal . At the time I was in my late 20s and I do n't even break out , but this stuff made me look like a teenager in puberty ! So if you have sensitive skin , or you think you might have sensitive skin I would NOT recommend it . Instead I would highly recommend Garnier Ultra-Lift , it 's light , and does not irritate or make you skin break out . Plus it WORKS unlike anything else out there and gives our skin a glow , even under makeup . Plus completely got rid of all my wrinkles ! : )	-1
Very fancy bottle , when you pump it out comes that thick , greasy , white sunscreen everyone has run into before . Maybe it has crazy good ingredients or is good for your skin , but I will never come to enjoy putting thick , greasy feeling , white sunscreen on my face or body . I do use it , but I do n't like it .	-1
i did n't care for this product . It felt heavy on my face and after a couple of hours , it kind of pealed of my face . It also felt like it dried out my skin .	-1
So disappointed . Very thick and sticky consistency . Way too heavy caused breakouts after one use . Also not for sensitive skin caused redness .	-1
Again , if your skin is too sensitive or you suffer from eczema , like I do on my face , you have to be careful because this product may not work for you . It did n't work for me . My symptoms got worst .	-1
dry skin ... good for normal acne but not to severe acne people ... . recommend to see doctor and have acutane pill..	-1
I have to rate the product according to my experience . I ended up being allergic to the main ingredient in this product . It was way too strong for my skin and I quickly began to start scratching for no apparent reason to me and having weird burning sensations , etc . on my face . I would recommend that you make sure your skin can handle this ingredient before purchasing this product .	-1
This stuff smells like someone rubbed you down with clothes . The cologne only lasts for 30 minutes . Not worth the money . Clubman original and clubman reserve are 10x better !	-1
Ran out of Dominica and looking for a substitute , I bought this stuff . Wretched ! Bears the same relationship to real bay rum ( rhum ) as instant coffee does to brewed coffee - in other words , it 's smelly brown water .	-1
I like bay rum generally , and think that the regular Clubman aftershave and talc smell nice , so thought I 'd give this a try . I could n't even bring myself to put it on -- when I opened the bottle , my first impression was that it smelled like a skunk ! Now , that sounds like I 'm being dramatic -- but no , this actually smells like skunk spray . I tried sniffing it again several times to be sure I was n't just crazy , but it really smells nasty . If you want bay rum , spend more and go forRoyall Bay Rhum All Purpose Cologne Splash , 8 Ounce , or some other brand . If you are looking for something cheap that has a classic , old-fashioned barbershop smell , go for the regular Clubman aftershave ( Clubman Pinaud After Shave Lotion , 6 Ounce ) , or the extremely classicClubman Jeris Osage Rub , 14 Fluid Ounce , orMaster Well Comb Spice After Shave Lotion 15 oz . Do n't bother with this one.IF I can bring myself to actually put this on sometime , maybe it will wear differently , and I 'll edit this review . But I would only try that if I 'm not going to be around anyone for a few hours , before taking a shower !	-1
This is ok if you have normal skin but did n't impress me for oily skin . Cetaphil is an amazing brand but I would n't recommend this item for problem skin . If you have regular skin , it does smell amazing and would probably work great for you	-1
Keeps my skin smooth and hydrated out of the shower and my husband loves the smell- I win this round.UPDATE- After using the product a few more times , I realized that I Do NOT love this item . If you do n't really rub this oil around , it kid of gobs up on the skin- my towels needed to be washed right away and I do n't know , it kind of trapped my body heat in- I did n't like the way it made me feel .	-1
I 'm not sure if I got a faulty product , but the `` hot '' air was not hot . It was lukewarm at best . As such , it did nothing at all to my hair except make it extremely frizzy . No curls or waves.You might have more luck than I with this product . And because Amazon allows you to return this after you 've opened it ( I 've already spoken to a rep and created a return tag ) , no harm in trying . It 's just not for me .	-1
I really liked the results I got from this iron . However , after about 4 months the connector that you twist to lock the barrels in place no longer worked . I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
I returned this styler after just a few uses because it gets VERY hot , even on the `` low '' setting , and the cord is very short . I do n't recommend it as a hair dryer , styler , or anything ! Look elsewhere .	-1
I did n't realize that 5x magnification was not very much . Following cataract surgery , I now do not have any close-up vision and hoped this would be good for putting on mascara , but NO .	-1
This is much smaller than I imagined . Also , the light is so faint that it does n't make a difference whether its on or off . I would n't recommend it . Mine is getting donated .	-1
had to return on christmas morning ! : ( the light did n't work at all !	-1
The light around this mirror does nothing but look pretty . I wish I had bought one with more magnification because the light does not help you see any clearer .	-1
This did n't put out much steam , and was n't very hot . Maybe it 's because I 'm in the mountains and water produces steam at a lower temp . up here . Anyway , I had a better facial with a pot of boiling water , and had to return this . UPDATE 2011 : Want steam ? ? ? Use a `` My little steamer '' mini clothing steamer ! ! ! CAUTION : Keep at least 12-15 inches away from your face . I used distilled water , and this thing really puts out steam , and in less than a minute too ! Remember ... do not put it too close to your face ! ! ! It generates VERY HOT STEAM ! ! !	-1
Ended up selling this at a garage sale for $ 2 . It did n't work very well at all . Would not recommend .	-1
Cheaper in Walmart . Not great quality , lightweight cheap feeling plastic .	-1
After that minimal steam . Cool mist worked ok . I agee with previous review . Towel and a pot of steaming water for me .	-1
I purchased this system at a `` Bed , Bath , and Beyond '' store . I used it , and I really did like the whole Facial Sauna System . However , not too long after using the system , problems did occur . The moisturizing sponge attachment wore down & eventually fell apart ... And there 's really no way to order a replacement . The other problem was that the actual Facial Tool eventually stopped working . I thought perhaps I needed to replace the batteries , although when I put new batteries in , it still did not work . So the only thing left that still works is the Facial Steamer .	-1
The sauna works fine with distilled water , its open enough to not suffocate you with steam but you can put a towel on if your looking to get deep into the pores . The facial scrubber cleaned out my blackheads . But only after a month it stopped working , its not meant to get wet at all , even the humidity of the bathroom will ruin it .	-1
Just bought this item . DOnt like it at all . Not enough steam by any stretch of the imagination . I give it a 2 star because the exfoliating brush and other amenities are great added features .	-1
I am not happy with these products . The steamer does n't create enough steam for a facial , even with holding a towel over my head . I can hear & see the water bubbling and ca n't help but wonder if it 's going to bubble boiling water onto my face . The facial scrubber it comes with is a peice of crap as well . Looks like it was made in the 1980 's , and made cheaply as well . Very disappointed . Will return .	-1
This product did nothing for my wrinkles . It does moisturize well . Although I wil not be reordering it .	-1
returned . this stuff contains alot of ingredients like three different parabens that are not good for 'sensitive skin ' as advertised . i returned it .	-1
I have been using the YouCurl wand ( Conair ) for over a year , and have loved it ! Now my hair has gotten longer and so the diameter of my YouCurl created much tighter curls than I like , so I was simply trying to buy a similar product but of wider diameter , but this is obviously not the right choice:1 ) Using the base clip is not very intuitive , maybe its just me , but I could n't figure out how to use the clip and twist my hair around it properly quickly enough ( I 'm sure if I spent some time on it , it would have been OK , but who has time to spend trying to & # 34 ; train & # 34 ; on using a curling iron ? ! ) 2 ) The spirals are purely decorative I think , there is almost no way for your hair to neatly fall between the spirals , so it just wraps around and over them , which in itself is no big deal , only it means they really do n't have any purpose other than to make it look more gadgety.3 ) The heat adjustment knob has no numbers on it ( yes , really , no numbers ! ) so there is no way for you to know what setting you are using , what temperature you are on , and if you happen to hit the right temperature by coincidence , there is no way you can replicate that experience next time4 ) Even when turning the dial to the maximum ( at least I think its the maximum , again since there are no labels on the dial ) , the wand never got hot enough to actually create any curls.This is the second wider wand that I have tried and both were terrible ( the other one was the Remington Keratin infused wand , which was only a minor improvement from this one ) .I will just buy another larger sized Conair model ( the original model that worked perfectly for me for 2 years does n't seem to have a large enough size , so I have to try a different model from the same manufacturer ) lets hope that it works as well as the original !	-1
I didnt like this because it did not get hot enough and my hair was still frizzy . I prefer hot tools because it cord doesnt tangle and it is hot like the ones a professional uses since I do my hair at home . It is better the spend an extra 15.00 to have quality and use it for a longer time .	-1
yes , it heats up , but the heat dial and on/off switch are constantly turned down or turned off due to their location . Would look at other brands before purchasing .	-1
Does n't heat up enough . I had it on my hair for 20 seconds without it feeling hot to the touch , on the highest setting.The on/off buttons are in the way and I turned it off by mistake at least 3 times just trying to curl the front of my hair , before I gave up and used another iron.I did get a cute curl once , but it went away by the time I did the next strand . I knew I hated Revlon curlers , but this was the biggest one I could find at the store . Hopefully the store will take the curling iron back unwrapped .	-1
This is not a good curling iron at all . I think I only got it for $ 15 so I guess you get what you pay for . It might curl a little bit , but it 's not how a curling iron SHOULD work . The curls are n't pretty and they barely stay.I would spend a little more money and get a better one ... I know I 'm going to .	-1
I have burned myself quite a few times because the little clamp gets stuck half way down ounce you release the tab . trying to maneuver the thing the rest of the way down without 1 ) burning myself 2 ) losing the piece of hair I was trying to curl is impossible ! This is a horrible product .	-1
I 'm asian but my hair is still not very thick . This curling iron does n't work at all . No curls whatsoever .	-1
The iron heats up well , but the barrel snags my hair which . Makes it quite difficult to maneuver and get my hair curled	-1
This product is overloaded with lavender . Why not just buy a bottle of lavender and put it on my face ? lol	-1
Kind of drying , not moisturizing . Kind of disappointed . Will have to keep searching for a good reasonable face moisturizer . It should not cost an arm and a leg .	-1
The lotion seems extra oily which broke my skin out . I used the remainder as a hand cream and still felt the extra oil .	-1
Well first let me say , i do n't have wrinkles or hard lines ( im in my 20s ) i use anti-wrinkles washes and creams to hopefully help prevent them in the future , so i ca n't comment from an anti-wrinkle view point however i have very oily , sensitive skin that can easily get a small break out . I started using this among other products and started to notice i would get small breakouts , i figured it must be the other new product cleansers and toners i was using cause eucerin has never given me breakouts , so i stopped using the other products , and tested this product on certain areas on my face only , and sure enough those exact spots had the new abrasions . I have super oily skin , i believe this product causes clogged pores which leads to the breakouts , i suggest you avoid if you have oily skin , i will continue to use this product of my neck and chest to get rid of it .	-1
This has the exact consistency , color , and smell as room temperature butter . It is moisturizing but it does n't work well for my skin since it makes me break out . Plus , it made me feel like I was smearing butter all over my face , which turned me off to this product.Will not purchase again .	-1
I used this all over my face before bed and woke up to redness and inflammation all around my eyes . I called Eucerin and they said this product is not `` opthamologist tested '' . Well , I do n't see why it is for sensitive skin and also DERMATOLOGIST RECOMMENDED if you should n't use it anywhere near the fine lines around your eyes -- the reason many of us buy wrinkle creams .	-1
This literally did nothing for my skin . You 're better off buying a glycolic acid cream and using emo oil as a moisturizer .	-1
Like many of the reviewers of this cream on here , I also have super sensitive dry skin & Rosacea . Thought I 'd give it a whirl based on such good reviews & I ca n't fathom what people see in this cream . It is SO thick , greasy , & clumpy with the consistency of `` butter '' ( even looks & kind of smells like it ) . It does work for super dry skin if you enjoy your face feeling like you have rubbed Vaseline all over it & having your face stick to your pillow at night..YUK..My Dermatologist recommended CeraVe cream to me which is also quite heavy but nowhere near as bad as this cream . I 've used a few other Eucerin products & they were all like this . Guess I should have known better . I really disliked like product . **Just a little update here**-I 've read some people use this as a hand cream ( I guess due to it being quite thick ) so I gave that a whirl & it does work great for dry/cracked hands & I now use it for this only , just wanted to add something positive !	-1
I purchased this after reading all the great review for sensitive skin- but this product made my skin itchy and reddish pumpy.. I had to throw it away after 1-2 use . It still has pretty strong smell for sensitive cream .	-1
I 've come to the conclusion if the product is advertised as Anti-Wrinkle it ai n't going to work and more than likelydo nothing but lay on your skin like a mast.Olay Regenerist is the same way it actually feels like heat on your skin . This one doesnt feel like that , it just feels like you are wearing a mask and the pores in your face are clogged.After seeing the horrors of plastic surgery and the Contour debacle where threads are inserted into your skin to pull the face up ... frankly just face the fact your never going to look like your were even in your 40's.Time and nature will have their way with you . Matter of a fact if wrinkles are all you have got , be glad there are so many ills and deseases to confront you as you make this short journey in your life , just be yourself .	-1
[ UPDATE ] It looks like Eucerin has changed the formula of this cream , and it no longer contains parabens . Thank you , Eucerin ! I will try it again and re-review it . My previous review is for informational purposes only.I used to use this cream , and I looooved it . It smells nice , and glides onto your face like frosting . Your skin feels luxurious afterwards . Then , I read an article about the potential dangers of parabens in skin cream and checked the label . Low and behold , I was very sad to see that Eucerin Q10 Anti-wrinkle cream contains lots of parabens . While we do n't know for sure that parabens are bad for us , it sounds like a pretty good bet . Like BPA , parabens mimic estrogen and may lead to breast cancer , premature puberty in girls , and studies indicate that methylparaben applied on the skin may react with UVB leading to increased skin aging and DNA damage . I 'm guessing that it 's more a combination of skin creams , BPA , birth control , deodorant , and all the other chemicals we 're exposed to on a daily basis that may be correlated to breast cancer , but why risk it . There are lots of other paraben free options , and Eucerin should really figure out a recipe for this cream that uses less controversial ingredients ! Full ingredients list from the Eucerin website : Water , Glycerin , Ethylhexyl Cocoate , Stearyl Alcohol , Hydrogenated Coco-Glycerides , Butylene Glycol , Cetyl Alcohol , Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride , Glyceryl Stearate Citrate , Butyrospermum Parkii ( Shea Butter ) , Tocopheryl Acetate , Biosaccharide Gum-1 , Ubiquinone , Tridecyl Stearate , Tridecyl Trimelitate , Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate , Biotin , Zea Mays ( Corn ) Oil ( Corn ) , Beta-Carotene , Dipentaerythrityl Hexacaprylate/Hexacaprate , Carbomer , Titanium Dioxide , Alumina , Silica , Sodium Polyacrylate , Phenoxyethanol , Methylparaben , Ethylparaben , Propylparaben , Butylparaben , Isobutylparaben , DMDM Hydantoin , Sodium Hydroxide , Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate ) .	-1
This clay mask does n't do anything for my skin . and also it has a funny smell . I do n't recommend it .	-1
The first time I used this I put it on and within two minutes began smelling vomit . I thought my dog had thrown up somewhere so I walked all over the house with the mask on looking for vomit . When the timer went off I figured I 'd look more when I get out of the shower and never found anything nor did I smell the vomit after I showered . Never associated the smell with the mask . The second time I used this I immediately noticed a vomit smell and put 1 and 2 together . By now I 've used it four times and every time it smells like vomit , not kind of like vomit , just like vomit ! The product works well enough , but considering it has fragrance as an ingredient I just do n't get why it smells so bad .	-1
Really dries my skin and causes breakout . I have had this for 3 months now and have only used it 3 times but still my skin is to sensitive for it . Waste of money since product does not work for me .	-1
- It peel off nothing . I do n't have blackhead but just a little dead skin around my chin . And dead skin is even easier to peel off than blackhead , but this thing ca n't even take it out . Disappointed .	-1
I guess I do n't know how to use a facial peel off mask or something , but I am not happy . First off , it 's like glue . It 's the same thing as getting elmers glue , just smells like cucumbers . I ca n't spread it around to my face and it peels off like glue on your hands . You know when you get glue on your hands and peel it off as a kid ? Same thing , except you ca n't spread it around like Elmer 's . It took me forever to get it off my face and was not nice because I have peach fuzz . It got in my hair and I had to wash it out , and I did n't see a difference whatsoever in my face except that it was red from trying to get it all off . If you want a pain in the ass ( and I do n't like to cuss ) , buy this . This is something that I would never recommend to anyone whatsoever . If I 'm doing it the wrong way , please someone tell me !	-1
I 've got oily , acne prone skin and I 'm constantly fighting clogged pores . This did absolutely nothing for me . Impurities were not removed , oils were not absorbed . It smells horribly like vodka and is very painful to & # 34 ; peel & # 34 ; ( I do n't have peach fuzz or any noticeable facial hair so I assume this is just from it pulling on my sensitive skin ) . Not my favorite freeman product .	-1
First of all , it does pull out stuff from your pores , bet very little bit . Just to explain : if you use strips on your nose ( I think most of the girls know what strips I talk about ) , then you pull it out , you see some pore stuff left on the strip , but most of pores still not cleaned . So this mask working much less than strips for nose . It takes some stuff out , but its nothing , does n't make sense to use.I could n't find some good pore cleaner , until I try proactiv . Even if you have no pimples , try to buy just a cleanser from proactiv ( the first one from regular kit ) , it 's like a scrub , but it 's first scrub in my life that really clean pores instead of scratching skin . So , put the scrab on DRY face , scrab it all for minute , especially your nose . After 2-3 use your pores will be clean . I promise .	-1
Does n't peel off well ... .I usually have to scrub it off , which defeats the entire purpose . I would n't get it again , would prefer other brands I 've used before .	-1
The smell is so strong it burns my eyes . I love Freeman 's other masks though , I enjoy the clay avocado one a lot and even use the black sugar scrub one to exfoliate . This one does n't seem to improve my skin or make it look any better after using ... it 's fun to peel off though .	-1
I thought this was a more powerful dryer ... my bad . I 'm going to keep it since I like the color ( LOL ) and it dries well with a high and low setting and 2 speeds , and has concentrator and attachment for curls . Both attachments are very tough to take off ... I 'm so afraid I 'll break one of them ... .they need a better system to get them on and off . The dryer is only 1275 watts , not exactly powerful . And , very important , the buttons for high/low/off/ and heat settings are very small , and placed badly . I keep accidentally turning off the blower !	-1
This hair dryer is heavy . And pretty huge . Also , it 's hard to hold it by the handle because the rocker switches for power and heat are in the way of your fingers , so you have to practice in order to not change the settings during use . When set on hot/high , the velocity of the air is very good , but it 's not hot at all -- the air is barely warm -- which is fine for drying , but certainly not good for styling . It did minimize my static flyaway hair , but since I had to use my old & # 34 ; hot & # 34 ; dryer to style , I lost that benefit and had to add leave-in conditioner to de-electrify my hair . The price was good , hence the two stars , but I do n't recommend . Probably better for short hair .	-1
I 'd say this is just your average hair dryer . I did n't notice anything magical happening with the ionic technology , and the accessories that it comes with are pretty cheap . Particularly the straightening-comb , which falls off every time you run it through the hair . The diffuser worked ok for me .	-1
so I like it for a hairdryer but I bought is as a QUIET hairdryer for grooming a skittish pup and it is not quiet .	-1
It 's HUGE ! It was described as more of a travel dryer , but it 's way too big to put in a suitcase , and too expensive for quality , cheap looking plastic .	-1
This dryer does n't blow hard or hot enough to straighten the waves out of my hair without a lot of extra styling , which is time-consuming . I have pretty fine , thin hair , so I think this dryer should only be good for people with very straight hair that only want to dry it , not style it . I tried using a styling brush , but the style did n't hold due to the air from the dryer being too cool . I had to use a curling iron . It does leave my hair soft and fluffy , but I would n't buy another one .	-1
I 've been blow drying my hair for 20 years and this is the worst blow dryer I have ever used . It takes forever to dry my hair and it does n't give me the sleek results I 'm used to . My hair dries to a wispy , flyaway state w frizz . It really does n't get hot enough and does n't produce enough air . Really terrible . Someone said it was heavy , but I find it lighter than most . It gets the job done just not well . I have to go over each section of my hair w a large curling iron to smooth the strands . I 'm causing extra damage and wasting extra time for no reason . I 'm going to go back to the Revlon line . It produces much better , quicker results .	-1
After using this I started developing little red pimple like bumps on wherever I used it . I gave it away to my sister I 'll just stick with CeraVe SA it 's a better lotion .	-1
While this was moisturizing , I used the entire bottle- 2 applications per day- and it did nothing to lighten my darkened elbows and knees .	-1
I agree with the other reviewers in that this product used to have a light , wonderful lavender scent . Now it has more of a Pine-Sol cleaning smell scent to it , and it smells more like Rosemary than Lavender . : (	-1
I did not have a good experience with this product . It smells good but I used it ( sparingly ) in the bath and experienced sensitivity/irritation from it ( feminine region ) . I ca n't use drugstore brands like Olay , Softsoap , etc ... I normally use Body Shop , Neutrogena , and Bath & Body Works and never have problems . I incorrectly assumed Alba products would be more along those lines . Beware if you have sensitivity issues with bath & shower gel and body wash .	-1
It does n't go very far , I need to use so much of it , It wo n't last long at all . It smells fine though .	-1
I 'm not a big fan of this body wash . It is supposed to smell like Honey Mango , but I smell a lot of floral hints . I wo n't buy this again .	-1
at first it smelled like mango and it was OK . But when I used it in shower , it smelled different - I ca n't describe it but it smelled like something not fresh and stale & # 8230 ; I do n't know , other people might like it , but I do n't . I can stand up with this smell until I use this whole 32 ounce bottle up .	-1
Hate the smell , it 's just like rotten fruits ! ! Lathers ok for an organic shower gel , it performs ok just the smell that 's the most bothersome	-1
I really think if your skin is like leather this is for you . Otherwise , stay away . I followed the directions and then started cutting back when I noticed it was turning into red splotches . I finally quit after a week or so . I was so embarrassed to go out of the house . All I wanted was to get rid of the red spots that were left after pimples came and left . I am a strawberry blonde with fair skin . The alpha hydroxy is the culprit . I had high hopes . This product deserves zero stars .	-1
I love the smell of cocoa butter , so was looking forward to bathing with it . However , this bar soap does n't smell anything like cocoa butter . Worse , it does n't seem to moisturize my skin either . I wo n't repurchase .	-1
I could n't wait to get this eye pillow . I read the reviews and was hoping that the scent was n't too overpowering . Well it came last night , I opened the box expecting a beautiful scent of lavender and I can BARELY smell the scent . I do n't know if I just received one that was older or what , but when I used it last night the lavender was so faint that even holding it up to my nose did n't work . I love the fabric and it 's very well made , just does n't smell ... is there something you can do ?	-1
I bought this because it was reduced . It was an even lower price in the grocery store . My son questioned the smell . This is like no ocean smell I ever smelled . Now I am stuck with 4 of them .	-1
This shampoo works pretty good and smells great , but it does not have much lather . I have been using the L'Oreal sulfate free shampoo and it is much richer and has a great thick lather . I wo n't be buying this product again . I prefer Alba shampoo for natural products .	-1
I bought it , but I do not like it . It does not lather that well and my hair feels like stray after using it . I bought Enjoy and it has a great lather and smell and my hair is smooth . I ca n't recommend this product as it was not great on my hair .	-1
My hair looks clumpy and unclean . My scalp is itchy . My hair looks horrible , as though I had n't showered at all . Please avoid this product .	-1
This has a really awful , medicine-ish / herbal smell that reminds me of dandruff shampoo or men 's deodorant . I only used it once , though , because I disliked the smell so much . So I 'm not really sure how well it works in the long run .	-1
Original Review : It goes on a little bit like sunscreen ... same consistency and same smell minus most of the shine . My skin is generally a tiny bit shiny after applying , but not overly greasy . the shine fades away pretty quickly leaving a nice radiant effect . So far so good . I 've been using it for about a week and a half and my skin is looking pretty good . It 's not overly hydrating I 've found , so if you 're looking for more of a wet lotiony consistency , this might not be the moisturizer for you . It offers great protection for being in the sun , though.After Continued Use : I started to notice a very mild burny sensation after using this product . I never really payed much attention to it in the beginning , but I really started to notice it after continued use . I get tiny tiny red bumps on my cheeks also from using it and it gives me sort of a ruddy appearance . I love the Neutrogena sun screens . they do not have this burny effect on my face , but this for whatever reason does . I gave the rest of my moisturizer to my mom to use and it 's just fine for her , but my skin is sensitive .	-1
YUCK ! I am really starting to think many of these rave reviews are fake , because go on over to Makeupalley and everyone else hates this product as well . I have never in my life actually thrown away a full product , until this one . It was literally unusable . It made my face look muddy , not natural at all . And it also clumped up around my eyebrows and the sides of my face , even though I did n't use that much ! It just looked so bad , I did n't feel guilty about throwing it in the garbage at all . Buy at your own risk	-1
I would LOVE to have received the pictured product , which I ordered . INSTEAD , I was sent the Helioplex & # 34 ; new & # 34 ; product - which is NOT the one pictured . Amazon STILL has not corrected this problem which I called to their attention numerous times when I returned the product that was delivered to me.Again - the PICTURED product is NOT the product that is offered for sale .	-1
This bottle is not even 2 ounces and it costs more than $ 11 ! What a rip off . It does n't work any better than other moisturizers , in fact I prefer the texture of other moisturizers and this one also has an odd smell . You can buy Olay or even the generic brand moisturizers with SPF and they have the same ingredients and work great . I will not be buying this again .	-1
I am throwing this away . I do n't like the brush , it is spaced too far apart , the mascara is clumpy , and it does n't wash off leaving ugly dark circles under your eyes . Ick . I 'm surprised to see such good reviews .	-1
Thin little brush , takes a few coats to do anything and by that time it 's a little clumpy with no extension . The best out there is Maybelline New York Illegal Length Fiber Extensions Washable Mascara - they really give you extension and no clumps . Once in a while I will try something else or try a new product , but nothing comes close to Illegal Length in my opinion .	-1
I think this is because Dena Alcohol is one of the main ingredients listed in it formula and it really does irritates my eyes . hope that they would make an alcohol free eye products , because the same irritation I feel it whenver I put the Master Drama eyeline on my inner rim .	-1
I decided to give it a try because of the previous good reviews of using it for outdoor activities ... After received it , I have been using it for months mostly for my water sessions , which are about an hour to two hours each session . I will not reapply it after getting out to the water , and i think it should be able to protect my skins for at least an hour or two ... however , it does n't , my skins still get tan after each session , and the worse is the sun spots on my face are darkening ... and I have to use a special face cream to fade the unwanted sun spots after showering ... so what 's the point of using it ? ? ? for outdoor activities , i do n't think it can fully protect human skins from the damage of sun exposure , like i said earlier , and it is much more expensive then those sun blocks ( around ten dollars ) in the drugstores . I did n't return it because I could n't tell the actual result from using it on the first few times ; however , after 30 days of ordering it , i confirm its ineffectiveness when i have used it more ... well ... two stars are for its light weight , non-greasy texture , and decent smell , so it can be applied under the foundation for daily use ; however , there are tons of similar products that gals can use it under the foundation and are much cheaper ; or tons of foundation already have spf . perhaps guys ' skins are n't that delicate as gals ' ... my husband uses it too ... but i still see his sun spots on his face ... he just does n't care about that ... does n't mean that works though	-1
Another failed sunscreen ! It does not go on clear as advertised and it stains clothes.It dries out the skin and makes wrinkles more pronounced . I also had a breakout with this one on my face and neck as I did with the one for sensitive skin.Something in these Fallene products does not agree with my sensitive skin . This was the 2nd one purchased at the same time .	-1
I used Aveeno for years but switched to Elta MD over two years ago and have not looked back : Eltamd UV Clear SPF 46 , 48-Gram 1.7 oz.Elta MD UV Clear SPF 46 provides higher spf protection and goes on smoother with a cleaner finish . Elta MD is much better for combination or acne prone skin than Aveeno . Elta MD does a FANTASTIC job of calming the excess redness in my complexion , something Aveeno has no effect on . I also love how Elta MD goes on much lighter than Aveeno and Elta MD lasts longer as a result . Elta MD is more expensive than Aveeno but I found myself going through an Aveeno every 2 months and a container of Elta MD lasts me over 4 months , so net net you are spending about the same or less with Elta MD over time.Thanks for taking the time to read my review , and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision .	-1
The scrub did not live up to my expectations , no brightening of skin , didnt feel it cleansed well enough : (	-1
STAY AWAY FROM IT IF YOU WEAR CONTACTS AND HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN . I put this on my face and it felt alright for the first hour . I noticed my eyes started getting irritated and a rash on my forehead . My eyes looks stressed and was red . I did n't put this on the next day and my eyes felt way better and no rash . However my face is red from the irritation from this sunscreen . This product seems like the perfect choice for me : A daily moisturizer that has clinically proven Total Soy Complex and natural light diffusers that work to naturally even out skin toneGentle enough for sensitive skin and daily useOil freeHypoallergenicNoncomedogenic ( wo n't clog pores ) but the result turned out to be a bad product for me ... I wish I could get my money back . If you wear contacts do not buy this . This product has a very heavy scent that will irritate your eyes and you will be desperate to take your contacts off ... ..	-1
I can not use liquid foundation . I have tried tons of different products and everything I use , no matter how light , turn orange on my skin after a very short time . I decided to try tinted moisturizer and this seems to blend like I was hoping it would . This is not for someone who needs a lot of coverage . I have normal skin and I do n't get acne very often so I do n't need anything full coverage . I tried this and for the first 2 days I used it it seemed to blend well , I would still wipe some off after I went out into the sunlight , but I did n't have to remove all of it . This morning I put it on and it was n't even on my skin for 5 minutes and I looked like I was turning into an oompa loompa . No matter how much I tried to blend it around my skin . Maybe I am destined to never wear liquid makeup . : (	-1
This is a nice lotion but I think it is a little heavy for the face . I do like it on my neck and shoulders . As I get older , lotions with SPF sometimes do n't absorb the way I hope they will . I 'm sure many others will love this .	-1
I have sensitive skin and a history of melanoma so I require a high spf . I chose this product because my old product was discontinued , Aveeno has typically been very gentle and this one offered a 30 spf , which I need.It smells like sunscreen . It went on easily but after a few minutes , it feels like it 's kind of caked on . Like a layer on top of my skin . After a few hours , my skin felt very dried out as if I had n't put a moisturizer on at all . Three days into using it , I got two huge under the skin pimples that left marks on my face for over week .	-1
I was SO disappointed in this product.It is glitter mixed with moisturizer and foundation.I would be a full-time user of this tinted moisturizer if it did NOT have the glitter.Oily or Combo skin girls- AVOID THIS ! Just make your own tinted moisturizer.It is cheaper and you control what is in it .	-1
The pump does n't get the end bits , so you end up wasting 1/4 of the product . Very irritating and wasteful .	-1
this does n't help my dry sensitive skin . i was using it often and whenever i go for a facial or to a makeup counter they tell me i need to exfoliate so I know it 's not working for me .	-1
This does not seem like face soap to me . For starters , it is iridescent in appearance . It also has a very noticeable fragrance - one that I would expect more from a body wash instead of a face wash. And it does n't lather - I need two full pumps to rub over my face because it wo n't lather . I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Clinique and did n't find it here .	-1
I use the moisturizer and love that , however , this tinted moisturizer is very cloudy and goes on very thick . I am still trying to figure out how much to use . I wo n't purchase again .	-1
I have oily , oily , oily skin . I would wash my face with this scrub , go to bed and then wake-up and my face would be extremely oily . It 's like my oily glands went into overdrive . I did n't notice any of the skin brightening claims . The only thing I love about this product is the smell . I love the smell and that 's it !	-1
Smells . I have allergies . I love Aveeno products , but this one not so much . Face scub is great . Lotion great . This , not so much .	-1
This product includes parabens , read the package . I thought this is going to be my favorite but I scared to use any more . Not only Aveeno , other brand products are the same and have harmful ingredients . therefore I decided not to use any product with harmful ingredients.finally all of products I have gave to my mothering law . at least I am free now .	-1
If by positively radiant , Aveeno means shininess , then this is the product for you . I love Aveeno products , but this one is n't it . I have some light acne scars and I heard this was a good way to cover it up ( BB creams , tinted moisturizers , etc . ) .When I first applied the product , it really burned and felt like a sunburn for a good 30 minutes . Then , I waited for it to dry and not look as shiny but it pretty much glimmered on my skin for the rest of the night . The color was marked fair to light , yet it was rather orange . Overall , I 'm disappointed in the results . I 'll stick to my Maybelline concealer for now .	-1
I work full time and go to school at night so I was looking for a product that I could throw on in a hurry that was able to stand in place of make up . I have combination skin so a moisturizer was just what I was looking for . At first I LOVED this product ! It covered quiet well and was very moisturizing . However , I only wore it for 4-5 hours at a time while I was in class . I later tried it on a weekend and noticed I had some minor break outs . The more I used it the more I broke out . Then I noticed there is SHIMMER in it ! If you have acne shimmer will accentuate your break outs . Awful ! Pros : Coverage ; Not quite as good as make up but able to stand inSmell ; VERY light smell of sun tan lotion , other than that unscentedFeel ; It goes on pretty thick but absorbs into the skin well so you do n't feel too greasy . Heavier than my normal face lotion , thoughSPFCons : SHIMMER ! Caused break outs	-1
I really wanted to like this product , though I did read some negative reviews from Amazon . While I 'm fine with the heavier coverage/thicker consistency of this moisturizer , I made my skin break out . Therefore , I had to stop using it for now . May give it one more chance a little later .	-1
There are many Aveeno products I love and work very well . This is a decent scrub minus the brightening . Aveeno needs to toss this one because the results ( zero ) make you feel like you are either not sure what brighter skin means or lied to .	-1
Color looked orange , smelled funny , but worst part was it stung and irritated my sensitive skin . I would not purchase if you have sensitive skin .	-1
It 's definitely not for oily/acne prone skin . When I would use it on my relatively clean skin first thing in the morning , my face would feel greasy and start breaking out later that day . When I would use it to take my make up off before I went to bed I would usually wake up with several pimples .	-1
I bought this because I 've always wanted to try a tinted moisturizer and most reviews seemed ok . I got it and tried it on for less than a month but it is basically thick sunscreen with foundation . It looks whitish on my skin when I first put it on and then looks oily ... just like if you would put on sunscree ! I would n't recommend it .	-1
Just average . Nothing special about this product for me . But I guess at 52 I need to stop hoping for miracles .	-1
This stuff is terrible . It makes my skin break out because it leaves a waxy residue on your face after you wash it off that clogs my pores . Also , the `` microbeads '' are a joke - you can barely tell they 're there and they do n't help exfoliate at all . Worst of all is that this scrub is like a gel , and I prefer scrubs that are like a cream . To top it off , it does not `` brighten '' or even out my skin tone at all . I would not buy this garbage again .	-1
I started using this a few years ago . I was on the hunt for a face lotion that had atleast SPF 30 and had light coverage . This seemed perfect . Unfortunately , it 's too dry to really be a moisturizer . I find I have to use a serum ( which I would use anyways at 34 ) , a base lotion , then this on top for the spf coverage . I do n't hate this product . But there are some drawbacks : Cons : I have combo skin , oily on forehead and t-zone , but dry on cheecks . This is not moisturizing enough.Feels heavyGets REALLY greasyVery thick , almost like a foundation.BURNS MY EYES TERRIBLY . I ca n't use this around my eyes at all . I put it on with a foundation brush I lightly dab around the eye area . If I am in a hurry and just rub it on , it 'll burn my eyes the rest of the day . ( I do n't wear contacts or anything . ) Also , if you are outside and sweating it 'll run into your eyes and sting.Seems to sit on top of the skin , instead of blending in.Has no anti-aging properties . Thought the soybeans would even skin tone or brighten ... something ! Nothing.Pros : Good coverage . I stopped using foundation when I started using this.Convienent pump bottle that locks for traveling.Size of the bottle will last FOREVER . One pump and your good to go . If you use more than this , YOU WILL BE GREASY.Good for every day use . When I know I am going to be out in the sun all day , I use a 50 spf zinc cream . ( I 'm fair and burn easily . ) I started using this when I was pregnant with # 4 . I know hormones do crazy things , but I got a horrible pregnancy mask while using this in the sun . I know masks are caused by hormones , but the sun accensenuates them . While I do n't burn with this product , ( I might get a little red , but not fry ) this did not protect against the sun enough . Last winter , I watched my mask fade . When the summer hit ( after the baby was 9 months old ) I would go back in the sun and it brought my mask out again in full force . I think this does n't shield enough from the sun.I am currently looking for another lotion that has SPF and color that is n't greasy & wo n't sting my eyes . I have only continued to use this because most tinted moisturizers with spf are the same price for only 1.5 - 2 ounces . So price wise , this is a bargain.Also , I let my Mom try it & she said her eyes were tearing up constantly and burning as well . ( She does wear contacts & does n't have sensitive skin . )	-1
Ok , i love aveeno products but this is a total FAIL ! ! And a waste of $ $ for that matter . I 'm on a budget , and i was looking for something budget-friendly from a drug store . After all the hype about this product , i decided to give it a try . First of all , the scent was overbearing , too greasy , my skin is combination/oily , and this made it worse ! ! I was extremely oily all day even make-up did n't help . I also developed a rash on my T-zone . I 'm a very patient person so i stuck with it for a month before dumping it ! Started using St.ives and so happy with the results not to mention the price is 2 less for what i paid for this junk ! Too bad i wo n't get my hard earned $ $ back !	-1
They are a quite big so i cut them in half to get more use out of it . I would use this 2-3 times a week for the past couple of months and have not seen any improvement . If anything i broke out slightly more , nothing major . Not worth it my opinion .	-1
Just for background information : I have very fair , sensitive skin . I 've been using the Aveeno Ultra Calming moisturizer for several years , and while I like it since it does n't break me out , it does n't provide the extra bit of moisture that my skin sometimes requires . This past summer , I used the tinted Positively Radiant moisturizer , and I was satisfied with it - it provided a nice amount of tint and moisture , and for the first time ever , I even got compliments on my skin . So , when the skin on my cheeks started to get quite dry a few weeks ago , I researched a multitude of products , and after reading review after review , I decided to give this product a try since I 'd had luck with Aveeno in the past ( I also had a coupon , which did n't hurt , either ) . I used a very small amount when I first got the moisturizer home , and it seemed okay - there was a smell that was a little strong , but it eventually went away , and my skin looked dewier and healthier . About an hour later , I began to notice a bit of itching on my face , but it would come and go and was n't all that intense , and I figured that it was just the dry skin rearing its head again.The next day , I used a small amount of the moisturizer again , and in short order , the itching returned , and grew progressively worse during the day . Unfortunately , since I was at work , I did n't have the means available to wash my face or anything , so I had to basically suffer for several hours . Meanwhile , I started to notice that a small amount of redness had begun to appear through my foundation . I was n't overly worried ; as soon as I got home , I washed everything off my face , and apart from some residual redness , everything seemed relatively okay . By the next morning , though , things were decidedly not okay . When I woke up , my face was bright red and itching unbearably . I tried using cool water to rinse my face , in the hopes that it would alleviate some of the itching , but once the water hit my skin , my face started burning.That was yesterday morning , and even as I type this , my face is incredibly red , itchy , burning , and peeling . To make matters worse , my skin has broken out from forehead to chin in innumerable bumps . Given my past positive experiences with Aveeno products , I certainly did not expect this to happen , but this moisturizer has burned my skin like nothing else I 've ever used.This product has myriad positive reviews on many different websites - I think that , if your skin is n't of the sensitive variety , this product might work very well for you . However , I have to caution anyone who has even the slightest bit of skin sensitivity against using this moisturizer . Whether it 's the amount of SPF , the fragrance , one of the other ingredients , or a combination of any of these factors , this product has given me the worst experience I 've ever had with a face product .	-1
I had one of these decades ago when I blow dryed my hair and used hot rollers -- I thought the towel was great . I recently bought another , as my hair is very long and naturally curly ( it has to air dry ) . First of all , this towel will not stay twisted in a turban while I put on moisturizer , etc. , and second , it soaks up so much moisture that my hair dries frizzy ( even with product on it ) . I 'm dissappointed with my purchase , and would not recommend this to anyone with naturally curly hair that need to be air dried .	-1
I was extremely disappointed in this microfiber hair towel . It is too small to wrap around my head and wet hair after I shower . It lacks the absorbancy to get the water out of my hair and it needs to be washed carefully . Overall is this is an overpriced product . A regular cotton terry cloth towel does a better job for far less money . I feel suckered by the marketing on this .	-1
Sometimes you get what you pay for . This is one of those cases . There 's no lint on the back that would cause it to overheat or anything . One day it just started switching to a warm/cool setting even though it was set to hot . As time went on , it just does n't even get hot anymore at all , warm at best . I had this less than 1 year and always kept the back cleared of lint so this is just a junk product . I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because it does come with attachments that similarly priced dryers do n't usually come with , and there 's a removable cover thing on the lint trap in the back that makes it way easier to clean , you can remove it and wash it off in the sink in 2 seconds . But it does n't work long so do n't expect much .	-1
I have really thick , hard to curl , dry , asian hair . This iron did not work for me at all . The iron did not get hot enough to do anything . I guess it would work if I did small one-inch sections , but I have so much hair , it 's just not worth the time . The waves it did create were fizzy and ugly.My friend , who has thin hair , uses this iron all the time and it works great.I recommend the Hot Tools Deep Waver . It worked a lot better on my hair and created well defined waves .	-1
It made my hands smell so manly . I could't get enough on my hands or get it to go in my hands . It makes my hands shiny and greasy but still feeling not moisturized . My hands were covered in a thin layer of it just sitting on top . From all the great reviews i thought it 'd be wonderful but I was so wrong . It could work for others ! My skin could just be an exception .	-1
nice packagingnice smell and texture.But if you are having difficulty falling sleep problem , this product dose not promote sleep . At least for me it dose not work much . I need to go and take lorazpam ! Since I paid for it , I use it as kind of face moisturizer on my face before sleep : ) ) )	-1
I was really hoping that this product would work for me . Unfortunately this product did not do anything at all for me .	-1
Really dry and ca n't get anything out of the tin box with finger . Do n't know if I received an old batch or what ...	-1
gives the lips a bit tint , i dont like the strong smell though , smells like the lipsticks from the 80's./ not a lipstick , but this is a gloss with tint so dont misunderstood that , stick is hard , and dont glide easy , like an old stock , maybe it is . : /	-1
I really hoped this would have worked , but unfortunately it was a let down . I have mildly curly and thick hair ( but not coarse ) . I straighten my hair almost daily . I tried all the tools and still hated it ! It does n't even get hot , even when left for about 10 minutes . The straightener SUCKS ! The crimper is even worse ... no matter how long you hold it , how small the section of hair , or even the amount of hairspray put in before using it ... .it would n't do the job ... just wave it the tiniest ... .making it look like my natural hair anyway . The curlers are n't impressing either . Seriously , I 'm better off using my mother 's hair tools from the 80s ... ..I would throw this thing out , but my mother bought me this for Christmas only a couple months ago .	-1
Even with the suggested heat-up time , it would never reach a temp high enough to create anything . Easy to use , and crimp plates were wide , if you do insist on buying . Too good to be true .	-1
I like the aveeno day moisturizer very much so thought will give this soap a try . But it made the skin very very dry . On top of it started getting more acne . So discontinued using . I got a pack of 3 . My husband uses the aveeno face wash and really likes it . Since 2 more soaps were left over and also each and every person skin type and tolerance level are different . We thought he would try using it . But it made him break out immediately . He skin is normal and never had problem with breakouts . So that is it.. We thrashed it and never thought about buying again .	-1
I bought these for the mild acne on my chin and for convenience sake I mean , cleanser and exfoliater in one pad , plus great reviews AND a decent price , sounded great . Well , I used these at night for one week and these evil little pads ruined my face . I had and still have little red bumps all over my forehead and cheeks like my skin was burned off ! I have n't used the pads in 2 days now , but my skin is still very dry , even peeling in some spots and the bumps are still there . Oh and my acne is still there too.No , I have n't changed anything else in my skincare routine either.I 've NEVER had skin problems before , besides the above mentioned mild acne on my chin , so seeing red bumps all over my face was a little frightening . Hopefully they 'll go away soon..I like Aveeno , I really do , so this is very disappointing , if I could give this zero stars I would .	-1
My skin was relatively clear except for some acne on my jawline . I had been using Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Night Moisturizer and it was working wonders . I switched to this product when I noticed the Neutrogena Moisturizer was n't reducing the jawline acne as much as I wanted and I wanted to try a less expensive night time moisturizer since my face had mostly balanced out.Terrible mistake ! I stuck with this product for about a week , to at least give it a chance , but the acne became increasingly worse ! Eventually with 5-7 new break outs a day ! I stopped and switch back to my Neutrogena Moisturizer , however , the acne this moisturizer caused left me with damaged skin . It 's been about a week and a half since I used Aveeno Clear Complexion and I my face is just starting to lose the large , red post-pimple marks . The Aveeno Clear Complexion , during the week of use , caused my pores to become larger and release a lot of oil throughout the day . I 'm switching back to Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair .	-1
I did n't order this product from the seller , I actually picked it up at a local Walmart , they sell this product in a lot of drug stores and such too.It 's in a nice pump bottle that you twist to lock and unlock it to prevent it from spoiling prematurely . The smell is actually quite pleasant , it 's a clean fresh scent . When you pump it on your skin it 's not runny , it 's pretty thick . It 's also has more benefits than any other western bb creams I saw at the store . ( The highest amount of sunscreen and whitening properties ) It 's very dry feeling so it 's perfect for oily skin , and my skin feels somewhat moisturized after use.However.Like most Western makeup , this has an orange tint to it . I myself am pale , ghost pale . I have to mix my own makeup pale . ( makeup forever 's lightest shade is orange on me , the only thing that somewhat works is loreal true match in porcelain ) It leaves my face very orange . This product is not for people who have trouble with fair to light make up looking orange on them.Also , I do n't like that is has glitter in it . At first I did n't notice it , I thought it was just a dewy finish , but when I looked back at my fingers they were covered in glitter.I feel like maybe if this matched my skin i would appreciate it more , because it does n't break me out.If you 're looking for a lighter western bb cream I recently tried macs new bb cream primer in light , and that blended perfectly and made my pores look smaller and face softer . It 's a bit more creamy/sheer , but it makes your skin perfect to put makeup on and it really does make it look flawless .	-1
I 've been using this product pretty steady for about 6 months or longer and have n't noticed any change in my complexion . Not really much positive feedback I have for this product .	-1
This product is not what I expected . I 'd never used a BB cream before , so I guess I was n't sure what to expect , but this cream does nothing for me . It actually makes my skin feel greasy and does n't do what the description says . I would not purchase again . Not worth the money .	-1
I have been trying to develop a skin care routine and was looking for a good moisturizer . I have oily acne prone skin and this made my skin burn and break out even worse . My face is red and dry now because of this . Cystic acne is not fun to deal with and this brought out too many cysts around my chin and cheeks . My face was doing great , clearing up before this . Waste of my money , but I guess it 's all about trial and error . I take my time when adding a new product to my skincare routine so that I know if its going to break me out or not ,	-1
Tried it for two weeks : I did n't see any difference in my face and it was a little thick when applied . It also leaves a slight sheen that I do n't care for . I 'm sure the 0.5 Salicylic Acid is good for sensitive skin .	-1
My breakouts had gotten worse just a few weeks ago , so I picked this product up from CVS . I adore Aveeno products , such as their haircare and their lotions ... . so I had high hopes for this . I used it that night in the shower , and when I got out , my face felt like I had a horrible sunburn . I looked in the mirror , and it not only felt burned , but looked it too ! I 'd be lying if I said it did n't scare me . I 've never had a product do that , and I 've tried A LOT of things ... not to mention my skin is n't 'sensitive ' , aside from breaking out . I decided to give it another chance , used less product and rinsed it quicker than I had before . It made my face slightly red , but it did n't feel like sunburn . I figured it was just a one time thing , and let it go . I used this face wash for well over a month before I gave up . It did n't help clear my current breakouts , nor did it stop new ones from sprouting . If anything , I felt like my face was more oily than it 's ever been , due to this , I 've been using baking soda to get my skin back on track . So far , the baking soda is working ... then I 'm going back to my Clean and Clear .	-1
I learned after buying this bar , that if you have sensitive skin or trouble with acne , you should try to steer clear of anything in BAR form . Now , I 'm not sure if this was the bar 's fault or if my skin is just having a field day being irritating , but my skin got worse using this product . I normally love Aveeno , but this is not for me.Good luck !	-1
I wanted this to work so badly since it 's natural but it did n't do anything for my acne . It 's a waste of money .	-1
I bought this sometime ago , the one star says I hate it . I do n't , it just did not work out for me .	-1
I used to buy this product at drugstores and was glad to find it again . BUT the teeth are falling out of mine - many on the bathroom floor with each use . It will soon be without teeth altogether and useless . Next time I 'll pay more and hpoefully get a better product ! !	-1
This is by far the worst thing I have ever put in my hair . I have long wavy hair , and I made sure it was dry and brushed before using this product . I put a small segment of hair on the brush ( despite the fact that after 30 minutes of heating , it was barely warm ) , and when I wrapped a strand of hair around the brush twice , I could NOT get the hair out . It tangled and held on to my hair so tightly , I even considered cutting it off ! Eventually after 20 minutes of struggle , I was able to free my hair . I immediately returned it to the drug store where I purchased it and even wrote a review on the remaining products on the shelves with a sharpie , directly on the packaging to warn other people ( see customer posted images ) . Do n't purchase this if you care about your hair .	-1
You get what you pay for ... it 's in my trash can . I 've never used one of these before and never will again.I got the thing so tangled in my hair and almost thought I was going to have to cut my hair at the scalp to get it out.This is for short hair only ! ! !	-1
This HOT BRUSH does not curl is basically a piece of junk . Not an adequate hair curler . Get a real hair curler and use with oil treatments so your hair does not dry out .	-1
this hot brush is not good as the brand name . it 's not curl your hair and made from cheap material . I used it just only one time and put it in the closet .	-1
I have very long hair , well past mid-back but not quite to my waist . So , the majority of you with shorter hair will likely have different results that I did . But , this brush immediately tangled for me . And my hair got so entwined and stuck in this brush it took about three minutes for me to untangle it and free myself from the brush . The bristles were n't the main driver , it was the small seam between the plastic handle and plastic tip , and the metal body . Very surprising that these are n't sealed better to prevent this . Once my hair got tangled in those gaps , it inevitably got tangled in the bristles too . Maybe I just got a bad one , but really ca n't recommend this for those with long hair : (	-1
I have medium volume straight long hair so I though the 3/4 inch will work better . How wrong I was . The spikes on this brush are so short that they can barely grasp my hair . Very hard to use and does not curl hair effectively . I get better curls with a flat hot iron then this product . Not recommended .	-1
I have only used it twice in the past year . When I used it it did nothing for my hair and also there was black stuff coming out in my hair . I think it was melted plastic ...	-1
I do n't think this brush gets as hot as it should with all the different settings it had . I cranked it up and it does not get hot enough to style my naturally wavy hair . I will be donating to someone with hair that requires less heat to style .	-1
THIS ITEM DOES N'T DO ANYTHING FOR MY HAIR . I WISH I HAD NEVER BOUGHT IT . I WILL CONTINUE MY SEARCH FOR A BETTER ONE .	-1
I loved the idea of this curling brush , and the size . However , it just did n't get got enough to curl or allow a curl to stay for my 4A/B hair . I am 100 % natural with very fine , dense , shoulder length hair , and wear my hair straight styled most of the time . Usually I use my SuperStar flat iron to curl by flipping the ends , it never causes damage or fries my hair and the the curls and style will last all day with those . I got this because I thought it would be a nice option and I could have curls more round and softer . Granted , I 'm comparing a $ 100 flat iron to a $ 10 curling iron , , but I have used drugstore curling irons ( e.g . Revlon ) successfully too , and unfortunately , this product just did n't get hot enough to hold a style . On the highest heat setting , it felt like the temperature only got to about 285 . I would n't recommend this if your hair prefers a professional level of heat ( 325-450 ) to hold a curl all day in very curly hair . I ended up donating mine to Goodwill after a week of failed attempts at styles . It would be nice if you could see the actual temperature the iron is heating up to instead of just number settings , but I guess for $ 10 I cant complain too much and am glad it works for others . : )	-1
Hard bristles do not catch hair , so why do companies not understand this ? Also , this is just a heated brush . It is NOT an air brush .	-1
Plus I 've burned myself several times . I did n't read thoroughly enough and thought I was buying a blow-dry type tool . I should have returned it , but I needed something and do n't see anything I like this barrel size . I 'd like to see a brush bristle tool ( boars hair ) with the plastic & # 34 ; teeth ' interspersed to add strength and hair-holding power in a blow-dryer wand type tool this size . Would anyone else ?	-1
The barrel is too large and cumbersome for those with fine long hair : ( Had to return it for this reason . The unit itself looks and feels cheap as well . However , I bought the 3/4 inch one as I thought the size worked better for my long and fine hair .	-1
I bought it and never used it . however It gives a nice volume . But if you are looking for curls or waves , this is not the tool . It just gives a slight wave and if you want that then it 's a good tool.its good for traveling but i never take it with me when i travel	-1
I followed the directions and it just does n't keep my hair curled . I have thicker hair but I tried only a small section and that did n't stay either . : ( I would love to use hot rollers instead of a curling iron but they do n't ever seem to work !	-1
This is terrible . I did n't like the out come at all . It does not heat up enough . Noting special . The roller is only 5 so i ordered more 5 roller . But the problem is it 's not good result .	-1
I bought this set to replace a set of jumbo rollers by BabyBliss . The case looks identical and the rollers are exactly the same . However , these rollers take about 10 minutes to fully heat and never really get hot enough . The plastic clips do n't hold my hair very well and are too bulky to pack in a suitcase . If I had it to do over again , I would n't purcahse these rollers .	-1
These jumbo rollers are very easy and convenient to use , the box is small and light , so you can definitely take them with you on your trips . However , there is one thing you need to know before you purchase this product : it is completely useless on long and thick hair . I have tried heating them for over an hour and leaving them on my hair for over 2 hours . Still , when I take them off , there would n't be a slightest hint of a curl in my hair . My hair is naturally wavy , but after using these curlers , it would actually get straighter.I have tried using them on dry hair , slightly wet hair , right after washing my hair , two days after washing my hair , with or without product - all to no avail . I have tried using them on only half of my hair , as some readers have recommended but the result is still a slightly straighter hair and no trace of a curl.So if your hair is long and thick , this is definitely not a product for you .	-1
I have a ton of fine hair that has a natural wave . It did not curl my hair and i left them in until they were completely cool . Disappointment . I gave it 2/5 stars because maybe it 's my hair type that 's the problem , not the product . I just would not recommend it since I did not have success . : (	-1
These rollers are 1.5 '' thick and are too large for my thin , straight , long hair . They do n't curl my hair enough . They do add volume and make my ends curly but I wanted a bit more curl . The deal-breaker is the clips though . They hold the hair well , but the creases look horrible . I end up throwing my hair up into a ponytail just to hide the creases ... what is the point of that ! ? I will be returning these .	-1
I received this item on time . Well , I should rephrase . I received something I did n't order on time and in great condition ! I received a product in the Sun Kissed Caramels line of products when I ordered an ASH brown . Ash is not caramel . I 'm scared to use it and guess what ? I CA N'T RETURN IT BECAUSE APPARENTLY IT 'S HAZARDOUS . I will , however , enjoy the conditioner that was included and might consider re-purposing the developer . Just not with a caramel color . Caveat emptor , you wo n't get what you ordered . Fail , Amazon .	-1
I have never dyed my hair before so I had the requisite virgin hair . It is a soft black and I really wanted the color lifted rather than bleached to a brown color . I wanted to stay away from bleach because I did not want my hair to turn orange.Prior to dyeing , I did n't wash my hair for a day . I followed the instructions . I wanted a subtle ombre effect so I only applied the dye from chin length to the ends . I left it on for 30 minutes . The effect was so subtle , I could barely tell anything had been done to my hair ! Having gotten over my fear of dye , the next day I went on a dye rampage ( not advisable given the fact that no professional has ever colored my hair - I just watched a lot of Youtube videos ) .I wanted to stay with the ash/cooler dyes to avoid the orange effect so I chose the L'oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown . I washed my hair first with a clarifying shampoo , blowdried then followed the directions . The color lifted at least two shades of brown , which was good.But I did n't stop there . I then washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo , blowdried , then applied Garnier Olia 6.3 light golden brown ( which , by the way smells amazing . The L'Oreal has ammonia and made my nose run and my eyes burn ) . It made it darker . Not good.So I washed my hair again with a clarifying shampoo , blowdried , then applied another layer of the L'oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown . My hair was the right shade of subtle dark brown . I love the effect of my soft black hair 's subtle gradation to the brown from roots to tips.If you 're fearing for the damage to my hair , you 're not alone . I figure 20+ years of no chemical processes and then 4 box dyes in 24 hours should balance each other out . Anyway , I applied the Pantene overnight miracle to my hair and now my hair feels even softer than before.The next day my hair lightened even more so it is now a rich chocolate brown.Final verdict : If I had to do it all over again - I would have skipped this one and just used the L'Oreal sun-kissed caramels UL61 hi-lift ash brown the first time around .	-1
I usually use the 6G or 6-1/2G , but it was unavailable , so I thought just the normal brown instead of the golden brown would be ok to just do my roots . For whatever reason , this stuff just did n't do the job in covering the gray or blending the roots . Also gives my hair a greenish cast . I 've been using Loreal haircolor for years and I bounce between Excellence and Preference , and the 2 brown shades I mentioned . I will never deviate again .	-1
This is the phoniest haircolor I have ever used . Been coloring my hair for a few years now for the & # 34 ; grays & # 34 ; and this is the worst . Looks like it 's painted on , and & # 34 ; dark brown & # 34 ; apparently means black . Totally fake look . Ca n't wait until it fades and goes away . Beware . It 's not very good . Many better , more natural looking options available these days .	-1
L'oreal makes many hair color brands , The Superior preference brand is just TERRIBLE to apply . It is extra runny and watery . I could not stop the dripping and I have been coloring my hair for 20 years . I 'm very careful and do it in sections but this is not a cream type like the excellence is . It was literally dripping off my gloves after I put it in my hair . I never had a problem with any other hair color product and not even by L'oreal . This formula is way too watery ! ! ! I never had so much drip to the floor ever before.Always buy the cream kind , or the mouse . This stuff is terrible ! ! : ( I swear the good reviews must be for the L'Oreal Paris Excellence Preference and not this . The boxes look almost the same.Boo on how runny it is ! ! ! !	-1
I was able to do this on my own . I ca n't say it was easy ... cause I stained some of bathroom cabinets.At first , my hair color came out SUPER dark . After a few days , my color starting getting lighter and lighter . Now , I like the color on my hair ... but it was n't the color I originally intended to get from the box.I would purchase this product again but in a lighter shade and have someone else color it for me .	-1
It wo n't give you the colour that shows on , or at the back of the box . not even close ! I have medium ash brown hair and the only reason I dye my hair is because of my grey hairs . I just used an & # 34 ; ash & # 34 ; shade of this hair colour to dye my roots and now my roots has an awful copper/red shine , and it does n't look & # 34 ; ash & # 34 ; brown at all ! It has orange undertone : ( I am so upset , and recommend you not to use this product at all ! Do n't even try it or you would regret like me .	-1
Alot of hairdressers claim that loreal is one of the harshest dyes to use on your hair . Evidence of that was in my family when both my brother and sister with continued use of this started having major hair loss . They stopped using it and there hair loss stopped also . you be the judge .	-1
I 've been very discouraged lately at the changes in hair color . It used to last much longer , and the color was better . This time I tried Medium Auburn , and it said to leave it in for 20 minutes . I left it in for 45 minutes just to be sure , and there 's barely any color . My hair is soft and shiny , I 'll give it one star for that . But I could get these same results using a deep conditioner , and it is FAR too expensive for that . I guess I 'm going to have to get brave and graduate to henna .	-1
The color is pretty , but no where near the color on the box . It is a mahogany/red color . Much deeper and quite red . There is NO gold . I am disappointed with how dark and how red the color is . The grey covered very well ( which is why it gets 2 stars instead of 1 ) . I do n't really like the formulation -- the gel colorant is quite drippy . I also like that it only takes 25 minutes to process . I might try it again if I had confidence about the color choice .	-1
I have dark reddish/brown hair and wanted to dye it blonde for a change . I chose this brand because the before photo on the box appeared to match my hair the closest and the after photo best matched the shade of blonde I wanted to be . I applied this brand to my hair and it did absolutely nothing . It says on the directions to leave it in for 25 minutes . I was n't noticing a change so I left it in for an hour . I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because the conditioner smells amazing and it left my hair feeling very soft . Too bad the dye does n't work .	-1
I did not notice the tightening feeling that other users described . I use this in conjunction with my Olay recommended regimen . I did not have any noticeable reduction in fine lines . My pores were not refined.It gets one star for keeping my face more moisturized than not using it.It gets another star for not making my face break out like the daily moisturizer my regimen wanted me to use four times a day .	-1
I did n't like this . It seems very watery and my face always felt wet after using it . I did n't see any changes , so given the price , I wo n't buy it again .	-1
I have used almost all of the jar and my wrinkles dont look any better . In fact , I think they look worse . It does moisturize well but its too expensive for that .	-1
I have been using the product for 4 months and have been applying it to my face every night before bed.PROS : Has a nice clean smell , moisturizes very well , makes my skin feel smooth , gets rid of dry spots . Also , a little goes a long way . I still have 1/3 of the product left after 4 months.CONS : Did not tighten/firm my skin whatsover . Did not prevent or smooth out any wrinkles as I noticed new wrinkles over time , and the smile wrinkles I have got worse and are more noticeable now . Lastly , this product made my skin look and feel VERY OILY . I do n't like wearing the product around other people as the shininess is embarrassing.This cream is basically good as a moisturizer if you have dry skin , but is n't really good for anything else . I ca n't say I 'd recommend it , but looking at how other people have rated this , there is still a good chance that it could work well for you .	-1
I purchased this as I love Olay regineris . I was hoping this would be similar . It is nothing more then a night cream . While it is thick and creamy it did n't do anything to firm my skin , diminish fine lines or even out my skin tone . Disappointing	-1
I really do n't see any difference using products such as this on me . If I had , Olay would be my preferred brand . Do n't waste your money , just buy a good moisturizer and cleaner .	-1
I applied Olay Total Effects one time . I thought the scent was strong , but hoped that it would dissipate in a few minutes . Wrong . I had to wash my face and hands - twice - to get rid of the stink . And I do mean stink - overwhelming fake floral yukkiness . Like perfume that costs $ 1.99 for 16 oz . at Walmart.If artificial fragrances bother you , give this one a pass .	-1
READ INGREDIENTS . THE HIGHER THE ZINC , THE MORE PROTECTION.Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one , blocks both UVA ( 320-400 nm ) and UVB ( 280-320 nm ) rays of ultraviolet light . Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks . ZO is insoluble in water , used in many industries , in ointments , creams and lotions . Non-irritating , non-allergenic and non-comedogenic , used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts . ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm , when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body , do not enter the bloodstream , and are not a threat to human health.SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream . If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes , for example , a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes . While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn , UVA rays damage the skin 's DNA at a deeper layer . Both radiation types can cause skin cancer . The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf . For that reason , when I purchase a sunscreen mix , I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose , I bump the zinc . Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection . The more zinc , the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to EVCO.Blue Lizard Baby- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Chemical-Free- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- 10 % Zinc Oxide ; 5 % Titanium DioxideBlue Lizard Face- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- Oil-Free- 8 % Zinc OxideBlue Lizard Sensitive- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Chemical-Free- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- 10 % Zinc Oxide ; 5 % Titanium DioxideBlue Lizard Sport- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Very Water Resistant- 6 % Zinc OxideBlue Lizard Regular- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Very Water Resistant- 6 % Zinc OxideNot a Paraben Free formula . The inactive ingredients are extensive in Blue Lizard , check their Internet site but more importantly compare the cost of any sunscreen to better brands with hardly any ingredients except few organic and a very high amount of zinc like 18 % zinc not 5 % or 10 % zinc . Blue Lizard 's ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives , less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation . Cancer does not differentiate face skin or leg skin , it is all the same so why apply anything that has less protection to different part of the body . Ingredients get soaked in regardless of the skin location so compare ingredients since it is like consuming those ingredients when applied to the skin . A good organic 3oz 18 % zinc mix should not cost more than $ 13 and for less when on sale . I get lots more when I make my own , much , much more and I get to control the zinc percentage in the mix as well .	-1
I 've written off Barielle as the most high priced gimmick products I 've ever tried . This does n't do a darned thing . It 's greasy , oily , and if it worked , I 'd deal with it , but it does nothing . I 'm sick that I spent the money . Do n't spend yours on this . There 's another product sold here on Amazon called Carmichel 's Cuticle Cream . I 've used that for 20 years or so and it does work . I was experimenting again , and I should know better . So I bought two little tubs of Carmichaels ( or Carmichel 's ) and my nails are better again . I just do n't know how this brand stays in business . They wo n't be getting mine again , that 's for sure .	-1
With all the great reviews , I thought once again I would try something to help my nails grow . I applied the cream 3 to 4 times a day . I even took my polish off , hoping that would help . My nails are now more of a mess than when I started . I am truly disappointed .	-1
I bought these awhile back and wrote a favorable review on them , but they seem to have become useless somehow . I used to get nice bouncy curls , but now the rollers do n't hold heat and when I unroll my hair it comes out frizzy , fuzzy and kinky . I was shocked because they used to work so well . I 've taken good care of my set , I never leave it on or forget to turn it off for long periods , and I ca n't imagine it wearing out so quickly , especially because I only use them maybe twice a week . I will not be buying another set , I think I 'm going with the BabyLiss hot rollers this time.P.S . They only come with three clips .	-1
I have used electric curlers for 25 years and this is the worst product I have ever purchased . Extreme heat in 75 seconds ? Lie ! How about mediocre heat in 10 minutes ! Do n't waste your money . Also the clips are terrible and DO NOT secure the curler . Just bad all around .	-1
This product did n't work for me , but that 's not to say it will not work for you . My issues with this product was that I burned my fingers each time I tried to put the roller in my hair , you only get a few clips with the product and they did n't work very well -- At least they did n't work well for me . I gave this product away and even that person did n't want it . I may be a fan of some Conair products , just not this one .	-1
I rarely ever return items because it 's such a hassle . But this , is being returned immediately . The idea is actually very good- it has a side heater to heat up the clips as well as the rollers , a feature I 've never seen before . However , the clips do not hold- at least not in my long hair . No matter how many times I tried , the rollers would always fall out within a few seconds . Even when I stayed completely still ( very difficult when putting in the remaining rollers ) they would still fall out . They never stayed in long enough for me to see how well the curlers worked .	-1
Is plastic getting expensive ? Because the plastic that the hinged cover on this is made out of is SO THIN ... I would describe it as `` fragile . '' In fact , there 's already a small crack on one side.The on/off switch was also faulty - I had to jiggle it back and forth to get it to turn on initially . It would only stay on if I kept the switch positioned in the middle.This is by FAR the poorest quality set of hot rollers I have ever bought.I only gave it two stars because it DID heat up evenly , and the rollers themselves would be nice in a better `` house . `` Thank goodness the switch was faulty and part of it arrived cracked , since you can return defective items and not pay for the return shipping on Amazon !	-1
I found these difficult to use unless your into burning your hands . After one use they now reside on my closet shelf until I make my next trip to the GoodWill .	-1
I 'm not sure what the exact issue is , but these rollers only curl the bottom of my hair . Maybe 4-5 inches . I suspect this is because they do not get hot enough . The clips are not the worst ever , but they are a pain . They look like they will be nice , but they do n't hold the hair quite as tight as I would like , and they leave a dent every . single . time . My stylist recommended hot rollers to me , saying they are the best way to get a curl that lasts all day , but the curls I get from this barely last an hour . I do n't mean that after an hour the curl is a little limp , I mean after an hour my hair looks like it did before I curled it at all . I have hair that is naturally a little wavy , I usually have no trouble holding a curl . I even used Redken spray starch will is great for holding curls , but still no luck . I 'm very disappointed.Also , I noticed a very recent reviewer complained her set did not have an on/off switch . Mine does have this switch . A big one right on front that you could n't miss . Are there two different models they are shipping at random ? That is a problem .	-1
I purchased this some time ago , but when new , for some reason I never used it.Pulled it out of the cabinet to try it again , and only ONE curler heated up.So whatever I paid for it , it did n't work .	-1
It makes the skin feel hydrated but i ca n't get it to sud enough , even after much rubbing of the bar onto my rough bath sponge , to wash even just 1/4 of my body before the suds completely dissapearing . I know that glycerine bars do n't sud like soap bars but this is rediculous !	-1
I purchased this soap for the sole reason that it was supposed to be `` jasmine '' . It 's not even close to that fragrance . However , it 's still a glycerin bar of soap so I will use it but it is falsely labeled as jasmine .	-1
NOTE : After checking this out again at the store , the soap reviewed below is actually the BLUEBERRY soap by `` Clearly Natural . `` I would n't normally review a bar of soap -- after all -- what 's there to review , but this bar is an exception . Perhaps the doors of perception will differ for others , but the jasmine soap has a peculiar odor.While usually a fan of Clearly Natural products , something went wrong here . I think , frankly , that it smells like poop . Seriously . And that 's not exactly the `` scent '' I want when taking a shower . Another person in the family likens it to bathroom cleanser . To each his or her own , but I recommend another soap `` flavor . ''	-1
It was difficult to choose which of these Clearly Natural soaps to purchase , but I finally settled on honeysuckle . I do n't use bar soap anymore , body wash or shower gel tends to be my preference , but I was drawn to Clearly Natural because of the cost and the fact that it claims to be a natural glycerin soap.I 've used the unscented glycerin soap and I like it , but this one ? I 'm just not sure . I 'm not sure that it is as pure and natural as it is claimed to be . It was extremely drying and somewhat harsh on my sensitive skin . It is a brilliant yellow , which indicates a fair amount of dyes in it . And the fragrance ? It is a bit too perfumed for my liking . Honeysuckle is supposed to be a light floral scent , but this soap is scented strongly . I ca n't explain it but it is migraine-worthy . There is no humectant in the glycerin which also left me an unhappy camper ... and I do n't like to write bad reviews . I thought glycerin soaps were meant to be soothing and gentle , but this one is just not my favorite by a long shot.I definitely wo n't repurchase this soap in honeysuckle , but maybe I 'll try the aloe vera one . As mentioned previously , I also like the unscented version because it contains no dyes or perfumes . The unscented one is clear/transparent and full of natural , skin-loving ingredients unlike the honeysuckle one . The packaging is somewhat eco-friendly and at least the product is inexpensive so even if you do n't like it , there will be no guilt about throwing money away .	-1
I thought we 'd upgrade our home clippers and get these since they seemed a little better quality than the ones we already . They did not cut cleanly , I had to go over the same spot many times . These also vibrated so loudly that it hurt my hubby 's hearing and I had to return them .	-1
I know this masque has a cult following in the beauty community , and that is what has inspired me to try it so many times over the years . My skin is very sensitive and while I have used dozens of other clay masques with no issues , the mint oil in this one sets my face on fire . I ca n't even keep it on for 60 seconds because it is so painful . There have been a few times where I toughed it out and ended up with red , angry , itchy , irritated skin that lasted for days afterwards . This has also caused me to break out , something I have never experienced with another masque . I think most people probably wo n't have any sort of reaction to this , but if you have sensitive skin I caution you to really think about whether this is a good product for you . At the very least , do a patch test before putting it over your whole face .	-1
I used this once before.. it dried out my face quite a bit.. And Look at the ingredients this item contains methylparaben ! All paraben 's are bad for your skin and are known to cause cancer . Its is in many makeups and its slowly being taken out of the products we use . try to find something with more natural ingredients that WONT give you skin cancer .	-1
Check the ingredients , do your research . One of them is Methyl paraben combines benzoic acid with the methyl group of chemicals ... Highly toxic , you do n't want to be letting parabens absorb in your face ! And anything with unnatural coloring and fragrance is really not good for your face .	-1
I do n't get the hype . I have sensitive and dry skin , maybe it 's not good for my skin type . This thing burns and then I see no results . I 've used this mask about 4 or 5 times . Boooo !	-1
i had high expectations for this mask after i heard so many good things about it . i was disappointed to find out it really is no miracle solution , at least not for my skin . i have normal skin , a bit dry in the winter , slightly ( not really ) oily in the summer . i have never had acne before this year as a 25 year adult so maybe this mask didnt do anything because adult acne is usually hormonal ? i dont know i am not saying dont try it because very skin is different but it might not work for you . definitely didnt do any of the magic in decreasing the size of pores ( my pores are small but visible on my nose and they were same size after the mask ) or getting rid of blackheads and drawing the impurities to the surface . just didnt do anything in particular so still looking for that miracle solution but to those who found it , congrats	-1
I have used this clay mask several times and it never helped me . It did n't do anything for my face or my acne . I have oily , sensitive acne prone skin and all it did was burn the hell out of my face and turn it red . It may work for some , but did n't work for me .	-1
Did n't really do much to clear my skin . I have pretty clear skin but occasionally breakout ; I tried this on a breakout and it did n't really have any effect at all . It feels and smells nice but that 's pretty much all I can say .	-1
it 's okay i bought this off of a youtube review lets just say not everyone has the same skin type	-1
Heard great things about this product , but it is very drying ( combination skin ) and it has paraben.So I will not be using this . They should re-formulate and take out the paraben , it stuff has been banned in Europe .	-1
This product is as close to useless as it can get . It 's a waste of money . First of all , it falsely advertises as it does n't `` peel '' anything . Normally with a face masque of any kind , you will see a remarkable instant `` glowing '' or `` brightening '' of your skin because it deep cleans . This product is too thin to be of any benefit . It does not deep clean and the slightest bit of perspiration will immediately start to dissolve it . After one tube , I would never buy it again and I do not recommend it .	-1
I was trying to replace a peel off mask I had in college over 10 yrs ago but could n't remember the name ; it left my face soft and it was easy to peel off and it didnt have a strong smell , but this product is the opposite . This product is messy to apply and thick , and it takes a long time to dry and I do n't see a difference in my face when I take it off . I left it in the draw with all the other products I do n't really use because they do nothing special . I mean really ! ! !	-1
I read all the time about Aveeno being good for your skin and having locally grown ingredients in & wanted to try it . I was surprised when I received this and you can clearly see it is just Vaseline coming out of the tube and that is exactly what it is . Will never order again because I could have just went to the dollar store and got a tub of Vaseline for $ 2.00	-1
I really need a body wash for my very dry , itchy winter skin . The reviews lead me to purchase this one , but so far it has made no more difference than my other regular body washes . I do n't get it 's appeal . I think I will maybe try something with ceremides perhaps next time . There are limited choices for extra dry skin from what I can see . I do n't think I will repurchase this aveeno not to mention it is NOT sulfate free and I think it 's the sulfates that keep my skin so dry after a shower..	-1
I fully expected to like this . It does make my skin softer , but it creates a sort of film on my skin that then will sort of get gritty and rub off if I rub my hands . It 's slightly waxy . It also seems to rub off on my clothing , which I can see if I 'm wearing black or dark blue . I wonder if it might actually be the `` oat kernel flour '' that does this ? Colloidal oatmeal is a powder . I 'm not going to throw it out , but I 'm not going to buy it again either . I bought this at a local drug store so I ca n't comment on what others have said about the product having been opened or used , except to say that I do n't remember it being sealed in any way .	-1
I have thick hair that tends to get slightly greasy if I do n't wash it everyday so I thought this would work for not washing my hair for a day . Turns out it just made me hair feel heavy and greaser and more unclean . So not for me I guess .	-1
I tried this . It did n't work for me but it might work for others based on all the good reviews it has on amazon . It 's probably only for certain hair types ( maybe shorter and less oily hair ) . My hair gets oily quickly and when I use this the day after a shower , It does n't feel clean . It leaves a sticky feeling in my hair and it still looks oily . It also weighs my hair down . The only plus is it smells nice . Powder dry shampoo may be another option , but I have n't tried that one yet .	-1
Buying this face lotion was not a good idea . Used just a pea-size amount & it sat right on top of my skin . No moisturizing - just whiteness . No , I will not recommend this product to family & friends ; neither will I waste my money purchasing again .	-1
I generally do pretty well with Eucerin products , but unfortunately , this just was n't it . When I first put it on , I noticed the smell , exactly like sunscreen , and my face ( which is already pale ) looked like a ghost . It turned my skin white ! And I reeked of sunscreen.The biggest disappointment from this product was one of its ingredients : sulfate . If you are sensitive to sulfates in the smallest way , this product will definitely dry out your skin . My skin started flaking off after two weeks of using this lotion , and definitely improved when I stopped . Instead of moisturizing it like it claims to do , it did the complete opposite.Overall , this was disappointing . My skin looked flaky , white , and smelled like sunscreen . There are definitely better moisturizers out on the market .	-1
I do n't know how this stuff is getting good ratings . I wore this product today for a few hours today . I noticed my face started itching , turning red and burning . It was odd . It did n't burn or irritate my skin when I first applied . It was fine for a few hours . It was a slow allergic reaction but it was a bad one . My face turned red . My neck and chest turned red . I had to take an antihistamine to calm the itching . It was awful . I thought this product would be the answer to my never ending search for a sensitive skin moisturizer with an SPF of 30 . I was wrong . The product is very white . Chalky . It takes forever to sink in . It does seem to sort of flake off your face after a few hours like another reviewer mentioned . I have used other products that contained zinc and I did not have problems with them . I have dry skin . This product made my skin feel even drier when I was wearing it . I can wear banana boat sport on my face with no problems , but not Eucerin . Go figure . I did not purchase this product on amazon , but I felt the need to give a review because one reviewer suggested that people ignore the low ratings because we must have received a bad batch . I got mine a week ago at walmart so it 's definitely not the same batch . It seems like this product is good for most , but it does irritate some people . If you do n't have sensitive skin , try it . If you are like me and have hyper sensitive skin , stay far away from this product .	-1
This product feels okay on the skin but leaves a highly visible white film on the skin . I 'm not sure if it is apparent on other races but it is very noticeable on African American skin tones . It looks like I 've applied cheap foundation shades too light on my face.I can not wear it outdoors in front of people during the day ( and I 'm cheap ! : ) ) so I use it as my night time moisturizer before bed . Imagine using an SPF moisturizer only to bed ... Will not repurchase once I 've used it all .	-1
The lotion is fine , moisturizing and non-scented but it rubs off in little balls as soon as I put on makeup primer or anything else on my face . It just does not layer well at all . If you need this for bare faced days , then it may be adequate but for a daily moisturizer underneath concealer or even very light makeup , it 's awful.It was the least expensive moisturizer with sunscreen at the drugstore on the plus side .	-1
I did not like it because it left white residue on my face and neck . Plus , my face broke out when I applied it . I was disappointed .	-1
Many of my friends recommended this for me . sadly it does n't work .. It made me break out -tiny pimples- like crazy . I came to the point that any product with sunscreen on it will have the same problem on my skin !	-1
So disappointed . With the Eucerin name I thought this lotion would be really great.Pros : -goes on smooth-feels good on my skin-no break-outs or irritations-no smellCons : -it pills really bad if you rub your face - ICK ! I will not buy again .	-1
Who are these people giving this product 4 and 5 stars ? ! Are they spokespeople or employees of the company ? I bought this product from Walgreens for the expensive price of around $ 13 ( around the same price for two of these here on Amazon ) . I used it twice on the same day , and unfortunately it gave me the same chalky-white face look that many people complain about in many sunblocks . I did discover people 's perception that zinc oxide was the culprit for the distasteful white-face look . I was n't aware of that before I purchased this . On top of that the moisturizer was non-existent . My face was really dry when I put this sunblock/moisturizer on my face and hours later my face was still dry . I so wanted to like this product , especially because of the potential benefits this product supposedly offers as purported by the company from providing 24-hour moisturizing effects to an oil free and non-comedogenic sunblock that does n't clog pores and break my face out with pimples to UVA and UVB protection with at least 30 SPF . I want all of these features in my sunblock , but the white residue this sunblock leaves is so undesirable .	-1
I tested this product on my arms for a week . It dried sticky , and this caused me to be very itchy . I ended up stratching up my arms , but after I stopped using this product , my arms started to clear back up . But , still have some scarring . I think I will go back to the original Eucerin that dried clear , and did n't leave any residue .	-1
A total disappointment ... .one star for the nourishing moisturizing activesPros : Good light weight , matte , non-comedogenic moisturizer suitable for sensitive and oily skin.Cons : Does n't rub in well , leaves horrible white spots and streaks .	-1
Overall , it sits on my skin and I would n't be able to put makeup over it because it does n't absorb into my face . My face ends up looking sweaty even though I have n't broken a sweat ! The product also has a strong chemical smell like a very cheap sunscreen . It is also drying , which is weird for a moisture lotion . If you sweat while wearing this , you will get white streaks on your clothing and face.I 've kept this bottle for only one reason and that is to use it if I run out of the good stuff and that is n't often . I guess you get what you pay for . This is cheap as in price and in quality . I highly recommendAveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer , 2.5 oz.over this one .	-1
I bought this because of all the great reviews in magazines and on t.v. , naming this as the best mascara on the market . I have never been allergic to a cosmetic but this product burned my eyes every time I used it and accidentally got a little bit inside the lid . The brush is small ( some may like that , some may not ) and it is not the slightest bit clumpy ( excellent ) but the reaction I had to it outweighed the positives and I returned it and got my money back .	-1
I had used this brand years ago and never had a problem . When my most recent tube of another brand ran out , I went back to the soft black great lash but the very first day I used it , my eyes felt dry and itchy - I thought it was odd and as normal , washed off all my makeup that night taking care to remove everything around my eyes . The next morning , my eyes felt worse - crusty red and irritated . Took some visine , thought maybe some soap had gotten in my eyes and that was the problem . Applied makeup as usual including this mascara , same day time issues , same problem the next morning with red irritated eyes . Being stubborn I tried it again day 3 - same problems . Nothing else in my regime changed except this mascara . Now I am reading reviews on this same brand in blackest black that there is something causing the same problems for many other users . Something is up with Maybelline . I would take it back to the store if I kept the receipt . No star .	-1
A few hours after trying this mascara , my eyelids were swollen and red and my eyes were burning . It got progressively worse before improving . It was supposed to be hypoallergenic ! It is horrible . I buy inexpensive mascara all of the time but this one I will stay away from .	-1
I was surprised to see the other reviews about stinging , because I thought it was just me ! I have very sensitive skin and allergies , and was able to wear this mascara , but often experienced stinging and burning . It also flaked off under my contact lenses , and smeared easily.I love Maybelline products , but must give Great Lash Mascara two stars . Try L'Oreal 's Million Lashes or Cover Girl 's Clump Crusher instead .	-1
This has been a beauty staple of makeup artists and mascara fans for years and I can not for the life of me figure out why . I guess if you 're lookin for a mascara to give your lashes a darker color and nothing more , you 'd be satisfied with this . But most women buy mascara to lengthen and/or thicken their lashes and this just does n't do that . It does n't clump , but it also does n't do anything else for your lashes . I really tried to give it a chance but it ended up in the garbage . Such a waste . Good thing it 's pretty cheap .	-1
Only came with 1 mascara not six , very misleading ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Therefore , also made the product a bit expensive .	-1
I wanted something to make my blue eyes POP and this is blue on the wand ( as others have stated ) but looks black on my lashes . I do n't know if maybe it 's blue under a special kind of light but maybe this is n't for dark eyelashes ? I could n't see any blue on mine..	-1
I did n't want blue , but this is what they sent . The black of this brand is pretty good but blue ? I was n't looking for Halloween makeup and I 'm not going to any raves soon . They would n't take returns so I guess I 'm stuck with this .	-1
I was exited about getting this mascara because I had heard in some magazines that women all over loved it , but I was kinda annoyed when I saw that the brush was tiny and it really didnt do anything for my lashes , I recomend Milani Runway lashes mascara for about the same price but a much better product !	-1
It seems to me that Maybelline is synonomus with mascara . You would think , then , that given their years in the industry that they would have mascara down pat ! Not so , as evidenced by this product . It is not a good product because it does not do what it is suppose to do which is to make the lashes look longer , thicker , etc.There 's a company in Australia that makes the best that I have found . Then there 's Lancome which is always good.Both of them are much more expensive : 4 times more so.I would think Maybelline would improve their product and if it 's mmore expensive to do so , then do so and charge perhaps 10 bucks for a product that will end up doing what its suppose to.Their liquid eyeliner surprisingly does well in competing with Lancome ... .why not their mascara ?	-1
This is a terrible mascara . It smudges easily , it flakes , it does n't even do much for volume . I 'd say I can wear it for about 1-2 hours before it starts to melt . All I can say about it is it makes my lashes dark . That 's all . This has got to be one of the worse mascaras out there . I would not recommend . Do n't waste your money .	-1
OMG I just ca n't believe it ! The product has changed after all these years . In a previous post , I rated a powder and referred to a Long and Lush mascara from the 80 's and how bummed I was when thr formula changed . HERE we go AGAIN ! To say I am disappointed is a huge understatement . This product had remain unchanged and perfect for so many years and I have faithfully used it . It washes off easily but does n't smudge EVER . That was the old Great Lash I loved.I noticed while applying it that it did n't feel exactly the same but did n't look closely at the bottle . It was n't until my shower that I realized something had drastically changed . I simply could not remove the mascara ! My eyelashes felt like they were glued into 4 lumps of lashes . Crazy . So , I had to use some baby oil to actually remove the mascara . Then 2 days later , after using this one time , yes , one time ! I got a sty on my upper right eyelid . Upon observation of the bottle , the word `` waterproof '' has been added . Holy moly they 're not joking ! But if you have a product that has withstood the test of time , why change ? Call it something else ! UGHSo now what to do ? That is a good question . Meanwhile , I 'll keep using the old bottle until I test out some new mascaras . WHAT a BIG BUMMER ! ! !	-1
I bought this because this was a favorite of my mom 's and has been used by my mom for years . I figured since this particular one was water proof , it would be a plus . Boy was I wrong . Not even hot water gets it off easily , after loosing about half of my lashes , I threw it out . Save your lashes and stick to a great lash mascara that is not water proof .	-1
This mascara may work well for others but it did absolutely nothing for my eyelashes . Did n't add any length or volume , just weighed my lashes down .	-1
I bought this mascara and right from the get go there was nothing in there ... . only the minute traces that something may have been in there . Waste of money , and the worst purchase I ever made on Amazon .	-1
I tried this again after 15 years , thinking by now it would be better than when I was younger . NOPE . I applied coat after coat , and still it looked like nothing . To make matters worse , it also smudged and smeared . Even the naked eyelash look was better than the messy look from this mascara .	-1
I was tired of natural deodorants that just did n't work for B.O . However this is n't that much better on odor . It stops you from sweating which I did not care about . It also makes me sneeze and is hard to wash off the next day in the shower . While it goes on clear and dries smooth , my armpits feel sticky or coated in the shower the next day . I would not get it again .	-1
I am very disatisified with this product . It comes on thick and chalky and did not leave my skin moisturized . I would not recommend this product .	-1
I do n't have especially sensitive skin , but it is dry . This product did not feel very moisturizing , but it made me break out . I thought it might be something else , but I quit using it for a few days , and my skin cleared up . Then when I tried it again , I immediately had another breakout . If you have sensitive skin , skip this cream !	-1
Everyone reacts differently , and this product made me break out . I would test it out on a small patch of skin to see how you react .	-1
I really love Oil of Olay products and have used them for years and years . I was once at the H20 store in downtown Chicago and this young , black guy who worked there had the most beautiful skin . I asked him what he used and he looked around the store to see if the coast was clear before saying , `` Oil of Olay . Although I probably should n't tell you that . '' I have used Oil of Olay ever since and had great results.My problems comes in with this Serum . I feel like I am putting something terribly bad on my face . Oil of Olay 's products tend to fill in the lines with mineral oils or silicone , which once absorbed , do a great job , but similar to Blistex -- -your skin becomes addicted , and if you stop using the product , you skin goes to rubbish.My great friend swears on coconut oil for a million things , including facial moisturizer . I decided to use the Serum for two weeks and coconut oil for two weeks on different parts of my face . The side with the coconut oil had better texture , tightening and my skin looked a lot more readiant . The serum made my skin look good when on , but out of the shower it was a little 'eh ' . Coconut oil is also about $ 10 cheaper and will last forever.I am not saying that is for everyone , but I find that the best products for rejuvenating my skin and hair have been coconut oil based and that is a really great find when you are paying at least $ 20 for a couple ounces of Serum .	-1
I really wanted to notice a change in my face using this serum but I did not . Now I have happily moved on to other products . : )	-1
I do n't know what 's in this stuff , but it really irritates the delicate skin around my eyes ( it makes my eyes water after application , tears literally rolling down as if I 've been sobbing my eyes out ) and burns the skin on my face.I 've used Olay products in the past and used this with Olay cleansers and never had a bad reaction . I 'm not allergic to anything that I know of either ! At first I assumed I had something on my hands , like pepper from cooking . I tried again with the same result . Then I thought maybe I had a bad bottle . I purchased another and got the same effect again.Additionally , when I tried to put my makeup on over this ( once my eyes stopped watering ) I could n't get my foundation to go on over it . It does n't really absorb into the skin well ( like many lotions with SPF in them unfortunately ) and when I put my foundation over it both the lotion and foundation were sloughing off all over the place . I tried it a couple of times with different foundations ( I really tried to do my due diligence ) each time with the same effect . I 'd have to remove my makeup and lotion and start over with new lotion and foundation . As a busy mother , I do n't have the time for all that ! My solution was # 1 to stop using this lotion and # 2 to use a lotion with no SPF in it underneath a foundation that does have SPF .	-1
I see that this product has tons of good reviews ... . but I have to say , after trying it , and trying to STICK with it after it DESTROYED my skin ... I am NOT pleased with it whatsoever.I have been using Olays `` Complete All Day Moisture '' lotion for YEARS . ( I 'm 24 ) . It was the perfect lotion for my young skin ( I know , I know , I 'm by no means OLD now ) It had the perfect amount of moisture and never clogged my pores . Well last year I had this crazy time of breaking out and I thought it was partially caused by the Complete All Day Moisture lotion , so I stopped using it . I went through many other lotions TRYING to get the breakouts under control . Finally , I changed my diet , attempted to rid my life of stress and went back to using the All Day Moisture . At first my skin calmed down and seemed like it might clear up ... ... So since I use to bask in the sun , and I 've used tanning beds , and even though I 'm not old ... . I noticed a few lines on my forehead and by my mouth ( Those dreaded parantheses ) I decided to try this lotion since I wanted to keep my skin looking as young as possible . All I can say is HORRIBLE.It felt GREASY on my skin , it never fully absorbed and it caused an even WORSE breakout then before . I had tons of little red bumbs across my forehead and on my chin . I thought maybe I was breaking out all over again due to stress and stuff , so I continued to use it unknowingly.Well a few weeks later it dawned on me that the lotion may be the culprit . So I switched back to the All Day Moisturizing lotion and WALLA ! ! ! ! ! ! ! My skin calmed back down and the red bumps went away.This lotion may be a godsend to those with dry skin ( Mine is combination ) and who 's skin has more fine lines ... . but for young skin that is either combination or OILY , STAY AWAY from it ! It will only make it OILIER !	-1
I am turning 30 this year and decided it 's time to pay attention to my skin since I 'm starting to get some fine lines . After searching and comparing reviews for lotions on amazon I decided to give this Olay Regenerist with SPF 15 lotion a try . I wanted something that kept my skin soft , prevented lines , and protected me from the sun to an extent . I 'm not sure if it is because it has the SPF protection but when I put this on it feels like I 'm using sunscreen . It looks like sunscreen and feels oily like sunscreen . My face is not overly oily but this makes it feel greasy and so far has done nothing for my fine lines . I wanted something that I would enjoy putting on my face every day because it felt like it was making a difference in the quality of my skin but this just makes me feel like I 'm putting some banana boat on my face . For the price I would expect better quality , at least better texture . I do n't expect the miracles that advertisements claim but would like to at least LIKE the product . Thankfully I bought it on amazon with a coupon but it is outrageously priced in retail stores . I will not be buying this again . I do love Olay 's Regenerist Night Cream , that stuff feels amazing ! I wish they had something comparable to that for daytime wear . So maybe I 'll try a different line from Olay or maybe one without SPF but I really want the sun protection . The search continues !	-1
Let me start by saying , these curlers were not my original choice , but 'looked good on paper ' , so I decided to give them a try . They do n't hold a curl , they are not very easy to use and I do n't like the way they make my hair feel . I would have sent them back , but because there is no defect , I was n't able to , so I 'm stuck with them . May try to get rid of them on ebay one day soon ... ..	-1
When I curled my hair , by the time I got to the other side of my head , the first half of curls had already fallen out . Does n't hold the curl at all . Hairspray did n't help . Returned the product and the hunt continues .	-1
Heats up fast but does not curl and my hair curls easily with everything else . This product is a complete waste of money .	-1
I ca n't see any difference at all in my night sweats ! I still wake up 3-4 times a night sweating and miserable ! I 've tried this several weeks with absolutely no change whatsoever ! ! I will continue til it 's gone and if by some remote chance it starts working I 'll update this review to me it 's just a joke !	-1
The instructions also seemed to be written wrong ( aside from referring to parts that were n't included ) . We kept putting off installing it as doing so would require a trip to the hardware store , which is n't a bad thing at all-just more trouble than this homely , chintzy thing was worth . In the end , we donated it to charity .	-1
I have used this 3 times so far and it has not made ANY bubbles . I am so disappointed . I did everything right , even shook the bottle . I squeeze some out under the faucet and it makes really tiny insignificant `` bubbles '' and by the time I get in the bath , they are all gone and what 's left is cloudy water . Waste of money ! Only positive thing is that it smells good . I do n't notice that my skin is softer .	-1
I did n't like this at all ! The scent is terrible and not relaxing at all . It also did n't bubble at all . It did n't moisturize my skin either . I left the bath feeling more stressed for having had wasted my money on this product . Smell it before you buy it and expect a bubble-less bath .	-1
Item : Double Extend MascaraBrand : L'Oreal9 times out of 10 L'Oreal makes a smash hit product I would use over and over again , this is an item in the 1 out of 10 .

My experience was not like any the reviews I read . The packaging , the product - it all came the way it was supposed to . New . It only took a little over a week for it to be clumpy and gunk up my lashes . After wearing it all day I would have super cute dark rings under eyes . So obviously it could n't even stay put . After a few weeks of daily use its almost gone . I only paid maybe nine dollars , but I was hoping for something better . I 'm not sure what it would take for me to try it again . Overall , this mascara was a stinker .	-1
After reading glowing reviews on Amazon and elsewhere , I decided to try this hoping it would help my sensitive , acne-prone skin . I liked the idea of an inexpensive cleanser that was gentle on skin . Turns out this soap is gentle on dirt , too . It does not remove makeup very well . After use , makeup still comes off on my cleansing cloth ! I have since switched to Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Wash , which seems to work better .	-1
This perfume is so overrated . It smells OK , the scent is not lasting and is too subtle . The male scent is far better . It is barely worn . Sorry I bought it	-1
DEFINITELY READ ALL THE BAD REVIEWS FIRST BEFORE GETTING TRICKED INTO BUYING THIS OILWish I did because I had the exact same problems after getting mine . I usually do always read a couple bad reviews before buying to check out the pros and cons but I ordered this one half asleep.The actual jojoba oil shown on this page is a great oil for your skin but the Jojoba oil I ordered from one of the sellers on here named Livamed sent the oil a lot later after the 1st was lost in the mail plus the oil WAS NOT ORGANIC and PROBABLY not jojoba , or completely jojoba , it smelled like it had been mixed with cocoa butter or something else . Real joboba oil hardly has any smell at all to it this bottle had a strong nutty smell , plus there was no safety seal on it.I went shopping for ORGANIC jojoba oil ( not NATURAL jojoba but organic- there 's a huge difference ) just like the page is showing it 's supposed to be , with the organic seal shown on the bottle in the picture at the top of this page . The bottle sent by Livamed does not have an organic seal on it at all which means it was not organic . I doubt it was even pure jojoba oil . There was no seal on the top of the bottle so anyone could 've added something else to it to fill up the 4 ounces . That 's false advertising . I threw the bottle out since I dont know whats really in it.If you read the rest of the 1 and 2 star reviews on here they all had the exact same problem . One reviewer who had the same problem , called the company , gave the batch number and found out that not only is the oil not organic but Amazon is not even authorized to sell it .	-1
This stuff must be made of unicorn poop and diamond chips because when I saw the size of this bottle I nearly sent it back . It is less than two ounces , people . I used it once on old sagging skin and the bottle was 1/10th gone . NO LIE . So please stop buying this and maybe they will lower the price . I have no idea how well it works because at that price it would have to be like a scene from Death Becomes Her for me to ever buy it again .	-1
I heard alot of hype using this product finally bought it and been using it over a few month period everyday I really didnt notice alot but for the most part its a silcone feeling serum almost like a foundation primer and it worked for me just as that it made the texture of my skin smooth just what a regular primer does anyways before I put on foundationwould I repurchase again ? no theres other serums that will do more than this	-1
I purchased this after reading positive reviews on reputable product review site Cosmetic Cop.Pros : Effective ingredients ( niacinamide & peptide are the star ingredients of anti-aging ) , affordable price tag , fragrance free , decent packaging.Cons : Sits on top of my skin , feels very silicone-y and sure enough it broke me out a fair amount.I 'm typically ill tolerated by products with higher composition of silicone , other silicone-heavy products that broke me out are Smashbox primer & most Giorgio Armani foundations . This serum congested my skin congested & broke out at areas where I usually do n't . I looked back at the reviewers who gave low rating to this serum & unsurprisingly , a good portion of them said that it broke them out as well.My skin was normal again after switching back to ( my favorite ) Caudalie Vinosource SOS serum.I 'd love an affordable & high performance serum , too bad this is n't it .	-1
This stuff is nothing special . Leaves a tacky film on my skin . Try the Tehani Salon skin care anti-aging products . I found those to be better Amazon Products .	-1
Just another rip-off as it does nothing good at all . I used it faithfully for weeks , both with a night cream as well , and take two showers or baths per day to keep everything clean and moisturized . I think people that say it works well , are those that see what they WANT to SEE and nothing more . The tiny , tiny little bit of good that happens if any , is the same that can be accomplished with any moisturizer , and not the expensive stuff that delivers nothing THE ONLY THING THAT DISAPPEARS HERE IS OUR CASH AND NOTHING MORE .	-1
This does not work like this other serum I purchased . Noticed no difference or improvement in my face skin . but instead of tossing in the trash , I found out it work good on hands .	-1
I love Oil of Olay . My primary moisturizer is Oil of Olay Total Effects 7 in One and I love LOVE the creamy fine odor-free texture of the Total Effects but this one is just a weird feeling on your face . I also did not notice any results from using it . I think I even tossed the rest and I 've never done that with a cream . Pretty sad it did n't turn out good as I do love the line of Oil of Olay .	-1
I have used Olay regenerating serum for years now . This is the first time I bought it through Amazon , I always bought it at the store in the past . It came in a different package than the serum I always bought in the store . It also has different consistency and feels different on my skin . I will not be buying it from Amazon again . At a store , at least I can see what I 'm getting .	-1
I was not impressed with this product and gave it to my girlfriend . I prefer to use a primer before applying my makeup and did n't notice any difference in lines , skin texture , etc .	-1
I read the reviews and I got ta say , all this magical tingly feeling some people feel ... I did n't feel it . My pores seemed more noticeable and my face was even a little drier , making my fine lines look not so fine . I threw it out and told my mother not to try it .	-1
I ordered a handful of different creams to experiment with , and this is the one that I 've found least compelling . I 've actually gotten up from bed to wash it off as it was burning me . Maybe -- - maybe the burning/stinging is somehow a good thing , but it made me nervous ( and , of course , hurt a bit ! ) . I 've read that retinol is not suggested for people under 40 or maybe 45 and maybe it 's just a mismatch between me and the product . Hence , why I was experimenting !	-1
First I do n't like the pump container and it just did not suit my needs . I am 67 and have sensitive skin so I need a moisturizer that will work , this just was n't what I needed .	-1
Had to toss this in the trash after reading it 's ingredients . There are plenty of other moisturizer out there that does n't contain these cancer causing chemicals .	-1
Somewhere in the fine print for this item I 'm sure there is a sentence that says , `` Buy this if you 're a sucker . `` I use a regular ceramic curling item to make spiral curls in my hair . It works great , but when I saw this item I had visions of even better curls , so I ordered it.What a pain to use . This iron has a raised spiral pattern along the length of the barrel , and you 're supposed to painstakingly wind your hair between these raised spirals ... I 'm guessing to make an even curl . It takes forever to do this . I did ok on the right side of my head ( I 'm right-handed ) but I had trouble doing the left side . You have to be a contortionist to get the iron at the correct angle and roll it up smoothly . And remember that this is coming from an experienced curling iron user.Were my curls any better than with a conventional curling iron ? That would be a big fat NO . AND it took double the amount of time to curl my hair . I kept it , solely because it is good to have a back-up if your regular iron dies at a critical moment , but I do n't have any interest in using it .	-1
First of all , this is tricky to use . Especially if you have short layers . Second of all , the curls I achieved from it , I do n't really think are any different than a regular 3/4 '' barrell curling iron . The curls were n't all that defined in some spots , and some had a crimping spot from the little clamp . I 'd skip it and get a normal curling iron which does the same thing and is easier to use .	-1
I guess this would be a great product if you have a small head . It does n't fit mine so it was a waste of money .	-1
I should have known better than to purchase a dish soap that had a high fragrance , I thought this would be a nice change and allow me to actually enjoy washing dishes ( no dishwasher ) yes it smells great but leaves a bad residue , which you can taste on everything ! ! It 's especially bad with plastic , it soaks up this soap like no other and even when you rinse it a million times , you can still taste it . Awful ! ! And yeah they 're not green , this stuff gots chemicals too , just look it up on ewg.org .	-1
I wanted to like this soap . The fragrance was wonderful until it stayed on everything I washed with it . I rinsed and rinsed , and tried using less with no avail . I bought the Seventh Generation Free and Clear dish soap instead and did n't have the same peobelm .	-1
I thought this was supposed to be a natural product but it has artificial fragrances and it really bothered my hands since I have mild eczema . Very disappointed since the labeling was misleading .	-1
Like most of Mrs. Meyer 's stuff the scent name and actual scent do n't match . This one smells like bug spray and honestly I ca n't wait to go through it so I can have a different smell in my kitchen . I bought the Parsley hand soap and it smells more like honeysuckle than this does . Too bad I bought 2 bottles of this stuff . Maybe I will find someone with no sense of smell , or someone who likes the smell of bug spray to give it too . Pee Eww !	-1
I 've used this product for several years now , but it is n't working very well lately . The main problem is that there 's very few bubbles and I found I was having to use more and more product to get my dishes and pans clean . The consistency appears to be the same , but it just does n't clean . In fact , this is my main complaint with most all of the Mrs. Meyers products I 've used . They smell nice but do n't do much beyond that . I feel like I 'm using a product that was devised for a reniassance home - lots of perfume to cover the bad smells , but no cleaning power . What a let down.Update : Thanks Christopher Davis for the confirmation that the formula was changed by the manufacturer . It was pretty good prior to the change . Not so much so now . I still stand by my review !	-1
Very disappointed in this soap . The scent is not `` lemony '' ... it stinks of `` old lady powdered perfume '' . If you know what I mean by an old powdered scent ... you 'll know what I mean . You get this on your hands and you will have to smell it for hours . It 's horrible raising food to your mouth with this `` perfume '' on your hands . You ca n't wash it off either.Besides that , after washing a few cups during the day , I noticed my hands were now chapped and burning . The detergents in this soap opened the cuticle of my skin on my hands so horribly that they felt like someone had taken sandpaper to them.Absolutely horrible stuff . Oh , your dishes will smell of this perfume too . I raised a cup to my mouth to drink coffee and smelled the powdery perfume smell in the cup . Had to rinse and rinse and rinse . Never buy again .	-1
It may have cleaned my hands well , I do n't know because I disliked the smell so much I had to throw it away .	-1
I was very disappointed with this hand soap . The bottle is really ugly ( not great in a guest bathroom ) and after a few weeks I could n't wait to be finished with all of the bottles so that I could replace them with the better designed Method hand soap bottles.I also did n't like how watery the liquid soap was . We ended up using more soap so even though a bottle was cheaper than other liquid hand soaps it lasted half as long.The scent was so faint you basically wo n't be able to smell it.Because of the ugly bottle packaging , watery consistency , and lack of aromatic scent I will not be purchasing this bottle again .	-1
I purchased this hand soap based on the rave reviews but I do n't see anything special about it . I think it cleans well but the scent is somewhat & # 34 ; fake & # 34 ; . I do n't like it . I may try other scents . I prefer hand soap from Bath & Body Works .	-1
Repeated use of this hand soap completely dried out my hands to the point of the skin around my fingernails cracking . I had to throw this product away . And when I stopped using it and went to another hand soap , the skin on my hands got better almost instantly.I 've now tried this and the lemon counter top spay and have been totally unimpressed with the performace of the Mrs. Meyer 's products . They may smell nice but they perform mediocre at best .	-1
I have used this product before except I bought it at my hair salon . That one worked well . So well , that I decided to buy again except I saw this one online and it was cheaper . But , this one purchased online got all over my hands as soon as I touched my hair lightly , got on my shirt when I pulled it over my head , dripped down the side of my face when I perspired . Awful . Wish I could return it but I did n't pay that much so let 's just say its one lesson learned .	-1
It 's cheap but when you recieve the color you want it 's different . I got Auburn and it 's more like a brick red , . It does'nt match my auburn/blonde hair at all ! I tried it out and it smeared on my hair and it 's to hard to blend . Thank god it washed right out the next morning . Stick with regular hair coloring or try try the powder kind which I 'm gon na try next .	-1
I waited three months to give this product a fair shot . My skin did not peel to reveal new skin , my pores did not diminish , in fact it diminished the glow to my skin and dried it in spots . I will be returning to Olay products and probably get a professional peel .	-1
I picked up the PanOxyl 10 % Bar when I could n't find the Foaming Wash at my local Wal-Mart which usually has the Foaming Wash of the same type , which I am still an enormous fan of , at a reasonable price . The bar was $ 4 cheaper as well so I figured hey , same thing but in a bar , why not right ? Well , for reasons that I can not explain , my acne has never flared up so badly with a Benzoyl Peroxide medication . I ca n't remember the last time I had so many zits on my forehead and cheeks . The kind of zits that are stubborn too , they returned over and over again . I am under the impression that the medication 's tendency to dry the skin accelerated oil production . Even using a good lotion after application made no difference . Maybe there was something wrong in my routine I do n't know.Taking a look at the ingredients the two are different . Not my much , but they are different . Perhaps my skin just disliked something in the bar . Either way , I can not rate this product very highly for what it did to my face . I have since switched back to the PanOxyl Foaming Face Wash of the same grade and my skin has started clearing up again within a matter of a few days which makes me think something about the bar , whatever it was , just did n't get along with my skin . I am sure this bar will work miracles for most , but those of you who have some more sensitive skin like mine , try the Face Wash instead , it works wonderfully .	-1
I could n't find any difference in the amount of dandruff at all . I went through the entire bottle used as directed and there was 0 change . Every person is different but this was a waste of money for me . Luckily , Selsun Blue ( the medicated one ) worked in ONE treatment .	-1
I bought this to try because the American ( blue bottle ) version was not available for a time . It smells like the anti-itch animal shampoo we used for our dog and was very very watery.Stick with the blue bottle US version of Nizoral . It is a thicker consistency and while it does n't smell wonderful , it smells much better than this stuff .	-1
Bought his lip moisturizer based on reviews . I personally did not like anything about this lip moisturizer . It has a silicone feel to it and had to reapply all day long . I went though a whole tube in 1 week . Gave the other one away . I will go back to eos ( http : //www.amazon.com/Sweet-Mint-Organic-Balm-Sphere/dp/B003ND183O/ref=sr_1_10 ? ie=UTF8 & qid=1364137223 & sr=8-10 & keywords=eos+lip+balm ) which is wax based lip balm but it does the job and love the sweet minty flavor and it lasts forever .	-1
Do n't know what all the glowing reviews are about . I bought this after reading all the reviews because I was curious to try it out . There is nothing special about this Chapstick and I do not find my lips to be all that more moisturized after I use it . It was n't expensive so no love lost but I would not order again .	-1
This lip `` moisturizer '' dried my lips out sooo bad after using it ONCE . I hate leaving bad reviews , but I honestly hate this product . My lips got so dry and they looked so gross . I 'm sticking with Blistex chapstick .	-1
I read on several blogs that this was great for cystic acne . I found that it did n't really work . It is also a really weird color to have on your face .	-1
I do n't understand why this had such good reviews . For the price , it did n't work as well as I thought it would . I should have just saved the money and bought the one from Ulta that I 've been using for years that 's only $ 4.99 .	-1
Sulfates ! This product broke me out with cystic acne on my forehead , chin , and nose . Also , it 's very drying and I have super oily skin - like wash face at 8am and tiny beads of oil on my nose by 9am . So disappointed by the product .	-1
I have fine , shoulder-length hair . I primarily use hair spray around the roots to add body and to hold the baby hairs in place . I developed a mild reaction to the current hair products I use ( that works ) and tried Free & Clear Firm Hold Hair Spray.I 'm not happy with the spray . I 'm not sure what it really does because it feels like my hair is still doing it 's own thing , regardless how much spray I use . I may as well use NO HAIR SPRAY because it seems to wear off a few minutes after application . This is after a using it for a few days : my hair is unruly . I 'm going back to the stuff I 'm allergic to ( it worked all this time without issue ) .PRO : * No itchy dandruff due to allergic reaction to hair products.CONS : * Hold is not firm nor does it give my hair body . Big Sexy Hair 's Spray and Play Harder holds better . Kept my hair in place without looking it like a helmet . * Does not keep baby hairs in place . John Frieda 's Fly Away Tamer does the best job on this one .	-1
If you are truly sensitive to scents do not buy this as it has a noticeable scents and is not returnable . Plus it is quite expensive for hair spray .	-1
After reading all the positive reviews I was so hopeful . My nails have always peeled , been weak/thin and brake/chip easily . Used this product for several weeks , as directed and it did not make one bit of difference . No change what so ever . : (	-1
I did not notice any results from this product . In fact , it seems to wear off and chip rather easily .	-1
This product provides a much too lightweight degree of stickiness , even on thin fabric . I 'm sorry I wasted my money .	-1
Not as good as the ad . The stay and stick is not as good as a great product should be . Cleans up easy after use .	-1
The spray color borwn/blonde is WHITE . Unless a person likes WHITE hair , forget this color . I have used brown and that is fine , and I like the product . However , DO NOT BUY this color . You will be sorry .	-1
This is the worst stuff I have ever used on my hair . You spray it , it is what appears to be perfect till you mess with your hair and your hands turn brown/black depending on color choice . I would NOT recommend this product to anyone . Also be advised it took me 3 shampoos in 1 shower to scrub this crap out of my hair , what a disaster .	-1
this never dries , even weeks later and comes off on everything . Your hands will be covered with this and also your pillowcase . Also leaves a powderish film on your hair .	-1
DO N'T BUY THIS PRODUCT THIS STUFF IT IS ABSOLUTELY NASTY.IT MAKES YOUR HAIR STIFF AND ITCHY AND AWFUL TO TRY AND BRUSH OUT . I DEFINITELY WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT .	-1
color is way too black , not mixed wel in container , messy , discolors fabrics , do n't recommend this except for possible halloween contume product ,	-1
For some reason Amazon only has a handful of detangler comb/brush choices so I decided to go ahead and order this one because it seemed to be the best choice at the time.When I was younger I remember having several & # 34 ; detangler & # 34 ; combs in our bathroom drawer because my younger sister and I have always had very long straight hair that tangled up , especially after bath time so instead of my mom having to chase us around to brush our hair and then we would scream like someone is trying to kill us she always used a brush and detangler combination and it worked fine ! I do n't remember what age I was when my hair seemed as though it stopped getting tangled all the time but for a long time I remember not having that issue and life was GREAT.About a year ago though my hair started to frizz-up and tangle and all sorts of other weird stuff so my search started with hair treatment products , new shampoos , etc . While I was trying to figure out what was going on I decided I would also buy new brushes and unbelievably so after so many years find a detangler brush as well ... . : ( For starters the detangler combs we had when I was young were tiny compared to this cumbersome thing , they were made out of different resin/plastic and the bristles were also completely different.None the less I still decided to give it a try because as all things in life you can no longer get all the awesome things we all grew up with and miss dearly almost on a daily basis ! My two sense about this comb is that because its gigantic , the bristles are way too thick , the material used to make it is very cheap , and the alignment of the bristles is way off because they are so big instead of it actually detangling your hair it in fact tangles it even more than when you first started.The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not 1 is because I like the design and tortoise pattern.I would never buy this again or recommend it ! PS : If you want an INCREDIBLE detangler and brush invest in one of : The Wet Brush and you wo n't regret it ! For those interested after using the brush for several months I finally reviewed it on 11/25/2012 its the black J & D ; Beauty B830W .	-1
This comb does not detangle your hair wet or dry . I do detest false advertisement . Keep your money in your pocket .	-1
This product came damaged , two of the comb teeth were missing , and they were n't even in the bag , which means it was packaged damaged ! ! ! !	-1
I hate this comb . I have 4C hair that is & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ; that is really thick and longer but still this comb is terrible . It snags and feels like it is going to break with each use . If you are very , very , very careful and slow you have nothing to worry about . So maybe if you are detangling after a good wash or deep condition this might be of some use but for me I do n't even use this comb anymore as it pulls out my hair and is big and not sturdy . A well built wide tooth comb would be better , I will not be buying this product again . It is useless and just sits under my sink after I have found my old wide tooth hand comb . Does n't work well with my daughter 's hair either though her curls are not as rough as mine and silkier .	-1
NOT AT ALL WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS . I AM NOT ABLE TO USE IT BECAUSE MY HAIR IS TOO THICK WHEN I WASH IT AND THIS COMB WILL DEFINITELY BREAK .	-1
The prongs on this comb are cheap machine made plastic that is actually too sharp and scratchy to the touch to put through hair . Always test a new comb on your hand , and if it scratches your hand then it will cut at your hair strands damaging them . If you have short hair this would be fine because the sharpness is high up in the comb , but for mid back length heavy hair these teeth will absolutely ravage your hair . Sometimes you truly do get what you pay for so I suggest the wenn shower comb instead - it 's excellent for thick or fine hair alike and it 's extremely well made .	-1
I read all the reviews diligently prior to ordering this product . I received the Mavala Scientific nail hardner and followed the instructions yet the very first morning after applying the night before I had a split . Because my nails are super short and the instructions are very clear to only apply to tip , I was super careful not to `` over do '' it , making sure I only get it on the tip that I do have . So , not giving up , I filed down the split and re-applied this time using a tad bit more as I figured maybe I just was `` too '' careful and didnt get enough on ( the instructions say to hold the brush their for about a few seconds/or minute to make sure it absorbs . So I did this again . Again , same thing , this time it was another nail I noticed a split . I only have two fingers that have tips so the other nails I used Trind nail balsam and nail repair ( with the intention when they get long enough I will use the Mavala on the tips as I truly belived or hoped the Mavala would be best for the hardner part since it makes sense to me to not use it on the pink part of nail or cuticle area ) . My nails are in horrible shape but have been very good about soaking , wrapping and `` feeding '' the cuticles for the past two weeks . These two nails had finally showed a tip so I was very excited to use this Mavala . I figured I would only use it when the other nails caught up as my cuticles were always so bad and feel that I had been going about treating my nails the wrong way by over drying them with hardners for my entire nail . Anyway , I used the Mavala hardner with the Mavala nail `` shield '' products ( 2 layers of fiber solution they sell to use with the hardner to keep the rest of your nail protected between applications ) . What I noticed is 1 ) the nails treated with the Mavala hardner/shield products were significantly `` yellow '' compared to the the ones I used Trind.2 ) The Mavala `` peeled '' off at cuticle area both times I tried it the next day . As the instructions as well as proper care tells us to continue to use moisterizers for the cuticle area so doing that caused the Mavala shiled to peel.3 ) Then nail tips had splits on the Mavala after 3 times applying it each time alittle more to ensure I was doing it right.4 ) The Mavala nails looked bumpy , dull and tacky compared to the Trind . I know this is not a review of the Trind but for now , the Trind is amazing . Using the Trind nail balsam under the Nail repair ( which their nail repair also has Formaldyhed ) there were no bumps , my cuticles looked great and so far so good , no splits or shreds at all . Also they looked `` whiter '' compared to the Mavala . The Mavala has too many coats and if you read the instructions the shield is just a `` fake '' layer to protect the nail but it peels and really donesnt do anything more than get you by . the Hardner , what a disappointment ? Past reviews suggested your nails would be rock hard on the tips but mine are not that but more importantly I have since had to file those two nails down to where they are not `` no tips '' because the hardner didnt do what it was supposed too . I tried 3x ... so ca n't believe that it is this amazing product when I had splits two times in less than 3 days.I did exactly what the instructions said if anything , put alittle more ( but this was only after the 3rd day still splitting ) .The Trind is really nice . Easy too . You are to remove it every night with non-acetone nail remover , coat your nail with the Nail balsam ( which keeps your nail and cuticles from drying out under the fomaldyne ) then you use their Nail repair ( which is similar to Mavala 's hardner only you put on the whole nail . The amazing thing is it is NOT drying or peeling . And the nail looks smooth and white ( not yellow and tacky ) .the two nails that had tips are still alittle bit there even after I filed them down after the splits occurred when I tried the Mavala ... and so far so good with the Trind nail repair . I switched those two nails to the Nail Trind ( like my others ) and the tips are strong and no splits.I do not recommend this Nail hardner if you have really soft nails that are super short . I watched a couple tutorials on youtube of people applying the Mavala..all the people have super long `` claws '' where the white is very present ( it doenst really show anyone that truly has weak , frail SHORT tips ) . To me , if your nails are already super long and have white tips its not the Mavala as much as you have good nails.I am a perfect example though of every time I get slightly white tip it splits and my nails are paper thin from artificial nails , bad circulation and abuse for all my life ( 51 years old ) . Now , I am showing great results but not from the Mavala but the Trind . I recommend the Trind .	-1
got this for both my kids who chew their nails . Both continued chewing away . My daughter even said the taste is not enough to deter her from the bad habit . Tried telling them there is a nasty ingredient in it . That worked for like a day .	-1
I bought this product for my 4-year-old so refuses to stop sucking on his index finger . I applied it on his finger and it did n't bother him at all . I kept applying it hoping that eventually I would start seeing results but nope , I did n't . I ended up sawing a glove to one of my son 's long sleeve shirts and that finally helped break the habit .	-1
I bought this for my son who is a chronic nail biter . Unfortunately it did n't work at all .	-1
This product was tried on a thumb sucker and a nail biter . It did not work for either.I felt terrible after using it , it made my 7 year old vomit . As for the thumb sucker , he did n't care , he just kept right on sucking his thumb . The smell of this stuff is very , very strong . If the child touches ANYTHING , the taste and smell will get on that item . If your child , for example , is going to eat a banana , they will get the taste/smell of this in their mouth/nose . When it is on , it 's hard to have their hands even near your face , it 's so disgusting . I would never put this on another child . Even as an adult , just lifting your coffee cup to your face you 'll be able to smell it , get the taste , from your hands . We ca n't recommend this for any child and will keep looking for solutions to our thumb sucker and nail biter . I was hopeful after reading the reviews , but we are deeply disappointed . This is just awful .	-1
I wonder why have they allowed this thing to be on the shelf . Please try this product but a slight brush on ur nail and , u wud have hatred towards it . thankfully i tried it before trying it on my child . I think better is trying to encourage your child out of it.I wonder why isnt there negative rating	-1
i guess we are severe nail biters ... .beyond help ... .because this stuff did n't work . it washed off with water and my son figured that out pretty darn quick . after that , he would just scrape it off with his teeth and proclaim that he liked the taste . i tried it myself and it honestly does n't taste that bad . i mean , it stays in your mouth for a bit but nothing unbearable . i 've been biting for 32 years ... ..this is n't going to work for me . it does get all over everything you touch so be careful eating .	-1
ended up using maybe a total of 3 times , because my babies . Twins . Decided that they like the taste of the stuff , when it actually tastes I bit hazardous and toxic in my opinion ( though I 'm sure it ca n't be ) I was too scared to continue because they just suck it right off , and Keep right on sucking their fingers .	-1
I thought this product would work for my 2 1/2 year old son . My son keeps sucking his tumb and I have tried everything . This was my last thing I have not tried . I have tried several nail polish stoppers and just like the rest this did not work . Save your money and just use baby orgel .	-1
I bought this product coz of the rating ... Now I hear that the reviews are spoof..Check this `` 15 of these 5-star reviews are spoofs '' , April 25 , 2011 By 42bunny '' It may look like this product has a high number of positive reviews , but looking closer you 'll see that 15 of the 5-star reviews ( all posted on Nov 30 , 2010 ) are comedic , or rather , attempts at comedy . `` Hmmmm ... .Update 29th Aug 2012 - I heard from two separate friends that my lower face looks swollen .	-1
i purchased because of its good reviews hoping that it would calm my eczema , unfortunately , i found cetaphil to be more useful ; /	-1
This has a sweaty , heavy feeling on the skin and felt like I was smearing vaseline on it . Do n't even think about using it on your face . My face was sticky , shiny and almost felt like it could n't breathe . If you enjoy smearing vaseline on your hands then you may enjoy this lotion .	-1
I was unable to use this product as it dried my skin out too much . I would not expect that to have something scent and dye free meant that it would be so harsh .	-1
Decided I would try this due to my allergies , asthma , eczema and sensitive skin . After using it to wash my hands , my skin was so dried out . My throat began to close , chest tighten and I had to take benadryl and albuterol to stop my reaction . I do n't know what 's in this , but I guess the chemicals were a no-no for me .	-1
Very incense like , but also powdery and a bit musty . Reminds me of slipcovers and drawer liners . Not what I was expecting at all . Kinda sticky too . Scent does n't last very long either . All in all , not so great . ( Egyptian Goddess scent )	-1
The first time I used this fragrance it made me nauseous . It had an old lady smell to it . I did n't smell any sandalwood at all . Very disappointed . I threw it away !	-1
There was not much scent to the oil I received , and what little scent there was reminded me of Play-Doh . I used the entire roll-on over the course of a couple of months with no improvement in the product 's performance . ( I had read that exposure to air helped release the fragrance . Nope . ) If this worked for you , I 'm glad , but it did nothing for me . Not recommended .	-1
I do n't see what all the fuss is about . This oil smells okay , but it does not last at all . I would NOT buy this again	-1
So I just received my blck coconut roll-on , and was so excited to try it because I LOVE all things coconut , and I 'm disappointed to say the least . Its almost sickeningly sweet , and I really do n't sense that much coconut . It almost smells syrupy . I put it on though because oils can smell different on the body then it does in the jar . 4 hours later and its still pretty sweet ... not as bad as it was when I first put it on , but definitely smelling even less like coconut . I thought I would be getting a true tropical warm scent from the description ... ( pure coconut with a bit of spice ) but , alas , I go right back to the bubble_gum scents of junior high when I smell this . Does anyone have any recommendations for a TRUE coconut scent ? ( Nutty , creamy , musky , and warm smelling ) I 'm willing to try anything ! But id rather stick with the all natural oils for their longevity .	-1
I chose to get the Egyptian Goddess since it seemed to have good reviews but I must have an extremely different idea of what good smells like . I opened it and without smelling it first just rolled a little bit on my arm , I smelled like an old lady all day ( no offense intended ) . Right after I put it on this really sexy guy I work with walks in and says it smells weird in here what is that ! ? I showed him the scent and the disgust on his face said it all lol . Then of course I figured it 'll fade soon enough but no I could smell it for hours so I said screw this I need to wash my wrists . Even then I could kind of smell it and I do n't have smelling like a dog it was just that bad . When I got home that night I had my grandma and mom see of they liked it and the look on their face was priceless haha , I need to send this crap back . Otherwise its one of those gifts you give out for xmas to someone you do n't exactly like .	-1
Initially this smelled good , when I dabbed a bit on my wrist . The scent was light and faint , not at all overpowering , in fact it was almost unnoticeable . I put my wrist to my nose several times throughout the day and could smell almost nothing . The next day I rolled more oil on and still , no real smell . I have no idea why . Maybe it 's me . I wo n't repurchase .	-1
I do n't like it at all , it has a good staying power though but is a flowery scent , not very strong but you can feel it . If you are into flowery scents then try it .	-1
Review about `` Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess '' by DayDream..When I smell this perfume oil product , I like smell , it 's light and stay about 4hours on my body but on 4th day when I open this bottle and I do n't get any scent smell . I thought I got cold but I asked my family members `` did you guys smell this ? ? '' any scent smell is there ? my family members laugh on me so badly , and we realized no more scent smell and it 's `` just oil now '' ! ! above half of the bottle still remains ... I trashed it straight away..do n't purchase this product by Day Dream.Yes I got Black opium from vendor name `` Xtremek '' , that perfume oil still nice smell . I am more purchasing from Xtremek Black opium . but do not buy this `` Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess '' from `` DayDream '' this is the my bad experience of this product ... . I tried similar products in India called `` Attar from Ratlam Aerochem is company name '' its nice one but bad luck that I do n't get online so , I am trying this products now ... do n't waste money on this `` Auric Blends Egyptian Goddess '' by DayDream.Smell gone after couple of days or within 4days . Just think if you plan to gift someone this product after 4days ? ? ? ? ugghghhhhh ? ? ? No smell.. No smell..- Thanks : HP	-1
Does n't smell like coconuts . Smells very synthetic , nauseatingly sweet and plasticky . Not at all how I imagined it would be . Ca n't recommend this one , not even for teens .	-1
I REALLY , REALLY wanted to like this . Was so anxious to get it . Other reviews were great so I am wondering if mine just got messed up or something . It stinks . Really stinks . Nothing musky at all about this . It smells like hand soap but not the good kind . So disappointed . Cant even describe the smell - just a strong flowery scent and smells like cheap soap / lotion .	-1
I do n't know why everyone is complaining about the faint smell . Yes , it is faint when you open the bottle cap and sniff it . Once you dab it on you - just a quarter size and let it sit and go into your skin , the fragrance will start to grow . Initially when you first buy the perfume , you may need to put on about 12 '' of it on your body to detect the scent . Then go out for a day or so ( walk around in the fresh air ) and you 'll start to notice the scent . After your nose can delineate between the fresh air and the scent , you 'll notice that the scent is actually quite strong . Later , just a dab will last you 48 hours - through showers and repeated hand washing / dish washing.This fragrance reminds me of my Kindergarten teachers and older women in their late 30s up to 60s wearing this stuff . This is definitely not for women in their 20s , as it smells too `` motherly '' and `` married . '' It 's a comforting , sweet scent , but it smells old , as in a popular scent that we grew up with when we were little , so it lends itself as an older woman scent from the last generation .	-1
I thought I 'd try this based on some lovely reviews , but sadly this was n't for me . Gave me a man kinda smell . Not what I was going for . Had to toss . A little strong and headache-inducing as well . Ishall stick with their Egyptian Goddess Blend , which is soft and feminine on me .	-1
Really strong . i am 28 and this smells like what I think my grand kids will say I smell like in 40 or 50 years , when i have kids and they have kids . I 'm not mad I bought it but it is more musk than anything else .	-1
I purchased the Jasmine scent because I wanted to try something new ( my signature smell is `` Aphrodesia '' by Song of India ) , but I 'm totally underwhelmed by the smell . Well actually , its a pretty overwhelming smell , but it does n't register as Jasmine to me . My dad ( who is in his 60s , and who 's senses are n't as sharp as they used to be ) thinks it smells amazing ( I think it makes me smell like a hotel bathroom ( y'know that generic soap/air freshener smell ? ) ) , but my boyfriend ( who is a big fan of my usual scented oil ) ca n't seem to smell it at all , so I 'm quite dumbfounded . When the package arrived , it was clad in bubble wrap along with a free box of incense cones ( my dad was thrilled ) , but the container somehow leaked during transport , and just reeked . I had to wash my hands several times to get the smell off them . When I put it on , I kept forgetting , and so would periodically wonder what the terrible smell was . I do n't think I 'm gon na get this again , and I feel bad , but I 've considered never purchasing from this brand again . Perhaps I 'm just a Song of India gal through and through ...	-1
I decided to purchase this perfume based on the great reviews written but unfortunately , it is just was not what I was hoping for . The scent is so light , I feel as if I have to literally douse myself to smell anything . I am suspecting that the item that I got is an old batch .	-1
I bought this thinking it would be as fragrant as other oils that I have used . Not so . I put a small amount of this on right after I got it , which was fast , and you could smell it for a few minutes . Then nothing . I thought maybe I did n't put enough on , so I reapplied . Same thing happened , even though I used more the second time . I emailed the company to see if it was possible to get an out dated or bad batch . They wrote back and told me that their oils are n't like other ones and you need to apply it 4-5 times to get the fragrance to last . Does anyone else see something wrong with that ? ! Seems ridiculous to me . Anyway , I 'm not going to send it back so I guess I 'll just use it when I want to smell it for a few minutes . Wish I would have known because I would n't have gotten it or done business with this company .	-1
I read the reviews where people said they could n't smell anything . I took a chance and ordered anyways , thinking they must have had bad noses or had actually got used to the smell . I ordered two bottles . The first was okay . It did n't smell musky to me at all , just slightly earthy and very sweet . It was weak , and only lasted minutes on my skin ( and my skin tends to hold musky/spicy/earthy smells well ) . I asked several family members to smell where I had rolled it- nothing.The second bottle ... I almost want to say it was just vegetable oil , but it had a slight burnt rubber smell to it . Maybe it was a bad bottle , I dunno , but I wish someone had smelled it before they sent it to me , because it was obviously something wrong with it . Even the texture of the oil felt wrong , if that makes sense.All these reviews really got me hopeful , and I 'm so disappointed . I would send them back if I actually had the receipt , time , and energy to do so . I just had my first daughter and the post office is so far away ! Argh !	-1
Take the cap off and sniff , and you 'll get a light whiff of this perfume . Not bad , really . But , roll it on and the scent disappears . I 've used it several times and the result is the same ... nothing . I can only think that it is just too weak to have a scent when spread thinly on the skin . I am aware that an individual 's personal chemistry can affect perfumes , but I expect some scent , even if different once applied . Disappointing , to say the least , and I am afraid I can not recommend this product .	-1
I read the other reviews stating that this perfume was too faint , and that you could n't smell the fragrance . I should have paid attention to it . But , having said that , I am also one who likes a strong fragrance . This one is extremely mild but pleasant . It 's a pleasant fragrance , I just should have saved my money . I just assumed maybe it was just the difference in chemistry and maybe it would work for me ... .it did n't .	-1
I tried to like it . Good shipping speed , good price , packaged well . But it does n't smell like sandalwood to me , not even a tiny bit . It smells very synthetic and just not good ; too sickeningly sweet . Sigh.Also , I would like to mention that when it arrived the roller ball was broken - stuck inside the cap . FYI - it is not returnable , to anyone thinking about ordering this . I 've emailed the seller to ask how they will make this right and am currently awaiting reply .	-1
I wanted to like this , I really did . I ordered Black Coconut expecting a natural coconut scent that would take me to a warm and tropical place and was convinced it would take me there from some of the reviews about this particular scent.It finally arrives and I excitedly open it and take a whiff and.. it smells synthetic . REALLY synthetic . I 'm talking Glade plug-in air freshener synthetic . I was highly disappointed at how synthetic and artificial this smells ! Because it was an oil , I was expecting it to be composed in a more natural scent ( especially because coconut oil exists ! ) but this literally smells like a coconut version of car freshener and you know you ca n't expect a natural scent out of those.I received this roll-on three weeks ago and tried to give it an honest chance by wearing it on my wrist and allowing it to heat up ( as Egyptian Goddess taught me , a little heat can create magic ! ) but even when my body warmed it up and let ts scent disperse , I was seriously far from impressed.If synthetic scents are your thing and you do n't mind an artificial coconut scent , then I 'm sure this will be for you . But in my case , I find this smells terrible . I suppose I got what I paid for considering how cheap it 's priced.. : ( ***COCO MANGO***I ordered Coco Mango and Black Coconut and received them 3 weeks ago in the mail . While I was seriously disappointed with Black Coconut , Coco Mango was definitely the winner of the order . It 's great in comparison to Black Coconut but to be honest , the scent by itself is n't impressive either . You can smell the scent of artificial coconut in this roll-on , but mango is n't exactly what I smell along with it . I warn you , the scents are quite artificial so you may not receive what you 're expecting when it comes to scents from natural sources like fruits and flowers.The scent is.. sweet , but overly sweet . Sickly sweet , if that 's a good way to describe it . It 's also very strong so if you get this , I recommend using it sparingly . I honestly do n't really care for the overly sweet scent ( and this is coming from a fan of Aquolina 's Pink Sugar ! Irony ! ) so I either use it extremely rarely and sparingly or not at all.I suppose I ca n't really roll with this roll-on because of how synthetic it smells ; when it comes to smelling nice , I want to smell natural , even if the scent is far from natural- unnaturally natural ! But when I used Coco Mango and Black Coconut , I felt like I smelled like one of those cheap car air fresheners you get while paying your gas money to a store clerk.I wanted to love Coco Mango especially in comparison to Black Coconut . But it has not wowed me . It's.. decent.I had way better success with Egyptian Goddess , though !	-1
Darn ! I 'm so disappointed because I really had hopes this would smell like the Patchouli of days gone by . Unfortunately , it does n't . The oil is thick and goes on smoothly with the roller ball but I detect no Patchouli fragrance . I even tested it with my husband who absolutely adores Patchouli : I did not tell him I bought this and when it came in I applied it in several strategic locations . He did not detect the slightest hint of Patchouli ! In my opinion , the bottle I received may be old because it actually has the fragrance of cardboard . Very disappointing .	-1
I just simply do not like the smell of this oil . Different body chemistries make the fragrance different on everybody , so you should probably try for yourself . After I first apply it , the smell is like that of Opium perfume . Unfortunately , on me , it morphs into a body odor smell shortly afterward . I did n't realize at first that it was the perfume oil and was concerned that I was having a sweating problem ( even though I was not sweating and I shower at least once a day ) - after smelling my wrists repeatedly , I realized it was the perfume oil . I am going to give this to a friend to try , I hope it works better for her . I wo n't be ordering this fragrance again .	-1
I 've bought oils for the past 25 years everywhere from the bazaars of Saudi Arabia to the fine perfumiers in Paris and the French Quarter in New Orleans and have always been a fan of oils vs perfumes . For years I 've made my own scents from oils mixed with various carriers as well . Disappointingly weak single note fragrance does n't last long at all..maybe a half hour ... poor quality and very weak . At this rate , it 'll be gone in a few days . Not a good value for the $ $ $ would not buy again .	-1
I ordered black opium and day dream send patchauly ... What a junk ... I 'm not affordable return this item , do n't deal with these junks ... Waste of money and trust of amazon sellers ... I ordered 3 different products 1 ) Egyptian Godess scent smell gone after 4days , 2 ) Black opium that was good so , I ordered again same BlackOpium but 3 ) got patchauly instead of Black Opium.Thanks and I will sure never deal with you guys.I ordered couple of Black opium by XTremek it 's nice and ordering more ... Long lasting , got correct order from xtremek ... I like this xtremek seller only..HP	-1
Whoa doggy ! This is a strong , strong scent ! ! ! My first time using it I got nauseous from the scent . I have been wearing perfume and oils since I was 15 and none of them have had that affect on me . I like strong perfumes , but this took the cake . Maybe next time I try it I wo n't roll , but dab and then see how it is . The scent was strong all day .	-1
Ive bought several of the Auric Blends perfumes and loved them but this one I just do n't like it . More of a masculine scented oil bordering on aged powder.Its not a disgusting scent , just not what I thought it would be.It would probably smell nice on an older gentleman though .	-1
This Black Opium scent reminds me of those cheap Chinese plastic goods you get at the Ranch 99 or those Chinese markets that sell plastic goods - plastic cups , bowls , lunch boxes , etc . I bought it from Amazon but I am very displeased with the scent . I 'm more into floral and berry scents like Victoria 's Secret . I do n't think this is suitable for women in their 20s . It has a deeper , earthy , somewhat ethnic scent . I would n't call it a fragrance good to wear . Maybe as a soap fragrance for the hands , but definitely not for the body . It does n't smell that inviting .	-1
I wanted to love Auric Blends , based on everything I had read and accidently stumbling onto their perfume oils here I decided to order three different scents , based on their website descriptions . This scent , Black Opium is decent , I suppose but only by comparison with the others that were horrible failures Majik , and Egyptian Goddess . This is the only scent that actually smells okay and stays on you for a few hours . I had hopes of ordering 5-6 others but based on these three , I will not be buying anymore Auric Blends .	-1
First of all these say that they 're Ardell lashes . They are not . The package I got has black marker scribbled over the name of the lashes , and they 're Andrea lashes . Also - the glue is removed from the package . I have n't tried the lashes on yet , that 's not what I 'm writing this review for . I 'm writing it because it 's not even the product in the picture ! What are these people doing ? AND you sent me an opened package ? So kind of you . Boo . Hope these lashes were worth it , really do .	-1
I had high hope for the brush but as soon as I tried it , it caught my hair and pulled it out ! ! ! OUCH ! ! ! I have medium length hair and it would get caught in the handle . I returned the item .	-1
I do n't know what 's up with this brush , but my hair always gets caught in the tiny little grooves on the handle ( the red part ) . I have no clue why people would leave a gap there when making this brush , but it hurts my hair and pulls a lot . I still use it , but I would never buy another one .	-1
..maybe this brush is just not suitable for my hair type , I have wavy/curly hair and its making it more frizzy and not so soft..	-1
Maybe I just have n't perfected the roll brush technique but my hair is super curly and this does nothing but hurt my head ... I have found that the really small roll brushes work best .	-1
I have the conair 1 1/4 inch hot brush but my hair is very thick and long so I wanted a bigger barrell . This was all I could find . I read all reviews before I purchased and people either loved it or hated it . If you have the conair first you will hate this brush . If you have nothing to compare it to I guess it would be ok . The cool tip at the end is too small and I kept burning my finger tips . The on/off switch is right where your hand goes so you have to keep switching it back on . It does not get hot enough . If you have a lot of hair do n't waste your money . I 've gone back to using my conair . Wish it was bigger but it always makes my hair look great ! I donated mine to a thrift store . I paid for shipping and by the time I paid to have it shipped back it just was n't worth it . Whoever buys it will probably pay 2 dollars for it and that is about what is was worth to me . Someone please come out with a 1 1/2 inch hot brush ! ! ! !	-1
This brush iron does a reasonable job on the ends of my hair , but it is definitely not for smoothing or adding curl or shine . It just does n't get hot enough . For my long , fine , straight hair , it is just ok at taming the bangs and ends . If I want curl , body , bounce or shine , I do n't even plug it in , I just go for my better styling tools . I was really hoping this would be my go-to tool after letting my hair air-dry , but it was a disappointment .	-1
Why did n't I buy this size brush iron sooner ? I have short , layered hair and have been usingInstant Heat Hot Brush , 1 1/4-Inch . It does a good job , but some pieces of hair are just too short for its barrel . Any type hot brush is hard to find in a real store , so I started my initial search at Amazon instead . 1/2 '' is the perfect size for short haircuts . I prefer added body rather than outright curls , and this does that if the barrel is kept on my hair for about 6-8 seconds.It only has two settings ( low/high ) compared to Conair 's many . That 's okay -- once I found the perfect Conair setting , I never moved it elsewhere anyway . The high setting on Helen of Troy seems to deliver the same amount of heat as Conair 's highest setting , so I 'm happy.Thank you , Amazon , for stocking a hard to find product and thank you , Helen of Troy , for making it.11-12-2013 UPDATE : My five star rating has gone down to one because this brush iron lasted ten months before a row of teeth simply broke off , and ca n't be fixed or replaced . I was n't even aware it happened -- found out the hard way by getting a big forehead burn . This iron was not used everyday either -- just occasionally when more body was desired . I see now from reading negative reviews that many others have experienced the very same problem .	-1
I thought this would be a nice way to give my hair some shape and smooth out the frizzies instead of pulling a flat iron through or even a curling iron with the clamp ... I was WAY WRONG.I get absolutely NOTHING fro this iron . I ca n't even get my hair to heat up with it.I 'm thinking it would MAYBE work better with shorter and thinner hair ( my hair is fairly coarse ) .	-1
This is a really nice curling brush , except that it does n't get nearly hot enough to actually curl hair . There are two settings : High and Low . The & # 34 ; high & # 34 ; setting does not even produce a curl immediately after taking the brush out of your hair . I am not one to use rushes and irons so hot that they can not be touched and where your hair is damaged , so I was n't expecting anything blazing hot . However , it has to be warm enough to actually curl hair . In all my years , I have never had an iron or brush that did n't get hot enough.Really a disappointment , because it is otherwise a very nice brush . But what good is a curling brush if it does n't curl ? ?	-1
Was not impressed with it at all . Teeth were too far apart and the heat was really very hot . My hair is a little fine so this did not help me at all . My hair would slip through the teeth and made it hard to use .	-1
I 'm asian and my hair is medium in thickness . My hair uncurls once I get to the other side of my head . I 've used other ones that were better and lasted me more than one day without any sprays . This one might work for you if you have fine hair .	-1
Sorry but these round brushes are terrible for me . I hate the fact that whenever you go to pick the hair out of the brush , the bristles poke underneath your fingernail causing redness and pain . Even worse is that I live with family members who refuse to remove the hair from the brush so ... guess who 's job it is to remove the hair ? Hey *somebody* has to do it and it 's me I 'm afraid . Ugh ! ! !	-1
I can not believe all the good reviews ! UN-pleasantly surprised ! I trusted these reviews and got the brush but it is AWFUL ! The static it causes my hair is unmanageable and the bristles are SHARP and actually hurt my head . I am sending it back asap ! You are better off spending a little more and getting something better quality that is NOT made in CHINA !	-1
I have thick , course , asian/caucasian hair . My hair got stuck in the bristles and it was a total nightmare . I will just use for the bangs where my layers are shorter . Not for long thick hair- atleast did not work for me .	-1
there are a lot of plastic bristles in this brush . cant really recommend it . wouldnt get another one . read description carefully .	-1
I 've been using ceramic brushes for years , so I know they get very hot , but this one does not have a cap at the top , so if you hit yourself anywhere on the face or scalp , you will most definitely burn yourself , and it may scar you . Just a warning to anyone who is considering buying this brush . I 've thrown mine out after burning myself several times in the last few weeks . Every other ceramic brush I 've owned has had a cap at the top to protect from this , but apparently not this brand .	-1
ugh money wasted ... just too small dissappointed . I should have known better . anyone want a brush ? hahaha lol other than that love spornette brand	-1
Really stiff bristles . They are very painful if you scratch your scalp with them and they pull your hair . Get 's caught easily if you are n't careful . Not for fine hair .	-1
Unfortunately I bought $ 35 of it because it was a lower price . It smells like soap , it feels like soap . I 'd never buy this one again . I love the Tuscan Honey and the Oriental , this is the only one I 've been really disappointed it .	-1
I bought this due to the good reviews . I have curly , highlighted hair so it is really dry and needs extra moisture , was looking for something that would detangle my hair and leave it silky soft . I used it twice , the first time was before shampooing and conditioning my hair , the second time I skipped shampooing and co-washed and conditioned my hair , which naturally leaves my hair feeling better any way . Both times was hard combing through my hair , so hard in fact that I stopped and just finished with my normal routine . My hair was nothing like it says moisturized , shiny , smooth ... . Do n't buy not worth it .	-1
Smells delightful , but this made my skin break out terribly . It has wheat derived ingredients , which causes skin irritation for a lot of people . I returned the product for a refund.. Oh well ! Done with you , Burt .	-1
I wanted to switch to natural products so I tried Burt 's Bees . I 'm 24 and have n't had pimples since middle school , but when I started using this a month ago my face popped up with pimples . Most of them have cleared up but the breakouts left marks and discoloration on the side of my face . My face was smoothe and pimple free ; I never had to use powder or foundation . Now , I have to use concealer and pray these marks fade away . Using this product was the worst decision I ever made . To BB 's credit , when I called up to complain on their customer service line , I was refunded the amount .	-1
This Burt 's Bees cleanser left my skin feeling greasier after I used it than it was before.I have normal-oily skin and this is definitely not a good cleanser for that skin type . This cleanser might work really well if you had very dry skin.It does smell nice though .	-1
I 've been using the BB Orange Essence cleanser for a couple of years and had excellent results - fewer blemishes , less dryness and tightness after cleansing , and easy makeup removal . However , I am going to have to discontinue use after the recent recipe change . I 'm not sure what my skin is reacting to , but it 's causing me to develop peeling and swelling around my eyes.I did n't want to jump to conclusions about the product , so I attempted to give it as scientific of a go as I could . I started using the new formula normally , just subbing it into my regular routine . After a few days , the skin under my eyes swelled and began to peel . I did n't immediately decide it was the BB , instead I stopped using all product on my face ( including makeup ) for about a week . The swelling went away . I then started using my usual moisturizer ( ROC ) again , and had no reaction . I wore makeup again and did n't have any reaction . Then I added the BB back into the routine and within two days my under-eye area was reacting again . I 'm going to have to toss this stuff , and I 'm quite disappointed as it was a favorite .	-1
I do not like the consistency of the product . It leaves a very greasy feel after using . Also , I used a toner following washing with this cleanser and there was a lot of face makeup that had not been removed with this cleanser . The smell is okay . Also , it says not to use near your eyes so now I have to have two cleansers anyway . I think I will just stay with Johnson & Johnson 's Purpose which does both and is gentle also . I had just thought I 'd try Burt 's Bees as I like most of their products .	-1
I am not knocking it as a product . The smell was nice and the exfoliation was gently , but it did nothing for my combination skin .	-1
I am ready to throw this in the garbage . Its tooooooooo thick , i am unable to use it , most of it i use to clean my bathroom floor , sink and tub . Maybe I can try again to thin it out with water . I would definitly return it but it was so inexpensive that shipping will cost me more . Dont bother ordering this , words cant express how dissappointed I am with Burts for selling this since I LOVE all their other products . I will be contacting Amazon regarding this product and will keep you all updated .	-1
As an RN , I wash my hands constantly , to the point of extreme dryness . In fact , by the end of the shift , our computer often can no longer read my fingerprints , when I try to access controlled items , because my hands are so dry . And , while on duty , we are NOT permitted to use hand lotion , because it interferes with proper hand washing . So , my hands are screaming for care by the time I get home ; definitely presenting a special challenge . So , keep in mind , this product may work splendidly for those who have not abused their hands to such an extreme.I have been a long-term fan of Kiehl 's Ultimate Strength Hand Salve . It has been the only thing to keep my hand 's hydrated , with a healthy appearance . However , my curiosity was piqued when I saw the great reviews for the Miracle Hand Repair Cream . Kiehl 's is terribly expensive , while the MHRC provides a lot of product , for a reasonable price.The verdict : back to the Kiehl 's for me . I found the hydrating properties of the Miracle Cream to be average , at best , although it does absorb well and is not greasy . Oddly , after a few days of use , though , my hands actually felt a little dryer . I also could not tolerate the smell of the cream . It has a strong 'baby-powderish ' scent , that smells so institutional -- -think hospital , or convalescent center , or that nasty powder odor inside the hospital latex gloves ( if you happen to be familiar ) , that you ca n't even wash off . It just makes me think 'hospital ' when I 'm not there , which is n't a good thing , for me . This again , may not bother others without such an association . I definitely wo n't be using this on my hands again . I 'll probably just delegate the product to my feet , if at all .	-1
It smells bad , does n't work , smells like the worst cheap perfume ever , and I just ca n't get over the smell . IT made me wan na puke .	-1
First : I did not over apply this product . I was being conservative I used less than recommended because I have sensitive skin . After two days of use , I broke out with bad acne at the application site.I can not say whether this works or not for hair regrowth since I stopped using it .	-1
I 've been using Rogaine since it came on the market , but recently noticed that it inflames my scalp and that I 'm losing hair rather than growing more , as well as experiencing dizzy spells after use . In truth , I think Rogaine works in a way similar to a root lifter in that it makes you appear to have more hair when you use it , but when you stop your hair appears much as it did before . The best hair growth was on my face . I 'm blonde and developed peach-fuzz on my cheeks , and single dark hairs on my forehead and cheeks as well as my chin . I 'm post-menopausal and realize that hair growth happens , but since stopping Rogaine I no longer have a facial hair problem , other than an occasional dark hair on my chin . I 'm content to use Pantene Anti-breakage shampoo/conditioner and a styling gel . My hair looks better and is certainly less brittle and dry . It also is a better color than during the years of Rogaine use . Those who are blonde may notice that the roots always look darker when using Rogaine , and hair greys more readily . There are several articles on long-term Rogaine use online , and I think I 've reached the point of diminishing returns with this product .	-1
I used to buy this and use it without lucky . Seems like when I lived in San Francisco it did the trick , but in dry arid Colorado the product is n't rich enough . I could put it on 3-5 times a day and it did n't help . I switched to an organic macadamia nut oil product called Bee Nuts and have had great luck with it .	-1
This is nothing more than a big bottle of liquid soap . You are better off at the dollar store . I tried as a shampoo and it left my hair dull and dry ... even though I diluted it a lot . I tried cleaning with it but it did n't do an adequate job . I tried it as a body wash but again it left my skin dry . I have now resorted to using it for dog shampoo ! would not recommend	-1
I 've tried to work with this soap for a year and am finally ready to donate it out . It was a gift and is almost full . It has a nice scent.I really tried to like this product . It boasts having multiple uses , but it just is n't plausible for me personally.It feels really weird on skin . I do n't like the feeling ( diluted or full strength ) , and I honestly ca n't tell if it cleans or not . I feel like I have to scrub very hard . Diluted seems to not lather at all or feel clean as I 'm using it , and full strength lathers well.It 's too drying for AA coily 3/4 hair ( diluted ) .I do n't think it cleans well enough as a all purpose cleaner for the bathroom ( diluted or full strength ) .I am no way putting soap in my mouth to use as a toothpaste.There 's probably a hundred more uses I could try , but those are the only ones I wanted to consider using it for . It 's useless to me and I 'm glad it was a gift . I would not purchase and honestly feel this product is a bit over-hyped . There are better natural options out there if you need a beauty soap .	-1
Ive been using this for about 2 months and i dont really see a difference . I think this smell is horrible . Very chemical and gross . Also i believe this formula is too liquidy . Hardly a a conditioner . I shouldnt have believed all the hype and wasted $ 17 on this .	-1
Was recently at a salon and bought a bottle because I have trouble with breakage and split ends . I like the smell , but was pretty disappointed with the performance of this product . Did n't notice any difference after using .	-1
I bought this for all the amazing reviews . I do n't like it at all and will not buy again . Does not moisture . Squirts and is too watery !	-1
i like redken 's all-soft heavy cream conditioner so i thought getting a leave-in product from the same line would give equal results but was sadly mistaken . all this product does is make my dry hair look wet , like crunchy , out-of-the-shower , towel dried hair ... .why do i want this look from the 80 's ? it has n't improved my hair at all and the smell is awful . maybe my nose is sensitive but it smelled like a mild perm solution when i first started using it . i guess i 've gotten used to the smell since then and it now just smells like a mildly rancid lemon.i would n't even mind it if it did n't leave my hair looking wet all day , but that 's the last thing i was looking for in a product like this .	-1
I didnt see any difference when using this product = ( i could get netter results from a drug store brand . I would not recommend this product	-1
I used this product devotedly for several years until it became almost impossible to obtain in stores or internet orders . It might even be unavailable ? I switched to another newer self tan product with 15 SPF and found it to be highly superior . The Bain de Soleil Mega Tan had a very drying effect on skin .	-1
I thought this would be a good polish from the reviews , but its not . I had to put on several coats and it still did n't look right . I love Essie polish just not this one .	-1
I am an avid nail polish collector , most of my collection being Essie , OPI and a few China Glaze . I bought this one cause it seamed like a very popular pale , light , delicate pink . But the formula is too streaky for my taste . As much as I love Essie , I do n't particularly like this one .	-1
this color is way too light and to get the white-ish color you have to have 3 coats . The seller is the BESTS ( not the first time I order from them ) but THIS particularly nail polish is not great ... I 'll just stay with Opi & lt ; 3	-1
The fast shipping is the only good thing about this . Even though the bottle says it 's `` mademoiselle '' but it is clearly not the right color . It 's suppose to be a `` classic grown-up pink '' according to Essie 's website . What I got is a beige color and will no way be noticeable on my nails . I bought this hoping to save a bit of money and a trip to the drug store , but do n't waste your time with this . I ca n't even return it now because Amazon says it 's considered hazardous waste . So now I 'm stuck with a color that I did n't even want and is completely useless .	-1
It 's pretty and looks nice , but started chipping very quickly . When it 's actually on and dry it 's not all that different from the milky pink color often used in french manicures . It looked nice when I first put it on , but now I 'm disappointed .	-1
I am pretty disappointed in this color . I was looking for a soft , pale pink shade and thought this might be it . Unfortunately , it is rather nonexistent in any color at all . In the bottle it looks pink but once applied it is little more than a clear color , maybe if I applied 5 coats I would see some hint of the shade . I will continue my search for the right color .	-1
This is not a true red . It is closer to burgundy/ magenta . I have since purchased the OPI Over and Over a Gwen which is a perfect true red .	-1
Part of the black handle was chipped off . I wanted to give this as a gift but could n't because of it .	-1
I am usually a great fan of OpI and never disappointed by the color . Generally what you see is what you get . If your counting on getting a pretty rose color as pictured think again . What arrived was nowhere near the color or color family . It 's more a shade a muted clay mudd . Do n't know if I received something that was accidentally mislabeled or defective . Save your money if your looking for a ros & eacute ; pink .	-1
The only negative thing I have to say is that the color is different to what is pictured on the product listing . The color is actually more pink than purple ( although you can definitely see the purple in the color ) . In the picture , the color looks like a deep purple , whereas in person the color is more of a deep pink , as one reviewer already mentioned . It 's almost like a dark Barbie pink . I almost took a star off for this , but that is more of an issue with the product listing than the actual product . The actual color is a beautiful color , but I wanted the deep purple color in the picture.EDIT : Since posting this review , I have become unhappy with the quality of this polish . This polish is below average in that arena . It dries very , very quickly ( 10-15 mins ) and leaves a nice , smooth finish , but it chips very easily , which I did not expect from a well-known brand like OPI . This polish starts chipping badly the day after application if no top or base coat is used . I have never experienced this with any of the other polishes I have used , even with cheaper polishes that you can purchase from stores like CVS . Even though I typically apply a top and base coat , which would make the polish last longer , I do n't like that a bottle of polish for which I paid nearly $ 6 chips so badly the day after application that it looks like I 've been wearing it for two weeks . I will not be purchasing this brand again simply because I can buy polish for cheaper than $ 6 of equal or better quality - at least as it relates to the chipping issue . I would advise using a very good top coat if you do decide to purchase this polish .	-1
I love OPI nail polish . and i 've ordered many from amazon , and usually they are on point . They look just like the picture . But in this case , I was expecting a Dark bluish toned Gray Matte color and instead I received a Dark Brown with a slight blue tint . I was shocked and thought there was a mistake , but sure enough the name of the nail polish color was the same as advertised . The picture is all wrong . And nail polish is non-refundable . I feel ripped off . False Advertisement.This is not a color I like or would ever buy .	-1
Great grey/black if that 's what you 're looking for but I thought it was going to be more of a navy . My bad .	-1
I am sure that this shade is not as pictured on the website - even making allowances for computer differences . Also , the polish is thick and apparently old . One coat is too thin and two coats is too thick and chips easily . Quite a disappointment . Unfortunately , the return or replace policy is non-existent for a & # 34 ; hazardous & # 34 ; material . I 'm out $ 8.00 with no alternatives .	-1
This arrived today after my husband ordered it because he heard me talking about wanting a blue nail polish . It looks much better online . I do n't know why in person it 's just not as pretty but it 's not . I 'll be returning it . On another note , he surprised me with German-icure and I love it . It 's not as red looking as it looks online but it 's still very autumnee ( I just made that word up haha ) .	-1
I ca n't even use this color ! ! I have to run it under hot water to open , the day it arrived , and you can paint but as soon as you screw the cap on , done ! ! Forget about mixing it between coats !	-1
After reading some of the reviews about OPI nail polish , I became obsessed with the brand . I went to get a manicure and on the SAME DAY ( I 'm not exaggerating ) it chipped from one nail . The manicure did not last me a week ( 3 days tops ) . Very disappointing , waste of money . FYI : When I use Duri or Essie nail polish , it ALWAYS last for more than 5 days !	-1
This beautiful pinkish color looks great on my nails and is the perfect color for the spring and summer . I apply a coat of gelcolor top coat over it put my nails under the curing lite for 2 min and my nails last for almost two weeks without a chip.I feel I must update my review . I have only used this polish two times and it is already going on gloppy ( less than 2 months old ) . It has been sealed tight and stored with all my other polish . My other colors that I bought locally are 2 years old and in better condition than this one .	-1
The color shown on the product page was different from what I received . I was aware of this possibility but took the risk . Turned out it 's yet another lesson not to buy colored nail polish based on online pictures ... ..ah ! !	-1
I 'm a fan of OPI and will continue to buy their nail polish and other products . Italian Love Affair did n't apply nicely on my finger nails as other OPI polishes . It may have been a `` bad batch '' . It went on my finger nails streaky and the color is way too light , even after several coats.If you like a light polish then you may like this . I have n't tried it on my toes yet .	-1
This color was way different than the tutti fruiti opi bottles I bought in the past while my bottle says Tutti Fruit , I put it side by side my old bottle and they are nothing alike.. The color looks nothing like this picture . It 's grossly misrepresented .	-1
I wear red nail polish all the time and liked amazon 's price ! Its hard to tell what a color would be without actually seeing it . Needless to say this was not my style and has been sitting .	-1
I just bought this about a week ago . It 's a strange color . I really could n't descibe it . The color grew on me after a day or so and I kind of liked it . The picture kind of looks like a pink color , but it is n't . What I did n't like was how watery the polish was . I made a mess trying to paint my nails . I hope that not all OPI polishes are like this one . I 'm usually an Essie girl and I think I might just stay with what works for me .	-1
Got 2 OPI nail polishes . It stays one single day . American quality sux sux sux sux sux . Dont waste your money . European rules .	-1
I need something that really covers the grey . This product does n't cover well enough for me , not crazy about the color for medium to darker browns .	-1
This product is extremely watery ( even after a good shaking ) . It seems to be conditioner mixed with a lot of water . I find it difficult to get in my daughters hair before it runs through my fingers ! I have seen no results or an increase in softness or & # 34 ; brushability & # 34 ; for my girls who have long hair . I do n't particularly care for the smell either . I really hoped this would be a good leave in conditioner for a good price , but this was one of those , you get what you pay for scenarios . This reminds me of the concoctions my children make in the tub when they mix a little cheap & # 34 ; suave type & # 34 ; conditioner in water in one of their toy teacups or the hair rinsing container . Do n't waste your money , I will have to buy something else to replace it with .	-1
I have been searching for a leave in conditioner which leaves my hair moist after cool blow drying and this conditioner left me with one conclusion . If you like straw like hair , it 's the right one for you.I 've been using less sulfate based shampoos and instead using Conditioning shampoos along with deep conditioning regularly . This leave in is water based and can be used as a detangler . Otherwise , do n't look forward to moistness and shine you obtain from other leave in conditioners . This does n't live up to the Lacio Lacios or Chi Silk Infusions of this world .	-1
I 'm amazed at all the good reviews people have given this product . This leave in conditioner is SO watery and runny and does n't help detangle or condition hair at all . I knew that it was a liquid leave in conditioner , but I was expecting it to have a slippery feel to it like other leave in conditioners I 've used . This however is just like scented water.I definitely would not recommend this product . Waste of money .	-1
I purchased this product because it was suggested to me . Unfortunately , I saw absolutely no difference in the condition of my relaxed hair after using it . I actually gave it away after two uses to my friend . I 'm not sure if she finished the bottle but I know that she was n't compelled to buy another . If you can try it for free , go for it . I just found that it was n't worth the money I spent on it .	-1
I used this a few times and my hair looked really dirty and greasy afterwards . I wash my hair every other day , and if I use this , the following day my hair looks so greasy that I have to wash my hair a day early . Perhaps my hair is just too fine . I prefer the Bumble and Bumble thickening spray ; it also has the hydrolized protein in it as well .	-1
when i brought this i was originally looking for something to spay in my hair every day but i decided to get this instead it really does n't do anything for my hair and yes i followed the directions and applied heat to my hair after i washed it but i could live without it . i really dont see what it 's doing and i 've tried it a couple of times ... so yeah , but the chi keratin mist does wonders for my hair i love that product but this i wish i could return it but i already used it	-1
I bought some sort of protein treatment from this company years ago and it made my hair hard . But it 's been like 20 years ! So I thought I 'd give this product a try as I 'm always looking for leave-in keratin based treatments for my hair . This was not it.I sprayed it in my damp hair , styled as usual ( braid-out ) , and my hair was crunchy for the rest of the week . Ca n't imagine how it acts when you heat style your hair . I definitely do not recommend .	-1
i dont even know what this does , i bought it hoping it would help keep my hair healthy and cut down on the dryness , over all , it didnt do much for me , invest in something better , although my hair style is curly african american hair	-1
Left a red tint in my light brown hair , didnt cover well and left the hair with a waxy damaged appearance . I know it did not damage my hair , but it exaggerates split ends	-1
I have never tried henna before but by all accounts this is definitely not real henna . As a reviewer said above , it did not stain anything at all , the instructions on the box are poor which implies to me that these people are not real henna sellers ( says mix with cold water -- no measurements at all -- whereas other , better henna products tell you to use a specific measure of warm tea water ) . I used the tea water anyway left this on for two hours and when I was done spent twenty minutes washing all the DIRT and rocks and sediment that was left in my hair . this stuff sucks and the Colora company should be embarrassed to sell such a mockery of a product . My hair was not in ANY better condition than when I started ...	-1
Easy to mix . Very messy . Like Coney Island chili . Keeps dripping from hair , will need a towel to stop drips . Left on more than required time . Time consuming to rinse out . Crumbles all on the floor . Does not color dark brown to black hair at all . Does not cover gray . I 'm still seeing the gray . It only subtly colors hair that is already naturally light or dyed a light honey blonde . The color is barely recognizable . Makes hair tangley . Doubt I will waste any more time with this .	-1
I received this fairly quickly , but this product did *NOT* cover my grays . It slightly lightened up my already colored hair , but that 's about it . It took me over an hour in the shower to rinse off the sand/grit/rocks/cement and even then I 'm not sure I washed it all out . I am not happy with this product , and the fact it did not cover my gray ( waited an hour and a half before rinsing , ) was adding insult to injury , or uncolored white roots to impossible to rinse off product . Very frustrating .	-1
I have used it a couple of times , and it makes my hair look dull . I 'll probably end up throwing it out .	-1
This so called nail polish thinner actually does n't work . I used it to thin many of my nail polish and at a glance , it seemed to work . However , when I actually used them , they were thickened again . It kind of ruined my favorite nail polishes ... so disappointed .	-1
WHen my eyes watered it came right off . no staying power at all . Went on easily but I will not wear it again	-1
I used this according to the instruction and it seems to me that my nails became somewhat more brittle and prone to breaking.Also it gave my nails an unattractive yellowish look.The people who find this works seem to wear nail polish over it . Maybe this makes a difference but it is not mentioned in the product instructions . I do n't typically wear nail polish .	-1
This is basically just a thick clear polish . It doesnt strenghten my nails , if anything it made it worse . It just puts a top layer over my peeling nails . Then when the nail polish starts to come off my nails peel with it . If you are looking for a good clear polish this is for you , but if you are strictly trying to fix your cracking/peeling nails , this isnt the best .	-1
It globs up very quickly and I have only used it twice and it needed to be thrown out . Not happy .	-1
The nail stregthener is suppose to be clear , mine has a yellow tint to it . Unfortunally I accidently throw away the returning label or else I would have returned it to the seller . I am sure the product is great but like I said my has a visible yellow tint to it . Also , it tinited my nails yellow . Seller look into why the product has yellow tint to it .	-1
Good for one day only.And OPI test this product on animals . Not good at all . Poor animals ... ... So never again .	-1
If you did n't study Geology and you do n't know what & # 34 ; cleavage fracture & # 34 ; is , look up Micah . This stuff took off the top layer of my nails pretty far down almost to the quick . It does n't last and does n't effect the quality of the nail polish .	-1
I wish I could give this product ZERO DAMN STARS ! ! ! ! I ordered this piece of crap wanting blue AS SHOWN IN PICTURE . I know it says it matches to your body chemistry , which is cool and everything . I thought it maybe was gon na turn a darker blue or something but NOPE ! ! ! It turned bright , hot pink . If I wanted bright , hot pink , thats what I would have bought then ! ! !	-1
I am extremely disappointing with this one . When I went to use the product is has this horrible fish smell ... I am not one to normally complains about smells.. it was really really bad . I wanted to see if it would work anyway , so I tested it on some lashes ( to see if it would get tacky , never touched my face with it ) and it would n't work at all . I have used this product in the past and I loved it , I have been through many tubes of it . This one was expired and I would honestly call it rancid . I threw it right away . I will buy it at Sally 's where I normally buy it , this seller ships expired products.. not ok ! ! !	-1
I 've been using clear Duo adhesive and it works great , I wanted to try some dark adhesive so I bought this . My lashes were falling off within hours ... not sure if it 's just not as strong but I did ( heavily ) powder my eyelids , a trick I use to keep my liner in place . Duo sticks for at least a day and a half even with the powder , this does n't . I 'll try it without the powder but so far I 'm not impressed .	-1
This did nothing for my hair . I did n't feel moisture or dryness ... just did absolutely nothing . I 'd rather have Suave professionals Conditioner in Rosemary Mint ... amazing especially on Afro textured hair .	-1
My hair type is thick and prone to dryness on the ends . My hair is not overly damaged but this product actually made it feel damaged . I used this product `` correctly '' as another reviewer outlined and still got poor results . There is nothing special about this product , it might as well been from the dollar store . I have used many hair products from cheap to very expensive and this fell way near the lower end . After using it my hair felt straw-like and gross , something I had never experienced even when I do not use conditioner . It did n't even smell good . I could n't find one thing I liked about this product . Will not be buying again .	-1
This worked ok but it was n't anything special nor did it seem to help my skin much . Overall I would not recommend it and it is expensive . I think there are other options for cheaper that you can get .	-1
I loved the oil , but the soap had barely any scent , and felt as though it was going to fall apart in my hands . It was odd shaped and very fragile . Not buying this again .	-1
I really had a hard time rating this product , being that I was allergic to it . It left my face red and stinging . Hope it works for others better .	-1
Thick cream which is helpful for my dry skin but the fragance is too strong in cheap way . Jason needs to make this product without any perfume scent . I use this to supplement my primary moisturizer . It 's only been about 2 weeks , but I have n't noticed any effect to my skin . Overall , I prefer their Vitamin E cream .	-1
The scent is absolutely wonderful . I have baby fine hair and it IS a little difficult to lather up into big suds like other shampoos , but it still cleaned well and made my hair nice and soft . I also used the matching Avalon Lavender Conditioner with good success.Problem is ... when I was diagnosed with Celiac disease , I made HUGE changes to my diet and lifestyle -- more organic , nothing with wheat/gluten , less processed & more natural/raw . This shampoo and conditioner was my treat for this total life make-over I had to do . So the other day when I replaced my shampoo , I noticed a different label on the bottle . I double-checked the ingredients and it now contains hydrolyzed wheat protein when it did not before . So *NOT* that I expect to ingest my shampoo , but it is more worrying to me about getting ANY suds in my eyes , nose , or mouth . It is a risk I am not willing to take.I sent a note via their website asking why they changed the ingredients adding wheat , and that I can not use it now , and this is the response from Sarah , Consumer Relations Representative at The Hain Celestial Group : `` In our efforts to make our products the best they can be , there have been reformulations to some of them . Our consumers help us determine which variations they prefer . We are sorry to hear that you can no longer use this product and we appreciate your feedback . '' Sooooooo , masses of people requested hydrolyzed wheat protein be added to their shampoo ? ? ? I 'm a consumer and I prefer they NOT use wheat in their products.New label photos are included in case anyone else has this concern and prefers not to risk their health with this new `` variation '' .	-1
I have used this shampoo for awhile now and I have to say that it 's just okay . I am a wash and air dry girl , I rarely apply styling products . After using it for more than two washes in a row it tends to not do it 's job so much , I 'll still start to get build-up on my scalp along with dry hair and have to switch to another shampoo and conditioner , then come back to this . The smell however I find is very invigorating , and really wakes you up in the morning , it 's also sulfate free which I find also to be a plus because I do n't like to use a lot of chemicals on my hair . The conditioner that goes with this shampoo is very thick , and very moisturizing so much though that I can not use it on my scalp I can only use it on my ends . When I use it on my scalp I appear to have oil build up by the end of the day . After I finish using what I have I doubt I 'll ever buy the combination again .	-1
Normally , I love Avalon 's products , and their commitment to using lots of organic and sustainable ingredients . But they have to work well , and this just doesn't.This shampoo smells great , but left my hair incredibly dry . With my fine , oily hair , that is a problem that I 've never had before . I never use conditioners , because I 've just never needed them before , but with this shampoo , you 'd better have some handy !	-1
I recently replaced all of my personal care items with organic versions , and tried this shampoo for my long hair . I do not recommend . It is very drying , and the essential oils in the shampoo left my scalp terribly itchy . Within a couple of days of ceasing use of the product , my scalp returned to normal . Acure Organics are much more moisturizing .	-1
Scent is lovely but it last until you blow dry it or when your hair air dries . Not worth the price I purchased it for the scent .	-1
I was hoping for better results from this product . I do n't feel like it makes my hair stronger nor does it help with thinning hair . I feel like I have to use a lot more of this shampoo just to get a good lather . I will not buy this again .	-1
I wish I had been able to try this out or at least smell it before I bought it . I knew it was going to smell herbal based on the ingredients , but I barely got the lid off the container before it brought tears to my eyes . I returned this to the store . Normally I like Burt 's Bees but this is just too pungent !	-1
I read the reviews and researched this item along with the 5 % one . Decided to go with the ore potent one expecting it to have quicker results . nNothng has changed in the condition of my skin ... the allergic food reaction that has resulted in cystic acne just below my collar bone are still there . I am dissapointed in this product and will not buy again .	-1
Pretty sure it caused my face to breakout so I stopped using it . I do not recommend . It is Very cheap .	-1
It seemed to break me out after using . I was only applying every other day in the interest of acclimation . I had better results using a glycolic wash previously . I think maybe this was just too strong and staying on my skin a longer period of time did not agree .	-1
Let me start off this review by saying that I am basing my rating on how it works as a hairspray , not on how `` natural '' it is . I gave it two stars because it smells nice and it 's probably a little better than using nothing , but I 'm sitting here only 4 hours after curling my hair and I have almost completely straight strands.I live in a dry climate , so humidity was n't the issue . My hair does lose curl pretty fast though . I 'd say it 's worth a try if your hair `` likes '' being styled/curled , but if you need something for stubborn hair , this is n't it .	-1
I was using this product along with Desert Essence Tea Tree Cleansing Pads ( [ ... ] ) and at first , I noticed that I felt a bit of a burn and discomfort from both products . I tried using the products separately as well as together , and thought that maybe it was normal . However , after a few days of using this product , I ended up getting a severe burn all over my face , and broke out into a very painful rash.It started out as just a prickly pink , then went itchy and red , and eventually broke out into a severe burn , and was extremely painful and peeled for several days . It took weeks for my skin to stop feeling sensitive and raw.I 'm not sure why my face reacted this way , but I 'm really sad that it did , because I had been searching high and low for an all natural facial product , and all of my searching on Amazon pointed to this .	-1
This is a descent , thick moisturizer . I usually really like Dessert Essence products so I was excited to try it . It leaves my skin feeling a little bit greasy . It also smells like pee , literally . I 'm not just exaggerating a bad smell . It really smells like pee . If they could fix the smell , I would probably give this product 3 stars .	-1
Another high expectations , and high disappointment . Yes , that ` s great cream for 4 dollars , and if you have an oily skin , because it doesn ` t really moisturize . I have a combination skin , but after washing it gets tight . This cream sinks after a while in the skin , but I have the same feeling of dry skin later . It has no glide.Now I use it for the body , after adding few drops or aromatherapy oils . I won ` t purchase again .	-1
I purchased my first jar on special at Whole Foods . It was a great price and a nice sized jar . However , the product is not good for my skin . I 've been using it for a month and , in the last few weeks , I 've had a horrible rash that burns like my face is on fire . I could not figure out what it was until I used some of the moisturizer tonight ( to soothe the rash . After a minute or so , my face started to break out in a bright red rash and my skin was on fire . I immediately washed it off and applied an ice pack . It still is inflamed but not stinging anymore . After research , I realized that it contains sodium hydroxide ( or lye ) which is extremely caustic . I do n't know what the manufacturers were thinking !	-1
I had been using the AD and E creamy cleanser by earth science but wanted to try this one as I thought it would help clear my skin up . I do not have bad acne , only a few spots here and there that generally go away in a few days.This cleanser first off smells horrible . I read the ingredients but still ca n't place the smell . Very chemically though Second it stings and dries my skin . Perhaps it is old or perhaps not even the actual product . I t was slightly open when it arrived and leaked a little , I should have just sent it back or thrown it out.I have n't ever had a problem with this brand and will not order from here again . I will stick to either the company site or another site that I normally use ( vitacost ) .Very unhappy , so is my face since it was irritated . And my nose for smelling this stuff.I did n't notice anything in the ingredients that I have n't seen/used in other products at one time or another so I do not know why the smell.Product is also too running and not very & # 34 ; gel like & # 34 ; as a cleanser should be .	-1
I have acne prone , oily skin . But this was way too drying . I have since learned to use gentle cleansers ( soap free ) on my face and my skin has improved greatly ! I actually thought of hanging onto this for emergencies ( when I 'm out ) but this is really not that great for anyone 's skin in my opinion . I now use a cleansing balm that is mostly oil based and my skin is soft , smooth , kind of glowy , with smaller pores ( because they are happier ) , and less wrinkles due to the drying cleansers of my past . Including this one .	-1
I order the black toiletry bag , but received a brown one . The zipper did not glide smoothly and the leather was stiff .	-1
This does not do what it promises to do . I did not notice anything when I applied the serum . I am still on the search for a true firming and lifting cream or serum .	-1
I used for 2 months and saw no results or change in skin firmness	-1
I have been using DMAE cream and wanted to add a serum to my daily regemine . This is not it . It is very sticky and pills up on the skin . It is very drying . Be forewarned , this is one of those products that can not be returned .	-1
Not sure if this really does anything it claims . Everytime I use it , I say to myself what is it supposse to do becuase I do not see any kind of improvement . Firming ? ? ? Hmmm ... ..Am I missing something here ? Ok I tried it but will not waste my money on ordering it again .	-1
They have changed the packaging ... .. and the formula . I used to love this stuff . If ordering this product , you will receive the new product in it 's new packaging . Amazon needs to update the photo . This new formula includes a wide spectrum sunscreen . That sounds really good , but this new formula is so oily . I mean it 's just downright greasy on the face . I would n't even recommend for someone with dry skin . Dry skin needs moisture not grease.Further , it does n't cover imperfections and dark circles as well as the old formula . I used to use this one product as a foundation and under eye concealer . It did a great job . If wanting to cover darkness from scars and really dark circles , this formula wo n't do it . It will lighten , but not cover . It also transfers very easily . What a waste of my 31 bucks . A disappointment too , because now I have to find a new foundation ... and concealer .	-1
I have used before and ordered Suntan but this time Suntan is a strange color . I will return and try to order color again hoping it will match .	-1
It does n't blend well and it dry very quickly plus it very light for my skin . I do n't recommend it for anyone and it too expensive ! ! !	-1
I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT AND IT WASNT THE REAL . I GUESS THEY MIXED SOMETHING ELSE IN THERE THATS NOT DERMA BLEND . I PUT THE PRODUCT ON AND IT CAME OFF IN TWO SECONDS ALSO THE PRODUCT RUB OFF ALL OVER MY HOME . DO NOT BUY !	-1
I first tried this product 6 months ago to cover my greys which I do n't have a lot of ( 5 % of my hair ) but since I have dark hair the greys are very noticeable . The first time I tried it I left it on my hair for 30 minutes as indicated and after rinsing it I realized every single grey hair was still there ! just as shiny and white as before . I used this on virgin hair and I do n't use hair products or even conditioner so I did n't have any build up that could interfere with coloring process . I figured that maybe it was because I had bought tint and left it in my bathroom for 6 months before I used it - but it was still over a year away from expiration.I decided to give this tint a second try today , fresh bottle just bought 4 days ago , made sure hair was saturated , this time I left the tint on for 45 minutes like another review had suggested and after rinsing..still grey/white hair ! ! not even a bit tinted.I was so looking forward to hiding my greys with a product free of most chemicals found in other tints but I was hugely dissapointed .	-1
Never actually used but returned this product and bought something in a local health food store . I know many woman like this shade , but seeing it online I did n't notice that is was that shade . I should have known based on the name Mahogany , so this was my mistake and does n't reflect the product itself .	-1
I got this to make my brown hair look darker . It does look exactly like in the photo unfortunately . It was way blacker than I was hoping for , it 's a Jet Black . I just hope it will fade away and be lighter over time . I want to go lighter I think next time .	-1
I purchased this product at my local health foods store . I have light brown hair and I was attempting to lighten it a little bit , about 2 shades -- nothing major . On the box there is a photo showing a medium brown shade going up to a golden blonde , about a 4 shade difference.Well , I used this product as directed and there was absolutely no change in color . Not only that , but it left my hair feeling brittle and dry.BTW , this product is labeled as organic . According to the most recent issue of Consumer Reports magazine , there is no such thing as `` organic '' when it comes to beauty products . Meaning , there are no federal standards whatsoever , and any company can label its beauty product as organic , when , in fact , no organic ingredients are in the product whatsoever .	-1
OMG this product name/claims make it APPEAR to be & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ; , but its made out of horrible chemicals : ... . Claims & # 34 ; No Ammonia , No resorcinol , No parabens & # 34 ; So what ? ... it contains : peg-2 oleamine , aqua ( purified watter ) , cocamide dea , alcohol denat ( alcohol ) , propylene glycol , oleic acid , ethanolamine , p-phenylenediamine ( TOXIC ! ! ) , sodium sulfite , tetrasodium edta , hydrolized vegetable proteine , sodium erythorbate , n , n-bis ( 2-hydroxythyl ) -p-phenylenediamine sulfate , 2-amino-4-hydrohyethylaminoanisole sulfate 1 , 4-chlororesorcino ... blah , blah , blahIt fried my hair so badly I can not even brush it . wth . Also , this color has an orange tone . O-R-A-N-G-E. Like a pumpkin . Only on crack . I would sooner shave my head than EVER use this product again . Naturtint , you are NOT anything near natural , you suck . People , do n't use products that can harm you , cause & # 34 ; allergic reaction & # 34 ; , seizures , coma or death . Just the ingredient PPD alone is enough to make me say : Naturtint , you SUCK . DO NOT BUY ! DO NOT USE ! Unnatural color . Unnatural ingredients ! Huge red flags ! So glad they claim to not test on animals , but now I look like a damn pumpkin . On crack .	-1
This so-called `` natural '' hair color still contains the 3 most toxic ingredients : Resorcinol , p-Phenylenediamine , and phthalates in the parfum . I am appalled that this is even considered `` safer '' . wow ... .Google any of these ingredients and you will get an eye-opener . No wonder they do n't list the ingredients on the box.From the online ingredient list : Parfum ( Fragrance ) . ( +/- ) p-Phenylenediamine , 4-Amino-2-Hydroxytolueno.p-Aminophenol , 2-Methyl-Resorcinol , m-Aminophenol , 4-Chloro Resorcinol , N , N-Bis ( Hydroxyethyl ) -p-Phenylenediamine Sulfate , 2-Amino-4-Hydroxy-Ethylaminoanisole Sulfate .	-1
I had really bad luck with this product . I used it for the first time yesterday , and , even though I followed all of the directions and even contacted their customer service for advice before dying , it left me with bright orange `` hot roots '' and left my hair feeling very damaged and dry.I bought this in the Terracotta Blonde color ( 7C ) . Before purchasing it from Amazon , I went to the Naturtint website to check out the color chart , and then found it locally so I could see the color chart in person . Since I still was n't sure what color to get and was trying to go to a lighter red than my current color , I emailed a photo of my hair to Naturtint 's customer service email . Someone emailed me back right away with two suggested colors -- and so they definitely have excellent customer service ! This color contain hydrogen peroxide , which means that it can lighten your hair over time . If you want to move to a lighter shade , you can use Naturtint to do so gradually , by slowly going down two shades at a time . The peroxide , however , is probably what makes this so drying on your hair ; it left my hair feeling awful afterwards.That being said , when I rinsed this out of my hair , it took forever to rinse and burned my eyes really badly as I was rinsing it out . It also left my hair feeling like straw , and I had very healthy hair to begin with . Even after using their shampoo and conditioner , my hair felt awful , so I did a deep treatment with one of my own hair masques , and that seemed to help a bit . Overall , though , my hair feels really dry and straw-like , and I had a lot of residual color left on my towels and pillowcase last night , which I 've never had before.When I told my stylist that I was going to start dying my own hair again , she said just to do an all-over color every four or five or so colorings when doing box color , and just touch up the roots in the meantime . I 'd like to do so , but this seems to be so damaging to my hair that I 'm not sure I want to use it again . Before now , I was using Robert Craig color , which left my hair in much nicer condition , but was more of a pain to use because you have to measure and mix up the color . I might go back to RC color , depending on how my hair recovers after I try to baby it the next few weeks .	-1
I wanted to try this product because I was looking for a non-ammonia permanent product . I have tried Naturcolor and Tints of Nature ; both of these have strengths and weaknesses I wo n't discuss here . Anyhow this brand seemed to have a loyal following that extended for years , so I thought I would try it . It contains monoethanolomine which is still an ammonia but without a smell ; it 's still a toxic substance . The product had another type of smell which was like wet wool and not very pleasant . The gray did n't cover and the color came out too warm .	-1
Not only did I get sent the completely wrong color ( ordered 8C Copper Blonde , a ginger color , and got sent 10N Light Dawn Blonde , PLATINUM ? ! ) , but it was so poorly packaged that one of them ( ordered 2 ) exploded . Now Amazon wants me to go out and purchase another box , bubble wrap , and tape , print out a label , and send the other one back . Um , the cost or those materials alone will be more than the worth of the item ! Looks like I 'll be going to another popular online drugstore to order my hair color . At least those people can read and use common sense that LIQUID items need bubble wrap !	-1
August 28 , 2012I just threw away my second brush . The replacement brush lasted only four months . I love this brush , but it should last longer than eight or four months . I am looking for another brand , but it makes me sad . This is the best brush I have ever used , but two brushes in one year worn to uselessness is just too much . I can not understand the problem , but it seems to me it is how the bristles are attached to the padding . The balls break off and then the whole bristle pushes into the padding.May 17 , 2012 Updated Review : Half the end balls were gone and the entire center of the brush have broken off . It lasted eight months . I have just retired it and started the replacement they sent me when I emailed them that the balls were disappearing at a fast rate . Good brush , good company , very short lifetime of use.January 31 , 2012 , Updated Review : I took the suggestion of a person who commented on my review and emailed the company . Within five days I had a new brush in the mail . Wow ! I am so impressed with the Phillips company . Few companies just make it right anymore . I would suggest buying Phillips company products because not only do they make great products , they stand behind and make any problems right . I wish more companies had this old fashioned ethic.December 31 , 2011 Original Review : I adored this brush and still like it very much . I have never had a brush I liked so very much . Unfortunately , I am already losing the balls on the ends of the brush that keep the bristles from scratching . I have had it four months and have lost three end balls . I think that by the time I have had it a year I will have lost at least 12 end balls . I am severely disappointed and surprised about this . So maybe another brush would be a better choice .	-1
I bought this brush based off the amazing reviews on amazon but im failing to understand why . I 've had this brush for over a year and it just sits in my drawer . I have long hair with average thickness and this did n't impress me at all.Pros : Good weightComfortable handleCons : Adds staticHard to cleanNot preferred for wet hairAverage detangling abilityLackluster designI think the biggest selling point is that the brush lasts forever ... well since then newer brushes have been made that imo outperform this standard design . I now use tangle teezer ( also sold on amazon ) and it detangles my hair without any pulling , does n't give my added static , less hairloss , and is great on wet or dry hair ! If you 're looking for longevity then consider this brush but if you 're looking for performance then go with tangle teezer .	-1
I did n't really like it ... : / It did n't meet my expectations . It just felt too rough on my scalp and hair . Ended up giving it away .	-1
The brush worked very well ; however , the tips are so sharp that they created cuts on my scalp . This is totally unacceptable . Replaced with Cricket brand which has nice round tips .	-1
I have fine , straight hair down to my armpits . I wanted to love this brush because it had great reviews . However , I tried a couple times and each time it just got stuck and twisted in my hair . I thought I was going to have to cut it out once ! If you have shorter , thicker hair I could see how this could work . It just depends on your hair type I suppose .	-1
I ca n't seem to get over the feeling of washing my face with Tang . I was hoping for a cleaner citrus smell . I did continue to use the product to see if I could sense the benefits of the brightening , renewal , and ascorbic acid anti aging properties . And I 'm sorry to say , I have n't noticed a difference in a month of using this product . I will not be purchasing again .	-1
I 've been using this for 2 months and it 's nothing great . I have normal skin . Occasional break outs . This did n't do anything for me . At all ... I get better results from my black African soap and it does n't have as many chemicals as this .	-1
I am a disappointed in this , it doesnt really make my skin feel as clean as I would like . Vitamin C products work great on my skin , but this doesnt seem to have any affects of vitamin C. I would recommend this product	-1
Kelp face wash has a horrible smell , I could not stand it - I am washing my feet with it . It also dries your skin a lot , and I did not like how my face felt after that . I am not buying this again .	-1
Too stiff . I ca n't use this , not even when it 's wet . It feels like it 's scratching my skin , and feels terrible . I 'll save it for scrubbing walls or something .	-1
This thing did nothing for me . Cheaply constructed and did not solve the problem I wanted it to solve . Wo n't buy this again .	-1
I can barely smell the rose scent- it 's very diluted . The smell also changes to something very unpleasant on the skin , hair or anything else that 's being sprayed on after a while . Wo n't purchase again .	-1
Terrible product . It made my hair green . I could n't believe it . And it dried my hair really out a lot . All my natural locks were gone and I looked awful . did n't even want to leave the house any more . It took almost 14 days to get rid of that green color and to get some shine and elasticity back into my hair . Never again .	-1
i did n't expect the outcome to be orange . i expect healthy hair and shine.. yeah , whatever ... too much praise for this product . i hate it ...	-1
If you want to add red to your hair or better yet , turn your hair red then this is the product for you . It did n't cover any of my gray hair , turned a lot of my hair red and left some of it brown ... .so I looked like a ridiculous rainbow . I had to dye it all over again with something else !	-1
I bought this from a beauty supply store . It was very muddy/grainy and hard . It was also hard to apply and did n't stick to my hair . I left it in for HOURS , like about 6 . When I washed it out , which did n't take as long as others said but was still a dirty job , my hair was not covered . It looked a little darker but the gray came back within DAYS . Usually when I wash my hair , the grays disappear and then when it dries , there they are - once the leave-in conditioner is gone . The SAME thing happened with this `` henna '' . I do n't know much about henna , but this did n't seem to be a good quality product . Anyway , that was 6 or 7 hours of my life that I will NEVER get back . WASTE of TIME . Save your money .	-1
It did make my hair soft the first time I used it but after it dried it was really hard and stiff . To me it was not worth the time and mess spent .	-1
I am a long time user of Henna products . I wanted to try this one to hopefully get a redder tone and I mean an `` apple red '' shade . I usually use the Harvest Moon Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams , but wanted to try this brand , hoping for a different red.My natural hair color is medium brown , but since I 've been using henna for a while , my hair was a light red ( and I mean RED , not copper ) . Since it was time for a new dye application , I thought I 'd give this brand a try . I certainly should not have done it.The directions say to use boiling water when making the paste . You can also try Red Zinger tea instead of water , to make it a deeper red . I did n't try that , I used boiling water . You can use the paste on clean dry or damp hair.My hair came out a light to medium copper . Last time I checked , copper is NOT red . Yes , I know ... I 'll be told that my hair color was already red and that 's why it came out copper . NOT SO ! I have been using henna for so long , that I 've never had a brand change my red hair color . EVER ! Extremely disappointing in the results . I had hoped for a deeper red , instead a got an almost dark strawberry color , which is a miracle ( and not a good one ) considering my hair was red in the first place.If you 're looking for a true red for your hair , this brand is not it . I will stick with Harvest Moon .	-1
this was my first time using a henna product of any kind so I wo n't give the product a 1 star because its always possible i didnt do something right ( even though its just add water ) the product smells like cooked spinach which isnt pleasant at all but its natural so i went with it hoping that when it dried the smell would go away , no such luck . also the product didnt rinse out - after rinsing and repeating until my hair felt stripped i just twisted and air dried , the next day i still have what looks like coffee grinds in my hair - gross ! ! and the biggest disappointment of all is my hair is not red - i wore a heat cap for 60 mins and there is no red in my hair - i started with a medium shade of brown and i feel like it looks darker than when i started which is okay because i ordered the dark drown too , but i think i will try a different company before i give the spinach head a go again .	-1
I have n't used witch hazel as a facial toner before , but based on the reviews I thought I 'd give it a try . After a couple of weeks , I can say I do n't really see that it has helped to soften my skin . And if I had known how awful witch hazel smelled , I definitely would 've tried one of the many scented witch hazel products out there instead ! I 'm going back to using the Avalon lavender facial toner and this will go in the cabinet to try on bug bites in the future .	-1
My hair type , very fine . Was damaged after using this product . It might work for others .	-1
I returned the product because I noticed the box listed the Phenylenediamine ( PPD ) chemical known as coal tar , which may cause a flare up ( or irritation ) of asthma or a dermatitis-type skin rash . This product may work for others , however .	-1
I lost so much hair ! I followed the instructions of this product since it was my first time using it . I went to rinse it out , and my hair started falling out in clumps . I used the included conditioner as suggested which did make my hair soft , but did not help with the hair loss.This made my hair prone to breaking off once dried , and also caused me to lose about two handfuls of hair in the process of washing the dye out . I did not experience any burning of the scalp while I had the dye in my hair so I have no clue what would cause this type of reaction.I hope this review helps anyone thinking of trying it . Beware !	-1
Maybe you need to use all the products together to get results but I felt that I spent money on this for no reason.I really never noticed a difference while using this product .	-1
This product feels great when you put it on . However , when I went to comb out my wet hair afterward , I found that it was a tangled mess , especially at the ends . I would have probably broken off half my hair while trying to comb it out if I had n't used a leave-in conditioner to help de-tangle it . So even once my hair is dry , I wo n't really be able to tell how well this product worked since there is so much leave-in conditioner in my hair now . This is going in the garbage . My hair is too fragile to risk more breakage .	-1
I purchased this at Fruitful Yield . I read all the great reviews online . I decided to try it on a cyst under the skin . Right after rubbing my finger on it to soften it up and get some on my finger I started sneezing . I put it on my skin anyway thinking it was just a few sneezes . My eyes welled up , throat felt dry and the sneezing continued . I really wanted to try this stuff so I thought I 'd muster through the reaction but it was getting worse . Within 10 minutes I washed it off with soap and water . The allergic reaction stopped . I looked up the ingredients and I am not sure what I am allergic to . I have been exposed to most of the ingredients before except maybe ichthammol , so I 'm just not sure . Who knows since companies put so much crap in everything - I guess I have n't put a marigold up to my nose since I was a kid , so I suppose I could be allergic to those too ( one of the ingredients of this stuff ) . Anyway , I ca n't use it , that is why I gave it two stars . I will keep it around to use on the kids or pets and if I find it helps with anything , I will update my review ! I sure would like to know what in it I am most likely allergic to if anyone has any ideas .	-1
I do not give one stars very often at all . But this stuff was just weird . I put this on a wound that had formed a scab and it caused the scab to come off . There was then a hole in my chest where the scab had been . Is that what this product is supposed to do ? I threw this product away . It was very yucky . I got it to help heal wounds and it seemed to make them worse . I would not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
Iodex is becoming both increasingly scarce and expensive . I should have bit the bullet and bought another jar of Iodex instead of this crap . Nothing draws infection out of and heals a wound like Iodex .	-1
Maybe its me but this product doesnt seem to work at all , I had a few splinters and it did nothing for them .	-1
This did not work at all	-1
Let me preface this by saying that this does not work with hard water . I 'm pretty sure others have mentioned this , but since it 's the primary reason for this review , I have to say it again . I gave this shampoo bar 2 weeks . During that time , my hair was somewhat thicker , but it was also constantly filled with static , and just seemed really dry ( which is weird , because I normally have oily hair ) . The fact of the matter is that SLS was pretty much created to work well with hard water -- and it does . I pretty much have no choice but to continue to use my regular shampoo . I 'm sure this shampoo probably works great with soft water , but since I do n't have soft water , I ca n't really say . I only know it did n't work for me .	-1
At first the product worked great . Then over time the water started turning cloudy and had a funny smell . Would not repurchase and would definitely not recommend .	-1
Fake rose smell , it was pleasant . This just was n't the toner for me . Made my face worse with this and Neutragena Oil Free Acne Wash .	-1
I actually think this makes my skin blotchier/reddier . Would not recommend ! I have combination skin with an oily t-zone . This would be perfect for dry/normal skin , but it did nothing with mind and only made it blotchy .	-1
I was looking for a natural toner to replace my favourite Humphries - I saw that there were many good reviews for this one and considered buying it until I looked at the ingredients.It contains Butylene Glycol & Methylparaben which have been flagged by the skincare website as damaging and carcinogenic to skin cells.I am sorry , but this is just not natural enough for me .	-1
I Love Rose Scent but ... .I had to literally throw this away ! The scent ... . was so STRONG ... it gave me a headache ! I have never had trouble with any product where the Rose scent was too strong !	-1
it 's rose smell does the work for 'rose toner ' but the result i got.. was n't as what i expected . i bought this product because one of my friend is using it . she uses it well and recommended to me . since we both have sensitive skin and so i thought this should be good for me ... yet who knows each individual is still different . my face started to have break-out and i patiently use it for about 6 months.. nothing gets better . not even toning feel . and the cap is so loose that whenever i accidentally flip over , it spilt all the time . now i just keep it aside and using Neutrogena from drug store . it 's cheap and so i think you get what you paid for .	-1
I dont know if they changed the formula , this felt different from previous 2 bottles that I used.It burnt my skin ! ! ! Also the smell was little bit different from previous ones .	-1
I am alergic to this thing ! ! I used rose body lotions before and never feel this bad . And the smell is completely artificial , very unnatural and too too strong ! ! ! Now I 'm even sure if I 'm allergic to rose water or just the fragrance thing . I really do n't dare try any rose water afterwards ... ..I think I will stick with prodicts with allergy test .	-1
I have very dry skin others commented on how great product was they didnt even need moisturizer . Well if you have dry skin you do not want to use this it is VERY drying . Had to stop using .	-1
This product burns my skin , I do n't know if it was tampered with . It 's supposed to be alcohol free but something is not right with the formula . I used the cucumber version and it does not burn and feels great . I am going to contact Thayer to see if I got a fake product , if so there will be big problems with the seller .	-1
I am very disappointed with this product because I see nothing great . I used to use Bulgarian rose water purchased from amazon as my toner . It used to tighten my pores and give me a good fresh feeling . Also my skin looked great when i was using it . I tried this for a change and nothing great infact i broke out after using it . Not liking this product	-1
I was very excited to try this toner , it 's all natural and the price is good . I also read so many good reviews that I was confident about my purchase . I was first very disappointed by the smell . It smells like roses , kind of , but like an old grandma 's flagrance . Fortunately the smell does n't last , but I quickly realized that the toner made my skin very oily , even if I do n't have oily skin and I started to breakout after a week . Not great ... I 'll look for something else .	-1
I was excited to get this toner because I 've heard so many good things about the Thayers face toner . I cleansed my face and then put some on a cotton ball and applied it and it set my face on fire ! ! I did n't understand because it 's all natural ingredients , even pure Aloe Vera which is soothing and is n't supposed to burn . Witch Hazel is also soothing and it has all natural ingredients , even the Rose is a natural fragrance not like the fragrances they put in all other kinds of products . So I called Thayers and they said that it should definately not burn your face at all and could be counterfeit . I let the seller know about this and they are looking into their supplier . You have to be very careful about the counterfeits on here as I ran into some already .	-1
The lavendar witch hazel is so much better . The rose smell made me sick after the second use and I did n't see the results I had when using the Thayer witch hazel-lavendar .	-1
I 've purchased this particular perfume at department stores for a few years now since the fragrance smells great ( fresh , does n't make you want to sneeze ) , and decided to get it from Amazon since it was cheaper . It does n't smell exactly like the one in stores ( although it smells similar ) , which makes me think it could be fake ( or watered down ? ? ) . The perfume fades quickly which is strange since I 've only needed a spray or two of this perfume in the past , and it stays on for a long time . I would n't buy this from Amazon again , and would n't recommend anyone buy this from Amazon .	-1
Nice spray , but as I have arthritis in my hands , the deodorant cream spray was too large for me to use . Nivea Rool-on and Ban Roll-on deodorant are better for me -- both available on Amazon ! I especially like the Nivea Roll-on as I have sensitive skin !	-1
I have had a Diamon Deb file for about 30 years and this new one is n't a good as my old one , even tho it is old . The quality is n't the same .	-1
My constantly itching ear may be caused by something different from most here ... my dr can not seem to figure it out -- I have tried anti fungals , antibiotics and steroids..and now this stuff ... .I really had no effect from it at all , other than grease on my pillow ... I dont wear hearing aids ... I dont know what it is , but this didnt help	-1
I never usually pay over $ 2 for a bottle of nail polish since I generally just use it on my young daughter who likes to change her nail color often . I purchased this at a store for about $ 6 and am sorry that I did . It may be a $ 6 bottle of nail polish , but I have $ 2 bottles of nail polish that 's better than this . You have to apply multiple coats to get the full color of this silver polish ... And even after you 've done that , it chips very easily . I only gave it 1 star because I had to ... Its a waste of money , IMO .	-1
I still love china Glaze polish but this is hideous . It 's sheer frosty pink on it 's own - over clear basecoat or natural nails ... .BUT It 's totally purple ... if you paint it over any other color , no matter how light or dark - it paints over solid/opaque . I thought from the sheerness of the polish in the bottle and the way it is on=screen , it would be a topcoat look with kind of rainbow of colors depending on the light or reflection . BUT it paints over as a frosty purple/lavender . I even tried it over Zoya Verushka which is a matte velvet dark forest green on it 's own . Frosty purple , no hint of forest green-same with paint over candy cane red , dark burgundy , over pale pink or super bright pink , over Audrey Blue , Recycle Grey-you get frosty purple ! . You can tell there 's a dark color underneath but just barely , and certainly no forest green or any other specific color . On it 's own , it 's a frosty pink that looks like it could be a topcoat and changes color but not in a good way because it 's all rainbows of pink , pink , pink-nothing else , no rainbow . On everything else it just obstructs and ruins any decent color you have on your nails by making it purple . It 's just awful.They really missed the mark on this one - the least they could do is tell you what color the polish is . I 'm really fed up with looking at a gazillion web sites to try and find out what one nail color is supposed to be so I can buy it from the manufacturer or a seller on Amazon . Why ca n't the sellers give us a clue ? Obviously the trendy thing to do is name your polish something fun or funky or crazy that has little to do with the actual color , and then the manufact . gives descriptions ( and sellers ) that are stupid , like `` if you 're a such-and such person ... '' `` If you like fast cars ... '' WHAT ? How about `` If you like bright pink glittery polish '' after all , we are buying POLISH ! How about telling us if it 's a metallic , a frost , a cream , is it opaque or sheer , or , let 's see WHAT COLOR IS IT ! ! ! ! I know ... do n't buy it online ! Here 's the thing - first of all , everyone buys online these days so that 's no excuse . Second , because of my illness , I ca n't get out much , hardly ever , so I depend on online to get pretty much everything . I appreciate that I can finally get polish online but since the prices are typically ridiculous , and get more pricey all the time , and then the shipping cost is inexcusable in most cases , and then add to that the more and more stringent return policies that make it not worth returning , and the least they could do is give a three word description.Name Sheer or Opaque Metallic/Frost/Creme/Glitter Color or Color FamilyI mean they have to tell us on the bottle what the ingredients are but nobody has to tell us what color it is when you put it on your nails ? And then so-called Nail Polish/Beauty Supply stores online do n't tell us anything , while making it impossible to return anything . Your only hope is that someone somewhere bought it and has the time and energy to write a review that tells you about the actual polish , not just the brand or the seller.Kudos to ZOYA and Art Of Beauty for being the one and only manufacturer/site who tells you exactly what you are getting from the polish on their website . Shame on any seller online who sells Zoya and is too lazy to copy the information about the colors of polish when they sell it on Amazon.Sorry for raging against the polish companies and online sellers but NOBODY should waste $ 5- $ 15 a bottle on what could be purple , red , pink , brown , who knows what color - you just have to hope your screen is close to the color and if you hate metallic or frost or creme , you can cross your fingers and hope it is n't the one kind you hate , and if you need opaque , you can hope it is n't sheer , but good luck on that one too.Ultimately , it 's my own fault for buying a color called `` Rainbow '' that looked like a sheer topcoat that is a wierd sheer pink frost on it 's own and lavender frost that is opaque with one coat if you paint it on ANY color.I hope this helps all of you who do n't want to waste money on a pink frost/purple frost polish when you are looking for a cool topcoat to give a different finish to your other polish , or are looking for an interesting sheer polish that is n't just clear , but changes colors in the light . And I hope it helps anyone looking for a sheer pink Frost polish/ or Lavender Frost opaque topcoat and ca n't find it ... here it is , no thanks to anyone in the business .	-1
I purchased this dryer to replace my old , old , old hair dryer . My previous dryer was great but it just stopped working after many year . So it was time for a new one . This dryer has two speeds low and high nothing in-between , ok I did not like that feature but I can live with that , what I did not like at all was the fact that the vents were only on the top of the hood so there is no air flow around the sides of your head . There other featured I was totally displeased about was the fact that you can NOT adjust the hood at all its either up or down . I do n't know about you but when I dry my hair , the dryer goes on the table and I site facing the dryer and it would be nice to adjust the hood so it does not feel like half your hear is not being dried . I did try to face fwd but it is still to high and I do n't feel that I am fully under it comfortably . I had put something under it so it would tilt forward . Mind you my table is NOT that high and it your average hight table . Unfortunately I normally wear my hair curly and did not bother to open the box and inspect it until now ( 4 months later ) so it is to late to returen it which makes me want to kick myself for that . My old dryer was from Conair and being that I loved it so much I figured I would love this one just as much , NOT the case at all . I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this crap .	-1
Dryer does not dry my hair well at all . I can sit under it a full hour , and my hair in some sections will still be dripping wet . Total waste of money .	-1
EDIT : I stopped using this because I just could n't justify the expense , and honestly I think my skin looks BETTER without it . This product , though refreshing and pleasant to use , does n't do much for the quality of my skin . I am going to use up the rest of my bottle by `` setting '' my makeup with a spritz - otherwise I wo n't be repurchasing.I love this toner ! It is hydrating , smells lovely , and really helps my moisturizer sink into my skin ( I use CeraVe lotion ) . I also love the spray-on application because it is less fuss than using a cotton pad , in my opinion . In addition to using it between cleansing and moisturizing , I will also use a spritz of it on top of my makeup ( Maybelline mineral powder foundation ) to give it a nice `` dewy '' look . The only reason I have not given it a full five-star rating is because of the price . Although it lasts pretty long ( I have used about half in three months because I use it two or three times daily ) it costs more than I typically feel comfortable spending . Amazon 's price is cheaper than buying from a salon though , and it is a high-quality product , so I guess the price thing is a relatively minor complaint .	-1
Burned my skin intensely . This product SUCKS . IT has so many irritating ingredients in it . My dermatologist looked at the label and said no wonder you have contact dermatitis . She showed me that there are proven scientific studies that show ingredients like fragrances and lavender oils used in this toner actually CAUSE irritation which later causes wrinkles and think skin . THAT IS NOT WHAT I WANTED ! This went right in the TRASH !	-1
I 'm getting to the age where I could use some skin tightening , wrinkle reduction , spot reduction , smoother complexion ... I 'd be happy with any improvement in any area really . This did NOTHING ... It does have a lovely , soft pleasing scent , but it 's really just an expensive moisturizer , not an antiaging creme .	-1
This made my skin so greasy and shiny , in addition to not helping my acne at all ! So very disappointed .	-1
This was a total waste of money - I 've had it a week and the bristles are falling out all over the place . I thought maybe it would get better after a few days , but no luck . I do n't know - perhaps this is not the real thing because the first Bare Minerals brush I owned ( that I replaced with this one ) was fine for almost a year before it started shedding .	-1
This foundation brush is just not for me . When the representative at Macy 's put the foundation on my face with this brush my face felt itchy and I did n't know why . So I bought the $ 60 starter kit for my sister for Christmas and I tried the brush on my fce without foundation and it just is n't as soft as I want and it made my face itch . It 's fine for my sister who I bought it for . Idk maybe I just have sensitive skin and need really soft stuff . I use ecotools and they r uber soft and do n't bother my skin .	-1
Got this in the starter kit and it sheds leaving single strands in my makeup compact , blushes and allover my face and clothes . Not really worth purchasing . It works OKAY but not great as it is poorly made .	-1
This thing did n't last long at all . The bristles fell out on my face and it had a slight odor . Not like the ones I buy in the store .	-1
I got this brush cause some reviews said it was a very soft brush . Bristles feel rough against the face . The description makes this brush sound better than it actually is . I have found brushes a ton softer than this onr , so I do n't recommend it .	-1
I purchased a set of brushes as a backup for when I clean the first set I got ( handi buki , flawless face and full coverage face ) . These brushes were not the same as the ones I purchased from the Bare Escentuals section at Ulta the week before . The handi buki is smaller , hard and the bristles do shed like made . The other two brushes are also harder and shed a lot in comparison to the brushed purchased in store . None of them apply the product as well as the good ones . It did not apply the foundation nearly as well as the original . It is horrible . I will go to Ulta and purchase a new proper set so I wasted my money here.The name printed on the side of these brushes is id Bare Escentuals . The GOOD brushes bought in store do not have the `` id '' on them . This makes me wonder if these brushes are not genuine ? FYI the real BE brushes available at Ulta are fantastic .	-1
It 's an ok brush . Does NOT cover everything . It 's good for medium to light coverage . Switch to E.L.F brush people , it 's much better ! Trust me .	-1
Pros : Good for blush or bronzorCons : ScratchyDid n't retain shape after washingDoes n't deposit enough foundationThis came in the starter kit I got as a gift and it sucks . I only use it for blush , which it actually distributes well . It distributes the power foundation terribly . The only reason why it got a 2 is because it actually got softer after I washed it so it was n't nearly as scratchy , but it did lose some of its shape : it became more fanned out and less dense .	-1
I 've had 3 of those brushes , and I ended up throwing all of them away . My skin is very sensitive and applying fondation equalled deep exfoliation for me . My skin would burn for a few hours after applying Bare Minerals on my face . I switched to the Mary Kay brush a few days ago , and it 's night and day . In additionto being as rough as boar hair , they also shed and get messy .	-1
I have long , curly , fine hair so when I shampoo I have to move this brush all over from point to point otherwise it will tangle my hair like a rats nest ! The bristles are a bit stiff , making it a little painful in some spots.I would probably go with one that has longer spikes that are a little softer .	-1
I got the lightest color and it is still to dark for my skin.. Looks almost orange on my face . I had high hopes for this product , but was highly disappointed instead .	-1
I found another way to curl my hair , so I really did n't need these at all . Rather an old idea and improved upon since . I just needed something when I ordered them and they work ok , but there are better ways .	-1
The photo of these is misleading . I thought these were the long `` professional '' hair clips my hair stylist uses at the salon to pin my hair while blowing drying ( section it out and pin it ) . These are `` useless '' . They are way short , and `` tiny '' so I cant even use for other things.These are barely useable for a childs hair/head.The box doesnt even list the length but these clearly are not the super long , tight clips I was looking for to keep my hair from falling and to keep it easily clipped while blow drying.I am sending these back .	-1
This wash was incredibly drying . I was using it once a day , before using it every other day and it was leaving my oily skin far too irritated . The product was too drying to use on it 's own , but using a toner or moisturizer with it left my face irritated .	-1
I dont get what kindve hair this works for . Im half latina , I look caucasion , people say my hair is black , but seeing family I dont consider my hair black , I have thick straight hair , and a lot of it . I used very little hair to see if I could curl it , I heated it up to a high setting , I kept it in my hair for 15 secs , it was very hot , as I had touched it to my head by accident , practically nothing happened except for the very end was curled . Seeing I was new to curlingn irons I looked up youtube vids to see what I was doing wrong , I tried 2 techniques , rolling the hair around the shaft , then clamping , and clamping the end and rolling up , still nothing , Im keeping with my straightner to curl , its ceramic , curls last long , and it actually works ... reason I looked for something else is that my particular flat iron has a gap that rips my hair out . IDK why people like this , except that it seems like a sturdy machine , it is a bit heavy .	-1
does n't hold my curls very well . Took a long time for the curls to even hold , it felt like i was holding this curling iron in my hair for at least 5 minutes per section . I would curl my hair and spray the curls so they would hold but within an hour they had fallen out .	-1
I have owned some hot tools products in the past , and it seems as though the quality has diminished over the years.Pros-This does get very hot-The controls are great-The barrel is smooth and I have not had an issue with it getting caught in my hair or my hair not sliding through it easily.- My hair does hold curl fairly well and this creates larger , waves that stay ... for me , at least ( if you want something for tighter curls , go with a 1 inch barrel ) Cons- The purple ring above the cord is so cheap and broke shortly after I got it . This resulted in the whole wand coming apart and shocking me . I currently have it duct taped together and it 's survived this way for close to a year now ... although very annoying . I just did n't want to replace it so soon after buying it and am trying to make it last till it dies completely.- the stand is so cheap and does n't work at all . I have a small bathroom with zero counter space . I set the curling iron on the stand on top of my toilet seat and the stand slid back , resulting in the toilet seat top getting burned ( it 's plastic ) . Not long after that , the stand popped off completely.While this gets hot and does create curls , I 'm not expecting it to last terribly long judging from how cheaply the outside of the curling iron was made !	-1
It was not at all helpful to my skin . I am a person that used to look for answers to skin problems and this was not it . I found my answer but , it is not Rosewater . This sits under my sink and maybe i 'll mix it with my Indian clay or something . May work for some but , not me .	-1
I used this in my hair , but it seemed to make it tangled and nappy . Sprayed it on my face and besides smelling like roses , it was no more effective than plain tap water . Was n't really sure what to expect when I tried it though ... ..	-1
I do not know how this product is made or whether or not it has anything to do with roses . It certainly smells NOTHING like roses . Who knows what it is ? I feel badly cheated and will never order it again .	-1
Products was a disappointment . I 've used tar soap in the past for my skin care . This did not work at all . Guess you ca n't return a half used bar of tar .	-1
I expected that an exfoliating glove would be rough . These exfoliating gloves are way too rough . I did n't bother returning them , but I do regret purchasing them .	-1
I read all the reviews and decided to try . It did n't make a difference for me . It did n't improve or dry out or change anything with my acne . It 's like I rubbed lotion on . It does have a tint to it which made me look clown-like so I decided to only wear at night while home . This has worked for many and people have praised this but it just did n't work for me	-1
I put this on my face and noticed immediately the very thin consistency ... this feeling was replaced with a burning sensation and I thought `` alcohol '' and sure enough , that 's on the list of ingredients . Alcohol is extremely drying and is not what I want to be putting on my face or body to moisturize.If you want your face to feel like you 're taking a trip to the Caribbean , complete with sunburn and the fragrance of a Pina Colada , this is for you . If you want a real moisturizer , I suggest Aveeno Everyday Oatmeal.Aveeno Active Naturals Daily Moisturizing Lotion , 18 OunceSorry , ca n't recommend .	-1
I bought this based on its cult following but I have to say I 'm not a fan . It goes on greasy , takes a long time to absorb , and smells like mothballs . Yes , the smell dissipates , but why bother when there are so many other pleasant smelling and/or fragrance-free options ? The color and texture are similar to nasal mucus . It 's just a big fat no all-around . I 'll stick with Aquaphor .	-1
If you like Bath and Body Works or youthful smells similar to that , you 'll HATE this . I stupidly thought it would smell good based on other reviews . DUMB ! It smells WORSE than Estee Lauder and that grandma stench . I kept it on for a while at home and thought that horrible smell would fade , leaving a not so bad smell . Nope . I had to wash it off my wrist after a while because it was so bad . BAD I SAY ! ! Do n't do what I did and buy perfume you 've not smelled . Once I find a post office , I 'm sending this sucker back . I 'm going back to Bath and Body Works and Victoria 's Secret for perfume . This was disgusting .	-1
This is one of those perfumes you must test for yourself before buying or you are destined to be dissapointed . I bought a sample vial because I read so many good reviews and am glad I only spend three dollars ! This stuff reeks ! This is worse than grandma scent , its nauseating . I asked my husband what he thought and his response was : `` Phew ! What the hell is that ? '' Yeah . It does last a very long time but what 's the use .	-1
This product was somewhat difficult to apply and probably took around an hour for my eyelashes . The reason being is I had to repeat the process 4x over to get my lashes black . Also I could not get much color at all to take on my bottom lashes . In the end this only lasted a few weeks . I purchased in store and ended up returning the product . Not worth my time in my opinion , also not worth the chemical fumes being near my eye . My eyes did not water or sting however you definitely know that there are bad chemicals near your eyes .	-1
This is like using a waxy crayon on your roots . It smears and it looks fake as heck on the hair . I tossed this .	-1
This product is great in concept and I was looking forward to using this tween coloring . Sadly , I had to send it back , I 've run the product several times along a few strands of hair . No color was deposited , just had tiny pieces break off onto my hair and scalp .	-1
worse product I 've ever seen , the stick was dry , smells bad.. ca n't use it at all.. it does n't even work	-1
I do n't know how others have rated this so well , but I found it to apply and it just did n't cover the grey . Nope .	-1
A completely unnecessary and strong stench : perfume I guess is what some people call it . I have seen estimates that as much as a quarter of the population is sensitive to these scents ; some know it and some do n't realize what is causing their sneezing , coughing , choking , watering eyes , headaches , feelings of malaise , difficulty breathing ( ! ) etc . So why put scent in a product that is supposed to color hair ? I did n't see it listed as an ingredient on the package ; otherwise I would not have spent my money on it . Only when I used it and had to ride in a closed vehicle with someone else who is very sensitive to this allergen , did I realize the strong unwelcome addition to something that was supposed to cover the gray , not somehow change my odor.I THINK it does work to color the wisps of white hair I 'm getting . But of course now I ca n't use it again . I suggest looking elsewhere for a product that wo n't make people sick .	-1
This is a Terrible product . Made my hair turn purple . I will not use or purchase again sadly . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Got this as a free deluxe sample at Sephora . Was underwhelmed . Did not manage my hair , or do anything to make it less frizzy . In fact , it made my hair dry and lifeless . I still have three unused large samples ... I wil give them away or toss.Also , I put a well thought out , but critical review on Quidad 's website . They did not print it . If you go to their website , ALL the reviews are positive . Not credible at all . Just leaves a bad taste .	-1
Well.. this product made my hair have even more frizz.. it didnt hold a curl.. HMMMM not for me	-1
I purchased this item in September , only to have it burn up in less than 4 months . I used the hot air brush only occasionally , perhaps 2 times a week . It did a nice job styling my hair , and I think the anti-static ionic feature made a difference . Unfortunately , the motor never ran an even speed . The second to last time I used it , I thought I smelled smoke . The last time I used it , I definitely saw smoke . That was enough for me to throw the item in the trash . As a result , I just ca n't recommend this item.For a period of over twenty years , I had 2 different hot air brushes from Conair . Unfortunately Conair no longer makes the model that I used . I took a chance on this Hot Tools item as a replacement , but this Hot Tools product was more expensive AND failed in 4 months.This was my first time with a Hot Tools product . It also was my last.I just purchased a different Conair product . At least I know it will last .	-1
I 'm usually the kind that does n't need `` frills '' and if a product works great , I can deal with smell or looks or feel , etc . I am more interested in a product working than the frills that come with it . Well I could not do that with this product . It stunk so bad that you could smell me wherever I went . The smell faded at the end of the day but you 'd stink almost a whole day after using it . And the bad thing is that it did n't even work well enough to make it worth the stench . Very disappointed as I was looking forward to this product . Instead I went with Raw African Organic Shea Butter . No frills and smell is n't great but it does n't linger at all and works fantastic . I have really dry skin and the `` chicken bumps '' and was really wanting a cure from this product - nope .	-1
This does provide a good heavy coverage but it makes my under eyes look very crepey & old ... . I 'm only in in my 40 's but this makes my eyes look ancient ... .	-1
At first I thought this smelled like peanut butter , but than after awhile it seemed to smell worst like so bad and too strong it was making me sick , if you can stand the smell , go for it , but it definitely made me want to throw up .	-1
After reading the disclaimer that it is known to cause cancer . Have n't used it yet because I 'm too afraid ! !	-1
It contains Phenoxyethano . Look it up folks , it 's extremely toxic . It has no Parabens but it has that which is MUCH worse !	-1
I am having the worst hotflashes and not wanting to take hrt i was looking for something else that may work . i saw all these great reviews and am so glad that this product works for so many , sadly not for me..	-1
I am glad that this works for some but as all should be aware , everyone 's mileage will vary and there is no single wonder cure that will work for eveyone . Beyond the arguments made in the scientific community concerning the efficacy of this product in regard to progesterone replacement and the cancer warning that some have noted , I was apparently one of the select few - given the reviews here - that has experienced negative side effects . I was hoping that this product would provide a natural option to level out some of my periodic hormonal roller coaster ride days . Unfortunately it raised my blood sugar at such an alarming rate that I had to discontinue after a short period of use . Immediate raise upon starting + immediate drop upon discontinuing = no question this was not working to my advantage . This was also accompanied by water retention , fatigue and a bout of extreme moodiness which was not what I was shooting for . I thought is important to share as I had searched extensively for any guidance on potential side effects and found the info spotty at best in regard to potential impacts on blood sugar . In this case , I am sticking with the professionals to address moving forward as this was not the silver bullet I was looking for .	-1
Decided to try this product since I 've had many , many hormonal issues since going off the pill , acne and weight gain being the two biggest problems . Since going off the pill , I steadily gained 20 pounds over 2-3 years and watched my relatively nice skin become mottled and scarred . I hoped I 'd be one of the lucky ones , but this product exacerbated my problems . After two dosages , I ballooned another 7-8 pounds over night , and felt crazy and hyper-emotional , like the pill used to make me feel . Needless to say , there is no way I would try to & # 34 ; push through the estrogen dominance & # 34 ; like so many people recommended , and I 'm glad I did n't since using DIM , Evening Primrose Oil and Milk Thistle have worked so much better.Would never , never try again . Waste of money .	-1
I understand the positive reviews posted here are based on immediate results . What about long term ? What about cancer ? Does n't that BOTHER any of the people posting that they 're using this product ? It says right here in the product description and on the box that this product can cause cancer . How is it that women can be manipulated to believe that temporary relief from menopausal symptoms is worth the RISK of cancer or dying from it ? I 'll keep searching for a natural remedy . Possible side effect , cancer ? HELLLLLOOOO ! ! NO THANKS ! If I 'm missing something , that someone wants to point out to me ... .have at it ! I 'm all ears .	-1
I missed this warning until it came in the mail : This product contains progesterone , a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.What a bummer ... I was so hopeful that it might help me , but I ca n't use something with such a clear connection to cancer . : ( I threw it away so I would n't be tempted .	-1
I bought this for the toiletries basket at my wedding . I do n't think anyone used it . When I went to use it later , I realized it expired shortly after I 'd purchased it - I think total lifespan was something like less than six months .	-1
Unfortunately , it did n't alleviate underarm odor . It seems as though these products only work for some , and I 'm one of those who just ca n't find an effective natural deodorant .	-1
I had high hopes for this product since I am looking for a safer alternative to traditional deodorant , however it did not mask the odor even a little bit . I am glad to hear it works for some , but not for me .	-1
He said it did absolutely nothing for his skin condition . He does not use it now . Waste of money . He has eczema of the scalp .	-1
And it dried out my scalp so I got more after . And my hair felt strawy ! It 's usually very shiny and soft . I did not like this at all .	-1
I bought this shampoo because I 've been having so many problems with my hair , I know that many of those problems comes with aging , the hair aged as we do . When I purchase this product was based on the reviews , my hair is thick and naturally curly , I bought coconut oil Vatika , Raw argan oil and Ojon hair repairing mask , and my hair feels so good after these products penetrate into hair but right after shampooing my hair with TheraNeem Gentle Therape Shampoo my hair becomes like wire , hard and stiff , it feels awful ! ! ! it looses completely the moisture despite I 'd used those products hours prior to wash my hair , and using a very good conditioner , that 's not enough to return my hair 's natural moisture , this is one of the worse shampoos I had ever used . My hair still falling out like crazy , now is even more frizzy , the worse part is that I bought two of them , one for me and the other as a gift , but now I am thinking what to do ! ! ! my friend is even older than me with hair problems and she does n't like to use conditioner because her hair is thinning and the conditioner flats her hair down . Probably I 'd give that to her because just because if it is n't good for me that does n't mean it is n't good for her , I do n't know ? ? ? . I Wo n't buy it again .	-1
I got a bad bottle . It did n't smell like it was supposed to , and dried down to a horrible waxy smell , like an unscented deodorant.It 's irritating that Amazon wo n't let me return it !	-1
Reminds me of a room fragrance plug-in , like the Kitchen or Caramel or Sugar Cookie scents from Bath & Body Work or Yankee Candle , but more layered & sophisticated . I would love this as a home fragrance spray , especially in late Fall and through to the holidays . But for me personally , I ca n't stand it as a perfume.That said , I love two other Hanae Mori scents - Couture and Mystical Moon .	-1
I purchased this product from our local MCX for a change from my regular moisturizer , and two months later I 'm less than enthused . I experienced no extreme medical issues , like some other unfortunate reviewers , but neither did I experience any sort of positive results . For the amount of money spent , I could have just as easily purchased a moisturizer from a local pharmacy for $ 5 , gone for a nice lunch , and two months later had the same results . `` Hope in a Jar '' did not work for me .	-1
I generally like Philosophy products , but this stuff is not worth it . It does feel great going on , and provides great moisturization under makeup or at night before bed . However , it smells so awful that I finally threw it away and went back to good old Cera Ve PM . Given how expensive this stuff is , one should not have to make such compromises . My husband wondered why I smelled weird . Yeah , its that bad .	-1
I 've never gotten all the Philosohpy hype-it 's overpriced cream , lotion , and other bath products . I got this as a sample with an online order at Sephora . It 's terrible . It 's runny not thick like other creams I 'm used to . Maybe it 's me but when I use lotion I like a creamy texture that soothes my face not something that 's running down it . The smell is ... weird . It 's neither pleasant or unpleasant , it 's just odd . And seemed to seep into the blanket I use when I sleep . Not to mention when I woke up I expected a moisturized face-another downfall of this product . This lotion did absolutely nothing for my dry skin . And what does 99 % oil-free even mean ( description on Sephora website ) ? Either it has oil or it does n't . And I 'm a 100 % oil-free only kinda gal . My $ 6 night of olay jar does a better job in all areas mentioned above . Also , the purity cleanser by Philosophy is crap too . I also got that as a sample and had to use a TON to get it to lather . When I wash my face I like to see the soap/cleanser . It also left my face still feeling oily-like it was n't fully clean . I 'll stick to Cetaphil which is way cheaper , gentle , and cleans thoroughly .	-1
I started using Philosophy products with their set , called something like Makeup-Free Skin . This was in there , and I used it for a couple of years . It was my first jump up from drug store brands . I liked it well enough , but the lack of spf was kind of a bother , and I never really felt like it sunk in . In the summer , my skin can get kind of oily , so this may be part of it , but even right after washing my face it just would n't soak in , so I 'd have to wait a while to put any makeup on . I was very conscious that I had moisturizer on my skin . Like I said , though , I used it for about two years , so I did n't think it was bad at the time . Since I 've switched to other things , I ca n't imagine switching back to this .	-1
I was n't even able to give this product a chance . After just one use , I could not believe the smell . It smelled like burned plastic after applying it to my face . It made me sick to my stomach . The smell was even on my baby when I laid him down to sleep and I took a baby wipe to get it off of his head . It just smells so bad !	-1
I applied this for the first time after my morning shower today . OH MY GOD ! It was seriously the worst , most horrible smell ! After rubbing it all over my clean face , I had to get back into the shower just to get the odor off of me as soon as humanly possible . I ca n't even attest to how it works because I could never stand the rancid smell . After a nice , refreshing shower , who on Earth would want to apply something that smells like wet dog and animal urine ? Not me . It was the most disgusting experience . I do like lots of other Philosophy products . But I was shocked that someone could even bear using this . Other reviewers said they did n't like the smell , but kept applying it until they did n't notice it much anymore . I wonder if those people wonder why other humans want to stand 12 feet away from them when they 're nearby . UGH .	-1
I really do not like this moisturizer . It 's a bit too greasy for my taste , although it does make my skin very soft and smooth . The worst thing about it is the scent , which is really bad . I do n't understand why Philosophy ca n't make this stuff smell better . I do not recommend it at all .	-1
I should have listened to the reviewers who have complained about the smell . I ca n't quite describe it . It 's almost a strong chemical smell . If you live in or have ever been in Southern California , we have a `` stink weed '' that is very pungent and smells very strong but artificial . It 's almost like that strong chemical stink weed smell . When I put this on my face in the morning , I have to quickly put an Aveda moisturizing lotion over it just to tolerate the smell otherwise I smell that stinky chemical smell ALL DAY . Since I really have n't noticed anything as far as an improvement in my skin or complextion and I really do n't have major wrinkles to see an improvement , I will never buy this product again . I 'd rather buy something that smells better that offers moisturizing components . Plus , with this product , it 's rather thin and does n't feel like it really absorbs into the skin . It 's not thick . ( I hate thick greasy products and this does n't fall into that category so that 's a plus I guess . ) It seems too thin like they put too much water in as a base . Overall the smell ruins the product and if it actually improved the skin , maybe it would be worth the sacrafice . Since it does nothing for the skin , why suffer with the smell when there are hundreds of other facial products that are much better ?	-1
EW ! ! GET IT OFF ! GET IT OFF ! I was unable to take home samples of the Philosophy products , and let the SA talk me into the $ 30 set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer.I had high hopes for Hope in a Jar . But my gawd does this reek ! As I 'm sitting here typing this review , the occasional whiff of this craptacular moisturizer makes me sorry I did n't wash it off first.This does n't have any kind of moisturizing feel or glide , it 's like I rubbed liquid candles on my face . Stinky liquid candles . My skin feels tight , like there is a mask on it . A mask made out of the same stinky stink of the candles ! My face feels very annoyed and irritated , to match the mood this smell is putting me in.If you can get a sample of it first , I 'd recommend that . Or at least buy from a vendor with a generous return policy in case it does n't work for you .	-1
I was looking for a daily moisturizer that would actually moisturize my face , so when I saw Hope in a Jar on QVC , I had to buy it . I have tried the product for two weeks now , and , all I have gotten is the same result . I have only put a pea-sized drop of this stuff on each and every night , and , when I wake up , I wake up to a cluster of blackheads and zits , usually on either my nose or my forehead . I am also very allergic to a lot of chemicals in beauty products , but this was the worst ! I actually have to be put on steroids for 30 days because it is making my asthma and high IGE levels of allergies act up badly . Also , if you have oily skin , BEWARE . I do n't have oily skin , and this made me break out in tons of zits , so , imagine what it would do to people that have really oily or oily skin ! I am not saying that Hope in a Jar is n't good for everyone . All I know is , it 's not good for me ! It 's Refund Time ! !	-1
Hope in a Jar is the product of marketing hype . This product smells like something out of a biologist 's lab . It 's also faintly yellow , and it reminded me of a chemistry experiment.When I put a huge blob on my cheek ( before spreading it out ) , it left my eyes burning . Its smell and effects on my eyes make it difficult for me to believe in its goodness . At this price , people with sensitive skins are better off experimenting with brands such as Burt 's Bees and Shiseido White Lucent ( both tried and tested , in summer and winter . they worked ) Skintype : Fair Asian , Normal - Dry skin in the US , combination in tropical Singapore	-1
Not for Sensitive Skins -- Perfume is UnnecessaryWhy would a company put such a heavy perfume in a facial moisturizer ? It seems that the majority of the negative reviews are because of the odor.I usually use Clinique , or Bare Minerals which is completely fragrance-free . Even then , I sometimes get reactions ( usually to chemical sunscreens that are in a lot of day creams ) .This product is not a good choice for women who have sensitive skin . It did n't make me break out , because it actually burned and I had to take it off immediately . This product contains Diazolidinyl Urea which is irritating to a lot of people ( including me ) .Conclusion : Lots of good reviews , so I guess it 's worth a try , but skip it if you do n't like perfumed moisturizers .	-1
I thought I would purchase this after reading rave reviews . I have dry skin that is sensitive , the cream burned my skin , turned it red and made it itch , I had to wash it off . worst moisturizer I have ever tried . Gimmick !	-1
I purchased this at a local store and since I absolutely love lime and lemon scents , I figured this was going to be very special . Unfortunately , my bottle has zero scent . It does n't smell like anything at all . I really wish I had pulled the tab before purchase and smelled . It bubbles up just like all philosophy 3-in-1 gels and leaves you feeling soft and moisturized . There just is no scent and lets face it that is what draws most of us to the philosophy line is that great smell . All this being said , from the other reviews I gather I am in the minority and have to figure that the bottle I received was defective . Most of the time if I purchase a philosophy scent that I do n't love I will pass it along to one of my daughters but this one I simply threw out .	-1
I purchased this to use as a bubble bath and I should have looked at the size , I thought it was larger . I found this same item in the department store for less than half the price . Smells good just feel I overpaid for it .	-1
I saw the ad for this product and was intrigued . I bought it from a local high end spa so I assumed it would be worth the price . It is the worst beauty product I 've ever purchased . It simply does nothing . It certainly does n't thicken lashes and barely lengthens them . As for the `` tubes '' concept ... talk about marketing b.s . It goes on exactly like mascara and is indestinguishable than the traditional kind.Do n't waste your money .	-1
I purchased this on the recommendation of those who said it cured `` raccoon eyes . '' Was willing to give it a try , though I find it extremely expensive but thought I might be able to justify the cost of it really worked . I was sorely disappointed . Not only did it still end up smudged beneath the lower lid but it was practically impossible to remove from the lashes . I have tried everything imaginable to get it off without pulling at the tender skin around the eyes . I decided to give the mascara one last try by applying my regular mascara first and then applying a layer of this only on the underside , sort of as a top coat . Still smudged . Also , there seems to be very little product in the tube , and the brush is terrible in that the bristles wrapped in a spiral are far apart so when you apply the mascara it clumps several lashes together and leaves a gap between lash clumps . Can not recommend .	-1
I bought this a few years back when it was Kiss Me by Blinc . Now it is just Blinc . I used to just love this mascara . Now it is way more flakey and not as easy to remove . Long tubes that looked like actual lashes used to slide off when i used warm water to remove the mascara . Now it is way harder to get it off and I just get little bits off at a time , , , ie flakes ! I also get flakes on my face just wearing it during the day/night . they must have changed the formula : ( I wo n't be buying this product again	-1
I bought this because I had heard so much about it . I LOVE all kinds of skin products and cosmetics , tried many and while I can say this is a decent one , I believe there are out there better ones for much less ( such as Naive Aloe Facial Cleansing Foam by Kracie - 110g for less than $ 7 ) . I will not buy it again	-1
I really wanted to like this product . Priced right , smells great , feels great , and the reviews were all great both here and at Sephora , but it make me break out . I do n't have acne issues at all , never had . I continued to use it for several weeks but it just left me a little oily . I have normal/combination skin and I 'm still in search of a good cleanser and moisturizer . Trying Murad now .	-1
I received a 2 oz sample of this in my new beauty test tube . I tried using this recently for a few days morning and night . I used it as directed ( leave on for 60 seconds ) . First of all it smells exactly like bug repellant spray lol . Not a big deal but thought I would mention it . But yeah while washing it has a slimy texture , it does n't foam up unless you were to really make an attempt but that 's not an issue just mentioning . There is *some* foaming action but not much . After using my face looks mostly okay but does n't feel clean ( and I only use mineral powder or bb cream ) . If I had a breakout then that area would be reddened after washing . After the first day I could tell this just was not working for my skin . My skin felt dirty , pores were larger , face seemed irritated . After the third day I was breaking out a LOT . I was getting crazy huge pimples all around my mouth and chin area . And I was getting pimples in strange places like the tip of my nose and around my eye sockets lol . Something in this was quite irritating and did n't wash off my face probably . I do n't personally feel that this face wash is gentle or effective . For reference my face is sensitive oily and clog prone , Acne prone especially with irritating ingredients . Therefore I can not recommend this face wash and I will have to figure out what to do with the remainder as I never throw anything out that is n't expired ( and neither should you ! ) maybe I will use as a brush cleaner .	-1
I am just SO DISAPPOINTED ! After all of the rave reviews on this product I really thought it was going to be great to use . However , it was awful , it made me break out badly and did not remove eye make up . I am overall really disappointed with all of the Philosophy products that I have tried lately . They are on the pricey side , so I definitely expected much better quality . I had no idea that regular Ponds Cold Cream would beat out such a product as Philosophy . I should have erred on the side of `` if it is n't broken , do n't fix it '' and not changed my line of facial products . Lesson learned . Sad that I can not return these products .	-1
If I could give this no stars , I would do it without hesitation . To start off with , this stuff is disgustingly OVERPRICED , considering how many damaging ingredients there are in this product . While I might get comments in response to this 'My skin feels fine ' , 'this does n't irritate my skin ' this does n't change the fact that this stuff is able to penetrate the skin membrane and damage your collagen ( what makes your skin supple ) . Personally , when I first used this product I massaged it on my face without problem , but when I rinsed it off my skin felt tight and dry ! Is n't purity indicative of being gentle ? Apparently not.Just to give you more in depth criticism of this product is ... IT HAS FREAKING BLACK PEPPER IN IT.As if all of the other oils filling in this junk product were n't irritating enough.If you want to damage your skin from the inside out , go ahead and buy this product .	-1
I did not care for this product at all . I have oily t-zone and break out easily and the oil in this product did n't help . It did n't remove my makeup very well either . My face did n't seem clean at all after using this .	-1
This was recommended to me by Sephora and I totally hated it . Purity did not cleanse my face thoroughly even with a facial brush . It does not leave my skin feeling fresh and clean . A total waste of money and a total lie !	-1
I was unable to take home samples of the Philosophy cleanser , and let the SA talk me into the $ 30 set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer . First of all , I use tea tree/lavender oil in my homemade cleaners and that 's the smell that hit me when I used the cleanser . Not good.It was n't even a fresh , pleasant smell like these oils can have . It just reminded me this is what I spray on the toilet.So-so cleaning power , and it made my skin feel a little like I just had n't gotten it all off . When I used a washcloth to get that coated feeling off my face , then my skin was tight and dry and ITCHY . Red and itchy , not good for acne prone skin.It also left that toilet-reminding-smell behind on my face to taunt my nose the rest of the night.I have used a ton of skincare products during my lifetime and this rates down there for me . If you can not try a sample first , at least make sure you buy it from a vendor with a return policy in place . JUST IN CASE you are in the minority who do n't like it .	-1
I was excited to finally have a facial cleanser to melt away makeup and it worked wonders at first ... HOWEVER , I started to break out ... BAD ! I could literally connect the pimple dots on my face ! UGHHH ! Then I discovered that it has IMIDAZOLIDINYL UREA ( found in urine ) ! Which I have researched and it is toxic for your skin ! I can not express how angry I am , not just because it 's expensive but also because it 's supposed to purify your skin . I 'm never purchasing from Philosophy again .	-1
Generally I love all things Philosophy makes . This one , not so much . The smell is awful . The price for this tiny little bottle not much more than a sample is certainly a rip off . I did n't even feel like it cleaned my face very well .	-1
After reading the other reviews I thought this would be a great facial cleanser . Unfortunately , it just dried out my skin . Which is odd because my skin is oily and it takes a lot to dry it out . I am glad I only bought the small size .	-1
This product cleared my acne , that is for sure . But I have dry skin.. and I 've read about others with dry skin and acne prone and using this and it works wonderful so I thought why not give it a try . I have been using this for about a week and a half now and as I mentioned before I have dry skin . My face has become SO INTENSELY dry and I thought maybe it was the winter season ? Maybe its just my skin acting up ? So I bought dry skin cream . Did n't work . I bought another dry skin cream . Again , did n't work . I tried one more time but this time I bought a VERY thick one.. and guess what . It did not work . My skin is STILL dry and this is so not like my skin . So stop using it and my skin is slowly starting to gain back the moisture . This product dried the HECK out of my face and BADLY to the point of where NO cream on this earth was going to work on my skin . If you have dry skin I highly do not recommend this product because it is TERRIBLE . Clears acne ? Yes . Hydrating ? Not in the LEAST bit and I am so upset because I wanted to love this product so much and I ca n't . My skin was miserable .	-1
Its the same thing as getting a cleanser in a drugstore . Only cheaper . This bottle is expensive and just like any other cleanser .	-1
I love the smell , but it DOES NOT 'stick ' . It smelt it nicely when I shampooed , or , when it was in higher concentration , but I could not smell it otherwise . Plus , it is not moisturizing . So , I will continue to use it as a shampoo , but not a body wash. My hair looked nice today , so I ca n't complain about it 's shampooing performance . But , since I paid what I paid for it , I am disappointed . I wish it had a more potent , long-lasting smell , and , I wish it was moisturizing .	-1
I ordered this to surprise my mom after she bought a bottle that turned out to be fake off a popular auction site . I wanted to be sure that this was authentic so I opened it and compared it to my department store purchased bottle . I sprayed my wrists with each and they were nowhere near the same . My department store bottle is soft , sweet and powdery with a hint of jasmine ... I do n't know how to describe this one except that at first spray it was overwhelming with more spiciness and no sweetness . I 've been wearing it for over an hour and it still smells nothing like the other one.To make sure it was n't just me , I left everyone in the house smell my wrists and they definitely preferred the department store bottle and said the Amazon purchased bottle did n't smell anything like the other one and even went as far to say it smells bad . I am so disappointed . Amazon , as always , is amazing with their customer service and made it right .	-1
Did n't realize it would be so strong . Tried it once but did n't keep the box so I am stuck with it . Would n't recommend to any one .	-1
This perfume should be selling for about $ 20.00 . There is nothing outstanding about the scent . I do not know what the rave is about with this perfume . It does n't last long , the bottle is not attractive and the scent is normal . I am disapponted withDonna Karan.. pull up your socks ! ! .. you will lose your customers	-1
I have bought NARS products for years knowing that no matter what I bought I was getting a quality product which why I do n't mind spending the money . Unfortunately this duo Windstar lacks everything NARS is coveted for ! No pigmentation , awful glitter fall out , absolutely awful . These shades are so beautiful and flattering in the pan but are virtually invisible once you attempt to apply them . Save your money and get All about Eve or Alhambra	-1
In the pan it looks mocha with subtle gold glitter , on the lid it is an extremely dark matte brown , almost just looks black . Do n't buy if you 're expecting a shimmery mocha , the shimmer does n't really transfer to the eye at all . But it does wear long	-1
I do n't have much to say about the product . Except I ordered from Perfumania.com seller and I received `` Dunhill Desire '' and not the Original `` Alfred Dunhill Desire '' which is in the listing description . Dunhill desire is an imitation of the originally designed version . I had it before , bought it for $ 15 on Canal St. and it 's good only for killing a laundry scent or spray in the bathroom to kill nasty smelling bacterias . I had the original version of Desire back in 2001-2002 and that was really something ... Stunning cologne . When I saw the image I kinda had a feeling that it 's gon na be a fake , but I loved the originalk version so much , so I desiced to take a risk and ... . boom , I got a bloody fake . Do not buy `` Dunhill Desire '' - it 's a crap . Make sure you get Alfred Dunhill Desire - the original one .	-1
i just recieve this perfume and also 3 more i was so happy about it box looked great bottle also but at the time that i tried na na ! ! ! fake perfume smells like water with alcohol ! this is so frustrating and dissapointing .	-1
This powerful smelling cologne generally turns people off when I wear it . My co-worker who happens to be a smoker told me the smell is so strong that he can even smell it when he smokes outside the building . From deduction , it must be a colonge for smokers only .	-1
Let me preface this brief review by saying I own 60+ bottles and growing . This is without a doubt the worst bottle I 've had the displeasure of smelling . The smell is something out of this world , it 's difficult to describe . Imagine sour , cheap , soapy notes that are so synthetic it hurts the nose . Man I do n't know what fragrance these other reviewers are smelling but this is aweful . If you absolutely need an FCUK scent try FCUK Connect it 's much better scent wise , even if the longevity is poor . I usually am pretty forgiving on my fragrance reviews since everyones nose is different but ... DO N'T BUY THIS . That 's my good dead for the year .	-1
I ordered this for the price and the notes of fragrance , ordered then read the reviews . I would never wear this cologne , It is too subtle and faint smelling . It smells feminine and may smell best on a female . The seller did a great job packaging and shipping but product is inexpensive for a reason .	-1
This is so dry it 's like chalk . The color is just ok . It must be old . Not happy . I have bought other products from this seller that have been fine	-1
I bought this because I read that Nars made long lasting lip gloss but this product is just like any other lip gloss to me stays on for maybe one hour or so .	-1
This lipgloss was too pale , unflattering , and all nars lipglosses are way too sticky , make my lips peel , smell and taste bad . My go to lip glosses are revlon over the counter lipgloss .	-1
Parabens are used as a preservative so that products have less of a chance at growing bacteria . But I own other cosmetics that are the same price that DO NOT contain these harmful chemicals . ZuZu Luxe for example . Or , Lavera Natur Kosmetik neither of these have parabens . They do n't have a ton of different colors to choose from but at least they will look natural for everyday use.I would expect lower end brands to contain parabens because they are cheaper to make . Here are some sources : [ ... ] [ ... ] [ ... ] [ ... ]	-1
The pigment on this color blush is so heavy and thick . If you make the mistake of putting on too much it is definitely a clown color on fair skin . Consistency is also poor made me break out . If this is NARS , it is highly overrated and definitely overpriced .	-1
After years of hearing this blush hailed as the ultimate color - I bought it . The color is beautiful - but the longevity is nonexistent ! ! The pigmentation was NOT good , after a few hours it travels and disappears . I have dry skin , so traveling makeup should NOT be an issue , but this was . The only way I could get it to stay was to put cream blush on underneath and layer it over it , which of course changes the color . Should n't have to do that for the hefty price , IMO . I would not recommend it to anyone . The second star is for the color , which - in theory - is perfect . But overall : this stuff is literally Wet -n wild quality ...	-1
Colors and pictures there are some differences . Secondly , the paint is very hard to push . Not to mention even . Completely idle for the first time . Will never buy .	-1
I thought this was more a mat finish , but it is shiny and lands in every life wrinkle and laugh line around my eyes . I am sure the younger ones would love it , but for this & # 34 ; seasoned & # 34 ; female who loves cosmetics this was not for me .	-1
Well this blush is 1 % minerals and 99 % glitter I dont likeat all the color is minimum but your entire face is completelyshine , waste of money never buy again	-1
I tried this product after I heard people raving about it and was not pleased at all . It made my skin look very shiny , even after I used the mineral veil . Also it accentuated every little line and pore . I thought it must be my application technique , but tried several times exactly as instruced , it just did not look good . Would not recommend this product to anyone over 35 ... . ( I am 42 )	-1
This is the first time I bought this from this seller and it looks exactly the same , is in the exact same jar as the product I bought directly from bare minerals but it does n't cover my skin flaws at all . The stuff I bought directly from bare minerals was much more expensive but covered flaws and lasted all day . This was a waste of money .	-1
This foundation made me break out and caused itching . When I stopped using it , my skin cleared , and when I started using it again , back came the little pimples and itching.After doing some research , I discovered this is one of the mineral foundations that contains Bismuth Oxychloride , which is not good for sensitive skin . It can actually make tiny microscopic tears in your skin , and those wounds can lead to cystic acne if they get infected , so it 's really bad for anyone 's skin . But use it at your own risk . Also , another ingredient , carmine , is in some of their blushes and eye shadows . Carmine is ground up beetles . I am not making this up . There are other products on the market which uses this ingredient too , not just Bare Minerals . I recently switched to another mineral make up which has no harmful ingredients and does n't clog pores . I wo n't mention it here for fear of being accused of working for them , but if you search the web , you 'll find much better mineral foundations than Bare Minerals .	-1
I do n't recommend this makeup . I am a very youthful looking 32 ( no `` fine lines '' yet ) and this makeup made my skin look terrible . It 's too thick , to start with . I tried applying it with a brush and with a powder puff and neither worked well . It highlighted every small flaw and looked too thick and `` makeup-like '' . If you enjoy the look of wearing thick foundation , I guess this product would be good . It created an extra layer which creased as the day wore on , making it look like I had wrinkles where I normally do n't . Also , this makeup has a shiny look to it.As an alternative , I recommend one of the `` tinted moisturizer '' type products , which are just a light touch . If you have nice looking skin , but just want an added touch of radiance , this product wo n't be right for you . It 's better suited to the type of women who wear way too much makeup .	-1
I was very dissatisfied with this product . It made my pores appear larger than normal and it was too pink . I will never buy make-up online again .	-1
I let a coworker talk me into trying Bare Escentuals . In theory I like it -- I do n't like applying heavy , oily feeling foundations to my face so the thought of a powder was intriguing . I found it covered well , but no matter what color or tint I used , it made my skin color look off . The sales person said this sometimes happens and suggested I try a similar mineral foundation from another company which worked much better with my skin tones . What I found hard to believe though was that none of their hues that matched my skin tone managed to look natural .	-1
The price may be right but it does n't work for me . I have olive tone skin color so maybe it works better on someone with fair skin . I find it to look thick and way to yellow .	-1
Applied sparingly this does look nice and photographs well but some component of the powder made me itch and burn and resulted in some very painful contact dermatitis/acne that took a week to clear . In fact some of the fallout from my use of this product left scarring . I do not recommend . Look around on make-up review sites and see for yourself . My story is repeated over and over by other women who wasted money on this product . This stuff is very , very irritating and applied heavily it does not look natural or good . For being photographed maybe . Otherwise little to no make up or a quality tinted moisturizer with SPF is the way to go . BareMinerals claims are too good to be true and they are not worth the potential havoc for your skin .	-1
I know they advertise this make-up as one that will not make you breakout , which is actually why I used it for a couple years . But after about a year of use , I began breaking out and just thought it was my skin . I tried different cleansers , changing my laundry detergent , chemical peels , facials and still would get acne on my chin and cheeks.I went to a dermatologist and she told me to stop using the Bare Escentuals and see how my face does . I stopped using it and started using Jane Iredale , Glo , and YoungBlood makeup and my face is totally clear ! ! I could n't believe it was the BareMinerals making me break out . According to my doctor , Bare Minerals does not use pharmaceutical grade minerals like the Jane Iredale and the other mentioned products I now use . I still use the Bare Minerals eyeshadows , as they do n't bother my eyes . If you have problems with acne and use this makeup , I would try switching to a pharmaceutical grade makeup and see what happens.And as a side note ... . stop using Tide laundry detergent if you have chronic breakouts . It contains a lot of residue that can make you break out . I now use Dreft on all my pillow cases , sheets and towels I use to dry my body and face . This was the first step in my quest for clear skin and it helped tremendously . When I switched makeups , my face totally cleared up .	-1
I know I may be tarred and feathered for saying this considering the reviews for this product , but I really hated this stuff . Out of all the foundations I have used in my life ( revlon , lancome , avon , prescriptives , bobbi brown ) this is , in my opinion , by far the worst for oily skin I have ever used ... and many of the others are n't so great either so that 's really saying something . Its possible that if your skin is either dry or combination this foundation will work . My skin is very oily . In about 30 mins after applying this foundation , my skin looked drab and patchy . It looked like I had powder caked on my skin and it felt awful . Applying more of the foundation just made it worse ... and after wearing this stuff for a whole day my skin looked like someone had splashed water and oil on my face ( lol ) .I was so displeased that I gave it away . Apparently , this makeup works for many many people and feels and looks great . It did not work well for me and it is an expensive product . I guess one never knows until one tries ...	-1
I used to really love Bare Minerals ... .. until I found out about the ingredient Bismuth Oxychloride . At first my face LOVED this stuff . But after a few months of using it I noticed that when I wore it my face would be itchier then usual . I also started breaking out a LOT more then usual . It was n't until I did some investigative work that I found out about that Bismuth ingredient and how heavy it is on your face . The whole reason you have to BUFF the makeup on is because the Bismuth Oxychloride is so heavy that it needs to be PUSHED into your skin . I noticed that my makeup felt and eventually looked like it slid off my face BECAUSE of how heavy it really is ( you would n't think it was a heavy makeup being that it 's mineral powder ! ) I stopped using this stuff and IMMEDIATELY saw a difference in my face . It went from being ruddy looking to clean and clear and glowing . I switched my makeup to Alima Mineral makeup and WHAT a difference ! For one thing you do n't have to BUFF the stuff onto your face , and I feel you get SO much more powder for the price ( Which is about the same as Bare Minerals ! ) The whole reason it feels like you get so much more is because you use a lot LESS ! I LOVE Alima Mineral Makeup !	-1
This product is the MATTE version of BareMinerals Foundation and is a totally different color than the original Fairly Light ... a bit confusing ..this one has way more yellow and did not match my skin tone .	-1
I 've tried this twice , and remain unimpressed . I bought a full size of it two years ago , but pitched it because the texture was so pathetic , and the powder comes off on everything and everyone ( including anyone you hug or dance with ) .Tried it again last week , after getting a sample from Sephora through the Beauty Insider program . Sometimes first impressions of products are wrong . Well , I 'm still unimpressed by everything about this product . The coverage is not great , the shades are not great , and the texture feels grainy and like it is n't going to stay in place all day . Not for me .	-1
I did a lot of research on mineral make-up . I was looking for a solution that would be fast so that I could look half decent when I drop the kids off at school in the mornings ! AFter looking at different companies , products , and infomercials - I decided on bareMinerals because they had a range of colors ( I 'm african american ) and because they had longevity and credibility in the marketplace.I was color matched and then had the make up applied . It looked nice , but not as nice as other make up I have tried . I think it looked a little grey and she tried a variety of the colors that they offered - but it was good enough for me to consider buying the starter kit and play around with it at home.As I walked the mall with my new purchase , my skin began to itch . And itch . And itch ! Twenty minutes later I went back and the sales woman asked me if I was allergic to sunscreen . Uh - no . I answered . She told me to go home and try it with my moisturizer at home - I agreed since there was a 30 day return policy.I could n't wait to go home and wash it off . I did n't bother trying it again - I returned the kit and got a refund . Afterwards , I did a little internet research and found that I was n't the only one with that reaction to the product . Supposedly because bareMinerals has an ingredient ( bismuth oxalate ) in it which can be irritating to lots of folks . Wish I read that earlier ! THere are mineral make up lines that do NOT have this ingredient , but they did not have a lot of color options - so I just scrapped the whole idea and decided to stick with my laura mercier tinted foundation .	-1
I was interested in trying the Bare Escentuals products after I went with my roommate for a consultation . I bought a number of products because I LOVED the way my skin looked in the store . It evened out the scars left behind from acne and just made my skin look fresh . However , after using this product for about a week , I developed red bumps in the area near my lower lip and chin . I went to the dermatologist and turns out that the Bare Escentuals products were to blame . My doc prescribed two topical medications and the dermatitis went away . I have n't tried the product since then , but do n't think that I will given what happened last time and the reviews of others with sensitive skin . A lot of my friends and coworkers use this product and I always admire the flawlessness of their skin , but it just does n't work for me.The best substitute I have found is the Super Moisture Liquid Foundation by Clinique . I hate that its a liquid but it works for me . It does n't irritate my dry , sensitive skin and gives it a similar look to Bare Escentuals .	-1
I have experienced mixed feeling with this foundation.The first time I got over a year ago my face broke out entirely . It was a disaster , no other makeup in my life made me break out like this foundation . I stopped using it , then tried again 6 months later ... at that point my face did not break out but it was itching all the time . once I cleaned my face the itch was gone . So I tossed the foundation away . I switched to mineral powder foundation by Gabriel Cosmetics and his Zuzu Luxe line . I LOVED it ! NO itch , no break out , silky smooth foundation and excellent coverage . I ran out and wanted to give this foundation ONE more shot so I ordered the start up kit ... This time with moisturized and primed face I felt like my other foundations were much better than this one ! My face did not itch or break out but there was NO coverage after the first application . I decided to build it up with one more layer and the face started to look totally cakey ... Mind you , I use kabuki , buff the product so I know how to apply mineral foundation . Honestly I was yet again disappointed . I will stick to Gabriel Cosmetics powder foundation for as long as they make it . I tried to really like Bare Minerals and their flashy price tags but 3 times did not do it for me .	-1
I 've been a Bare Escentuals BareMinerals user for about a decade . I usually buy direct , either from the store or online through the store 's website . The last time I was out , I decided to check Amazon and ended up buying this . Unfortunately , the product I received through Amazon did not have the right consistency nor the right coverage that I 've come to expect of the real BareMinerals.Recently , the real Bare Escentuals had a no shipping fee special so I ordered a container direct from them to compare . Right away , I became even more suspicious of the Amazon sold makeup . There are subtle marking differences between the two containers ; the kinds of things you might expect a counterfeiter to get wrong . Also , when I shook out the two out side by side , the makeup in the Amazon container is significantly drier and lighter.If this is not the real BareMinerals , and truthfully I do n't think it is , then I worry about what I was putting on my face for those few weeks . : - ( Caveat emptor . If you want the real BareMinerals , I suggest buying direct from Bare Escentuals or via one of their stores . If you want a fake , your local drugstore has several knock-off mineral brands that are properly labeled ( and even cheaper ) .	-1
First off , I am 26 . I have pimples and I have big pores , no wrinkles , and a jawline that ca n't handle even slightly perfumed cleanser , yet my reddest pimples are there . I was in heaven when I got the original foundation . I could n't find an exact color match , ( which they recently released ! ) but dusted on very , very lightly you can make your pimples a shade lighter . I would not recommend piling on on any of these products , this one included , especially if you 're anything like me.But for the part of my skin that shines , I decided this would be great ! I mean , it does n't have that shimmer like the original , something my t-zone does n't need . Well , disaster . It makes imperfections look worse , even with a light dusting , does n't really combat oil if you have a problem with it , and inflamed pretty much everywhere on my sensitive skin where the original did not . Be careful with this , and test it on a small part of your face at an Ulta salon . It 's free , and you can see if you 'll have a reaction -- this is true for all of these products . It 's worth the trip.I would n't buy this again , and would not recommend it to anyone with any skin problems , and suspect it may give problems to many who have good skin . However , in spite of my low rating I would n't say you should just give up . Some of those 5 star reviews may end up being you , if it works .	-1
I DID NOT like this make up at all . It made my skin tone look orange - I used the lightest shade available because I am fair skinned but it still turned orange on me ! It also has a shiny glittery effect on the skin that I hate . I have to agree with some other reviews that it does not cover flaws well either and does not stay on well for lasting coverage . I will stick with my tried and true liquid brand that has pretty much always served me well . I only tried the starter kit because I had heard so much great hype for this product , however , I was greatly disappointed in the performance and look of this make up.This stuff just looked like `` glittery powder '' on my face and nothing more . As far as that make-up artist saying you needed `` good skin '' to use this product I am 44 and I have no wrinkles or bad spots on my face , no pimples or rough dry skin , etc . and it still looked terrible on me . I see a lot of people seem to think this make-up is `` all that , '' and I 'm glad it worked for them but I sure did n't like it . I 'll never use it or anything similar to it again . I would suggest going to Wal-Mart or your local drug store and purchasing a similar product by L'Oreal , Maybelline and several other make-up companies which now offer a similar product at half the price of this junk or less which I am told works just as well for those who like a `` loose powder '' type foundation .	-1
I 've been using this product for years and thought I found a deal here on Amazon . NOPE ! The product is extreamly poor and has no coverage whatsoever . I had to keep using more and more , and it was n't doing anything for my skin . I should have guessed , this was only $ 14 vs. the real deal , $ 27 in my local dept store . I think I 'll just pay the extra and get the real product . I will NOT be back .	-1
NOT REAL ! I still had powder left from the real Bare Escentuals ( tried to get it cheaper ... ) and this is not the same . One , its darker . Two , made me break out . Three , does not go on or blend like the real one . Four , clumpy and sticky - does not come out easily . BUYER BEWARE !	-1
I have used BE for several years . I thought BE was a good product because it was `` natural '' however it is NOT ! It causes BAD BREAKOUTS ! ! Cystic under the skin hard acne , urrrg ! I do not know if they changed the formula but I would stir clear of this ! ! I had no idea it was breaking me out for the past 6 months until I read about it on a acne forum and sure enough Bare escentuals was on the list ! They have some ingredient Bismuth Oxychloride ( spelling ? ) anyway that is what causes breakouts from what in read . Regardless once I stopped using it my sking slow cleared up now I have acne scars I need to remove ! Grrrrrrrrrrrrr	-1
I like most of you tried Bare Minerals after seeing glowing infomercials . I 'm only in my late twenties and do n't have many lines , but I feel like the foundation aged me twenty years . My skin was dry and taut and it actually made my pores look larger . I felt like it sapped all the moisture out of my skin . This product might be good for women with oily skin who live in humid climates , but if you live in a dry climate like me , do not buy this product ! I 've found better products at the drugstore , Neutrogena Healthy Skin Tint is excellent for the price and it will leave your skin looking a whole lot better .	-1
I 've used Bare Escentuals products for years - foundation , warmth , glee , mineral veil and blush . It worked well and looked fabulous until I hit 60 . Now it sinks into lines and wrinkles and makes me look older . Hard to switch at this age and I 'm no makeup artist but tried several high definition liquid foundations - Chanel , Smashbox - and I looked considerably younger . Do n't know how true but they say powders make mature skin look older and I believe it . After 20 years hated to give it up but vanity won out and I now use liquid high definition foundation . It 's been a good run , Bare Escentuals/Minerals !	-1
Gorgeous fragrance for some 15 seconds , zero staying power . No one , including you , will know you are wearing it . Just like that 5 dollar stuff you get at the drugstore . Which leads me to believe the stuff is very cheaply made , despite the hype . Try `` Flowerbomb '' by Victor and Rolf- very similar but long lasting and totally worth the money , which this one is not . The same with all Philosophy fragrances and products . Hype , hype , hype . Are we so stupid to believe this is a quasi-religious experience ? Save your money for retirement . I will buy nothing from this hypocrit company . YyyyeeeeccccchhhhhhhhhhhEdit 7/29/13- I thought perhaps I would edit my review , in that it maybe was too harsh ? Upon reflection , I increased the negative review intensity . This product is still a big rip-off.Try Al Rehab perfume oils , like Soft . Nice product , no hype , fair price .	-1
This lotion was not what I expected . It was thicker and oilier than I thought it would be , and the scent was not appealing to me- smells a little too plastic . Still , with it being winter , I thought it would keep my newborn 's skin soft and moisturized.Alas , after application , she broke out in a red rash . Tried it again after a few days passed to confirm it was this lotion.Thankfully , Amazon has excellent returns program and I was able to return for a full refund.Bought & # 34 ; Noodle and Boo Super Soft Lotion & # 34 ; and love it .	-1
this one i guess is the cheaper version of derma e products . it is got too much fragrance , and is very sticky , they have some better products to offer	-1
i do my research before buying creams I apply to my skin and if I can I like to educate and inform other people too . So , here is the info I found . I wo n't buy it now : Phenoxyethanol-Repeated exposure to the substance over prolonged periods has been linked to contact dermatitis ( more info 1 and 2 ) , worsening of eczema ( more info ) , reproductive toxicity ( more info ) and neurotoxicity ( more info 1 and 2 ) .

I 'm so disappointed to find this product containing Methylparaben . Can they remove it ? Maybe this is n't the real product ? The one my sister has states NO PARABENS .	-1
I usually like Elizabeth Arden products over all but the green tea deodorant just did not work for me . It has a sharp fragrance that just smelled bad after application and did not last more than an hour .	-1
this is a cheap liner that even with endless amounts of primer and setting powder still bleeds . will not reorder very disapointed .	-1
This would 've been pretty good ( I liked the pointed applicator better than other brushes I have tried ) , but it stings my eyelids terribly . Do not use if you have sensitive skin .	-1
This eyeliner is OKAY.I am not too fond of it as I honestly think that my E.L.F . liquid eyeliner is even betterthan this . First off , I do not like the hard felt tip brush , I like the soft liquid eyeliner brushes as they willput on the liquid eyeliner with a thinner line like I like it.Also , it goes on too sheer . It also contains too little product as the bottle itself is too small.I think I will stick to my E.L.F . liquid eyeliner for now .	-1
Not a fan . The brush is kinda stiff so it 's harder to make a shape.When I 'm putting it on my eyes start to tear . I have the feeling this product have tons of chemicals.This eyeliner last for longsite and I put it above my other eyeliner	-1
Just as all the other reviewers have said , Fresh Farmacy 's main ingredient is calamine lotion , which gives the bar its trademark color , texture , and mild scent . It has pretty bits of dried lavender and flowers on top that are n't really functional but still look nice.I 've had moderate acne since I was 12 , and I love LUSH products , so I tried FF in hopes of finding a more `` natural '' blemish remedy . Unfortunately , it was n't the cure-all that most people make it out to be -- it simply did n't work for my greasy , sensitive , highly blemish-prone skin . Every time I used FF , it left this weird pinkish-gray residue on my face that I had to exfoliate off with a washcloth . I was also shocked to feel my skin just as greasy as before I washed it . FF 's scent is so nice and calming that I was really disappointed when it did n't get rid of my acne . It made a negligible improvement in the acne on my forehead ( i.e. , eliminated 1-2 blemishes out of 20 ) but ended up drying out my cheeks and chin , which then exacerbated the acne in those spots . I may as well have been washing my face with regular bar soap for all the improvement I saw ! : ( If your skin typically only responds to benzoyl peroxide ( mine does ) , FF may not work for you . I see that another reviewer did n't respond well to Proactiv , the active ingredient of which is benzoyl peroxide ; FF worked great for her . Just something to consider . I 'd say if you have super-sensitive skin , blotchiness , rosacea , or *mild* acne , FF would be great for you to try . Otherwise , you might want to find a different cleanser -- those with more moderate/stubborn acne might try LUSH 's Coalface .	-1
The reviews made me think my scalp would tingle and my hair would smell like peppermint . Nothing like that happen . Just plain ordinary shampoo with no mint scent at all . Total blah .	-1
I honestly do n't know how this thing even got on the market . Unless you have super short/thin hair I do n't see how this will do anything to your hair . It has almost no power and awkward to use . There use to be one a long time ago that rotated by itself . THat would work better . This one is no bueno .	-1
I bought this product and thought i would be very happy with it , I was not , It snagged and quit and was overall a piece of crude . Very unhappy with this purchase .	-1
This does the job but not easily . The handle is large and a bit difficult to maneuver . The brush gets hot fast so be prepared . I tend to use it on the lower or cool settings . Finally it is loud , loud like a leaf blower . I put ear plugs in whenever I use it otherwise it is too troublesome . All in all it styles well but I am going to search for a quieter product .	-1
I actually owned one of these and the bristles on it were cheaply made . When ordering this one it looked like it was made better , but on arrival , I could see that the bristles on this were just as thin and cheap plastic . The one I had the bristles burned due to the heat and was a mess . I payed $ 9.97 for mine when I lived in CA.It lookes nice and works for a while , but it ended up in the trash within 8 mths of use .	-1
Avoid this product - it can not be used for more than 3 minutes without overheating . I used mine twice - for about 3.5 minutes each time . This includes shutting the unit off and on to reposition it . The third day I used it , it started to smoke ! It is a piece of junk made with poor quality parts .	-1
Sent it back . Clips kept flying off . I used the proper clip for the size . It reminded me if one I had in the '70 's	-1
I returned this hair setter because the ends of the rollers get too hot to handle . The rollers are also very small .	-1
I did not care for the rollers or the fact that the lid is not hinged . Just not what I was looking for ; they were returned .	-1
I have been using this as advised for over a month now . It says 2-3 times a day on clean skin . Somedays I use it twice , some days I used it three times . I have not seen any even slight difference . Do n't waste your money .	-1
I used this on some older stretch marks that I had and it did nothing for them . It is a great moisturizer , but way too expensive to use for that . I ended up buying 100 % unrefined shea butter and noticed a significant improvement in my older stretch marks and it moisturizes my skin all day from just one application . Makes a great all over body moisturizer and you can even use it in your hair . The unrefined shea butter is way cheaper and way more effective . I would suggest buying the unrefined shea butter instead .	-1
I want to make clear I have n't bought this item from this seller , but I have used it every single day for almost 2 years , and I bought it in the UK and later here in Macys NYC let me tell you do not waste your money ! ! ! it did n't do anything for my stretch marks and wrinkles , as I used it on my face as well . In fact do your own search about the strivectin scam . The company is shady and this cream has the same components as one of the Olay creams for a fraction of the price . They also say Idebenol which is also another fraud . I hope it helps .	-1
I almost ca n't believe the positive reviews here , but then I remember everything does n't work for everyone . I used this cream everyday three times a day for a couple of months with no results . On top of that its very greasy so I did n't want it anywhere near my face .	-1
the size sucked , the product did not show me any improvement annd i HAVE BEEN USING IT FOR OVER THREE WEEKS NOW .	-1
I bought this because of the good ratings and am still hunting for stuff to deal with my thick , curly , coarse , long hair that is colored monthly and would be all grey if I did n't color it , so that might explain some of my problems with conditioning . The first time I used it , it did n't seem to do anything more than if I sprayed my hair with water , and I can do that for free . So , I decided to spray a lot of it , and the baby powder smell ( some chemical ? ) really irritated my lungs and sent me running for my inhaler - I have asthma . Now natural products and high end products never bother me ; it is only chemical laden products and cheap products that cause this reaction . At first I was n't going to send it back , but now that it makes me ill to use it , I am sending it back.Dumb question : Why do some of my orders have a button where I can provide a review , and some do n't ?	-1
I have type 3a curly hair and I purchased this item after having read the reviews . It really did n't do all that much for me , in fact it did nothing , as if I put water on my hair . I do n't recommend .	-1
I read about this in Prevention magazine that it was great for post workout for sprucing up curly hair . I did better with some Garnier stuff from Walmart . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Ok , this used to be the best brand . Everytime I find a color that is not too red , they change up the formula and RUIN my hair ! Your after color crap is horrific , it turns hair black and leaves a disgusting cheap tint , no one wants that stuff . Secondly , some instructions will say to dampen hair others say to apply to dry hair , confusing the customer . Someone at BI should be fired for constantly playing with the product , ruining millions of womens hair int he process ! When you have a good thing , leave it alone ! & # 34 ; NEW AND IMPROVED & # 34 ; my ass !	-1
This hair dye sucks bad . I should have listened to the bad reviews , they 're everywhere , and they 're right . I only ignored them because I thought this brand had the only semi-permanent dye on the market for natural colors but then later I found out Garnier has the semi-permanent HerbaShine one . I 'll be using that one next.My hair is naturally dirty blonde and straight/thin . This left my hair a really weird red color . No hints of purple at all . It left my roots CLOWN RED for some reason , and the rest of my hair a different darker shade . The color is extremely patchy and I somehow missed a ton of spots . I think this is due to the instructions saying you must have DAMP hair before you dye it . So annoying . How can you tell where you need dye if your hair is already wet ? The color is very dull and it looks like I 'm wearing a Halloween wig . It 's just really bad . I left it on for 20 minutes instead of 10.I do n't recommend this at all.I refuse to use the 2 week refresher because reviews say it 's even worse than the dye itself .	-1
I used this color years ago and was always happy with the outcome of the color . I thougth to give it a try again , and was so dissappointed with the result . I did n't like the auburn color at all , and above that it dried out my hair . I am so glad when all the color has washed out . The company must have changed the formula , because it is totally different from the color I had used some years ago . I will not purchase this product again !	-1
I ordered a package of 3 . When I rec 'd the order , one box of the product was so damaged that the & # 34 ; developer & # 34 ; lotion had spilled inside the box . I had to throw it out . As a result , I paid for 3 boxes of this product but rec 'd only 2 I could use .	-1
This color is great if you do n't like using harsh hair dyes , I 'll give it that , but when it comes to washing out , it DOES N'T . Even when you 're only doing the `` root touch ups '' like they suggest IT WO N'T WASH OUT EVER . I have dark brown hair and my hair has been stained black . Since it 's not like the ammonia hair dyes , it does n't come out with Loreal color fix and bleach ... well bleach is horrible , but it 's what I 'm going to try next to get this out of my hair , because I refuse to pay someone at a salon $ 300 to fix it . I know I may end up with no hair if I do that , so please do n't lecture me . I just want to warn others that this does not wash out as promised , you 're better off using a regular hair dye with stinky chemicals .	-1
My mom used Natural Instinct for many years until they changed their formula . The worst part of it all was the 2 week color refresher ! Turned my mom 's hair into a fireball ! ! ! IT 'S PURE RED ! ! ! ( she used a dark brown hair coloring ) She was very furious that she did n't leave the house for many weeks.I 'm going to do a research for another ammonia free hair coloring . She wo n't be buying this brand again !	-1
I found that having to put the color boost in a week or 2 weeks after dying my hair was annoying . I also found the instructions for the color boost to be confusing , since I had no idea what it was or how it worked . It did n't seem to be any better than any other coloring I had used before , and , maybe , not as good . Lastly , it LEFT STAINS ON MY PILLOWCASE ! There is now a section of my pillowcase that is stained with a brownish ( Lighter than the color in my hair , thank God ) area where my head had rested during sleep ( and , yes , I rinsed it VERY well ) . I have NEVER had a hair color leave color on my pillowcase before . I was shocked to see it , and VERY annoyed . I HAD a subscription for regular deliveries of this product , but I cancelled it . I wo n't use it again .	-1
I 've been using Clairol Natural Instincts hair coloring for years and years and years and have always loved it . Until now . The new formula smells awful , has a thick gloopy consistency that is so heavy it droops and drops everywhere and leaves stains on the counter/floor that are nearly impossible to get out . And for all that torture , the new formula takes twice as much to do the job and the color starts looking dull almost immediately after just a couple of washes . Plus it 's terribly drying to my hair whereas the old formula and conditioner had a nice softening effect.I 've always avoided having permanent hair coloring done at the salon because of the ammonia and damage it does to hair over time . But after just a few tries with the new Natural Instincts , I would rather do permanent coloring at the salon or even just go totally natural ( i.e . gray ) . Either would be far far better than the torture and bad results from the new Natural Instincts . If anyone has suggestions for temporary hair color solutions to replace Natural Instincts , I would so appreciate a tip via the comments.Clairol , what were you thinking ? You seriously need some help in both R & D ; and QA . : - (	-1
This product not only did n't cover gray , but it did n't grab my hair at all . Not worth the price and special order .	-1
I had been using Clairol Natural Instincts Midnight Black for a long time . I loved the original formula . The color was excellent and the conditioner was the best ( wish I could have bought it separate it was so good ) . I bought the new 10 min formula to cover my gray with Black and my roots are brown ! It is too ugly . I now have Brown roots and the rest of my hair is black . I do n't like it at all . I do n't understand why the formula changed . Why wo n't Clairol tell us the reason ? Was the original formula hazardous to our health ? If so , does this mean the new formula is even worse ? The 10 min formula is deceptive . It does not color my hair the color I expect . I will not use this formula ever again . As a matter of fact I think I may be afraid to use even the original formula if I ever find it again . So long Clairol and thanks for nothing .	-1
I used this product to color my daughter 's hair , she had never colored her hair before , and we did n't want to use permanent color . I followed all of the directions , but the first time my daughter washed her hair , there was a noticeable difference in the color , with her dark brown beginning to show . We had expected it to last through multiple shampoos , so this was a big disappointment .	-1
A truly lovely and uplifting scent . Clinique definitely had a winner with this , but unfortunately I can not love this perfume . It was a staple in my high school and every other teenager I knew claimed it was her & # 34 ; signature scent & # 34 ; after Elle Woods ( Reese Witherspoon ) made this perfume popular for tween and teen girls in Legally Blonde . I wore it and so did every girl I knew . ( This , and Love Spell from Victoria 's Secret and Cucumber Melon from Bath and Body Works ... ugh ) I ca n't stand to wear it anymore and when I smell it on someone my age I honestly wonder why . I have to think that they do n't have the same baggage attached to this scent that I have.But I do find myself sometimes picking up a bottle and spraying a bit if I 'm in a store and there 's a tester sitting out . It does hold some nostalgia for me , though quite bittersweet .	-1
While I like sweet fragrances , this one is too simple and smells like it would be for children . No depth , no intrigue.It is n't interesting or compelling , but even so , too loud.Someone wears it at work and I always wonder why , but then again , I do n't like her clothes either .	-1
literally , I do n't know they found this or what they did or how long this was sitting around , but I got the bum end of the deal , I used it pretty much to cover up bad smells around the house to use it up ... ... .. it was awful and ruined the like I have for the original bottle that I had bought at a department store ... ... . will NEVER buy perfume off internet again .	-1
Whoever designed the jar should be sent to a North Korean labor camp to be reeducated ! I do n't know about others but I certainly find the jar extremely inconvenient . It 's a rounded small jar with a small opening that makes it a task to get the creme out . What 's more bizarre is that it comes with a plastic stick that one 's supposed to use to scoop out the creme but who on earth has the patience to meddle with it ? And where would they leave it afterward , on the counter ? In the drawer ? Or just let the dog eat it ?	-1
This shampoo works just fine , but does n't have even a hint of peppermint scent . I was looking for something to pair with the very minty American Crew conditioner , which has a really invigorating , intense peppermint smell -- I was disappointed that this shampoo does n't seem minty at all .	-1
I expected so much more from this because of its reviews . However im not impressed . My hair feels the same after using this .	-1
I 'm on my hair journey and trying to find a leave in which keeps my hair moist when blow dried with very low heat . This ( in small quantities ) has done nothing for me . I do n't find it good .	-1
Tried this deep conditioning hair mask and was not impressed at all . The container it comes in means you take a huge risk of getting all the contents wet when opening in the bath or shower especially since you need to dig in with a wet hand . I always feel like when I open this container it is soaking wet and needs to be drained of excess water . Maybe I do n't like it due to the fact that the product always seems to be watered down , I would rather use Aussie 5 Minute Miracle which is cheaper and way easier/less messy to use ! !	-1
I have long , fine hair , greasy on the roots but dry at the ends . I was looking for a good and cheap moisturizing treatment . I read many reviews about Nutrogena Triple Moisture at the web and Amazon . Every time i use it ( i just put it from the middles through ends ) my hair feels greasy and heavy as if it were dirty . I think it most be for very dry and damaged hair .	-1
I 've heard so many good things about this product but my hair did n't take to well to it . It made my hair very stringy and dry . Used it twice and both times it was just disgusting .	-1
I read the reviews on this item and I wish it would have worked better for me . I am gray/blonde and my hair needed some conditioning so I read the reviews and one person even said they kept it on all night . DO N'T DO THIS . iF your hair is really dry or brittle and you put a softening agent like this one on it , it will make it soft alright , it caused pretty bad breakage at the crown of my hair . Now , some could say , it was n't this , but I know it happened right after I washed it out . It was very very soft but so soft it broke since it was dry . I have never had a real case of breakage or split ends so I was pretty shocked . My husband noticed it and said , you better check out your hair . There 's got to be something in this product that softens too much . I am living proof . I take good care of my hair , and I will never put anything Neutrogena on my hair again . Glad it worked for some people . I recommend Purelology shampoo , conditioner , and when you put the conditioner on , dilute it so that fragile or dry hair is n't overweighed by the thick substance of recovery mask and breaks . This was not recovery for me , it 's going to take a long time and lots of babying to work with this breakage . I hope this helps people who really need their hair replenished .	-1
Did n't work well on my dry , long hair . And was a bit of a mess to apply . I much prefer the Rusk Deepshine Luster .	-1
It can remove any regular make up however , you have to rub it out for waterproof make up . It leaves this gross oily feeling on your face that you can see . After wiping it off , I feel that my skin still has this oily residue . I was extremely displeased with this product because it does claim to be oil free but you can clearly see the separation between the oil and liquid prior to shaking . Overall it does work , it just leaves a icky oily feeling .	-1
I tried it because the reviews were encouraging , and it does work on water proof eye liner if you let it set for a half a minute or so . BUT the smell is truly awful , and I will not be buying this stuff again . I have found it to be irritating on my eye lids , maybe because I 'm in my 50s ? Could be . Sorry ladies , but in a pinch I think cold cream works better .	-1
Tried this and even dousing different materials I found that it required way too much scrubbing and pulling on the eye area . Back to Estee Lauder I guess : (	-1
Works ok but takes time ... .just like many other products . Nothing special	-1
I bought this after seeing all the great reviews , I 'm glad to see it work with everyone else I only wish I got the same results . I 've been using this for 4 nights on the SAME pimple and it 's STILL there . Waste of $ 8 bucks	-1
This product is a wast for me . I was so excited to get it after readying all the reviews . I applied it to the areas that needed it , and it does nothing for me . I do n't see any difference the next day , or even the next couple of hours aftering applying it , nothing . Wast of my money .	-1
I honestly felt like I was just putting water on my acne . I did n't notice any changes at all and would gladly return it if it cost me more and if I still had the box .	-1
I was tired of spending $ 17 at Nordstrom for the similar Mario brand of this type of lotion . So , thought I 'd try this . This looks the same but does not perform .	-1
Dries white alone or whatever color foundation/ eye makeup you are using . Does not really stick and peels off very easily .	-1
This glue did absolutely nothing to my lashes . I rather use the lashes on their own without the glue since that sticks wayyy better .	-1
does n't work	-1
This product was not what I had expected . For one thing , this product does not even keep the lashes stuck to you for long . However , the upside to this product is that there is no tearing of your regular lashes when you remove the false ones . Overall , this product was not worth the money . The seller was expedient in their delivery , and I received this product before the expected delivery date .	-1
When I took off the fake eyelashes , there was still glue , it would n't come off , and it was super irritating !	-1
it took too long to dry , waste of money , i want something that isnt as watery as this one . # ew	-1
Do n't waste your time or money dosent work for s*** not good it 's not strong and will make your eyelashes fall in one day	-1
I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS THING.IT IS NOT STICKY AT ALL . I TRIED ON MY FINGER IT FEELS LESS STICKY THAN COOKIE DOUGH . I MEAN SERIOUSLY !	-1
Most of my reviews are positive . There are a few that state my dislike . This would be one of them ! I hate this product because it did not live up to my expectations & # 8230 ; at all ! It was watery ; not at all like Duo adhesive in a tube . In addition , it had a strange blueish iridescent color and had absolutely no hold ! If I put a piece of chewed up gum on them-that would have held the lashes better than this product !	-1
The liquid is more like Elmer 's Glue all ! It does n't come out of the container in liquid form which would make it easier to apply .	-1
this doesnt do anything ... .it might help nourish lashes but i bought this for brows- pointless buy , has no effect for me .	-1
I used this product n it 's okay . Did not work the way it said ... ... n I used it every night . Sorry but I did use it every night like it said and did not see a difference at all .	-1
Reviews for this moisturizer are all over the board , but I had high hopes when I ordered it on Subscribe & Save . Am I the only one who got a bottle that 's grainy ? It literally feels like I 've mixed a little sand in with the lotion when I massage it into my face . Possibly I just got a bad batch , but I did n't get any of the glow effect others talk about in their reviews , not even an orangy look described by one person , just lotion that wo n't quite melt into my skin because of the graininess . I first looked at it in my magnifying mirror , thinking it might have little sparkles that produced the `` glow '' , but I could n't see any . Makeup goes on okay over it , but even if it did n't have the graininess , it 's nothing special.I just want a daytime lotion that I can depend on to protect and nourish my skin , with no hassles . I 've tried everything from the most expensive brands I could find online to the cheapest ( always based on healthy ingredients ) . So far , the RoC and Regenerist products are about as good as any . I 'll use the rest of this Morning Glow Moisturizer on my arms and hands , which is what I always do with facial moisturizers that I 'm trying to use up . Sorry for the negative review , but in fairness , it 's my experience with this lotion .	-1
It says oil free , but with my crazy sensitive/combination skin , I should have known better.I 've been using this moisturizer on my arms , shoulders , etc . for some light sun protection though so not all is lost .	-1
I bought this moisturizer extremely excited and hopeful , because I have very dry skin ( especially in these winter months in colorado ) and it had such great reviews . I opened the bottle up and get this chemical smell that is fairly strong . I couldnt wait to try it , so I cleansed and toned . When I put it on my face it was very hard to rub in , and although it wasnt greasy it just sat on my skin in a white film . I barely put any on ! A few minutes later it turned my skin to an odd orange-ish tint . Is that the `` morning glow '' ? Ive been using it for about a week and it has started to break out my skin and hasnt helped the dryness even a tad . I regret buying this product . I wish it had worked .	-1
This stuff is n't gentle at all . It seems grainy and it dried out my skin . I tried it for a few days before giving up and returning it . I would not recommend this .	-1
I should have known that this product would make me break out . The scent is extremely strong . People with sensitive skin should avoid this product . I ordered 3 bottles of this lotion based on the reviews . I gave the lotion to my insensitive friends and they love it : )	-1
I purchased this product about 6 weeks ago . I 'm in my late 20 's and have severe environmental allergies with dry , sensitive , blemish prone skin . This product has not been effective in treating my mild acne . It 's very drying and almost makes my skin worse ! It seems to exacerbate the area and cause more zits to form . Plus , it 's rather pricey for the amount of product you receive . It seems like a lot of great things are advertised on the packaging that are impossible to occur in the typical person 's 8-hour night sleep.. Do n't be fooled by the promises !	-1
I 'm still using this and been using it for weeks with no result . I should stop because it has n't gotten rid of any of the pimples on my face .	-1
Embarrassingly enough I was using this on nearly my entire face . I have always had mild acne but since I have had a lot of upper GI problems this year my skin has been outrageously hateful towards me . I have been using it daily for about 2 months now with no improvement for my acne .	-1
I tried this spot treatment for four months . I applied this salicylic acid treatment almost nightly to any acne blemishes . It burns pretty bad but , beyond that , I do n't think it works . I ran out of this stuff a few weeks ago and my skin looks the same , if not a little better . I should mention that I may be finally adjusting to the ortho-tri-cyclen that I was prescribed to help with my moderate acne but , all I know is my skin did n't seem to improve at all with the use of this product .	-1
I 've been using this product almost daily for one month on my oily-combo skin . I 'm prone to blackheads ( forehead , cheeks ) , acne ( forehead ) , and once a year cystic acne on the chin . I 've had a small breakout because my stylist used coconut oil on my hair ( my hair loves coconut oil but my face HATES it ) , and decided to use this with my face regimen . After 4 weeks this product has done nothing for me whatsoever . It is clear gel like substance ( like hardened baby oil ) and smells nice . That 's about it . I 'm going to use it up since I paid $ 7 for it but I definitely will not be repurchasing .	-1
After using their previous oil control product called Finishes Mattifying Cleanser and loving it , they discontinued it and replaced it with this . I was sadly disappointed , it did not deliver any shine control and actually seems to make my pores larger.I ca n't attest to the blemish fighting power since I hardly get any in the first place . I 've stocked up on the previous product which I find at Big Lots until I can find a new product that actually controls shine or they bring back the previous product .	-1
I did n't see any real results after using this entire product . Others may find it works for them but it did nothing for my acne . I used it every day and night regularly .	-1
Purchased this because of the claims that people saw a difference in 1 day . I am NOT one of those people sadly . I have dry skin and experience hormonal break-outs from time to time . I did n't notice a difference at all after using this product . Maybe it 's for younger , or even oily skin .	-1
For the price , there are much better options . I was hoping for some good news using this product , but it actually did n't improve and got worse . I switched to another product and it seems to work much better .	-1
If you have sensitive & dry to combination skin , DO N'T use this product.PROS : Sorry , but none ... ..CONS : After using it for only 1 night , my skin got really red and itchy . It felt like I had a sunburn on my face and neck . I used a tiny tiny amount , so you can imagine how strong this product is . It is supposed to leave the skin soft , smooth , and younger-looking ... not true . My mom also tried this , and the same result ... .she said it was not for her either . It is not suitable for sensitive and dry skin .	-1
This is like all the other JUNK that all the companies are allowed to sell for big money that do NOTHING at all but moisturize the skin and if that 's all your after then you can buy that a whole lot cheaper anywhere in the world.I find out they do n't ever ever ever test real people to make there outrageous claims of miracle reverse aging with lines and wrinkles . They use a test square of some kind of skin and look at it under a microscope and evaluate it from there.They do n't want to test real skin or real people , because they 'd not get the results they want I guess , so they find a way to make phony results that our corrupt government lets them make up to lie , cheat and steal the public blind with.I used it exactly right , and it did next to nothing at all but make my bank account disappear rather than the lines .	-1
I have to be honest and say I have n't noticed a difference using this night cream . Maybe others have a different results but my pores and skin look the same . Its a nice cream but no real changes folks .	-1
This is the first time my skin has ever had a reaction to skincare . The only thing I love about my skin is that it never seem to react to anything I subject it to & I have no allergies when it comes to skincare . Now I can only say , most skincare . I love the ROC Wrinkle filler & bought it before trying this cream . The most sickening thing about this cream is that it gave me a break out which is rare . I now have 4 pimples which are rather red & yet , I do n't see any results . I felt a slight sting when I put the cream on , near the cheek & mouth area.I usually sort of wipe off remainder cream on my neck after applying it to my face & now , parts of my neck is rather red & itchy . UGLY ! ! Again I shall say , this is the first time this has happened so this cream is a very special cream indeed ! On a lighter note , I bought the eye cream of the same range & it was fine . I do n't see really visible results but it was easy to smooth on & comfortable to the eyelids . I 'll review that one when I have more time . I shall still to the ROC Wrinkle Filler from now on .	-1
Not long enough , you need to use these products for a minimum of 60 days to see any results , so check back with me later .	-1
Purchased this product along with the other roc products in this line . as with the others this is a waste of money . Deep wrinkle removal is definitely not what you get . This does n't even remove or improve small wrinkles or fine lines ! ! !	-1
I have been using this product for the last 6 months straight on my forehead , applying the cream every other night before bed . This product has not smoothed out any wrinkles . Also , the product has a slight drying effect , so I stopped using it around my mouth as the dryness was the most noticble in that area . I regret all the time and patience I put into this applying this product , and I would have loved for it to actually work for me like it has worked for so many others .	-1
I am 45 and have nice skin , but have a chronic illness which ( I think ) is making the fine lines on my face more noticeable . I read a lot of reviews on a lot of different products and decided on this one because of price and availability ( I can pick it up at any store as well as online ) .I 've been using it for 8 weeks and can honestly say , I notice no difference at all . My skin is n't brighter , the dark circles are still there , so are the fine lines . So while it may or may not be working for others ( it 's all in your perception , right ? ) it did n't work for me.The first week or so , I noticed my eyelids and eyebrows itching and peeling A LOT . It was very uncomfortable . But it says that some of this is to be expected , so I kept on . The itching/peeling has calmed down for now.I do n't care much for the scent . It 's not that it 's bad or overpowering , it 's just not pleasant to my sensitive nose . I like my face/body creams to have no discernible scent at all.This cream does not spread well , the tube just barely lasted the 8 weeks and that was with me being very careful not to use too much . I found myself struggling to make sure I was covering my entire face & neck.So all that said , this might work for some , but it did n't work for me . I have fair skin and do not sunbath & always wear a sunscreen , even in winter , so it 's not like I was expecting it to remove road-map wrinkles .	-1
Hi I just bought this product a few weeks ago off of amazon . I have just been putting it on the underneaths and corners of my eyes to hopefully stop more wrinkles from appearing there.The box does say that you will have irritation the first few times you use it . So I used it for two nights . On the third day under my eyes were scaly , swollen , and red . My throat was hurting and swollen too I think from the allergic reaction.My eyes are finally starting to feel better three days after not using anymore . I am just disappointed that this product had such a strong reaction and wasted my money.If you have sensitive skin I would n't use this product . If you do buy this do small test areas .	-1
I would honestly love this if it were n't for the fragrance . It seems to work great , but I just ca n't get past the smell . The fragrance is way to strong for something that 's going on my face . I wound up going back to my old standby , Neutrogena , because the texture is very similar and it does n't have an offensive fragrance .	-1
I have very sensitive skin . When I tried this product I had a feeling it was going to make me break out . I went a head and tried it.i had heard and read so many great reviews on it . I ended up breaking out with it so I never got a chance to see if it works ? I am going to look for this in Sensitive skin . I know ROC has products for sensitive skin but I do n't think they have this exact one ?	-1
I 've been using the roC Deep Correction Wrinkle Cream morning and night now for about a month . I apply only to my forehead , between my eyebrows , to my nasolabial folds , and my neck . I 'm 40 , so my wrinkles are not deep or pronounced but I definitely have them . The pros : my skin sometimes reacts badly to skincare products , but this did not irritate at all , which is why I started applying it in the morning AND night . The smell is pleasant , and the texture is fairly light . The cons : nothing is happening . After about a month , my wrinkles and lines have not diminished or softened one bit . I was really hoping it would work on the frown lines between my eyebrows , but there was no improvement at all . I 'm about halfway through the tube and will use up the rest . If anything changes , I 'll edit my review , but I really do n't expect any results if I have n't seen any by now.UPDATE 3-22-12 I 've finished the tube , applying it both morning and night , and still NO REDUCTION in wrinkles , fine or deep . A waste of money .	-1
the problem w/this product is that they do not list the percentage of retinol that is in it . the higher the percentage , the better the retinol works . the highest percentage allowed w/o a prescription is 2 % . my sense is that the percentage in this product is far less than 1 % . I currently use skinceuticals retinol 1.0 refining night cream . and I 'll probably go even higher once my current tube is finished . I used the ROC a few times , but will either throw it out or use it on my hands at night .	-1
I did n't care for this . It does n't make your skin break out but it really did n't work for wrinkles . Spend your money on something better .	-1
This product is just ordinary discount sunblock in a fancy tube , so do n't waste your money . If anyone has a recommendation for a real wrinkle moisturizer please let me know .	-1
I have to wonder about all the 5 start reviews ? My experience is:1. at bedtime-wash my face with facial cleanser2 . apply them exactly as described on the package and website3 . they barely stick on after spraying them with water4 . go to sleep , wake up in a few hours , they are all aready came off5 . in the morning pick up all the unstuck `` frownies '' and put them in the trash6 . look in the mirror and see absolutley no difference whatsoever.Dont waste your time or money	-1
I 'm half embarrassed that I even bought this product , but pushing sixty are n't we all looking for a miracle wrinkle remover ? Well , this is n't it . I think I could do the same thing with duct tape at night as this product does .	-1
I 'm in my early 40 's and have started to get laugh lines ( not so funny ) , and I tried these . They actually feel really hard after applied to y face , and do n't hold as well as they should . In the morning , it kind of hurts to pull them off . I went back to my mom 's method of using the clear bandaid tape .	-1
These patches remind me of pieces of envelope paper with glue on them . They have hard edges which I find uncomfortable and itchy . It 's difficult to sleep with them on and in the morning , yes they temporarily flatten lines , but at the expense of a border in the shape of the Frownie showing all around the area they were plastered to . A few facial expressions later and , voila ! , you have the border AND the wrinkle . Do n't waste your money .	-1
You can see that it smooths the lines as soon as you peel it off but couple hours after your lines look same as before ! It 's not a bad product but it 's expensive for piece of paper	-1
I am one of the dupes that sprung for this garbage . The product is old time packing tape cut into odd shapes.. get some packing tape and make your own for about $ 2.00 . The tape would have more glue and they might even stay on.. these `` frownies '' wont stay on , no matter what hype the company says.. DONT BE A CHUMP like me . I blew $ 20 with shipping for some slightly sticky packing paper	-1
I found them too uncomfortable to wear for the entire night . i would find myself waking up in the middle of the night to take them off . They really hurt to take off . They left my skin dry where the strip was . Was not able to use them long enough to notice a difference .	-1
When I could n't find my favorite 'pink tape ' , I tried these , but there are features of the product that made me put it aside . First of all , I was surprised to find the paper is very stiff , like old-fashioned butcher 's paper . Because the patches are rather large , I had to tear them to get pieces that were sized appropriately . Cutting the patches to a smaller size left stiff edges and points that could still irritate . I also did n't like having to wet the 'glue ' on the patches to stick them to my face and ended up with the occasional breakout as a result of using them . They did minimize the lines , but the resulting irritation just shifted the problem . I ended up discontinuing use.Luckily , I was able to find the pink tape on Amazon even though I could n't find it any longer in stores and switched back to using it . It 's much easier to use and more comfortable . Although it 's officially hair setting tape , it is effective for removing lines by smoothing the skin overnight while you sleep and it never causes breakouts.3m Scotch Professional Hair Set Tape With Dispenser * Created Especially For Hair Styling .	-1
I got these to help reduce the amount of wrinkling I see when I first wake up in the morning , but they did n't stick very well , and when I could get them to stick , then they hurt to take off . These went back since they did n't do what they were designed to do . I had realistic expectations and these still did n't fit the bill .	-1
My first box worked great : lessened forehead furrows temporarily , stayed on all night , felt like really firm construction paper , were difficult to remove . I would have to wet and slowly peel to remove . Second box : didnt help much bc they often came off , felt flimsy . I have to glue 3 together to get the same effect . Very disappointed . I think company changed paper and glue . I wont continue to use .	-1
I expected this to be the texture of a flexible bandaid but it 's cardboard paper like a paper bag from the grocery store with a sticky back and in little triangles . I have used it for a few nights and notice a difference on the forehead line but it 's too uncomfortable for me to keep on my face and eyes . You 're supposed to keep it on for at least 3 hours and they say it 's best to leave it on overnight . I would almost rather use scotch tape . This product was disappointing . I really wanted it to work . If you like this kind of thing - I would recommend ordering strips instead of these triangles - when you try and cut them to fit specific areas , the corners are sharp and pokey and it leaves little parts that are useless you end up throwing away . I 'd do it in a flexible bandaid type fabric and make them strips .	-1
gives more wrinkles than you already have ! ! ! i bought it and tried it for couple of nights ... then i had to quit using them , because it creates more wrikles over night ! paper is rigid ! ! ! ! ! waste of money ! !	-1
I regret buying this . I 'm 25 years old and notices I 'm starting to get worry lines on my forehead , so I bought these hoping to do some proactive damage control . I do n't want them to get worse . While these did relax my worry lines , I still think these things are terrible and a waste of money . Here 's why : When you wake up , you 'll have new lines from where your skin was pushed up against the edge of the frownies . Yes , they fade away after 20 mins , but this is how wrinkles form , over time you keep your skin in the same position and eventually it becomes a wrinkle . I do n't want to use these products and then over time get NEW lines ! They are hard to stick on and feel uncomfortable . The first few times you remove them , it 's going to take hair with it , and it hurts.I wish I knew what the adhesive was made out of . You will feel a tingle and numbing sensation the first hour is is on . This worries me because idk what the glue is made of.Finally , these things are n't cheap . I was planning on using these daily to prevent further wrinkles , but they are n't cheap and they are n't good.I found another product that works better and it 's cheaper ! Medical tape . I use 3 pieces on my forehead every night . I do n't wake up with new lines and it sticks easily without coming off or pulling my skin when I remove it . It 's cheap , and I do n't have to worry about what glue they use . I do n't even feel them when I 'm going to bed . Seriously , just go to the store where the first aid kits are , find the medical tape and have fun .	-1
I do not like these . Do n't waste your money . Do n't like the way they go on or stick to the face . Very disappointed in this product . Would not buy again	-1
I normally do n't go with Frownies I go with another brand ... well on the other brand I saw so many people had stated that Frownies worked better . So I decided to go with the Frownies this time . All I can say is I am disappointed with these ... they did n't stick and no one had mentioned that these are just pieces of thick cardboard with a slightly sticky side . In the directions it basically says you need to buy more creams and lotions just to get these to stick on your face . In the description it seemed like they just stuck by themselves and were comfortable but absolutely not . if these did actually work I would n't be able to sleep with a hard piece of cardboard on my face . Im extremely disappointed with these and will more than likely never buy these again : /	-1
A few years back Frownies came in a sort of wing shape , and it was almost perfect for placement between the eyes.the current `` shape '' is a triangle , which makes no sense at all and has to be cut to fit the area . The edges and points of the new Frownie come loose . So far , after a month , I 've seen no difference in the look of the wrinkles between my eyes , but when I remove the Frownie in the morning , there is a red patch which takes awhile to resolve .	-1
Do n't believe the favorable reviews . These are useless and tiresome . The adhesive is does n't adhere and there is no noticeable difference even after you tape them overnight for a week .	-1
Frownies , I learned after receiving them are ADHESIVE PAPER TAPE . You can purchase an entire ROLL of this at a local art supply or home depot store for 4 dollars . Frownies are perforated into triangles , but have extremely sharp edges that have to be trimmed with scissors or you will develop NEW lines . After & # 34 ; activating the glue & # 34 ; with water , you stick them on your face and it keeps you from making facial expressions . It DOES NOT remove the lines on your face . Now this does over time help with the 11 's as the less you furrow , the less your lines will deepen . However , with this company , I informed them that the stupid tape wasnt even sticking ( falling off after a few minutes , I believe it was simply a defective batch of tape ) but they advised me to buy a & # 34 ; special activation spray , made just for frownies & # 34 ; - Which I did . After getting this 10 dollar bottle of scented WATER , of course , there was no change . They did n't want to give me a refund because it was opened , and I spent entirely too much time going back and forth with their rude customer service MEN who knew zip about the product much less about a womans facial lines . After 20 or so emails , they did finally agree to let me return the & # 34 ; magical & # 34 ; tape , but I would have to pay the return shipping and there 's would n't guarantee they 'd refund the money anyways . Needless to say , the company sucks and so do the frownies . I did go to Michaels and buy some adhesive paper tape and with regular water , it works fine ! Since you 'll have to trim the sharp edges yourself anyway , I would recommend you get the 4 dollar 30 foot roll of tape and you can customize the sizes for more specific to your face coverage and not have to deal with these clowns . Yes , they are clowns . Amazon should have vetted these yokels .	-1
I found a recommendation for these in one of my magazines , and as I tend to contract my brow at night , thought they would be a good preventative against the furrows that I saw showing up in the mornings . Boy , was I ever wrong.Firstly , these are made of cardboard . Literally . Just a very thin cardboard . With serrated edges ! So , when I press one up to my head , the rough edges irritate and hurt my skin.Secondly , the glue is just plain old stamp paste . I know that smell ( and taste , yes , I tasted it ) . My grandmother had a roll of this wet-and-stick packing tape when I was a kid and this is the SAME STUFF . It 's not going to hurt you , but - and I asked my family practitioner physician father about this - it is in ZERO ways better or superior to just sticking a plain old piece of tape on your head . The glue on a piece of tape is no more irritating to most people 's skin.Thirdly , if you do get these to stick on your head correctly , you have to soak them to get them off . This means that they stick so hard that they will actually dent your skin around the edges of the piece . Exchange one kind of set-in wrinkle for another ( more weird looking ) one ? No thanks.I 'd highly recommend using a more skin-friendly device , since the physical method of patching the skin to inhibit muscle contraction works just fine . I 've been using Nexcare Acne Absorbing Covers ( from Amazon ) , which are round , clear , and extremely skin friendly . They also stick well and stay put through the night . The oil absorbing feature is an added benefit !	-1
try it for a few nights , first it would not stick i used the hydrator spray and still would not stick , and the ones that did got hard lol	-1
I can see how MAYBE this product works for a person with very very deep wrinkles ... using this every night may lift some of the indentations . I have very minor forehead wrinkles and this product does absolutely NOTHING for me . I would suggest not wasting your money .	-1
These are a lot work to figure out how to do right . Once that is figured out and use them , the next morning you have glued heavy craft paper stuck on the areas you treat . When they first come off , you 'd think these things are a miracle ; 5 minutes later things go back to wear they were . Have to say , maybe if used for extended periods of time they might really work but it 's just way too much effort to get these things on right just before going to bed , and then getting them removed and the left over glue in the morning . If you 're OK with being around the house with these paper patches on you , give it a try . But if you 're not , it 's a lot of work before going to bed and when you get up .	-1
Said a lot of times . This product is a commodity the failure I buy in the Amazon . After receiving the goods after using a period of time , will reflect the commodity problems . It is a little effect not . Give me the business then replied , differ from man to man the merchandise . I do n't understand , how many people you need to feedback says this commodity not effect a little , you will recognize that it is really no effect . So , really do not want to how much of what , if you can , or give me a refund . This is useful .	-1
I suffer from acne and wear makeup every day . I use Revlon Color Stay foundation and put a Baremineral 's concealer powder over it , and finish with Maybeline translucent setting powder . This wash doesnt get it off . It gets off the powders and a part of the foundation , but it never does a good job . I stopped using it .	-1
Been using this for awhile now because I refuse to waste it . My skin type : combination dry/oily areas/fair/sensitive/acne-prone . This face wash drys my skin out terribly . I hate that tight dry feeling I get after using it . Sure I feel like it is taking the makeup off , but at the loss of all my skins natural oils and moisture which it really really needs ! Lately my skin has been so dry and flaky so along with the colder weather and dry indoor heat this stuff is wrecking my skin ! I hate it . Definitely does nothing to clear my acne , if anything it makes it worse . I will not be repurchasing this product .	-1
Dried out my sensitive skin . Smell and texture are fine but it seems to strip too much oil on my face each time I use this .	-1
Did not like this product . Smells awful and it after using it I did not get that fresh clean feeling .	-1
I ca n't remember but I think this mirror broke the second week I had it . The plastic around the mirror is weak and cheap . Look somewhere else .	-1
While unwrapping this mirror , it fell onto the floor from a height of about 1.5 feet , and smashed into a dozen pieces . : - ( I 've owned a similar mirror from Goody that I 've had for many years , and that one has never broken , despite falling numerous times.Not recommended .	-1
I picked up 183 Pine Tar Soaps ( 4.25 Ounces ) at a going out of business sale . I thought I was getting a good deal.Turns out the Soap smells horrendous and caused me to gag and itch all over when I used it on my [ blank ] . I had to toss all of them out.If you are prone to skin allergies or aroma allergies , do n't get this one .	-1

I bought my husband a ton of different man soaps for Christmas . This one was an impulse buy on Amazon . I bought him at least four other different brands , and this was , by far , my least favorite . I do n't think it smells good , and the smell is STRONG . If I left it out , it would stink up the whole room . The other pine tar soaps I bought did n't bother me like this one did . If I 'd bought it at a regular store , I probably would have taken it back ( or better yet , not have bought it to begin with ) . I had to put it in a zipper bag when I got it , so it would n't stink up the house and so he would n't know what it was . I reluctantly gave it to him , and I 'm not looking forward to him actually using it . Additionally , when I received it , the box was all mashed up and open , so the soap never stayed in there correctly . This is my least favorite purchase from Amazon in a long time .	-1
Let me start by saying that I KNEW this soap had a very unique smell , described by other reviewers as being similar to a campfire . I thought that would be fine , since I love camping and campfires . Unfortunately , the soap I received smells nothing like a campfire ; rather , it smells like a pile of burning tires . Or like burning garbage . ( Having grown up in the country , I know what both of those things smell like . ) Anyway , despite the awful smell , I tried using this soap several times . Contrary to what is written on the packaging , it did not lather white ; the lather was more of a brownish-yellow . Fortunately it did n't seem to leave any discoloration on my skin . But the main reason that I wo n't be using this soap again is because the smell stayed on my skin for a very long time ... 8+ hours . I could have lived with the brown lather and the nasty smell IF the smell had not stayed on my skin ... but there is no way I 'm going to go out in public smelling like a trash fire . Not gon na happen ! I really , really wanted to like this soap . I 've been searching for something that would help with acne and seb derm , and this soap seems to get a lot of good reviews from folks with those conditions . I 'm wondering if the manufacturer changed the formula or something , because the soap I received is just nasty and is not like the soap described in the other reviews.Anyway , give it a try , but be prepared to smell like ashes and cinders .	-1
The instructions were simple and it was promptly delivered but the quality of the henna was very poor and gritty . I had trouble getting it out of my hair . The results were minimalI my dark brown hair had slightly copper tones . Later I tried it again with some body art quality henna mixed with lemon juice instead of hot water and liked it much better . It was cheaper as well but I would n't put it down for someone cautious for their first time .	-1
This was my first time using henna so I followed the included directions exactly . One thing I was not expecting is the scent ! It is such a strong herbal scent that it made my entire apartment smell like henna , and gave me a terrible headache . Once rinsed out & after several shampooings my hair still smelled like henna for about a week.I rinsed my hair with conditioner to remove the henna , and waited over 24 hours before washing with shampoo however , the color still only lasted about 4-5 washes and then it was completely gone.Overall , I did n't think it was worth the trouble it was very difficult for me to wash out the henna paste , and I ended up using at least half a bottle of conditioner , and lost a lot of hair in the process of trying to get it all out .	-1
This hair spray does not spray - it squirts , leaving hair clammy and dry . It may be a natural product but it damages my hair the same way other chemical sprays do . Will not buy again .	-1
let me explain that - I love their orange smell . Even the paper mint is ok , but the lemon smell is ... simply not there . It is not strong enough .	-1
I 've been looking for a natural product to use on my combination skin & the salesperson at my local health foods store highly recommended this product because it is `` good . '' I hated it to say the least ... not as good as I was made to believe .	-1
Do n't buy this stuff . It is smelly and does nothing it says it should do to help . A real joke .	-1
it left my skin feeling dry and felt like it left a film on my skin . i use it to wash my hands instead of my face then i follow up with a dab of lotion .	-1
I began using this about a month ago . I have had issues with acne since I hit puberty . The only thing that has completely cleared my skin was Proactiv and hormonal birth control . Proactiv is horrible for your skin and would dry mine out . Hormonal birth control is not good for your body either , so I tried to go organic . After about three weeks of using this , my acne got worse ; I kept getting huge pimples and whiteheads all over my face . I guess I will just have to keep looking .	-1
I found it drying and a little irritating . It did nothing but upset my acne.Its also very thin and liquid , it takes quite a lot of effort to get it into a good lather . It smells odd , too , kind of like alfalfa hay.Needless to say I was n't impressed and likely wo n't keep using it .	-1
My sister recommend this 'green ' product to me , and at the time I ordered it through Amazon , I did n't realize I was purchasing such a large bottle . I used it once and could n't stand the smell , so I 'm saving the rest for my sister 's next visit , to give to her as a gift . The odor is strong and I do n't enjoy having my face smell like a tree . I 'm sorry ... I just do n't like it at all .	-1
Terrible medicine , unnatural smell . And the soap dries out my skin after two uses . I just ca n't get passed the smell	-1
NOt sure if it does anything to my 4a/b hair . I dont hate it , but I have found no difference either way .	-1
Of all the Aubrey organics I have tried , this is the worst ! It has a nice , creamy consistency and does n't smell too badly , but it left my hair and scalp terribly oily . I suffered acne break-outs all over my forehead , behind my ears and on my neck where my hair touched my skin . Unless you live in a dry climate or have damaged hair , I strongly recommend you DO NOT use this product . Aubrey has plenty of other conditioners to choose from -- my favorite of which is the Honeysuckle Rose formula .	-1
I have read good things about this brand and finally took the plunge to buy it . I normally use tresemme naturals and it works great but this left my hair feeling dry and had no slip to it . I really wanted to love it but did n't do a thing for my hair . Maybe because of the protein , Im still open to trying other products from this brand but not to this particular conditioner .	-1
I have used this shampoo and it 's matching conditioner for over a month . My hair feels like a mossy bird 's nest when I use the shampoo . I have to use quite a bit to cover my long wavy/curly hair and it is extremely drying . No lather either , it 's like a very unspreadable gel . I have since found a better , more affordable organic brand that lathers naturally ( soap nuts ) and I am so thrilled to have found it . Back to AO , I also noticed a lot of build up . It just was n't cleaning well no matter how much I used and how much I scrubbed . Forget the conditioner , it did nothing . Waste of money for me . As for GLUTEN FREE ? Not sure for those with the allergy . Either it was the smell which I did n't really like or the wheat germ , but I sneezed constantly in the shower with it .	-1
This stuff is super thick and in a bad way . It has NO slip whatsoever , so it 's thick and goopey and does n't spread easily at all . It also has a strong , annoying scent , and did not effectively moisturize my thick , coily AA hair . I would not recommend .	-1
I have a senstive skin ... It stings , does n't get absorbed at all , sits at top of your skin like a plastic , hard transparent flaky mask ... feels very sticky when you try to remove it ... .too bad ... good for nothing .	-1
Someone please tell me this product is alcohol free ? It smells like alcohol and I 'm not sure I should put it on my face . I do not see positive results yet either .	-1
Contains denatured alcohol and made my hair lose moisture , there fore the 4c hair would n't clump to full potential . Also flaky . After switching to kccc i have no problem getting root to tip definition in my max hydrated 4c hair for the first time .

not sure what i benefited from this product - i do not know what this product did for my hair , so i would not purchase again	-1
I just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh . I have good skin , but it 's sensitive and was quite disappointed to find my skin very tight and dry after using it . I think it 's better suited for normal to oily skin.If you want a high quality skin exfoliate that does n't leave your skin dry , check out louisebianco.com - they make a product called Derma Polish - it 's not listed on their website so you have to call them to order it . It 's about $ 25 but it 's remarkable in that it removes dead skin and leaves your skin feeling moist and looking great .	-1
I am a BIG Earth Science fan and LOVE their facewash and moisturizers ( been using them for years ) but this scrub creme I DO NOT like . It smells bad and it 's just a thick , sticky , gooey , gross mess . There is barely any materials in it to `` scrub '' -- I guess that is why it 's called gentle -- but I do n't notice any exfoliating results like I achieve with other exfoliating cleansers . It 's sticky on your face and is hard to wash off . I highly recommend Earth Science but NOT this particular product !	-1
Never got a chance to rip the benefits of this oil . It smells just like a fuel ( my friends confirmed ) and I can not put in my mouth something that smells like a gasoline ... I using it as a moisturizer for legs for about 3 weeks , but do not see any change : (	-1
i bought this with plans to mix it with almond oil and lotion to make a superior moisturizer but the smell is horrific and it gave me massive head aches . I even tried to mix in scent but nothing seemed to cover it . I had to through it out , im sure it works as a moisturizer but i just could not handle the smell	-1
If you already have access to Retin-A or Renova , skip this product.It 's definitely a wanna-be.I got the set of cleanser/retinol/moisturizer , and took it all back . This was the ONLY item in the box that did n't have a nauseating smell.Try Anew Wrinkle Corrector instead , if you do n't have access to prescription topicals .

I went by the directions on the package . You keep adding layers of filler . This made my nails a grotesque yellow color .	-1
I had to give it at least two stars because it is effective at helping nail polish adhere without chipping . However , if your nails are prone to peeling or chipping , this will make them more brittle , dry , and prone to peeling . Switched to Nailtiques # 2 and it helped them recover .	-1
I hated the color that was sent to me , pale chalky beige . I would have preferred a vivid color instead . Please do n't be mislead into thinking that you are getting all five colors , because you will only get one . Advertisement not very clear , very confusing .	-1
i purchased this foundation is maceys a while ago and was amazing thought i was saving money but same color /nc35 does match at all like the store one I bought also is light physically if that matters , , ?	-1

For reference : I have very pale skin with red undertones . I use topicals for acne and rosacea . Rosacea means that at any time , for any reason , my skin can and will suddenly flush red and blotchy ; it can stay that way or it may calm down . My skin is combination ; it starts out dry but becomes greasy in a hurry throughout the day . It 's also 'mature skin ' now , I guess . Just some crinklage starting in the eye area , I try to take good care of my skin.I 've been experimenting around with foundations again , seeing what else is out there . I love Smashbox Camera Ready , but that cream formulation is not really serving me well right now , with summer here . My face is like waterfowl near the Exxon Valdez about an hour after I use it , and even the BB Cream is n't containing it . After a year I finally broke down and gave in to the MAC hype , I ordered a box of foundations directly from MAC to see which one matches me . You may need to experiment heavily to find just the right tone , and if one does n't work , try the opposite tone no matter what anyone tells you you 'should ' wear.This formula , in NW15 , was a perfect match . But it 's a powder , and Retin-A means that my face is perpetually peely and flaking . Powder formulas normally make beacons out of the dry skin areas . I put this foundation on last night , straight , with no primer at all . I used the Sephora Mineral brush ( my absolute favorite for powder foundations ) SEPHORA COLLECTION Classic Mineral Powder Brush # 45 and it went on like a dream . I started on the nose , and worked my way outward , and it looked great . So great , that it totally covered up every single discoloration , and I looked stark white . But , I *am* stark white , I 'm just not used to seeing my skin look completely blank like that . It almost looked geisha-like ( but in a good way ) . With such a perfect canvas , it was easy to make blush look like it should , and not like I 'm having a fever or embarassed . What 's more , I guess I 'd become accustomed to the shine that inevitably accompanies a cream foundation ; the BB Cream itself imparts a lustrous finish . This stuff was flat out MATTE . ( Others suggest using the Fix+ for that , I now use Urban Decay De-slick which acts as a mattifyer AND makes it dewy ) The makeup washed off easily when it was time to remove it.So ... on to today ! I primed with the Smashbox BB Cream in Fair . Then using the Real Techniques Buffer ( wanted to try it , and it 's fabulous , not as dense as the Sephora ) real Techniques Core Collection Set I applied the MAC foundation again . Once again it was flawless , but with the BB Cream as a primer it was not dull and matte , it had a little shine to it . But by essentially whiting out my face ( hey it matches my neck ! ) all the other makeup really popped because it was n't competing with the pink undertones . I put on some MAC Half Red lipliner and some lighter gloss on top to kind of lighten it up a little , and it really looked great . I was super impressed ! But , it felt like a mask . In the heat throughout the day , I could REALLY feel this on my face , and it felt like my face was suffocating . As I was driving I noticed that my nose looked shiny , so I took a good look and all my face was * ! ! SHINY ! ! **I had read some reviews from others that Philosophy The Present was the perfect primer to use with this instead of what I 've been using , so I went to the store to get it . The sales clerk asked me some questions while I was swatching on some of The Present ; she thought I had never used primer before and I told her I normally use the Smashbox BB Cream . She kind of reared her head back a little as she looked at me with my super shiny robot face and her mouth made a funny shape as she asked , `` You use it now ? ? '' Yeah lady I know how I look right now . I told her I was wearing the MAC and she curled her lip as she said , `` I 've heard it 's not worth the hype '' . Thanks , lady.When I got home I could n't wait to wash this thick paste off my face ! By then my face felt like it had mud on it . It essentially looked great , just shiny like I was on a sweaty coke binge . I noticed as I washed my face , that my skin along the jawline was peeling off in pieces . Not flakes , but actual pieces like little sheets . WOW this stuff must be drying as all heck . Even with BB Cream . As the hours have gone by since I removed the makeup , I 've noticed more and more zits popping up on my face . Just about 20 minutes ago a big red welt came up on the end of my nose , and it looks like I have a 3rd nostril trying to form . I can feel them on my chin as well . NOT HAPPY that I 'm wishing I had a paper bag like the Unknown Comic ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! UPDATE : Using Philosophy 's The Present Philosophy The Present Clear Makeup , 2 Ounce under this powder , with the Urban Decay De-Slick Urban Decay De-Slick Oil-Control Makeup Setting Spray 4 oz.. ( The Present , apply foundation , light misting of De-Slick ) made the appearance of the makeup much much better . It was n't anywhere near the grease/shine level as previous wearing . However , it still felt heavy on my face ( Unlike the Smashbox Camera Ready ) and I still could n't wait to wash it off . And , sadly , it still broke me out . But on a good note , I 'm loving the Philosophy product under foundations that are more drying than the Smashbox , it 's a whole other animal from the Smashbox BB Cream . Normally I do n't like Philosophy skin care products , but have to admit this one is a real winner ! It also has a soothing property to it that the BB Cream does n't impart . NO SPF though , that 's a bummer . I have since found that MAC products work great with the Philosophy primer but I can not get any of them to cooperate with the Smashbox BB Cream.UPDATE II : This foundation caused such a severe flare up that I looked like I 'd just won a cherry pie eating contest , with my hands tied behind my back . Chin and cheeks engorged with red inflamed bumps and pustules , knots and pimples on my forehead , end of my nose , and cheeks . Some under my jawline as well . To make matters worse , I could't use my Lancome Huile Doceur to wash , without it stinging and inflaming my face further . My backup cleansers ( Cetaphil , Cerave , DHC Deep Cleansing Oil ) similarly irritated my face . The only thing that calmed it down and enabled the healing to begin was straight coconut oil . A week later my face is just down to the healed but flaky stage and I still can not use any of my normal cleansers without inflammation and irritation . Maybe that is a good thing , since the coconut oil costs a fraction of the cleansers ! But I do find it disturbing that a foundation product can incite such an allergic reaction that it changes the way your skin acts EVEN WHEN YOU STOP USING IT . Thanks to this MAC product I had to completely change my entire skincare routine and eliminate all cleansers except for just plain coconut oil . That profoundly stuns me , that ONE PRODUCT can change your skin like that . Just ... wow . On the plus side , my face loves the coconut oil .	-1
I have many friends who use this product but I can not stand it . For me , I get no coverage and look chalky and pastey . The color is a match but seems to be mostly corn starch or something of the sort . It even makes me wonder if this is not authentic . My friends use it and it looks great on them , but what I received is no good .	-1
It didnt make me break out but I think its fake , my last mac smell different and had a smooth finish . This is chalky	-1
I was very excited about receiving this product , after reading the reviews , but I 've got to say that it is yet another dissapointment . I 've used it for a little over a month and I have n't seen any results at all . Unfortunately , I had placed a second order , the ever hopeful I am , so now I 'll have to use it , since it is not exactly cheap .	-1
This sells because fatgirlslim is a FAN-TASTIC title . The product smells wonderful ! That is where this ends . I am not paying this amount for great smelling lotion . Off brand cellulite gels or lotions work better just do n't smell as good .	-1
i have n't completely used this yet but i brought this to make me slimmer , and it does n't do that . the jar only says for cellulite .	-1
I 'm not sure what I was expecting , but I really do n't see the results . I used it continuously for two months along with the love handler and the fatgirlsleep , and did notice a difference , but I 've had far better results with seaweed soap and exfoliants . Give it a shot , but do n't count on a miracle.Edit : Sorry , I did say both . What I meant was that I noticed that my skin was more moisturized ( which plumps up the skin making cellulite softer ) , but I saw no real benefit that could not be achieved from any good body lotion or oil .	-1
My small toe rubs again the forth toe and gives me painful blisters . These toe separators did not work for me . I have given myself a chance to get used to them and suffered with them for 2 weeks wearing them every day . They slipped out from between my toes . They were not comfortable in my shoes . I felt them all the time . And they irritated the skin between the toes while they were in place . I threw them out.I found a better solution chatting with an avid biker . He uses BodyGlide to prevent saddle sores , I decided to try BodyGlide between my toes and it worked for me . Now I use BodyGlideBodyglide Advanced Technical Formulato put between my toes every day . The toes glide against it each other rather than rub , and I do n't have any blisters . I have no ill effect from using it as frequently as I do.Ali Julia review	-1
Due to arthritis , I have crooked toes , and thought these would help to separate them . However , they tend to slip out , and are uncomfortable . I have tried different sizes , but all had the same results . I would n't waste my time buying these , unless , perhaps , your toes are slightly crooked ; they might help .	-1
I 've been wearing toe spacers for nearly 8 years , so I 've seen my share of brands . I was very disappointed with this brand because they are so thin . They really do n't even space my toes apart because they are so narrow . I 'm looking elsewhere .	-1
It kills my toes . Had it on for about 30 seconds . Waste of money . Do n't do it ! Ugg Ugg Ugg	-1
Great idea , Seemed to be just what my doctor ordered but hard to position toes in loops . Just get it right then time to take it off and wash. Easy care , just wash and dry but then start all over fitting iton your toes . If not fitted right , not too confortable . Have used better items to straighten my toe .	-1
This lotion seems to just sit on the surface , does not penetrate or soften . My hands just end up looking shiny .	-1
I found this product made my hair sticky . Very little thickening . I did n't like this at all . I know you are only supposed to use a tiny amount but still did not like the feel of it in my hair .	-1
This would only work if you have minimal hair thinning problems . ( like no scalp shows to begin with ) . No better than `` Cowboy magic '' hair shiner ( thin consistency reflects how its NOT going to work ) .If you have more severe thinning problems , use this : Samy Fat Hair Creme Thickening 3.5 ozAfter you shower & towel dry your hair , use some spray on detangler ie : No More Tangles ( so as to not pull your fine wispy hair out combing it wet ) , then get a dime to quarter size of this , smear it in your palms , gently work it in your hair & leave it in ( this is important ! ) . Let your hair dry.May take a little longer to dry , but the feeling & look of fullness & thickness is worth it if you have thin hair .	-1
I was so hopeful about this product . I tried it both on dry and wet hair , and either way , it just made my hair feel greasy . By the end of the day I looked like I had n't washed my hair all week . I used varying amounts , pea to nickel-sized . Did n't matter . I give it 2 stars because it did make hair feel fuller ( which is weird , since greasy hair is usually flat ) . I have very fine hair , and an oily scalp that needs to be washed daily . This just did n't work for my chemistry .	-1
I was disappointed after all of the good reviews I read . I just did n't find that this made any difference in my hair at all .	-1
I tried this and it only made my hair feel dirty and weighed down . I have fine hair and it was not for me .	-1
I already have thick hair but am always looking for more volume . I was impressed by some of the reviews on here an decided to give it a try . I have n't really noticed any difference in my hair . I still continue to use it because it says with continued use your hair can get up to 70 % thicker but I do n't know . Maybe it only works for people with thinner hair to begin with . It 's too expensive for me to buy with no results . I do love the smell and it certainly has n't damaged my hair and has good ingrediants so I 'm going to keep using until I run out . Maybe after I do n't use it anymore I 'll be able to tell a difference , but as for right now I 'm sad to say I 'm not thrilled .	-1
These moisturize really well . When I get out of the bath , my skin feels silky and smooth . I have two issues with the product , though . One : the smell . I do n't know what the scent is , but it 's not a good one and it 's not relaxing . It actually gave me a sinus headache and I had to throw the rest out . I wish there was a choice between scents because I would use the product if I actually enjoyed the smell . Two : the packaging . I 'm not a fan of having bath products contained in boxes . It should be in a plastic container that wo n't be destroyed if it comes in contact with water .	-1
I would give this no stars if I could . This made my skin so greasy . It also burned . It left my face so red and it felt like it was on fire even after I washed it off . It made the skin on my face peel like I had been sun burnt , I had to take this stuff back !	-1
When I was experimenting with cold creams a while back , I came across this upon recommendation from a friend 's mother . While I liked the old fashioned , perfume smell , I found the consistency too greasy and it did n't remove my makeup too well or moisturize my skin . In fact , I would n't recommend it to people with sensitive skin , since my face did redden when I used it ( and I highly doubt it was the red dye in it too ) .	-1
I loved Atopalm . It was a rich fragrance free moisturizer that I could use on my entire body , including my face . The company changed the formulation in 2010 , basically removing the parabens and adding fragrance . This made a huge difference to the efficacy of the product . It is no longer a rich emollient cream . It is now like many other drugstore moisturizers . And because my facial skin is very sensitive , the fragrance ( although very subtle ) STINGS my skin . I 'll use the jar I have for my family ( who it does not bother ) , but wo n't be buying again . Very disappointing .	-1
I did not love it . There are better and less costly products available . So , pass this one up . From now on , I am .	-1
the smell of some sort of pineapple fruit drink is overwhelming ... the & # 34 ; tropical & # 34 ; definitely dominates the & # 34 ; coconut. & # 34 ; I was expecting coconut with a hint of something else , and got almost no coconut scent and a powerful candy fruit smell instead , hence the rating .	-1
Suave is one of the cheaper shampoos out there . But hey , they usually smell good and they 're good in a pinch . Especially considering that a bottle lasts awhile.Tropical Coconut smells good . It 's sweet and definitely smells of coconut . I guess the tropical comes from the fact that it is coconut , because I do n't sense any other `` flavors '' in this mix . No pineapple or anything . And it clings to your hair , so hours after taking your shower , you can still smell the coconut . So it is a bit strong.The effects on hair are debatable . It does get it clean . But it also dries hair out a little bit and I 've been noticing quite a few more split ends than normal . And since this shampoo lasted me two and a half months ( being used on hair that 's to the middle of my back ) that 's a long time to be torturing your hair . But I hate wasting stuff so I stuck it through . I also noticed that my hair was n't quite as shiny and healthy looking as it used to be ( although I can not definitively blame the shampoo for that ) . Still , it makes me nervous about using it again . It does lather up quite well compare to a lot of natural brands . Bubbly and foamy white lather that only takes about a nickel sized drop to generate.I 'm not really sure how this shampoo is considered natural . There 's a long list of unpronounceable ingredients and only a few of those are actually natural that I can tell . It just is n't something that should be continually used on your scalp in my opinion . Splurge for a little bit better . With ingredients like Ammonium Laureth Sulfate and Cocamid MEA , I 'm not really sure that this is shampoo or rocket fuel . I do n't know what most of the stuff is.The bottom line is that this is cheap shampoo , with a decent scent , but probably not something that should be used on hair that you care about . I recommend avoiding it.Review by M. Reynard 2013	-1
It made my hair feel built up after first shower . Plus , this is super watery and not conditioning at all . Never again . I handed the stuff over to a guy friend . : s	-1
My sister had one and I did too . The dryer would turn off on everything but the low setting right out of the box . Both units did this . Do not buy . No , you 're not going to be one of the lucky ones ... do n't buy this piece of junk .	-1
I did n't buy it here but I still feel the need to write a review . I like Conair but this product was a waste of money . The hose does n't stay on the cap so while it 's supposed to be drying your hair , it 's falling out at the same time . Then.. it concentrates on only the section that the hose is connected to . I have to keep moving the cap all around my head just to get each section to dry . It was also HELL just to get everything back into the compartment . I could go on and on but I think that 's enough .	-1
but i do n't . the biggest thing is that it just does n't dry . i put it on and then take my sweet time putting on makeup so that this thing has plenty of time to do its thing , but my hair comes out about as wet as if i 'd wrapped it in a microfiber towel for a few minutes ( which is to say , maybe 10 percent dry -- not dripping , but definitely wet and not damp ) . there are other things i do n't like about it , such as the hose does n't fasten to the cap , just rests in the opening without any kind of clip or click or anything , which means paying attention to how much i move around to be sure the hose does n't fall out of the cap ; or that the hose is so short that the base has to be sitting pretty close to me the whole time . for now , i 'll stick with my hard-bonnet dryer on a floor stand . does n't allow for much mobility , but it 's way more effective at actually drying .	-1
This thing does n't actually deserve ANY stars , but that 's not an option here , so it gets the requisite one star.Do n't waste your money . Within fifteen minutes ( I kid you not - I timed it , prompted by the negative reviews I saw on this site ) of starting this thing up , the stoopid thing overheated and shut itself off . This thing spent more time off than on . With the quantity of hair that I have , I normally spend easily an hour and a half to two hours under any dryer in order to completely dry my hair.I 'm going to buy another Lady Dazey dryer as soon as I can get my hands on one - I 've had one of those for over a decade , and only recently has it started acting up ! Do yourself a favor : find a Helen of Troy brand Lady Dazey soft bonnet dryer - those things are more dependable than anything else out there , and worth EVERY penny !	-1
I recently had my hair styled and thought curlers would help me maintain the style -- unfortunately the curlers were too small , they really did n't heat up as fast as the instructions said they would , I also had trouble making sure they were connected to the heat source -- the casing is just too floppy for that I think -- also , I did n't like the pins -- the curlers kept on flopping around on my head and just were n't hot enough to do the job . I returned them and will stick with a curling iron .	-1
This was a complete and utter waste of money ... here 's the beginning of my laundry list of complaints:1 . There is no indication of when it 's heated up . I waited about five minutes and then just started to randomly touch it ( that 's what she said ) . Impractical and annoying.2 . The rollers do n't stay hot for long and generally did n't seem all that hot . The only moderate curl I got was on the very first one I managed to put in.3 . The pins are the WORST and not do stay in place . They completely did not stay on the roller , or in my hair and hurt when I tried to push them in so they 'd properly hold . My hair slid out of the roller before I could secure them.4 . The rollers are shaped oddly ... with grooves . What for ? I have no idea . Do you want ridges in your hair ? If it 's suppposed to help grip one 's hair , it FAILS MISERABLY at that task.I wish I had n't waited so long to try these out or they would have been a definite return . I have fine textured long hair , straight with a slight wave , easy to curl but tends to fall flat . If you have thicker or coarser hair , perhaps this may be a better tool .	-1
I 've owned many hair curlers , and I was looking for one that offered large rollers and fast heat up . I was disappointed on both points . First , the `` large '' rollers are not large . They 're medium . The smaller ones are really small . I plug it in before my shower , and even after showering and blow drying my hair , it 's still not really heated up like it should . The only thing I can say that 's positive about this product is the compact size of the unit and the number of rollers , which is nice . But if you 're looking for large rollers ( greater than a one inch diameter , and something that heats up really fast -- this one is NOT for you .	-1
It was a cute idea for travel , but for my purposes , it had too few rollers and never quite got hot enough . I ended up buying and keeping the Conair Compact Hairsetter ( in blue ) ; it 's a little clunkier to travel with but delivers much better results and has the right number of rollers .	-1
I attempted this 4 times on my hair and scalp . It does make your hair soft but it is n't necessary . It does not grow your hair . People that are saying it does , there 's no scientific proof . You have to be careful with it . It 's thick . I did n't like it because it made my scalp very itchy . I 'm probably allergic to it .	-1
I put it on my hair as my friend advised me as its good for anti hair loss , but it gave opposite result I lost my hair , moreover there appeared something like scurf .	-1
The lotion just like sat on top of my skin , did n't really get absorbed.Not a fan of the smell either . Thought it would be a heavy lavendaer smell , but that was n't the case .	-1
I was re-stocking the guest bathroom and bedroom and got the bright idea to get a collection of Avalon , which I 've always liked , so everything would match.The lavender scent is not pleasant and is not the lavender I am used to . In addition , the way the products are labeled it 's almost impossible to tell which is lotion vs hand wash without a lot of light and glasses.The `` off-lavender '' odor of the lotion is very strong , almost overpowering , and the lotion itself is cloying and greasy.This was not a good choice at all - I should have looked more carefully at packaging and such before purchasing . But who can mess up lavender ? Avalon . That 's who.Ca n't recommend .	-1
Smell is completely chemical . As other reviews state , it seems that product has changed , but continue being sold using positive reviews from the previous version . Shame	-1
Ox Bile is essential in helping with digestion of fats in older people or in people who have had their gallbladder removed but this dose is very high . I spent the night of the first dose in great pain , throwing up a very strong acid bile that burned my throat and mouth for hours . The diarrhea was just as painful and it took several hours to clear my system . 3 different bouts of vomiting and diarrhea . Just beware if you are a first time use of Ox Bile , to take a smaller dose , start out with 125 mg and work up as needed . I will purchase some empty gelcaps and break down the doses to manageable levels so it is not a waste of money , but it was sure a shock to my system .	-1
I was excited to try this product especially reading that it helps in absorption of foods after having the gallbladder removed.I took these as it said on the label , however , I had some serious adverse reactions to these . They made me sick to my stomach as though I had diarrhea . Perhaps the strength was too strong for me , but I threw these out ! Perhaps I will try the one 's that are 125mg .	-1
Was really looking forward to this hair roller set . It is much harder to use . Takes longer to set . Curls did not last longer . Very disappointed . I 'm going right back to my jumbo revlon heated rollers .	-1
I tried three times to get this to work ( and watched a you tube tutorial ) and maybe it 's just my hair because everyone else seems to love it , but it would n't hold the curl at all ... even with product the curls , more like waves really , just fell after a few minutes ... .resulting in just a mess of hair . My hair is naturally wavy and not especially course , so I would n't recommend this , but maybe it 's just me ... .hair is a subjective thing I suppose .	-1
I have thin , fine , very straight hair . I had hoped after reading some of the other reviews that this hairsetter would be helpful.What I discovered was this product is difficult to use and time consuming . I thought I could set my hair then do my make up while the rollers cooled.The rollers are easy enough , but the caps are a real bear to clip on the roller so that they actually hold . The clips do no fit on easily and the roller keep falling out.If I want to use this I must plan extra time -- -a LOT of extra time . The up side would be I 'd be using steam to set my hair rather than a hot , dry curling iron and I liked that idea.Since I bought it and unwrapped it to use , I have it , so I 'll try again . But , not excited about it .	-1
Cool little device . But all it did was add moisture to my hair so it did n't hold curl because it was moist . ( It takes a long time for my hair to dry with any amount of water in it ) .	-1
Where do i start ? I am sorry but i ca n't believe they designed to hair . Not only that how did it make to amazon best seller list with 300 review ? HA wow ! I like my hair soft shiny and wavy . Guess what ? this product does the opposite . After blow dry my hair i used this rollers the result was hell ... It gives me a tight curl but my hair was dry , twinkled . The steam makes your hair raw , dry . It 's like putting a water on ur hair . Do not expect compliment or anything . worry about your hair . It was like abusing my hair . The next day or after a few hour try to brush ur hair , it is really difficult . The idea of steam does n't give the desired result . Even though i get tight curl , It was really wired curl it makes my hair away short and frizzy . You do n't want that . Thanks to return policy immediately return it . If you can find a good ceramics rollers are a way better . Are there any one that agrees with me ? ?	-1
I received this product in December as a gift . I just tried it this evening and the unit is broken . It just makes a clicking noise and does not heat up or steam up . I am dissappointed as I have used these Caruso Rollders once before many years ago and I wore the old one out . I am trying to get a hold of the seller to send back for either a new one or refund.I hope everyone else is having luck with their Caruso C97958 Professional ION Steam Hairsetter .	-1
I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try . I am not impressed with these rollers since it takes way too much time ( and lots of practice ) to get it right . Part of my curls were way too tight , I had to use the blow dryer and a brush to & # 34 ; uncurl & # 34 ; them . Not enough large rollers for my med . long hair , the small ones are useless unless you have real short hair . Also the clamps to hold the rollers leave a mark on the curl which again requires a round brush and a blow dryer to even it out . Another item that will rot away in a drawer since I - regretfully - disposed of the box prior to testing them .	-1
A pain . Takes to long . Did not work as well as regular curlers . I tried and tried . Returned it . Egh	-1
I usually use the Sedu clipless curling iron and love it but wanted to see if this would be faster . My hair curls easily and it 's fine . Well , this took FOREVER ! ! I swear I was at it for over an hour at least both times.. I followed complete instructions twice and both times it took forever . GOD BLESS my Sedu . Anyway , guess what kind of curls I got with the Caruso ? No curls ! just nothing . Some of the hair had a very slight , strangely shaped curl . I did NOT over saturate curlers or under saturate . Left them in until dry etc . I do NOT understand all the raving reviews . They must be getting paid or something . Who has three hours to get ready in the morning ? Not me .	-1
Take to long . To much effort . Did not like at all . Did not like the steam and water . Regular curlers work better .	-1
I really hoped to like this but it is just o.k . I 've tried all the top department store mascaras and this is n't anything special . This is over $ 30.00 and it does n't compete with Lancme or Dior . I have found my favorite so far , Benefit they 're Real . It makes lashes super long and thick .	-1
I 've been using this for years now..and this time not sure if redken changed anything in the ingredient or the seller is sending some duplicate which is not actually redken..this is making my hair all frizzy and dry which is odd . Well , anyways I bought it so will use it and then buy one in another store to make sure if redken really has changed something on this conditioner/duplicate product and will discontinue using this .	-1
As much as i do not like to be negative I have to be honest , This body spray straight up smells like medicine . It does n't even get better . i would not purchase again . But hey , someone else might like it ?	-1
Touts itself to be an antioxidant sunscreen , but the only 2 `` active '' ingredients listed are the usual sunscreen things . How it 's supposed to be antioxidant is beyond me . Would not buy again .	-1
I returned this . Its a greasy thick white paste totally unusable unless you are a life guard or dont mind this look .	-1
This is probably one of the sissiest exfoliators I have ever purchased . It has beads so small I might as well use my Aveeno face exfoliator because it 's not doing much . Smell is ok , packaging as in the container is less than ideal ... some of mine started leaking rather quickly .	-1
This note of alert is intended for those who care : Amazon includes this soap in its category `` cruelty free , '' a choice on the left side of the page that narrows results within `` soap . '' That is flat-out incorrect . The ingredients listed on the package include goat 's milk , but the main ingredient is tallow -- in other words , animal fat . It might or might not be tested on animals ( I do n't know ) , but it is definitely MADE of animals . I ordered this based on its good reviews and Amazon 's categorization of it as cruelty-free . Since the ingredients are not listed in the product description as of this writing , and because repacking and returning items is a pain in the neck , I am mentioning it for those who might , like me , want to know .	-1
I had high hopes for this product due to all the great reviews but was only left disappointed . When i used this product , it made my hair come out in big clumps whenever I washed or brushed my hair which never happens ! I have very thick , long hair and was very surprised when I saw clumps of it coming out whenever I used this product . Once I stopped , so did the hair loss . DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ! ! !	-1
This oil smells like sweet herbs . I give it a rating of 3 at first because of the smell and feel . I love the smell , but I guess I have to wait another two weeks to see if it has made my hair thicker and longer . It feels really cool and moist on the scalp . I leave it in overnight.It 's been a month now of me using this ; it didnt do much . It does not make my hair soft at all . I hate coconut oil on my hair . It makes it crispy . I have natural african hair . I didnt use it 2-3 times weekly . I kinda stopped . I can tell after about 7 days when a hair growth product is working .	-1
What a waste of money . This , along with a brush , a comb and all kinds of other & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ; hair growth remedies have now gone in the garbage . I sport my & # 34 ; baldness & # 34 ; and wear it proudly . I am done spending money on things like this.The oil does smell good and is probably great for the scalp . But , other than that , I really do n't see the benefits of using it as a & # 34 ; solution & # 34 ; to hair loss . ( I used it religiously for a month ) The research on baldness is legion ... and most everything I have read list several main causes : Genetics , Diet and Stress . There is only so much a person can do about all 3 of these causes ( especially the genetics one ) .Save your money ... until they come up with a cure for Vanity ... which we all deal with in our culture in one form or another ... and we are all guilty of it.You look great ... if you are beautiful from the inside out .	-1
I have never minded a product 's fragance before , but this- blegh ! On top of that , it made my skin feel sticky , did n't improve my hair , and is all around pretty useless . For reference , I have long , thick , smooth wavy Asian hair .	-1
I have been using derma blend since 2003 . I bought the setting powder but it never works . When I apply my concealer , I dab on a generous amount of setting powder and leave it on for 5-10 minutes before I dust it off but the concelaer still remains moist/wet and rubs off if I touch it or brush up against clothing etc . Perhaps I got a bad batch but it makes absolutely no difference to me .	-1
I bought this product . I thought that it was a good deal . I had to throw it out this morning . It made my skin burn , whenever I use it . The dermablend powder from the mall had a different consistency and never made me burn . I threw it out , because I am not sure if it is really dermablend and I was concerned for my skin health . I have been using the real dermablend for years . I guess , I wanted a deal . Burning skin is not worth it .	-1
I was looking for a micro-fine powder to use to set my makeup . This looked cakey on my dry skin . I much prefer the Laura Mercier setting powder or even the $ 5 Elf HD powder .	-1
It does n't set my dermablend foundation at all . I 'm a dermablend lover but this is a definite dud . I would n't buy again . The only thing it really does is temporarily matte my face .	-1
I got this to 'set ' my liquid makeup , but this just does n't work . It cakes up quickly and it does n't set my face at all	-1
These gloves are terrible . They are way too thin and come apart at the seams easily . Terrible product ! Spa Sister White Cotton Overnight Moisture Gloves	-1
This contains a bunch of soy , weird coating , and most importantly , did nothing for my hair . Try the Phyto supps .	-1
This product did nothing for my hair growth and i took the pills as recommended . Let me tell you it is so annoying to take 8 pills a day ! I have a life ! I would n't recommend , I was n't hoping for a miracle given the ingredients are vitamins and amino acids and I already was taking vitamins and eating extremely well . However , I was hoping to at least notice something . I have used for about 6 months since I had bought a package but will not repurchase .	-1
I bought this product and thought nothing of the price for if it worked , it would have been worth it . I was very disappointed . It was just a gimmick . However , I found amazing results by taking biotin , folic acid , and bio-sil 3x 's a day . Do n't waste your money on something that does n't work .	-1
I did n't notice any difference with my hair but my nails did grow significantly faster and looked 10 times healthier . I 'm a bit disappointed because I was looking to strengthen and shine my hair , not grow my nails.Thankfully , there were no side effects . I do think it 's ridiculous to expect people to take 8 pills a day . With the lack of research , I was then too worried to take my actual vitamins , other supplements , or painkillers on top of the 8 pills .	-1
I didnt see no growth and its too many pills you have to take in one day and the kinda big which I didnt mind its just the quanity .	-1
I bought these SPECIFICALLY to avoid & # 34 ; raccoon eyes , & # 34 ; and after just two uses I looked like I was some comedic movie character who fell asleep on the beach and someone played a prank on me . It was seriously so obvious and embarrassing I had to tan a few more times without goggles ( which I NEVER do ) just to even things out a little bit . I did myself a BIG FAVOR and ended up buying the Wink Ease sticker goggles , which are amaaaaaazing - although they can be slightly prices since you only get 3-6 uses out of each pair before the sticky properties wear off .	-1
Great in concept , horrible in execution , try as I might I have not been able to get these to work and stay in place.I bought these to use outside in the sun ( not in a tanning booth ) . I thought that they would be a good compromise to help save my eyes from some of the UV rays as I was sunning . Thus far , I have been unable to get these to stay on my face for more than a few seconds . I do n't know if there is any trick to them or not ... . but for me , they do not work . I wanted them to work because I liked the concept . But they do not.Not recommended .	-1
Did nothing to prolong manicure . Many other base coats to choose from , this is n't a good one . Too bad . I really love CHINA GLAZE nail filled .	-1
I tried using this with almost every nail polish I have ... . and no matter what , it would not work ! ! ! My nail polish last MUCH longer with no base coat ! ! ! ! This stuff seems to make the nail polish come off faster ! : ' ( very disappointed I wasted my money on this	-1
For me , the color nail polish coat adheres to this fine ( why would n't it ? ) , but within a few days the base coat separates from the nail . I 'm not sure what the advantage is versus using no base coat at all.Update June 2014 : It might not be the product 's fault . I learned that some people have naturally oily nails , just like hair and skin can be oily , and this would inhibit good adhesion . I 'm supposed to de-grease my nails with alcohol first , and then base coats should adhere better . When I get around to trying that I 'll post another update with my results .	-1
It goes on fine but my nail polish will peel off the whole entire nail . It 's like it adheres to the polish but not my nail so it just comes off all at once . I find myself using different base coats because this one just does n't work well for me .	-1
Did n't really seem to work any better than a clear coat under color does-for me anyway . I have weak and peel-prone nails , so maybe this works better for someone with good nails . I do love china glaze though , the polish never gooped up at all and I used the whole bottle ( I was really hoping it would eventually work hehe )	-1
My nails chipped and broke just as fast if not faster using this product . I even bought a China Glaze color to go with it . No dice .	-1
I was very excited to recieve this base coat . I am attempting to grow my nails longer , now that I am getting older . I would never purchase this product agaian . This base coat does not keep my polish on , and it creates not barrier for my darker polished . I put this on and then painted two top coats and my nails were still stained red from the polish . I am very dissatisfied .	-1
I have been buying glass/crystal nail files exclusively for years now . I have one that is by far better than all the others and it still files perfectly , but I need more for other rooms of the house and have never been able to find it again , otherwise I would buy only that one exclusively ( it is one-sided , white , and blue on the last third , with a metallic JB sticker on it ) . Good ones last a long time and are smooth and do n't leave a rough edge on your nails.I bought this Nail Tek one because I really like the idea of having a carrying case ( sleeves are okay , but they get dirty and are impossible to clean inside ) . This one was for my purse , and if it was good , I was going to buy more . I am disappointed because the case is made of plastic and looks really cheap , and has some sticky residue still on it which wo n't come off , but my main complaint is that the case is so skinny on the inside diameter that this particular glass file is the only one that will fit ( my others from other manufacturers do not , yet all other glass nail files are that size , not this size ) , so I will not be able to re-use this case . And this nail file is just okay , not great . It is fairly rough . It does file the nails , but it should/could be smoother . And why would a person pay this much for a mediocre file , when the whole thing is disposable , not refillable . It might fit a short thin paper emery board , but I do n't know , as I do n't have or use that kind ( they 're not as smooth as the diamond/glass/crystal boards ) , and if you 're looking to buy this style you probably are not interested in paper ones . I also think that the price needs to come down ( ~ $ 13 is way too much ) . Not worth the money at all .	-1
Too small , thought they would expand when wet , do not . Was looking for looflas , these are nothing like that ! Would not buy if I had known .	-1
This sponge is not up to the quality you would expect from a Silk Sponge . It 's just a tiny regular sponge , kind of rough in texture . Good for scrubbing off dead skin , but not at all for delicate or sensitive skin . Gave it to my husband who has oily skin , but wo n't work for my dry skin . Really not a Silk Sponge at all .	-1
ITS WATER IN A CAN.IT SMELLS LIKE SWEAT ( SALTY SMELL ) DOES NOTHING ! WASTE OF MONEY WASTE OF PRODUCT ! DIDNT EVEN HYDRATE MY SKIN IT MADE ME LOOK LIKE A WET MESS !	-1
I bought this cap from another site and although it works well , it can not get as warm as you 'd need it to be for deep conditioning nor does it stay warm for a long time . I used this product ACCORDING TO THE DIRECTIONS and the packs burst and the gel hardened . I called the place I got it from and they do not sell refill packs . I have yet to find any place that does . So now , this product is basically a towel . It was okay while it lasted though but if I knew then what I know now , I would n't have bought it .	-1
Sorry , not a lot to say about this except I used it as instructed and there was absolutely no change or growth in my hair . The only thing I got from this was a really and long term upset stomach . I use Biotin and Mane 'N Tail now and my hair has grown about 3.5 inches in a little over a month .	-1
I had to return this product because it is basically a placebo . You have to take it too many times and the results arent anything less than what you would normally get > I gave 2 stars because maybe I did not use it long enough to see the `` miracle '' . I stopped using it in February and have since just focused on nuturing my hair , scalp massages and no heat and I have already grown 2.5 inches . Do n't waste your money .	-1
Will never purchase again . Zero results and I was very disciplined in taking these tablets . No difference in nails or hair . None ! ! !	-1
I took these vitamins for more than six months and during that time I did not notice any enhanced hair growth or any noticeable improvement in my skin and nails though I was on a very healthy diet , drinking plenty of water and exercising regularly at the time . I stopped using them and decided to try getting the needed nutrients from natural sources so I turned to eating a breakfast consisting of wheat germ , wheat germ oil , milk , an egg and fresh fruits daily followed up with healthy servings of vegetables and yogurts and plenty of water for the remainder of my meals , and it was only then that I noticed improvements in my skin , hair and nails . My hair texture has improved , it is growing above average , my dry skin and scalp have normalized , my complexion has cleared and I have a lot of energy . It is more than one year later , and these improvements are still there , and it is cheaper on my pockets .	-1
I did n't know that it had to be a light weight blow dryer . tried to get this to hold my blow dryer & apparently my blow dryer is too heavy & it wo n't hold it , keeps tipping over . NOT a good purchase ! !	-1
the expensive one I purchased at Sally 's fell apart after several years so I had to replace it . This looked similar but it is NOT like the one I purchased a few years ago . This is made of very cheap thin aluminum and I ca n't get the pieces together . It comes with 2 screws but the holes are not large enough to screw in so maybe Heman can come and put this together for me . it 's a cheap piece of crap lol . All of that could be forgiven BUT when I put my hair dryer in it , the whole thing tips over . It 's not the base that is the problem it 's the & # 34 ; flexible hose & # 34 ; part is not strong enough ... I REALLY need to start reading these reviews ... .	-1
It was hard to get it assembled . Even then , I could n't adjust the height . So I adjusted me to fit the stand . It actually worked pretty good for about two weeks . Then I turned my head and the dryer fell off and broke the stand . All gone now . Just another piece of broken plastic taking up space .	-1
So I ordered two of these Formula 2 PLUS , .25 oz bottles . I chose SleekHair as my choice to get the product . I think Amazon was n't selling it Prime or something , I forget why . Anyway , here 's my experience ... Took a little over a week to get . I got the Formula 2 bottles instead , not the Formula 2 PLUS , and the wrong amount - 1/8 fl oz instead of 1/4 fl oz . Contacted the seller , they said they were sending out 2 new bottles.Another week or so goes by . I get the new box . Open it . Same FORMULA with a UPS label to send back the 1/4 ounce bottles of the same crap . So they sent me the 1/4 ounce bottles of the wrong formula anyway so I 'm in the same boat . Still did n't get the product I ordered . And yes , there is a difference . It says so RIGHT ON THE BOX . So I contact them again.Their answer ? They are very sorry but they do n't sell the Formula 2 PLUS bottles but feel free to send them all back . What ? I specifically waited three days before writing this review . They are still listed as one of the sellers of this product even though they do n't have this product to sell.BUY FROM SOMEONE OTHER THAN SLEEK HAIR , they do n't sell this product and will give you the same run around .	-1
I love PCA Skin . But I have mild breakouts , more black heads and white heads and sometimes a random big zit . I thought this would clear up my mild break outs . Honestly I do n't use it that often and my face is pretty dry . I have oily skin but this is drying me out . I have backed off and stopped using it . With drying out my skin am having more of a breakout more often . So unless you have pretty bad break outs I do n't recommend this . I also use the pigmentation bar . I love this . And I 'm sticking to this one for sure . That one helps keep my break outs at bay I think .	-1
I am still breaking out . I keep using until I run out . Not sure why I even purchased this . Thumbs down PCA	-1
The item arrived on time an in great condition . I have a couple of sun spots on my face and I was hoping that this product would do the trick to lighten them . I have been disappointed with the product because it as done nothing to get rid of the spots or to even lighten them in the least . I used the product for over 4 months without noticing any difference in the appearance of the spots on my face . In fact this product is harsh and there were a few times that my skin felt as if it were on fire and I had to wash it off .	-1
This product is no joke ! If not careful it will burn your skin and leavemore of a pigment mark to you skin . I will never try it again . This productshould be in the hands of a perfessional medical person.Thank youLucy AB	-1
This works for everyone but not for me . Made my face worst and I 'm still dealing with that . It burned and I followed instructions	-1
2 % Hydroquinone is the active ingredient and you can get products with this much Hydroquinone at CVS , Walmart or Walgreens . Of course for fraction of the price . Not to mention , it leaves a orange tint on your skin , which you will be able to see if you are using it alone . Will not buy again .	-1
This stuff is TOO STRONG ! ! It peeled my skin within 2weeks of using . I would not recommend this product for use ! !	-1
This product has turned out to be a big zero for me . In 2 1/2 months I have not noticed even the slightest improvement as I did with my previous product.I did n't give it one star because it has not caused any negative results , just no positive ones . A big waste of money for me . : (	-1
I read the reviews before ordering and have been using it for a few weeks . It does pull out sebum somehow , but it mostly collects on the edges of the suction device and it seems like the suction does help in a way , but I have not seen it actually suck out a plug and collect it on the inside screen . Would I pack it when traveling as a must ? I do n't think I would . I 'd probably bring some Biore strips along with me instead and one of those metal extractor thingies and just try my best with that and a mirror.A few weeks later , I have only used this a few times since I first reviewed because I bought the Clarisonic Mia and that has been awesome ! My pores are smaller and I do n't have plugs nearly as big as before . I have tried to use the Panasonic pore cleanser after the clarisonic Mia here but it hardly does a thing - I have found that if I just take a hot shower and use an extracting tool by gently dragging along pores , I can extract a lot more sebum than this thing can . It really barely is picking up anything anymore . Maybe my whiteheads are too small or not formed enough . But anyways , it just has n't been working out enough . For example , if this device is extracting the equivalent of an eighth ( more like a sixteenth ) of a grain of rice of sebum , after a few weeks of using the Clarisonic Mia , hot shower , and basic metal extractor ( or the thing that has the loop on the end ) along face , I am getting out 2 grains of rice of sebum . Sorry if TMI ! I 'm going to see if I can return it .	-1
My husband has a lot of sebum in the pores of his nose . He was looking for a good way to get it out , besides squeezing . This thing does n't suck hard enough to get it all out .	-1
within 2 weeks of my purchase this item stopped working . contacted customer service and was SOL since i had disposed of the box already	-1
used it just as directed , but didnt appear to do anything . i know i have little pores , but nothing ? ? ? first time using a product like this , wont be wasting any more money . . .. .	-1
honestly , I have a lot of blackheads on my nose.. its starting to really bother me therefore , I purchased this pore cleanser . OK , this product does n't take out my blackheads . It does open up my pore and make it easier for me to use a stainless steel blackhead remover to scrub off my blackheads but this suction does n't remove the blackheads . That is why I think its a total waste of money . Let me suggest you all to take a facial steam for 5-10 minutes and then use a metal ( professional blackhead remover ) and start to scrub off the blackheads . That works much better .	-1
Do not buy this piece of garbage . It does NOT do what it claims to do . If you want to clean out your pores , you 're better off using your own fingers , biore pore strips , or the tweezerman face tool . The only thing this piece of crap will do is give your face hickeys , not clean your pores or anything beneficial . You 've got to be an idiot to buy it .	-1
I purchased a facial steamer along with this to help keep my pores open and face wet while using this product . I used this several times , and with the steamer got my skin hot and wet , but this product does absolutely nothing . As far as other users saying it needs good grip to get the right amount of suction , I had this thing pulling my skin up into the small opening , but nothing cleaned out of my pores . Get a good cleaner , a soft facial brush , and the mud masks ( that you mix from a powder ) to get your pores clean . I did keep my steamer because I loved the way it softens your skin and helps with absorbing lotions . This is garbage .	-1
This does n't really work . It might succeed in drawing some oil out , as evidence by how slick it becomes in between rinsing , but it does n't really get the gunk out of my pores . This unit has been sitting under my sink doing nothing for the past year . I love Panasonic , but try to avoid this product .	-1
Very disappointed in this product . Did n't work for me at all . The suction was not very powerful .	-1
I bought this product as a whim . I am 23 years old with combination skin and the unrealistic wish for microscopic pores . However even with this wish , this product really did n't do much except sit on my self . The suction makes rings on your skin but does n't take anything out no matter how much you steam your face . Do n't waste your money on something that I promise you wo n't work .	-1
I did not like this brush at all . I have thick hair and it hardly felt like I was brushing it - it 's too soft with little fluffy bristles which impede the brushing action of the longer stronger ones . Since it 's not worth the cost of returning it I 'll give it to my grand daughter and will let you know if its a hit with her as she does get a lot of tangles in her very fine hair .	-1
This is the worst POS brush I have ever bought . Even those cheapies that you can get at a local drug store are 10X better.Pros- none ! ! ! ! Cons:1 ) the handle is for the size of a child or hobbit.2 ) theres weird extra brissles that you can not tell from pictures . They make my hair frizzy.3 ) I have long , thick , wavy hair . This brush was a joke . I couldnt get past the first few strokes when I was ready to throw it out the fricken window . It was only brushing the surface hair only.Do NOT wast your money on this crap of a brush . This shouldnt even be considered a brush for humans . It looks like a baby doll brush or a brush you would use on a SMALL dog ( but then the handle is still too small and awkward ! ) ... maybe thats what Ill do ... Use it for my 10 lb dog so its not a waste of money . Irritated . Last time Im a lazy a $ $ and dont just go to the store to buy a brush .	-1
I threw this brush away pretty quickly after receiving it . I thought it would be a cheaper version of the # 25 Spornette Porcupine brush but just as good . I was wrong . The synthetic bristles were awful . Garbage Garbage Garbage	-1
sometimes i try to do reviews as soon as i get the product but in this case i am happy i waited a while.in the beginning i was definitely going to say this is a 5 star brush.it was sturdy in my hand and managed my bouncy thick hair without too much fussing so instead of just using it to blow dry my hair i made it my number one brush and pushed aside all my other combs.now only a few short months later i wish i knew where my combs got to : ( i have not used this brush 10 times to blow dry my hair and now almost 90 % of the bristles have lost the tips-making it a pain to use.i wish i can find a better everyday long lasting brush .	-1
Brush snapped in half after less than two weeks of use ... right where the handle joins the brush head . Would not recommend .	-1
I liked this at first , but after a few months several of the rounded tips at the end of each bristle came off , creating a brush that is very scratchy . I will not use it any more . My husband does n't seem to mind it so he is using it .	-1
I am no longer happy with non adjustable plastic head bands . My head is n't built for them . These look nice and hold great but they poke my head at the ends .	-1
These give me a headache . They sit right on the pressure points and they have these built in combs on the side that get stuck in your head . Trying to re-adjust it in your hair is a pain b/c it gets caught . These are terrible .	-1
The brown one broke as I was sliding it into my hair . The black one , I use very cautiously . Design is awkward . I guess the tilted ends are supposed to hold back the hair near the ears better ? But its so weak it hardly serves its purpose . Cheap yes , but so is the quality . Would not recommend .	-1
These do n't hold my hair back like I thought they would . They probably do n't give you a headache but you 'll get one anyway when you look at yourself in the mirror and notice you look hideous . I did n't care for these .	-1
It 's a bit much for a dog , I should think , for a shampoo to smell so , so much like perfume .	-1
I ordered this based on all the customer 's reviews that seemed great . I tried it once on my dog and it seemed to really dry out his fur . I do n't know what the big deal is with this product . There are way better products out there ( i.e. , Dermabenss ) . I really did n't like this product , and returned it .	-1
I recently got a Yorkie Terrier and this is the first brand shampoo and conditionar I have tried on my dog because of all the great reviews . I used this every week for 6 months and I am not happy with the results . The smell is great but it leave my dog 's hair rough compared to what it supposed to be . Yorkies naturally have silky hair and this shampoo made his hair the opposite . It did n't leave it dry but I knew for a fact it could have been much better . I thought giving it time would eventually solve the problem and thats why i stuck to it . Finally after reading some reviews i have tried thisEveryday Isle of Dogs Silky Coating Dog Shampoo for Yorkies , Beagles and Spaniels ( 16.9 oz/Jasmine and Vanilla ) and their conditionar . Now my dog 's hair is very silky and smells great as well . I would not reccomend this product , at least not for yorkie terriers .	-1
mine was smelling very bad- I wonder if it should be like that or it is just old- now happy-	-1
I did n't really like this . I have long , thick hair that has a very slight wave to it . Normally , after washing my hair , I blow-dry it and then either flat-iron it to make it sleek and glossy , or occasionally I take a curling iron to it . Often I do not blow-dry my hair completely , and pockets of it are very slightly damp . I was hoping I could use this hot air brush to not only dry those pockets of slightly damp hair , but also give the ends of my hair a little flip ( and thus replace the flat-iron or curling iron ) . This hot air brush accomplished neither task . I would probably have had to spend upwards of twenty minutes to get this brush to dry my ( slightly ) damp hair . It also did not do anything in the way of adding a curl or even a flip to the ends of my hair , even after multiple , prolonged attempts . The hot air is not really hot enough to have any effect on thick or coarse hair . The only plus side is that it appeared to make my hair feel slightly softer.The brush also does not rotate , despite what the box and the description says . Maybe I got a defective product , but it did not rotate for me . Even if it had , I do n't think that would 've helped .	-1
I ca n't believe this company has the nerve to set a price of $ 38 . Amazon had it for $ 10.59 and I got it with some other alleged plumpers of about the same price to try it out . The current price is $ 21 -- just ridiculous . It is a pretty lip gloss with a slightly sweet taste . It licks off easily so it does n't last long . It has no other effect , but the company includes a long information page in many languages with purportedly scientific details and the fact that you 'll get best results when it 's used in combination with several of their other products . Incredible . I do n't give it one star because I save that for products that actually cause harm or are extraordinarily displeasing .	-1
Did n't experience any difference in lip texture , plumping , moisture , nothing . Tingly ? Yes . Anything beyond that ? No . Could not use under lipstick in the morning or it would smear off . Applied it , left it on as long as possible but eventually had to remove what was left before applying lipstick . Applied at night before bedtime . No noticeable difference for me . Disappointed .	-1
It 's very nice that this is chemical free and all that , but what good is it if it does not do what it is supposed to which is remove nail polish ... rubbed and rubbed for about 10 minutes , even pre-soaked ... horrible product ! ! !	-1
I wanted something to fill in my nail ridges without exposing me to harsh chemicals . This does that . Unfortunately , it seems to have caused my nails to peel ! Fail ! !	-1
I 've had problem skin for about two years now and have tried just about everything to treat it . After reading such rave reviews about this product , I figured I would give it a try . The pads work as advertised , but I did n't see any miracles happening with my skin . From what I saw , they had the same effect as the Clearsil drugstore brand cleansing pads . My advice is to save your money .	-1
Though these correction pads have some good ingredients , this product strips the skin - which can cause a rebound effect of even more oiliness . When denatured alcohol is one of the first five ingredients ( ingredients are listed by amount , with the first ingredients comprising the highest % of the product ) do n't buy it . I get better results from MD Alpha Beta pads . It has a LOT less alcohol in it . It 's ingredients are : Ingredients : Salicylic Acid , Chamomilla Recutita Matricaria Extract , Citric Acid , Copper PCA , Disodium EDTA , Fragrance , Glycolic Acid , Camellia Sinensis Extract , Lactic Acid , Malic Acid , Polysorbate-20 , Water , Alcohol Denat. , Sodium Benzoate , Soy Isoflavones , Genestein , Hamamelis Virginiana , Achillea Millefolium Extract , Zinc PCA	-1
This came off in about an hour . Added another coat . Same story . Do n't bother with this . Save your money honey .	-1
This is the worst finger nail polish I have ever purchased . I have bought Essie before , but this stuff has no shine and it is like they put finger nail polish in it because maybe it was thick and out of date . I will never buy from this company again . What a rip off .	-1
I should have gathered this from the name , but this is a green with tiny bits of gold but not the color I expected . I do n't find it flattering and use it on my niece cause she is easily pleased .	-1
I was under the impression that it 'd be a good nude for me to wear but its too cool for my golden AA skintone . Its a good product but this color struck out with me .	-1
I am a rarity , but I hate Essie polish . The color is very streaky , even with 2 coats and I feel like the brush is too small . Go with OPI .	-1
I 'm more of a loud color person , so for some this color would be a great product , but for me it was a boring color .	-1
I ordered Cocktail Bling but received Bobbing for Baubles . Seller was going to exchange for me and sent me a prepaid label but it was just too much work so I kept it.I hate the bobbing for baubles colour , however . A lot . It 's way too dark a blue and I 'm not thrilled with the formula . Oh well , I can always throw it in the box when I do my next nail polish round robin swap .	-1
This is the worst nail polish ever . The color is not even close to what it should be . It actually looked like two different colors in the bottle even after shaking it . The consistency was very thick and would not glide on the nail . In the garbage it went .	-1
I absolutely love this color , I just feel ripped off . Original Essie varnishes are .5oz ( 15ml ) this bottle contains 0.46oz ( 13.5ml ) and the information on the label is incorrect .	-1
This did absolutely nothing , brassy tones are not reduced at all . Cant really say any more about it than that .	-1
Did n't work . My roots are as orange as ever . I used Ash Blonde . I put 40 drops in a box of hair color . It said 10 drops per ounce and it was total 4 ounces . I was n't sure if I was putting way too much , but it did n't end up doing anything . Disappointing . I think I 'm going to try Wella toner . I have heard good things .	-1
Did n't seem to help anything . Used in my hair dye shampoo and conditioner an did n't notice a difference . I would n't waste my $ just buy a toner or toning shampoo .	-1
I have naturally dark ash blonde hair that always seems to turn out orangy/golden when I dye it light ash colors . I was really hopeful that this would product would help produce different results with my last home coloring efforts , but sadly it did n't .	-1
maybe I expected too much , but even putting it on right on my orange hair , leaving it on , mixing it into shampoo or hair color , the discoloration did not leave my hair . Carrot top !	-1
Left my curls sticky and greasy ... and I didnt like the smell at all . Im a 3c with very thin hair and this product weighed my hair down and left it super sticky and greasy even with the cowashes ... ..I used it once and ended giving it away to my 6 years old niece.I 'll continue my journey testing different products ...	-1
This had really good reviews on this stuff but it did nothing for my hair at all total waste of money for me .	-1
This had so many good reviews that I was really excited to try it . My hair hates it , however ! I have fine , wavy hair , so maybe this is for people with thicker hair . It made mine kind of stringy and weighed down- I tried to lessen the amount I put in but that did n't do much . I have such bad luck with hair products , though , so I 'm not really surprised . I did give them an extra star for using the biodegradable packing peanuts : )	-1
I need a cream with a little more weight for my 3b porous hair . This also did n't stand up to humidity particularly well . And the scent , well ... .it reminded me of the 'setting lotion ' my grandmother used with her little pink plastic curlers : kind of unpleasant & chemically . I like the convenient pump bottle , but that 's about it .	-1
I have type 2B ( wavy ) hair , and bought this hoping to get some frizz control . I diffuse and use a curling iron to get some more wave in my hair and after using this my hair seemed just as frizzy as it would be without using it . It does not make my waves more separated , and does not add more shine as claimed . I am pretty disappointed with this purchase , and will be keeping my eye out for better products .	-1
I bought 2 items : TheRuby Stone Nail Fileand theRuby Stone & Nail Buffer.They are exactly the same and both are TERRIBLE.They are like rubbing your nail with a long flat dull stone . What I could do in 10 seconds with a cheap dollar store file , it would take me 5 minutes of filing with these . I was so pissed I showed how weak they were to my husband and he laughed his ass off . `` But they both got such good reviews on Amazon '' I said ... And he laughed even harder.The next day I went back and tried to use them again ( just to make sure i was n't going crazy the night before ) and yes , they really are useless . Completely useless .	-1
I 've experimented with different shades through the years , so I 've tried various hair color removal products in order for my next shade to go evenly . ( I also find that red likes to stick to my porous ends forever , despite the fact that its a fast fading color ! ) This is one of the worst ones yet . First of all , I doubt this stuff is very gentle . I was wearing an old hair raggy dye shirt and it bleached it so bad it ate through the shirt , creating several huge holes . My goodness , I never thought something could completely ruin my old hair dying shirt . I 've never had anything 'gentle ' do that before ! It 's also liquid-y like water , making the application process real messy . The worst part is it 's very difficult to apply evenly , because once you rub it around your hair clumps to it ... it 's almost a glue-ish texture . The only way I could get it to go on evenly was to comb it through , which I did very little of , since it was literally tearing up my hair . Instead I tried to saturate it as much as I could while rubbing it through.It really started to burn after 15 minutes , so I could n't wait any longer than that . The results were completely uneven . I found it left some red parts almost untouched ( it turned it into a pinkish color ) while some other areas were bleached yellow/orange . What I wanted was the yellow/orange all the way through . I had applied it to the end areas first and let that sit for 5-7 minutes before doing the rest of my hair . Even then , I still found the root area to be almost blonde . So be careful for you will see 'hot roots ' from this stuff quite easily since your scalp area is naturally warmer . So my entire head was real patchy.I 've applied my new hair color , and thanks to the bad results with this product , I decided to go with a slightly darker color than I had originally intended . Now it looks almost completely even , but you can still see some of the red dye at the tips . This stuff is too damaging to use again . Next time I 'll pick up Ion hair color removal . It is gentler to my hair and is much easier to distribute evenly ( plus it does n't bleach at all ! ) The box does lie ... it does NOT simply remove the box color , leaving you with the pre-lightened strands it had created . It will lighten it even more than that , IF you can get it all the way through your hair . This stuff burned my skin as soon as it touched it , and yeah , my poor old shirt has finally made it into the trash ...	-1
I had pre lightened hair with roots . I added some low lights and they did n't turn out good ( too muddy and ashy looking ) . So I got this color remover at Sally 's . I put it on my hair . It has ammonia in it , smells awful . Anyway , I went through with the application . After literally 5 min , I looked in the mirror and notices my hair below the roots turned platinum blonde . OMG ! It felt like I put 100 % bleach on my hair . I washed it out immediately . Now , I have dark brown roots and platinum blonde the rest of the hair . Very dreadful look . Why did it lighten my hair so much ? ! I ca n't understand . I thought it was supposed to wash out hair color molecules by shrinking them . I 'm surprised my hair is still on my head . I really really really would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
I 've been coloring my own hair for almost 10 years , and tried Colorzap after paying a ridiculous amount of shipping for it . First of all , the box was tattered and beaten up , and second of all , the product is horrible . Try Color Oops ( which is what I usually used , but wondered if Colorzap would be better ) . I had a dark brown to blonde ombre , and was going to lighten my hair before going back to red . My blonde ends did n't lighten at all , the middle of my hair is still nearly black , and the top is a patchy , patchy bleach job . It 's 10:16pm and I 'm considering running to Walmart to grab a box of bleach to try and even out the color . I 'm highly disappointed and , to be honest , pretty upset . The product was watery and horrible to spread , and gave me knots worse than a rats nest.Sticking with my Color Oops : (	-1
As a transitioning natural and natural I wanted so bad for the Denman to become a staple product . I 've purchased it multiple times hoping each time would be different . But the end result is always breakage . It is worsened by the fact you can not feel your hair breaking , just see the little hairs falling . In order to use this , your hair must be in a very healthy state , otherwise it will just further rip and break up the already splitting and damaged ends . This is a no no for transitioners !	-1
Yikes ! I had heard such good things about this brush and was excited to try one out . Even after removing several rows of bristles it still wanted to rip my hair out . The brush is made extremely well and has a weight to it unlike any other brush I 've owned before . I 've been afraid to try using it again since I do n't want to risk hair breakage , but I think this would probably be a wonderful brush for someone with straight hair ( my hair is wavy ) .	-1
I 've read the pros and cons on this site . The pros outweighed the cons for me . For me the size was just right . However , this brush generated lots of static in my hair . Before and after I went to the salon . So , I thought it was just me . I gave the brush to my friend , and she experienced the same problem . STATIC.Great massaging brush though , but ca n't get past the static .	-1
if you 're planning on buying the Denman 5 Row brush , make sure you know that its really small . when i read the good reviews and seen the videos on youtube about the brush , i was dying to try the brush out . when it arrived to my house , i took it out of the package and was disappointed . the brush is around 5 inches long . i did n't know that the 5 row brush was literally 5 inches long . just like all the other Denman brushes , the back of the brushes slide out . but i had a really hard time trying to slide the red part out so i can take out some of the bristles . since the brush is so small , its really hard to take the back out , but its even worse trying to slide it back in . the teeth are really close together , since the brush is so small , it really did n't make a difference taking some of the rows out . it was still snagging at my hair . if you 're going to order the Denman Brush , make sure you order any other rows beside the 5 Row Brush . the 5 Row Brush seems like it suppose to be used on a toddler 's head and not a grown up .	-1
I thought this would have been a good detangling tool for my natural hair but i thought wrong . I modified the brush by taking out every other row of the brush and i still could n't get it through my hair . I rather stick to my wide tooth comb . This brush almost ripped my hair out even when i was detangling with loads of conditioner in my hair .	-1
I wanted to like this brush . I tried multiple times becauseof the glowing reviews this brush received by other Naturallykinky textured ladies on youtube . I thought maybe the brush washelping to release shed hair , until I switched back to my largewide-toothed combed and experienced less hair loss . Tried again , and again , to only experience painful breaking and pulling of my hair ! I have a super mixed range of hair , mostly 4b/4c , however withinthere are 3c and 4a hair textures , and well as just some spots ofloosely textured & # 34 ; frizz & # 34 ; with no curl near my forehead and crown.I tried removing every other row , I tried only using 3 rows , I tried 5 , and the results stayed the same . Hair breakage . I tried using it in theshower with soaking wet hair and conditioner , damp hair with leave-in , butNOPE ! This was n't the brush for me . I 'll stick with my wide-toothed comband finger detangling and keep my hair . Ultimately , after 9 months of attempts , this brush found itself in the trash . And it was a really expensive brush.I do have to say it is a sturdy brush and it cleansed easily because of the removablebase and rows . However , this brush just was n't for me . : (	-1
I bought this because it looked exactly like a classic brush I had as a kid which I loved . It was made to look that way , no doubt . However , it is nothing like those old brushes so if that is what you are looking for , do n't bother . The bristles are hard as a rock , it rips your hair and hurts your scalp . Ir also has a funky smell - agaain not the smell the old ones had , which is a truly particular smell of that orange rubber base-not that I liked it before but I was expecting the old smell , if any smell at all . Instead I got a funky strong chemical smell . YUK.2 stars is solely because it is a solidly made brush , and most of the problem is my subjective dislike of a brush so hard is is bad for my hair and hurts my scalp , and because I was expecting a specific brush that looks just like this one . Other people might like it , if they need rock hard bristles to gdt through super thick pr sup curly hair .	-1
I 'm using this one for now but this product really stinks . First off , the package came beat up and looked torn , was n't sealed properly , and looked like someone stuffed/threw it together in a jiffy.Pros : PriceCons : Handle is WAY too small ! ! ! I do n't have big hands but this starts to hurt if you 're holding and brushing for a whileBristles cause static ! ! EEEEEK as someone with wavy/straight hair , this is the LAST thing that I need9-row bristles ? ? I figured this would be flat across , instead it curves a bit so you 're really only getting a 5 row contact.Bristles are pointy and & # 34 ; scratch & # 34 ; your scalp , OUCH ! ! I would send this back if I could but I 've already used it .	-1
For me this did not live up to all the hype that I 've been reading about on all these Natural Hair Blogs . So many people swear by this brush and I just do n't see why . I also hear that people take out rows of teeth on the brush . If you have to do all that why even bother . I will continue to use my comb to detangle . It does the job I need it to do . I feel like this thing pulls my hair out . I guess it 's going into that box of things that are useless for me .	-1
It 's very popular in the natural hair community , but for me it is horrible . If you have very thick hair , especially coil , this can be very damaging . I think this brush is better for a 3c texture . For this reason I love the tangle teaser .	-1
Very disappointing . I thought this nail glue was going to be very good , but its sucks . Honestly please skip it . I put it on the fake nails and on my real nails . The nails can still be pulled off . Not worth it .	-1
This glue did not work well for me at all . It is not strong . My fake nails popped off easily with this glue	-1
I found that this glue does not last or stick well , cheaper brands work better , I was hopeful but will not purchase again .	-1
I got this almost-instant drying glue all over myself and the bottle . My skin was burning from the glue and then when I went back to open it , a second time , the lid/ brush were completely and utterly cemented to the bottle . Its not completely useless and I havent even gotten to use it a single time .	-1
I used this and it worked good . The brush was better than others I have used . I only got to use this once . When I tried to use it the next time I could n't get it open so I had my husband try and when he turned it the whole top broke off . The glass broke at the neck of the bottle . Had to throw it away . It was a disappointment because it was expensive .	-1
did not bond well with the silk nails , would never purchase this item again , not as it was advertised .	-1
i 've been using this for 3 weeks now..do n't see any difference except it gives a shine to the hair..does n't seem to control any frizz at all . Wo n't be buying it again .	-1
After reading many reviews , I was really hoping this product would work well for me and my daughter as we have to battle frizzes in our hot and humid weather . Unfortunately , it does nothing to help . It feels like a silicone product and is hard to wash off our hands so you can image how it coats the hair . Another waste of money , we 'll keep looking !	-1
It came in a really small bottle , I thought it 'd be bigger for a 4.2floz but it 's not the seller 's fault.I applied just a little bit , but it still appeared greasy and did n't seem to calm my frizzes . Not at all.It 's a little expensive for a small bottle like this ( about $ 13 ) .	-1
Bought this iron because it was a great deal and had fantastic reviews . Was pretty good for the first six months then the red light started flashing on and off and the plates kept turning off . At the 12 month point it would decide to turn on whenever it wanted to and now after 16 months its completely dead . Do n't buy it .	-1
I love , love , love Laura Mercier 's products , but this one just disappointed.The moiturizer is very heavy and gooey , and does not go on evenly . Since it is tinted , an even application is necessary . The colors are not natural looking , at least the ones I have tried . And it did not make my face feel moisturized.The coverage is also too sheer for me ( ok ... so I 'm a tad bit over 40 ) . So I would need to use foundation anyway.I 'm sticking to a non-tinted moisturizer ( not by Laura M ) .	-1
I have been using mineral foundation for the last 2 years , and I thought I would try something else after reading tips from a professional makeup artist on About.com . Turns out , I went back to my good old foundation within 10 minutes.This tinted cream provides absolutely no coverage , ZERO . What is leaves behind however is a layer of oil that made my skin shiny and sticky.I rinsed my face , and never looked back .	-1
I am a concealer junkie . Always searching , and paying top dollar to find the concealer of my dreams.I am a bit over 40 and have hereditary dark rings under my eyes , in addition to some wrinkles.LM 's secret concealer has a dense , dry consistency . It is not easy to apply . I have to scoop a bit out and warm it in the palm of my hand . This helps it glide on.But it still does not cover to the degree I need . It also tends to get cakey and settle into wrinkles -- something a concealer should never do.And the color selection is too narrow . I suppose if you really like the concealer , you could by two or three and blend them to suit your complexion.But for me , this product did not work on all accounts . I 'm only giving it two stars cause I 'm such a huge fan of LM , otherwise it would get 1 star .	-1
I was looking forward to trying this because I had read some great stuff about it . It goes on greasy and I could n't see a major difference with it on . I would n't purchase again : (	-1
THIS AI N'T WAHT I USED TO USE ! ! ! ! ! ! I REMEMBER A NICE LONG LASTING BEAUTIFUL SCENT . THIS IS PURE WATER . DO N'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS OR YOU WILL BE SADLY DISAPPOINTED ON THIS PURCHASE . I WAS SHOCKED HOW BAD PERFUME IS GETTING TO BE NOW , I WOULD RATHER WARE NOTHING THAN SPEND MY HARD EARNED DOLLAR ON SOMETHING THAT IS PURE GARBAGE !	-1
Why did I buy this , I do n't know . I was feeling lazy going to the grocery I guess . Not worth it .	-1
I am black with 3c type hair.this leave in is not for me , leaves a stinky/dry feeling in my hairit also has alcohol as a main ingredient	-1
It did absolutely nothing ! I tried it as a leave in conditioner- adding it to a few drops of oil sometimes ... If anything the oil helps tame some frizz.. This actually make my hair feel like the ends of a broomstick . And I tried everything- a little , a lot , with oil , with no oil- no results !	-1
I love the barrel sizes of the curling irons but the problem is they do n't get hot at all . all three irons do n't work and does not get hot	-1
I do n't know if it 's just because my hair is super thick but these just did n't do the trick for me . All three gave me the same lame & # 34 ; spiral & # 34 ; or just did n't work ... does n't get hot enough I do n't think . I would n't let a friend buy these .	-1
this is still way to light for my skin . i have olive toned skin and it looked really powdery and pasty . i gave it to my sister who is very fair skinned .	-1
I had a giftcard , so I bought this to set my Laura Mercier under eye concealer which is great for coverage , but a little sticky . Honestly , I do n't really see much difference . I could use loose powder and it would look almost the same . It 's super expensive . It will probably last me forever though . I love the Laura Mercier concealers and tinted moisturizer , but this just seems like a waste of money .	-1
I have used this brightening powder for at least a year and began to see its flaws over time . Yes it does lighten dark circles under the eyes since the powder is very white , ( apply it over your concealer ) which was really great at the start , but i then realized that it also accentuates fine lines under the eyes as well , making them more pronounced than had i gone without it . So as much as i still have a jar and a half left , i havent touched it or used it in over a year . I 'd rather just use my concealer and go without this powder ( since we all use concealers anyway which can be enough ) than have my eyes looking old and lined and wrinkled underneath .	-1
Frankly this primer did nothing at all to prevent shine or to make my makeup stay longer . It makes no difference at all whether I put it on or not . I would never buy this product again ! It 's a huge waste of money ! There are much better primers available then this one !	-1
I had one of these about a decade ago and it did n't work very well , but I noticed that Remington `` improved '' the product , so I decided to purchase another recently.I 'm the type of person who blow drys and straightens my hair before bed so that in the morning , I could wake up , brush my hair , and go ! The process of blow drying and then straightening could get a bit tedious , so I decided to have faith in one of these to get the job done faster.I was completely dissatisfied with this product . Here is why:1 . This does n't completely dry , nor does it straighten the hair . Some of the heat will soak up the wetness , of course , but it still leaves the hair damp . Not only does it leave it damp , but it does not straighten . The hair actually becomes wavy from the heat/moisture combination.2 . It dries out the hair . Remington claims that this product seals the cuticle and leaves the hair virtually `` frizz free '' . Not at all . My hair became extremely frizzy after using this product.3 . It takes about 45 minutes to 1 hour to actually dry/partially straighten the hair . I had to keep going over each section of hair ( about 10 times ) to actually dry it completely . This is very long/irritation in comparison to a 20 minute blow dry/straighten session.Needless to say , I hate this product . Though it is inexpensive , I would n't pay even $ 10 for this item and am certainly returning it .	-1
It worked well until it just stopped working . It heated up quickly and stayed hot enough to straighten curls . The wet-dry straightening never worked very well . But it was fine until I went to turn it on the other morning , and it was dead . I plugged it into a number of known-working outlets and it was inoperable . Now I have to find a straightening iron that works and does n't fail within the first year . So far , it 's been impossible .	-1
Though this is only the second straightening iron I 've ever used , it is by far worse than my other one . It did n't dry my hair when I tried to dry it when it was wet . No matter what setting I used when my hair is dry , I ca n't get it nearly as straight as my other iron , and it 's not very good . It takes a little over thirty minutes to straighten my slightly curly shoulder length hair with this iron , where it only takes fifteen minutes with my other iron . I honestly would n't recommend this iron to anyone . I found it to be a definite waste of money .	-1
I bought for my daughter and it worked for about 2 months and just stopped when it did work it was great and did a good job . I think a my have gotten a defiactive one cause my girl friend who recommend it to me has one for over 14 months and hers is fine .	-1
this completely fried my hair ! listen to your stylist ... NEVER FLAT IRON YOUR HAIR WHILE IT 'S WET/DAMP WITH SOMETHING METAL ... you 'll thank me later .	-1
I thought perhaps I would save time by using this to dry and straighten my hair at the same time . My hair is fine , but I have a lot of it . It is naturally wavy and frizzes up at about 25-30 % humidity . I anticipated possible damage , so I also bought a high-end heat protection spray , and made sure to condition my hair very well . At first , it was lovely . I will say that the straightening did last a long time and held up against the humidity . However , after using it for two weeks , my hair 's ends began to look frazzled and became rough . Also , when applying to the hair , the hair would get caught up ... something I have experienced with cheap flat irons . I went back to my solidly ceramic ( instead of ceramically-coated ) Babyliss flat iron and my ionizing blow dryer .	-1
I bought this flat iron because the price . I should have known a flat iron that costs as little as this one did would break . I was so ticked off when right before an important interview , this thing did n't heat up . With no time to go to buy a replacement , I had to go to interview with a rat 's nest on my head .	-1
I would n't buy again or even recommend despite the other good reviews . My hair is thin , but I have a lot of it & # 8230 ; it tends to hold moisture , which is why I like to straighten it . It also is wavy & # 8230 ; but it 's not curly & # 8230 ; still , this wand barely straightened my hair .	-1
This hair straightener was dangerously hot and seriously a no no.This should not be on the market.My hands got burn several times trying to use this Geesh ! You think with advanced technology this would not be an issue.You do not want to purchase this.Find something that has better safety proof and there was no significant difference in the straightening of my hair.It also did not have an easy grip . Plus , the cord can get on your nerves.Do yourself a favor , Dont !	-1
I got this stuff because of all of the rave reviews . I certainly wo n't buy it again once this can is gone . It 's not worth the price , I 've gotten the same result from regular/cheaper hair spray ( at a much cheaper price ) . It does n't have the best smell for one.It did n't get keep my style in hold better than any other hair care products I 've had before , and in fact I 'd say it does a worse job . And it did n't last long . After about 4-5hours my straight hair was curling ( i had been using the kertain 7 day smooth and that was keeping my hair straight for 3-4days ) . So , honestly would n't suggest buying this product . Maybe it 's the simple fact that my hair is fairly curly . But I certainly DO NOT think this is an awesome product , sorry sexy straight , but my hair was anything but ...	-1
Difficult to use . And , the remains of the hair color stay inside the comb , so lots of my color was lost . Do not recommend .	-1
This product is NOT for everyone . If you have sensitive skin or do n't want to risk a massive breakout , stay away.I 've used a lot of skin products , and quite a few by philosophy as well . My skin can be problematic at times , but usually it is pretty balanced and normal- not particularly sensitive . Well , I bought and used this product due to the great reviews , and it dried my skin out and made me break out . I had flakes peeling off as well as several zits . It was close to my period so I figured that might have been responsible , and since I paid so much for the product and it got such great reviews I tried it one more time . Boy am I SORRY ! ! ! It has been three weeks and my face is still covered in acne , with red splotches and dry patches that are taking much longer than usual to heal . My friend asked what had happened to my face and when I told her she said she had experienced something similar with this product . If you have sensitive or dry skin , definitely stay away . Everyone else should proceed with caution.I hate to give philosophy a bad review , but my skin was great and now it is destroyed ...	-1
OK , I officially do n't understand what other women are looking for in makeup . This product makes my face so shiny it looks I stuck my head in a deep fryer . What am I not getting here ? Am I supposed to go to work looking like a human disco ball ? Being the lemming Amazon review reader that I am , I also wasted my money on that box of glitter that is Bare Minerals and had the same problem . Shine fest all over my face . In the future I will stick with Revlon powder and leave the expensive stuff to the rest of you girls .	-1
I had really high hopes for this hairdryer , but it really did n't work for me . I have long , very thick straight hair that is about five inches past my shoulders . It takes me about 15-20 minutes to blow dry with my Wigo hairdryer , so I was hoping to cut that time down by investing in a nicer hairdryer . While this one is pretty powerful ( the airflow is very strong ) , it left my hair very tangled and difficult to brush . Even after brushing my hair the entire time I was drying it , I still could barely get my brush through my hair after drying with this hairdryer . The `` hot '' setting on it is also just sort of warm-ish . I do n't want my hairdryer to be ridiculously hot , but I need more heat than this one offers to dry my hair within a reasonable amount of time . It still took me about 15-20 minutes to dry my hair completely with this dryer . It also did not reduce frizz as advertised.The dryer does have a nice , sturdy cord that looks as though it 's resistant to curling up and tangling ( a nice feature ) . It 's a little heavy , but that does n't really bother me .	-1
I purchased this for longer flights which tend to dry out my skin . I usually use the Evian spray but opted for this due to the pleasant scent . Considering it 's pricier , I would likely not purchase again because I do n't think it adds much . The scent is nice and it does last for quite awhile .	-1
There are better sulfur products out there that are paraben free . There is no need to slather that dangerous stuff on your skin .	-1
I usually have great luck with PTR products and I have been using his scrubs and pads for years with no problems . I was looking for a treatment product that would keep my pores clearer and gave this a shot . Thought I 'd found the holy grail for a couple of days and then my skin really started breaking out badly - something it had n't done in years . I guess I 'm allergic to an ingredient in this stuff . I will say it 's a lovely , lightweight consistency and not sticky . So many products with AHA/BHA are like rubbing glue on your face and this one is not .	-1
I tried applying this to wet and dry hair but either way it dried my hair out after about two and half days . The first two days it was oily and not as full looking	-1
I love this product , however the supplier is the absolute worst I 've ever encountered . This product should have been sent to me 2 weeks ago and I 've still not received it . I had to send out 2 messages before they bothered to tell me it was on back order . If you can find this product from another supplier , DO SO .	-1
I bought this product because my stylist ( Ulta Salons ) recommended it . Then i decided to come read the online reviews to see how good of a product it was . Nevertheless i have to say that i didnt see any differnce in my hair when using this product if anything i was experiencing more breakage . I have permed african american hair . I am not impressed at all . However , thanks to the other reviwer that broke out the ingrdients , i have started making my own conditoner and hair oil and that had been working GREAT ! ! ! ! Regarding the smell i do not mind it at all .	-1
Using this with the conditioner instantly gave me tingling all over my scalp and body which caused trouble breathing and a severely tight chest . Had to wash my hair out multiple times , take benadryl and my albuterol inhaler . I have hand eczema and asthma and almost had to give myself the epi pen because of the severity of this response . My skin is sensitive and I do n't know what to use .	-1
Did an extended review on the kit ( shampoo and conditioner ) but will say again , its extremely drying to hair and made my hair fall out . Stopped using it immediately upon figuring out that this was the only change I 'd done .	-1
My three children have eczema and unfortunately for them , this oil did n't help out at all . The only thing I accomplished with it was making the tub super slippery . The smell is vey unpleasant too ... I would give my kids a bath at bedtime and the next morning the whole bathroom would smell like rancid cooking oil .	-1
Cons : There are , like , 5 types of parabens in this product . Did they not get the memo about the possible dangers of parabens ? Plenty of companies are making paraben-free cleansers without a problem.It does smell funny.It does n't really & # 34 ; foam & # 34 ; ; it bubbles up a bit . With the Clarisonic brush , it gets up my nose.Pros : It rinses clean without feeling too dry .	-1
I am caucasian with thick , long hair . Perhaps for a different txpe of air this may work , but it barely lathers and actually once applied actually feels like it gums up my haur . It takes several long washings with lots of shampoo for my hair to reel clean and it feels awful . Perhps this lack of kather and slipperiness is common with organic shampoos , but i did not lime tge feelimb at all .	-1
This shampoo did a number on my hair ! My hair is curly and this product made my hair feel sooooo dry and damaged . Lets not talk about the smell , OMG ! It was bad , please dont buy this stuff .	-1
Smell is very nice , very rare in Audbery shampoo and conditioner family : ) Cleaning power is good . My hair needs shampooing every 3-4 days . When I apply this shampoo , my hair is very clean , but I can hardly run my finger through hair after shampooing , I wonder what ingredient cause this.After shampooing , I apply its pairing conditioner , which is also ok. After applying conditioner , my hair feel soft.I do n't think this pair would do any frizz control or any shine adds-on effect . I can observe my hair is soft and clean after usage.I would love to find something that also manage my hair frizzes though ! no success yet	-1
This cleaned my scalp well but made my hand itch really bad during the shower . I took the shampoo and used it in another shower stall , got the same reaction on my hand . And , only with this shampoo , nothing else . Even though this shampoo cleans my scalp well , it is a bit drying and tangled my hair . Plus , the smell is really strong , lingers on me for days end , and I am not fond of the smell . I used to hear that this is a good product , but it went downhill once they changed the formula . I wonder if I would 've had better luck with the old formula .	-1
I really do not like this product because it makes my hair so greasy it looks like I put crisco in my hair.It states that you should shake it - which is really hard to do because it is so thick - it leaves my scalp super greasy & my end dry . Very unhappy about that . It does have a semi-nice smell to it .	-1
I used this conditioner only twice and both times it left my hair feeling like I had n't washed it in a week . Both timesI had to shampoo right after using this because I could n't tolerate the greasy feeling of my hair . It did n't look healthy at all . I wo n't be using this again and it has deterred me from trying any other form of organic conditioner as well .	-1
I do n't really care much for this product . It 's not thick enough and it left my hair feeling stringy , coarse , and brittle . I usually like aloe in my hair , but apparently I do not like aloe in a conditioner . Also , this conditioner smells like lemon scented mopping solution . There is no universe in which I find myself wanting to smell like mopping solution after a shower . I do n't have anything against lemon fragrance , quite the contrary . I usually like the refreshing zing of lemon in a body care product , but this stuff just smells funky . I do n't recommend this for people with my hair type ( 3B , doing curly girl ) , but perhaps this works for some people . Personally , I think the Aubrey brand is going down the crapper since they started changing their ingredients .	-1
I did n't like this one compared to the HoneySuckle Rose or the swimmers conditioner . It did n't have that silky feel that most conditioners give your hair when you apply it . It almost felt like a clarifying shampoo that gives your hair a squeeky feel .	-1
I did not like this conditioner because it leaves residue and my dark brown/long hair always looks greasy . Smelled good though .	-1
Strong , not so nice , scent , It made my hair very dry and brittle and made frizz worse.I believe it is not good for dry hairs or for frizz control .	-1
I bought my Honeysuckle from Whole Foods for $ 10 . Everyone said this was a great conditioner . I tried it and it did n't do anything for my hair . It did not feel stronger , healthier , or softer . My detangling process took the same amount of time . So no , this did not help in that department either . I gave it two stars because the conditioner is all natural , free of harsh chemicals and dyes , and is good for all hair types . It also tamed my frizz also.FYI : I have combo hair . Im transitioning from relaxed to natural so I have chemically straightened hair mixed with 4a natural hair .	-1
A waste of money . It left my 4a hair feeling dry , stringy and rough . I tried it twice and regretted it both times . I do know about ingredient changes earlier in the year . But since I had never tried it before , I decided to splurge . What a mistake . Save your money .	-1
I used this back a year ago as I started my journey to dealing with the hair God gave me . I hated this conditioner then because it was too , too thick when applied and it did n't leave my hair soft or detangled . It ended up in the back of my stash and I moved on . Fast forward to tonight ! I pulled this one out thinking how bad could it have been ? ? Very bad ! ! ! Since I 'd moved on to better conditioners I noticed immediately that this one did not instantly soften or detangler , my hair but I kept going . I sat under the dryer and then rinsed , my hair was a dry Tangled mess ! ! ! ! I applied detangler , tried to comb it throughand nothing worked . I started to set my hair and noticed the entire back of my hair was poofy and dry ! ! ! ! Just like I had been in front of a fan ! My hair rejected this soundly ! ! ! ! ! Fearing breakage I washed my hair again and applied a good deep conditioner . All is well now and I threw this entire bottle in the TRASH ! ! ! Update : I did n't throw this out . I use it as a pre-poo and it still does n't perform well for me , but I 'm using it up so maybe my hair will get some kind of benefit .	-1
I really did n't care for the scent . It 's difficult to spread on the hair , and does n't effectively moisturize my thick , coily AA hair . It was a waste of money for me .	-1
I did not like this product because it left residue in my hair . The same with the conditioner . I have brown/long hair and it just did not clean it . My hair was always oily .	-1
We bought this directly from Aubrey , along with a conditioner of theirs , and not only is this shampoo not as good as the Nature 's Gate herbal shampoos , it is more than twice as expensive per ounce . This Aubrey shampoo cost us $ 11.48 , but that was only for a small-sized 11 ounce container . I had heard that Aubrey was over-priced , but I believe it 's both over-priced and of lower quality than other brands . It certainly is n't nearly the good deal that Nature 's Gate herbal shampoos are . This is ridiculous ...	-1
You will have to use more then regular shampoo , because this one is very watery . Although the shampoo works great , the company should make it thicker to stay on your head when appling .	-1
This stuff does n't lather well at all and my scalp did not feel clean . To be fair , I 've found that with other organic shampoos too . Their conditioner is very very good but skip the shampoo . The scent is nice .	-1
It dried my hair out and it made it hard to detangle . I had to use a good conditioner with slip in order to get the tangles out . I have 3b , 3c , 4a hair and I sectioned my hair off and placed it on my scalp . I massaged it in . After I rinsed , my hair was a matted mess .	-1
I have extremely fine hair that 's oily at the roots and a little drier at the ends . It gets greasy very easily and I need to wash it everyday . I like the idea of using all natural beauty products as much as I can and read good things about this shampoo being good for oily , fine hair . I was n't a fan of the smell , but it does n't linger and if it had worked well for me , it would n't keep me away . It 's kind of ... medicinal smelling I guess . Better than fruity but not nice like some herbal shampoos . At any rate , this shampoo is very thick in cocnsistency and dried out my hair and tangled it something terrible . I used an extra amount of conditioner but it did n't help at all . I try to not condition my roots and only apply it to the ends , but had to condition my roots and even then , the detangling comb still got stuck in my hair and I had to start ripping out the tangles which killed my already fragile hair . There are better shampoos from this brand . This one did n't work . At least not for me .	-1
I would give this 4 stars if it had not come in a glass bottle . This was very difficult to get the vitamin E oil out because it was so sticky . So I had to shake the jar with my hand and in the process , it broke and shattered all over my bathroom . The worst part was how it shattered in my hand and cut me pretty badly . Most of the oil had was tossed out along with the broken bottle .	-1
I paid over $ 30 for a 5 day cleanse that did absolutely nothing for me but make me go to the bathroom with explosive results . This was very embarrassing at times since I had to run to the bathroom at work . I will be returning this for a full refund no doubt . Save your money .	-1
after 5 days nothing , I was just 3 times for # 2 and should be 15 times , I was starving 5 days and not even lost a gram , the secret is out , it is worthless waste of money a really wallet cleanser nothing else . My doctor said colon clean itself every 3 days automatic without any supplements , my metabolism shut down after 3 days completely and not one gram of fat was burned not a waste produced so it really made not sense , very disappointed	-1
As I wrote earlier about the conditioner , it smells nice but is n't nearly as good as it used to be . It does clean your hair but it does n't brighten it up as it used to . It is very watered down just like the conditioner . I would n't recommend it any longer .	-1
Edit : I removed my original review . This listing has changed drastically since I ordered mine 3 years ago . The price is different , the images are different , lots of things are different . I would n't count on these being authentic MAC pencils anymore . It 's super hard to tell and I would n't take the chance . Dropping the rating .	-1
I LOVE MAC 's Smolder eyeliner . When I saw it on Amazon for much cheaper than their website I was ecstatic . That 's a huge price difference . However , something was definitely off about this eyeliner and all in all I should have known better . While this eyeliner is highly pigmented I find it to be slightly softer than the eyeliners I buy from MACs actual website . It does n't take long before it runs on my eyes . For the eyeliner that I received , the wood was a very cheap quality compared to other MAC eyeliners I have owned . It chips and splinters really easy . I am not entirely convinced this is truly an authentic MAC product . However , if it is then it must have been their `` duds '' that came off of their production line . That would make sense considering the price comparison.For me , I have found that since I have purchased this from Amazon I do n't use it anymore . I prefer my cheaper Cover Girl eyeliners from my local drugstore . It 's a shame too because this was my go-to eyeliner . So until I get another one from an actual MAC store then I think I am just going to trash the one I got on Amazon.All in all I would recommend this eyeliner ... BUT , I would recommend going to an actual MAC store or their website . I know it sucks to put out a few more dollars for something . However , at least then you will know you are getting a `` real '' and good quality product .	-1
I had high hopes but this mac liner isnt the best had to burn the tip for darkey look to !	-1
This is a fact : It is illegal for anyone other than the real M.A.C . to sell their cosmetics . Buyer , know that there are many M.A.C . knock offs just as Louis Vouitton has numerous Knock Offs . Do yourself a favor and purchase permanent MAC items at the store so that you know you 're getting the real deal . Limited edition stuff , you may have to buy it on here , but , it is illegal for the seller to sell it . Just know that . Call MAC at their number on their website and check to see if they have an amazon account before buying your products . Chances are , they do n't . I 'm not saying that all the makeup on amazon is counterfeit , but , I know for a fact that some of it is . This review is not of any one product or company selling on here . If you are legit , than this cautionary statement should n't bother you . Unless , you 're dishonest and are ripping people off .	-1
This is one of the best sellers ? It literally looks like I took a little girls pink , crusty lipstick and tried it on as a joke to be funny.Great seller though , fast shipping . Just terrible product . C'mon Mac ...	-1
Packaging is no problem , but when you open to paste has been broken into two pieces . It 's incredible . When the proposal delivery or open to have a look to confirm goods is shipped complete . I urge businesses to send a new one to me . Or you can choose to return .	-1
I knew by purchasing this , there was a chance that I was n't going to get an authentic MAC product but I figured it would at least hold up . It broke within days and it was way too chalky and heavily pigmented and stained alot of my clothes	-1
I purposely bought this one AND a REAL MAC one at the same time and they came a day apart . Comparing them , it 's SO obvious that the Amazon one is a complete and utter fake ! The REAL Raizin is darker and smoother to the touch ! Nice try , though . I 'll still keep the fake , because , frankly , when ordering it , I KNEW it was a fake to begin with - especially at its price - and it 's not a BAD blush . It 's still a nice shade . But , when I reach for it , I 'll know it 's the fake one because I wrote that on the bottom LOL !	-1
Eb5 cost a lot more and I did not see any difference in my skin . In fact I thought this cream was very heavy on my face and did not absorb into my skin very well . So it goes into the wasteland of creams on my nightstand and under my counter and chalk it up as a wasted $ 35 on my part.After reading all the five star reviews ( many of which is their only review on Amazon ) you would believe that this is the next miracle cream . My original review stands , it does nothing for my skin besides moisturize , I have seen no difference in wrinkles . If you are just looking for a moisturizer then be my guest and buy this product . If you want an effective wrinkle reducer , then keep looking .	-1
A pack of these came with my Merkur razor . They are the dullest blades I 've ever used . I actually quit mid-shave and put a Feather blade in to finish . Maybe I just got a bad pack , but I 'd never buy these . The Feather blades are maybe the sharpest out there . I probably gave them one star too many . Even a bad blade should be good for one shave . The Wilkenson Sword blade I used was n't good for anything .	-1
These blades are cheap . They made in Germany and I have heard that most razor blades are made in Solingen . These must have come from the reject pile .	-1
Finished 2 bottles and all I can say is drinking water would be as helpful . It did absolutely nothing . Ca n't return to store as I did n't keep receipt . Hope King bio company will stand behind product and refund . Waiting to hear from them . Will update . Also took 911 stress control . Did nothing . Took 2 bottles .	-1
This product was used according to package directions , and after two weeks my muscle pain has not diminished . My physician said to give it a try , but that the ingredients offered no pain relief qualities . She was correct . Do n't waste your money on this one .	-1
. . . but at first I thought it was a complete waste of money . What made the difference ? The relaxer ! I was natural when I bought it and was having a very difficult time detangling so I thought I 'd make an investment in a high-end hairbrush specially made for detangling . But it did n't really help at all . I cleaned it and put it away expecting I 'd think of someone with thick or curly ( non-black ) hair to give it to . But I eventually got a relaxer , which helped with the horrible issues I 'd been having with detangling . Of course , my hair still tangled ( because it 's quite wavy/curly ) , just not as badly , but still a chore.But eventually I remembered my expensive little white MP brush . I love it now ! It helps me a lot . I do not use it as directed ( it is not supposed to be used with product because certain ingredients are n't good for the rubber ) but I need to brush through with product and it 's also great for making sure hair evenly coated with treatments . Anyway , I finger de-tangle , then big tooth comb de-tangle , then the MP detangling brush brings it home . The result ? Truly detangled , un-knotted hair . Hair that when you detangle , braid , rise or wash and then unbraid , is STILL detangled ! That means fewer single strand knots for me , and just really pleased . Because it 's expensive I would encourage people with black or other ethnic hair to try to get where you can try and maybe return or something ( if it does n't do the trick on your particular head of hair ) . Do n't bother trying to dry brush using this if you have black hair ( in my experience at least ) . No 5 rating just because I wish it was a bit bigger and wish it was not so high-maintenance to clean , etc , but it 's still a winner for me . Thanks . *******UPDATE******It 's been about 6 months of using this brush and I just tossed it . The bristles have bent and are falling out . To be fair , the instructions say that it is not for use in hair that has product in it because oils and the like damage the nylon . So that means if you brush through with your leave-in product or whatever , as I have , it is n't the intended use . I will not be replacing it because it does n't do a special job on my hair dry . It just does n't last for the use I found for it . . .	-1
Even after reading a few negative reviews , I ordered this anyway , likely based on the name brand . It did not massage my scalp as described and it is not worth the price tag .	-1
I bought this based on the reviews and like clean , fresh scents . What I found is that if you spray this directly on your skin , the smell is way too overwhelming and too masculine . If you spray the air and walk into it , the masculine smell seems to evaporate over time leaving a cleaner smell . Honestly , this cologne is too strong and caused several migraines ( with just one spray ! ) . I kept trying to wear it because I paid money for it , but I 'm going to go back to Dior Addict 2 and Tresor in Love	-1
After reading so many positive reviews about this product , I decided to take the plunge and order . This product just did n't agree with me . I have combination skin , which this product is formulated for as stated in the description , however , it left my skin feeling extra dry . In addition , after using this product for a few weeks , I started to break out . Unfortunately it did n't work for me .	-1
It 's a no go for me ... .no matter how I tried it~wet or dry . The shade was to light with no undertone ... .just kind of flat . Would not buy again .	-1
I 've tried multiple face complexion brushes for pore cleansing . This one was way too abrasive no matter how gently I used it . I tried to `` break it in '' by using it as body brush in shower for a while ( works fine for that ) but it was still too harsh . Great for cleaning vegetables , though . The brush that was just right was the one made by Sephora but the two that I got promptly broke so I ca n't recommend it . The perfect solution for me was a very soft toothbrush made for use after dental surgery .	-1
I like a serious exfoliation ! But this can be used to clean the grout in my bathroom ! Buy another brush , I 'm now using it to scrub my shower . Very rough and felt like I was using a cleaning brush on my skin ! ! Plus the bristles fell out !	-1
This was too harsh for me . I tried both dry and wet brushing my face with it . I am even doubtful if it can be used wet . Anyway did not work for me . However I have begun to use it on hands and feet which works well	-1
I have sensitive skin and this brush is too rough for me- would often leave my face irritated for hours so I switched for a softer one .	-1
No good	-1
This is one of the worst base coats I 've ever used.Normally I 'm not very picky about base coats . When I was in cosmetology school , a friend/classmate of mine bought this and seemed to love it . I was leery ( even in professional cosmetology stores , this stuff is still $ 12- $ 13 ) but I needed something for state board practice ( which is done on a plastic hand ) . Afterwards I started using it on myself , and it is awful ! Even after thoroughly cleaning your nails , it still peels terribly . My nail polish comes off in almost a solid piece ! I refused to use it on clients . Whether you 're in school , in a salon , or just a lover of polish , I highly recommend China Glaze base coat . It stays tacky so that your polish actually sticks to it .	-1
I ca n't really tell a difference between when I use this base coat and when I use none . It does n't seem to make my nail polish last any longer or prevent chips . Sometimes the entire coat of polish will peel off my nail a day or two after applying this beneath my color coat . I 'm not sure if I 'm expecting too much from a base coat , but I am rather disappointed especially side I am usually such a fan of Essie products .	-1
Another nail product that promised to keep my polish on longer , but it lasted 3 days . I even bought and applied the Essie nail polish and top coat with the base . Still only 3 days . This is way too expensive for that . I am moving on to try something else . What a waste of my money . Well , with the higher ratings , it seems that some people had way better luck than me LOL !	-1
Nothing special . Just a product sitting on my nails doing nothing . Not the best base coat but im gon na use it anyways .	-1
On 2 occasions differnet sellers sent faulty product . Contacted manufacturer about mislabelling . Generally love this fantastic base coat . Not here .	-1
I thought that this was going to be clear , when you put it on it appears to white .	-1
I usually love zoya but the formula Is awful..the color in the bottle is amazing but the polish dries matte and darkens in color when it dries so of course u can put a clear coat on to give it a shine but that dark color it dries into does n't go away ... .so sad considering the color in the bottle is such a bright vivid magenta but dries into a dark magenta or plum . I do love other Zoyas though	-1
Pros : - This top coat has the weird ability of being able to even out a streaky polish application , if you apply it while the last coat is still tacky . I 'm not sure how it does that , but it was useful back when I was still buying cheapo streaky-formula polishes . With sheer colors I ca n't just hide streakiness by adding another coat of color - but I could smooth it out with a coat of Zoya Armor.Cons : - It dries very slowly . Even with the Zoya quick-dry drops I still managed to get at least one sheet mark.- It 's not shiny - it will follow the contour of every tiny bubble and slight imperfection in your polish.For a while , I was using Zoya Armor as a sort of `` pre top coat '' - to even out my polish and make it less streaky , and then I would put my `` real '' top coat on top ( Dior ) to solve the drying time issue and the shine issue . But then I discovered that some polish brands are n't streaky . And I stopped buying streaky polishes . Chanel polish is my favorite brand now and it never streaks . Dior is my favorite top coat and it dries lightning fast with a smooth shiny surface . Zoya Armor became an unnecessary step .	-1
What a disappointment.Did nothing to strengthen nails.Polish chipped after half a day.Sadly , I have nothing good to say about this one .	-1
I really wanted the super strong pins that my hairdresser uses . She told me you could only get them at a place that sells only to professionals . Why ? Why this silly prohibition from letting consumers have strong bobby pins ? Are they saving us from ourselves ? Perhaps , unless you are a trained professional , you could break a few strands of hair , mildly irritate your scalp , or god forbid , make a professional looking bun or french twist . In that case , thank you , oh Marianna Supreme Bobby Pins , from saving me and leaving me with weak buns .	-1
I was very disappointed in this product . First the container only appeared to be half full and the product was gummy & sticky . I saw no results whatsoever with this product . I ca n't believe I spent this much money for what seems like a poor quality lip gloss .	-1
I was looking for a nice set of bags for foot treatments and well ... these bags are no better than the store brand cheap 'twist tie ' bags you get from a grocery section for under $ 1.00I was almost considering returning but it 's just not worth the hassle .	-1
Was purchasing this and received makeup sponges . Still do n't know if these would work . I can only assume they work .	-1
After reading many reviews I stocked up on this product . Should have just bought one . I have dry , brittle nails that peel and I thought with daily use this would improve . It is actually so moisturizing it made my nails very soft and prone to bending and breaking . This may work for some others but it did n't work for me.On the other hand , my cuticles were very well conditioned . I will use the rest of the bottles i bought on my elbows , knees and feet as a nice-moisturizer . As a moisturizer and cuticle softener , 5 stars . But if you want to strengthen nails specifically , it might not meet your needs .	-1
I bought this for traveling , so i did n't have to bring my hair dryer and diffuser for my curly hair . The first time I used it , it gave off a plastic smell , after that it works but nothing like a diffuser.. takes a lot longer.But it does fit any hair dryer I 've encountered so far .	-1
I 'm not sure what all the rave reviews were for , because I missed the fascination of this diffuser sock ! All it is is a `` sock '' of sorts made of some funky fabric that fits over your hairdryer nozzle . Really ? I wish I would of thought of this bogus product first ! Do yourself a favor and buy a REAL diffuser !	-1
This product is cheap and sucks and not even worth $ 1 . This was a waste of time and money . Lame .	-1
I thought this might be a good choice for my naturally curly hair ; plus I did not want to shell out the $ $ for the Deva diffuser . All I can say is , this must be some sort of practical joke ! So little air comes out of this ugly thing , that even with my dryer on high , it would have taken me five years to blow dry my short hair using this monstrosity.I guess you do get what you pay for . Save up for a real diffuser .	-1
I got this item in a timely manner , no complaints about that . I used this as specified on the package and the Hot Sock almost FRIED my hair . I have very coarse , wavy hair that curls and I use a standard defuser on my hair dryer . I came upon the Hot Sock , read the reviews and thought it was worth a try . Big mistake ! I am Very careful about my hair , use heat occasionally and keep it hydrated . I am so careful and I never have split ends . My hair is past my shoulders and now I am going to have to cut about an inch or more to get rid of the damage . Very disappointing ! !	-1
May hair did not feel clean at all after using this stuff . My BFF swears by it but I could not stand it .	-1
I think this is a total fake Wen conditioner . I did n't smell any tea tree . It makes my scalp itch after a shampoo . I do n't like this AT all . I rather spend the extra money to get the real stuff from their website .	-1
After hearing a few people rave about how wonderful Wen was I ordered some for myself and was eagerly awaiting the day it arrived . I got a shower that night and used it per the instructions . I did n't have the wow factor after it dried and my hair seemed much more greasy after the fact . I thought maybe I did n't do it right and tried it again ... with the same results and this time my neck and back is covered in acne as well ( which I have n't had since I was about 16 ) . I 'm really bummed that this did n't work but not so much considering the cost.My hair is long , very thick and somewhat wavy . I typically wash it about once every 4-5 days ( normally my hair is n't greasy and does n't like being washed much ) .	-1
My hair hates this product	-1
This so-called miracle product is no different from any drug store conditioner . Does n't completely clean my scalp and leaves a lot of product build up and grease . Thankfully I paid for this using my Amex points ! ! would never pay for this with my own money	-1
I 'd been using the Sweet Almond Mint Wen for about a month prior to this purchase . Wanted to get the Tea Tree formula to help with winter hair ... dry , flaky scalp . The scent of this is so/so , but more importantly ... it simply does not work . Not only did it not help with scalp issues , I had to wash my hair every single day or it would become very oily . Sebastian Tea tree shampoo/conditioner is much more effective for scalp issues . Do n't waste your hard earned money on this ... not worth it .	-1
Stinky ! Smells strong of Pine Needles , does n't work well at all , wonder if its even WEN . Recently bought Lisa Rachel Conditioner and Cleanser with Olive Oil and Aloe for dry hair and its my NEW FAVE ! I wo n't buy WEN again , Lisa Rachel is way lower in price and way better product . I used Wen for 3 yrs . and bought the Tea Tree for the first time and hate it . Usually bought Wen Sweet Almond Mint . Still too expensive when I now found something cheaper and way better .	-1
Very misleading . If something has the name tea tree you 'd expect tea tree oil or extract in it . This has none . What a shame because tea tree oil is known to help problem scalps , like itchiness and dandruff . Maybe if they added what they are misleadingly advertising it would work great . Shame on them for lying .	-1
I 've gone through just about ever 'flavor ' of Wen . I love the spring gardenia as it makes my hair soft and supple . I liked almond mint , winter cranberry and I really loved using summer mango coconut last summer . I also liked the aloe/cucumber . I have yet to try Lavender , but I will say that I did not like tee tree , fig or pomegranate . Those last 3 make my hair end up feeling like straw . I can feel it as soon as I rinse my hair after using it . I even used one pump ( as suggested by Wen and other Wen users ) as a leave in conditioner , thinking that it would soften my hair up , but after blow drying it comes out like straw every time . I hate it . My husband took a pix of the back of my hair and it was stiff like a broom . I will say that the tee tree does smell good and leaves a pleasant tingle on my scalp , but I detest the way it makes my hair feel . Naturally , my hair is already a tad on the dry side , shoulder length and very fine . Like I said before , the best one I 've used so far was spring gardenia . It is about the only one that leaves my hair soft . But I will say that I totally disagree with Wen when they say they control frizz , because they do not . Even when I do use that one pump as a leave in at the end , I still end up needing a bit of hairspray to calm the frizzies . Some people would ask why I even bother with Wen instead of regular shampoo ... .Well , for me , it does make my hair feel clean even though it does n't lather . I love the smell of it ; it smells so clean and that lasts for hours . I managed to find the right one for me and should just stick with that , but I keep hoping that one of the ones I have n't tried yet will work even better than my favorite . I wo n't get another tee tree , but look forward to using the Lavender.I only gave one star to rate the product , NOT the seller . Seller was timely and professional .	-1
After seeing all the hype I was so excited to try Wen . Boy I was I let down . I tried both the tea tree and lavender . Using them for a couple months each . My entire experience lasted 6 months or so.My hair is to the middle of my back . It is pretty kinky and I sometimes straighten it . I picked the green tea to try because the lavender had left a bit of buildup on my scalp . I know tea tree was used for dandruff so I thought it may help.I did get a little tingle on my scalp when I used it , but my scalp still had some crud on it , and it left my hair super greasy and heavy . Generally I wash my hair once or twice a week , but I had to start doing it everyday when I used Wen .	-1
The cleansing conditioning shampoo is a very good hair product . It took me at least four to five uses to get used to not having lather . Once I got used to it , I LOVED IT ! It leaves my hair very shiny with endless softness and manageability . My daughter has very dry hair and now her hair looks really healthy . One downfall is the strong scent of mint which I do not like much , especially the sweet almond mint . However , the mint produces a really nice tingle on my scalp . There are other scents like the tee tree that are not as strong and I can still get the minty sensation . I feel that I will be using this product for a long time . *** Update ***New review after a significant period of use . I still like the way in which Wen leaves my hair soft and with moisture and I now actually like the minty scent . But over time I have used Wen , I have noticed that my scalp develops a thin waxy film or buildup which flakes when I scratch my scalp and I can actually feel the waxiness . I 'm unsure if I will continue using Wen since there are many creamy cleansing conditioner products on the market that work much better than Wen .	-1
Do not waste your money , My hair dont feel clean at all after using it couple of times.My hair feels dull and greasy afterwards.I do not recommend this expensive damage to your wallet ! !	-1
I really wanted this stuff to be as good as the infomercials say it is . It smelled medicinal , which I expected , and the smell did go away after rinsing , so that was fine . It did leave my hair soft , but it did not clean my hair . I gave it as long as I could stand it ( just over two weeks ) figuring maybe I 'd get used to it or it would get better . My boyfriend did n't like it either . It did seem to help his dandruff/itchy scalp , but left him with oily hair too . I have long , thin , fine hair and he has long , thick , wavy hair so I was hoping this stuff would work for one or both of us , but that just was n't the case . Overall , a disappointing purchase that I would n't recommend .	-1
This has a light scent . It does not suds up much . Less suds supposedly equals more moisture but I end up using double the amount to feel like I have covered all my hair . I stopped using it after a half of a bottle because it just seemed to cause build up on my scalp and my hair felt yucky . Now I 'm using it up as a hand soap . I may go back to the John Masters Honey Hibiscus shampoo which has more suds , a little goes a long way and does not cause build up even though it costs more . I just wish they were n't so pricey .	-1
I have shoulder length , bleached straight hair . I had to use a lot of this to clean my scalp , while I 've tried other organic shampoos that need only a pea size amount to lather well . The scent is pleasant and herby , but not as good as the other JMO shampoos . The JMO Honey Hibiscus shampoo needs only a small pinch while I had to use like 1/5th the whole bottle of this for the same effect .	-1
I have used drugstore conditioners that can do better than this stuff . All it is is a very all natural conditioner that smells horrible and leaves you smelling like it even after its rinsed out . You can use regular conditioners to do the same thing . Its just the method of using conditioner washing . Use Giovanni if you want all natural and not stinky and it gives better results ( and speaking on behalf of naturally curlies with african american hair ) I even use Pantene for curly hair and it works just fine .	-1
I usually do n't like to leave bad reviews . Most of my reviews are pretty positive . But this shampoo is awful . I purchased this , because I now use sulfate-free shampoos ( and what a difference they have made in the condition of my hair ! ) , and I saw the Wen products advertised as `` sulfate free . `` I ordered mine from QVC , so you 'll note that I 'm not a `` verified purchase '' consumer on this review , but believe me , unfortunately I did use this product.The cleanser left my hair limp and not feeling clean , no matter how many user variations I tried ( more product , less product , etc ) . But the thing that really concerned me was the amount of menthol added to this product . First of all menthol is used for its cooling value . It does nothing to improve your hair . What menthol DOES do is sometimes act as an irritant in cosmetic uses . And what an irritant it turned out to be ; I got an ear ache/irritation that is still not entirely gone weeks later . In addition , in the cold of winter I found the intense cooling properties of the menthol in this product to be totally uncomfortable in the shower . Who wants to feel even colder than you are on a cold winter morning ? Really , a small amount of menthol added to this product would have been sufficient , but it really suffocates the product.There are many excellent sulfate-free shampoos on the market . This is not one of them .	-1
I saw the infomercial and was sold . Then I heard a woman as Sephora swear by it so I purchased it right away . I have natural 4A textured hair and this cleansing cream did absolutely nothing for me . It was gooey and hard to work through . It was also difficult to rinse out and left a coating on my hair that I did n't like . It was also matted and made my curls look lifeless . I returned immediately and would n't recommend it to anyone .	-1
I ordered this from QVC and I have used it several times , not terribly impressed , particularly with the price . Also not sure if my very thick coarse hair is clean . I will not send it back , I can use it as a conditioning treatment but my advice for women with hair like mine is to look for gentler shampoos and wash less often . If you really used the amount of product they recomend you would need 2 full bottles of the stuff a month , to the tune of some 60 bucks . Also the miracle ingredient in it is old fashioned and inexpensive glycerin . Basically a rip-off .	-1
Bought after reading reviews and seeing on tv . I have very thick very curly color treated hair , age 28 . This does NOT lather which is weird to me , but I guess it 's not expected to . It left my hair still feeling greasy . I gave to my friend who has straight thin color treated hair and she loves it .	-1
It seems that all these `` wonder '' products work wonders for everyone but me . I was so hoping this product would make my hair shiny and healthy like the gals they use on their infomercials . It did n't . I 'm 1/2 Japanese and my hair has always been super thick but since I 've gotten older , my hair texture has definitely changed . It 's coarse and frizzy and kind of wavy ( and not wavy in a good way , either ! ) . Also , the smell ... to put it mildly I do n't care for it ... at all . It smells like really strong cherry cough syrup mixed with Vicks VapoRub . I 'm sure I would like the other scents but do n't want to pay for more if it 's not going to give me the results they claim . I 'm wondering if you only get the results if you blow dry your hair after shampooing , because I do n't dry my hair . If anyone knows , I would appreciate any info . Thanks a bunch !	-1
I have to admit , the very first time I used this product , my hair immediately felt different - in a good way . I have coarse and highly treated Asian hair and wanted to try to get the dryness out of my hair . I felt like it did it for the first washing . However , after having used it continuously for 2 weeks , my hair had that greasy look like I had n't washed my hair in weeks . It was heavy and was very hard to style . I exercise almost everyday , so the buildup of sweat and this shampoo was a disaster.So I washed my hair with regular shampoo/conditioner for the first time the other day , and I was amazed to see how CLEAN my hair looked and felt . My highlights actually popped out again instead of looking masked . I felt like I had new and improved hair ( thanks Pantene ) . It had movement and was light and it smelled CLEAN ! I think this product would be good if they could figure out how to clean hair at the same time as treating and softening it . It just felt like it was building up onto itself . I will probably end up using the rest as a once/month treatment , and then go back to my old standby hair products.OH , and thanks to other reviewers who suggested buying from Amazon ! It would have sucked to have to deal with canceling on the automatic monthly subscription that they enroll you .	-1
This is NOT for thin , fine hair.DO NOT buy it if you have normal to fine hair . The thicker the hair the better this scent works !	-1
WEN has nothing new with this product other than another `` average '' conditioner . Suave or Vo5 conditioners are actually better at cleaning/conditioning your hair as they have the chlorides essestial for `` clensing '' . Wen has too much `` guck '' in it . It builds up on hair.When I used this product my hair was `` heavy '' and dull . You do n't need to spend so much or use as much if you co-was with vo5 or suave . I actually discovered how great these inexpensive conditioners were . I have always used expensive conditioners thinking they were what is best for my hair and tangles ... I have thin , dry hair and much of it . I have used Biolage conditioning balm as my favorite..since I have gone with co-washing ( no shampoos ) vo5 is now my favorite . Comb glides through effortlessly and does as good if not better than Biolage or WEN .	-1
This did n't do a thing for me . It was a bit sticky , but did n't add definition or separate curls or any of that nonsense . I have generally healthy , medium length , fine hair ( and a lot of it ) . I use the cleansing conditioner and stick with my Matrix gel and mousse for styling .	-1
The texture was too watery to really detangle or soften my hair . It was n't conditioning at all , since my hair was still rough and tangled after applying this . Plus , once I began using this , I broke out really bad so I had to stop using it . I do n't know what in it would break me out , but well , it did .	-1
You can get the same results by putting some tap water in a spraybottle . Worthless .	-1
I have typical male pattern hair thinning and alopecia areata . I 'm always looking for new product that will stimilate new hair growth and loved the ingredient list and name of this . I have been using this for nearly two months and have not noticed any volume benefits or signs of hair growth . The bottle is small and 4 squirts per use will last about 3 weeks . While I continue to try JM products , I consistently am underwhelmed . This one is like wetting my hair down with fancy water ! Take a pass on this one .	-1
Want DRY , brittle hair that feels like straw ? Use this ! I could n't figure out why my once shiny , silky hair was feeling like straw and the ends were splitting.It was this shampoo , which is full of SULFATES ! YUCK ! Worthless !	-1
Sticky residue ; it 's really not good for wood.Try the Seventh Generation Wood Cleaner - 10x better and it smells nice too .	-1
You save a bundle with these large sizes . My salon sales this for 27.00 for 10 ounces ! However I no longer use these products full of typical personal care toxins ! If you do n't care about ingredients then buy them on Amazon !	-1
This product is VERY pricey and I 'm on a tight budget , but I heard good things about it so I thought I 'd give it a try . I 've used it religiously along with the Anti-Fade conditioner . I also follow all the rules for keeping red hair vibrant : do n't wash for 48 hours after coloring , do n't shampoo too often , wear a hat in the sun , and do n't use heat styling products too often.I was pretty upset to see that the red color rinses off my hair in the shower when I use it , just like with other anti-fade products . Having used both the shampoo and conditioner for 3 months , I have to say that my red hair has n't stayed any more vibrant than when I used other less expensive fade protection products . The color looks drab after 2 weeks.I ca n't justify spending this kind of money for a product that does n't do what it promises to do for my red hair .	-1
I have mild acne that I have been dealing with for years - I 've tried Proactiv as well as many other products so when I saw this I thought it might work and liked that it costs much less . I soon learned there is a reason why it costs less - about the only thing this product did was dry out my skin and bleach my wash cloth . It did n't even begin to clear my skin and I 've almost used all of each bottle . I will not be purchasing this again - go to Target or a similar store and get some of the bigger named cleasners , they will work just as well as this stuff .	-1
This stuff totally dried my face out , even with the lotion , I would n't recommend it .	-1
Ii 'm fifteen , and used this system exactly as directed ( twice a day , morning and night ) . The toner smells of alcohol , and the other two steps are benzoyl peroxide formulas . Anyway , when I washed , I dispensed a small amount ( dime sized ) , and massaged for about 40-60 seconds . A few days passed , and my pimples and blemishes became more red and irriated and my face itched . I returned it.If you have sensitive skin , do n't use this product . If you still want to give it a try , use the Acnefree sensitive skin system instead .	-1
My son has acne and I 've tried several products before this one and really have not been impressed by many . This one impressed me the least.My son started doing this at the begining of the week and kept it up for the next few days . During that time , his face was burning and turned red . Also , the pimples and surrounding skin seemed to swell up a bit . He complained of itching and pain.I was worried because he does n't have terribly sensative skin . I took him to our pediatrician *he 's 15 and she told me to immediately have him stop usuing this product and she gave him a shot of cortizone.I 'm not sure why he had the reaction he did , but it did n't make it ANY better at all , it made it WORSE . I can not recommend this to any one . I would not want to see anyone else 's child go through what mine did . I 'd try something else or consult my physician first.Thanks - Amy	-1
I bought the tiny 3/8 & # 34 ; size , having gotten really comfortable with my hair curling routine using a large tapered barrel , and wanting another option for a different look . I always thought the difference between metal and ceramic was just marketing nonsense , but holy cow . No matter how much hair I curled at a time or what products I put in my hair , it came out frizzy and horrible looking . My regular wand actually makes my hair look smoother . I 'm not sure if it works the same on every kind of hair ( I 'm white with long , fine , somewhat dry hair ) , or if I got a defective one , but I ca n't recommend it .	-1
Wow . It does n't even heat up ! A curling iron has one job : to heat up . I can literally hold it in my hand while it 's on the hottest setting and it just feels like skin temperature . Now I have to go through the hassle of returning it . Spare yourself the time and effort and go with a curling iron that costs just a few more bucks .	-1
Just picked this up yesterday and tried it today . Maybe I 've got some kind of problem . I 'm trying to find a product that I can put into my wet hair , let it air dry , and end up with dry curly hair that looks like dry hair , not like the `` wet look . '' This stuff left my hair looking wet , even after air-drying ... and after I fingercombed it ( which occasionally works with other products ) I now have straw-like , not very curly , hair . Not happy at all .	-1
* Sorry , but TIGI Catwalk Curlesque did not do anything for my wavy curls* Now I wish I could have tried the original version especially because I did not even get on sale !	-1
I hate having anything sticky in my hair . This was recommended to me by a hair stylist who was convinced I should wear my hair curly all the time- which I do n't really like doing- I prefer soft curs or waves . I thought I 'd give it a try for soft curls . This did enhance my curls but felt heavy and sticky and I only used a very little bit . I hate that I spent the money to use it a couple times .	-1
I tried this stuff for several weeks and mostly it just made the skin under my eyes all oily . I saw no change in puffiness and discontinued use after about 6 weeks.The only nice thing I can say about this product is that it smells pleasant .	-1
I ca n't get the powder to trickle down into the brush . I 'm not sure if it 's something I 'm doing wrong or if it 's the applicator .	-1
Sadly had to throw away because it broke me out . I tried the sample , and it seemed ok . But , when I started using daily , it did not work for me . The brush is hard to get back into the cap too . Wasted my money !	-1
This stuff is VERY heavy . It does n't have enough coverage to wear without a base , but to heavy to use as a finishing powder . I just use a face primer , no base , and it was still to heavy to wear . Do not blend well and if you accidently get to much on the brush , it 's impossible to not waste the excess . Do n't buy .	-1
I 've been cutting my husband 's hair for over 37 years now , so I 've purchased quite a few hair cutting shears . I usually buy them at beauty supply stores , but I decided to order some online this time . Unfortunately I found these to be a bit stiff ( which I could live with ) and not sharp enough ( which I ca n't live with ) . When shears are n't sharp enough , they `` push '' the hair away rather than cut it . I suppose sharpening shears is a science and there can always be a bad apple among the bunch . I decided to return these .	-1
If you have allergies , stay away from anything aveda or your skin will break out big time ! All of their products cause breakouts for sensitive skin !	-1
My hairdresser recommended this . Its a waste of money , and it is expensive . It did nothing for my hair . Morrocan Oil is much better .	-1
I do n't like this at all . It smells funny and it is greasy and it does n't do anything for my hair besides weighing it down . Now I have weighed down hair that is frizzy . Do not recommend at all .	-1
If you want to spend 20 bucks on some hair grease then go ahead , but this did nothing that a dollar jar of hair grease could do . It did not do anything to prevent frizz at all . I have natural hair and this product did nothing for it . It does smell nice- like gardenia flowers .	-1
Wow . This gel is great if you want your hair to : A ) Have NO shine whatsoever . B ) Smell like an herbal field , and I do n't mean in a good way , this stuff smells like rancid chamomile tea . C ) Want a very loose hold with excessive greasiness and NO I did n't use too much I 've tried many times with varying amounts , from pea to nickel size ) and D ) Feel like there is an opaque film of gunk on your hair that makes it look worse than if you had just air dried it straight out of the shower . Horrible stuff . Thank goodness it was n't too terribly expensive , I am tossing the bottle out . Ants will probably attack it in my garbage , the smell is so sickly sweet . For reference , I have 3A type curly hair . What I WOULD recommend for use on my type of hair - Redken 08 liquid , Versastyler ( the old formula , not the new stuff ) , Aquage uplifting mousse , and Thermafuse eSculpt . These are n't as gunky and filmy , and wo n't leave you smelling like rancid chamomile tea .	-1
I have purchased two bottles over the years used a little , used a lot , used it on wet hair , used it on dry hair . It would be shiny and soft at first and by two hours it would make my hair dull looking like I had n't washed it same with my daughter 's hair . I still have more than half of my second bottle left . My hairdresser used Sabino Moisture Block on my hair about 3 years ago and I instantly fell in love with it . It is like Biosilk but it is lighter and makes my hair incredibly shiny and soft with staying power . The bottle is smaller but you do n't have to apply as much as you do for Biosilk . I like to apply a tiny amount to dry hair , friends always make comments on how shiny my hair is . The only reason I would consider Biosilk is if they ever stopped making Sabino it costs $ 20 here on Amazon and it is worth twice that amount because it lasts a looooonnnggg time !	-1
Dont buy from them they will sell you the wrong thing and then not give you a refund even though there store page says they do ! ! ! ! Order from CosmeticMall or somewhere else instead ! ! ! ! !	-1
The product does not have the same consistency as the real Biosilk . It 's very runny as if it 's been diluted with baby oil which is probably why it 's so inexpensive . I will not order Biosilk from this particular vendor again .	-1
I read reviews about Amazon selling a deluted version of what you can get at a beauty store , but I thought that I would have a better experience . Well I was very wrong ! the minute I opened the bottle , the smell of alcohol was overpowering . I did shake the bottle before using but it was not enough apparently . I 've tried this oil before and it is amazing but I purchased it at a beauty store , and the smell is so pleasant so there is no way this is the same product . Im not using this crap on my hair because the alcohol will not only destroy my color , but it would probably fry my hair as well since I have thin but puffy hair . Never again ! and hope you do yourself a favor and get it from a real supplier of Biosilk .	-1
I bought this at the beauty parlor , and used it ONCE . Never again ! It left my scalp tingly and burning for many hours ( I assume from reacting to all the chemicals ) . It dried my hair and scalp so bad that it left my hair like straw and set my oil glands to pumping out oil ( to make up for the extreme drying effect ) , so soon my hair went from straw to heavy , weighted down oily . My scalp though still feels irritated by the product . I still have the tingly feeling , and that is due to the hyper active oil glands . This has happened to me on other occasions if I severely dry out my scalp.I will be returning this product to the beauty shop for a full refund . I am still looking for a decent product for color treated hair that does not have either salicylic acid or wheat in the product .	-1
My 25 year old daughter was complaining that her hair was getting dryer so I decided to buy this for her . Unfortunately , her hair ended up even more dry after one try . I gave her a bottle of my Aussie Moist and it worked much better . I have to actually try this Matrix product myself to see what happens out of curiosity so I ca n't quite condemn it yet . Aussie Moist actually works well and you get more for your money.Dry hair can be caused by a bad diet and heat . I avoid any form of heat on my hair like the plague . I think that if blow dryers , straighteners , and curling irons were avoided , these companies would lose a lot of business on products that often do n't do much and are highly over rated .	-1
I USED to love this shampoo . When I was younger I would break into my mom 's stash and use it up ( what a jerk ... I know ) . Now that I have tried so many other shampoos I was completely disappointed with this . Either they changed the formula or it was never that good to begin with . After using this my hair felt drier and even my scalp started to get dry and itchy . I now have a giant bottle of crap shampoo that I have to throw out or maybe give to an unsuspecting friend/relative to try.FYI : I have thick , wavy/straight hair that I blow dry and/or straighten 75 % of the time.I gave it two stars because even though I hated it , it smells good.Despite the price difference , I have officially converted to Aveda hair products because they never let me down and my hair is awesome when I use them .	-1
I liked this shampoo , because of how clean it got my hair . I saw the dirt go down the drain as I rinsed the product out which made me feel like I was really cleaning my hair . But it has Salicylic Acid in it , so it is very strong and my hair was falling out as I washed it . I have never lost that much hair in a shampooing process ! This product further tangled , snagged and snapped my 4C hair . This shampoo is probably best for STRAIGHT hair textures . I would not recommend this product for curlier textures .	-1
I read all the reviews and decided to try the normalizing shampoo . I 've only used it a couple times , but each time I use it , it leaves my hair too dry . It makes my hair hard to comb through . I do have oily hair so I do n't understand why it is n't working for me . I think it 's due to the fact that this shampoo containes sulfates which I think I 'm sensitive to .	-1
I used this after hearing rave reviews about their conditioner , even though it contains mineral oil . I had not used mineral oil in my hair for over a year and last night was my first time using it again . I hate this conditioner ! Although the consistency is thick and creamy which usually works on my super curly hair , it felt dry going on , which is weird for a conditioner . When I rinsed , after steaming my hair , it felt like straw . I co-washed my hair with suave ocean breeze to get some moisture back into my hair . Im not going to blame all of the dryness on the mineral oil alone , there were a lot of random chemicals w/ names I could not pronounce in the conditioner . im going back to my trusty Nature 's Gate for moisture . This was a waste of $ 17 .	-1
Nexus used to be my favorite hair product brand because they used high quality ingredients that did wonders for my hair . But in the last 3 years they have repeatedly tampered with their formulas to cheapen their products and still charge high prices.I used to love Humectress conditioner . It used to be a rich thick formula that left my hair incredibly hydrated and nourished . Then they changed the formula about three years ago to cheapen it . Now it appears that this year they have cheapened it even worse . It 's just a cheap or mediocre conditioner now , not worth the price they are charging for something that is no longer salon quality.As soon as I tried this recent version it gave me an huge rash on my neck . I could n't figure where the rash came from because I stopped using it for several months ( despite buying the 33 ounce bottle ) because it was no longer a great conditioner . When I tried it again to use up the bottle , the rash re-appeared . Rashes are individual , not everyone will react the same way , but it was obvious to me that cheapening of the ingredients has consequences in quality beyond just not making it worth the cost.Google all the complaints on the internet for more info . Basically they have kept the same names on their products but completely changed the ingredients , misleading customers , into believing it 's the same product . None of their products are the same as they were 3 years ago . It 's basically either crap or mediocre stuff pretending to be what it used to be.Many of the reviews on Amazon are from BEFORE Nexus started selling mediocre products in place of the wonderful stuff they used to produce .	-1
I 've used Humectress for the past 25-30 years . Loved it ! Always had it on hand , could n't live without it . Recommended it to my friends and kept it a secret from my enemies.I have fine hair , but lots of it . It moisturized my hair without weighing it down , keep the fly-aways gone in the winter and I had found no other product that worked for me.Until now . At first I thought I was having a few bad hair days which turned into a month . After doing a little investigating I was shocked , horrified to learn they changed the formula ... ! What ! ? Who 's the nincompoop who was in charge of this decision ? ? ? This happened right about the same time another dingbat at Johnson and Johnson decided to discontinue my go-to tampon ... .what ? How horrified does a girl need to be ? Where 's the picket line start ? I 'm in ! I think I 'll visit the nexxus site next and put my 2 cents in there as well.This product is now no better than one you 'd find at Walgreens for $ 3.99 - I 'd try that one instead , this one stinks.Signed - the woman with the flyaway , dry hair	-1
I 'm a long time user of Humectress . My experience was great from the 80 's till a couple years ago . I noticed , like some others , the formula changed . It smelled a bit different but mostly it did n't seem to work as well.With the current formulation my hair feels heavy and kind of dead after use . When applying the product in the shower after shampooing it used to make my shower comb slide right through my hair . Now my hair is tangle-city and I have to work hard to get through after conditioning . I also need to use much more product to get anything close to good conditioning.I 'm sad to say Humectress is leaving my list of preferred hair products and I 'm trying new products to find a replacement.Update : Dec 24 , 2013 : I have begun usingBiolage Fortetherapie Strengthening Conditioner by Matrixand I 'm doing very well with this . I still prefer the original salon formula Humectress if I can ever get it again .	-1
3c/4a coil curls.It has a pleasant , neutral scent . It smells like baby to me . It is clear and gel-like . That 's all that I like about it , really.I tried this on a large section of my own hair before putting it on my whole head . I do this for any new hair product to make sure it wo n't dry out my whole head if my hair does not like it . That is exactly what happened with this particular shampoo . I only used the tiniest amount , and focused it all on my scalp . When I rinse , I let the shampoo rinse over my hair while rubbing my scalp clean , so that I do n't use too much product on my curls . I could immediately tell my hair was drying out . I did n't like the feeling . I checked in the mirror ad my curls were dry . I immediately co washed with a conditioner.I am returning this bottle to Ulta , where I purchased from . I would love to keep it since I like the scent and consistency , but if using such a small amount and only focusing on my scalp dries out my hair that much , it is not worth it . *Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paulmitchell ( dot ) com lists . Otherwise you risk buying fake , old , or tampered product .	-1
it was a yellow , and weird smell to it , did n't do crap for my hair really , and I use to use this stuff a lot off the shelf so I think it was just old .	-1
After using this product I needed to get 3 inches of hair cut off because it tangled and ripped my hair to shreds . If you like your hair do n't buy this .	-1
AS PURCHASED FROM AMAZON - As described in other reviews - this item smells nothing like the exact item sold in salons . It smells like it is really old and makes my hair smell terrible . I purchased this because I like the product and wanted the convenience of delivery , but the product is not as it should be . There are several buying options - I purchased the item fulfilled by Amazon - purchase from a different seller ! I am guessing that the reviews that refer to this problem also chose the item fulfilled by Amazon .	-1
not happy with my purchase . I had liked the product I used before so this time I ordered it from amazon . I should have checked the reviews . I received a counterfeit product too .	-1
3c/4a coily curls.This conditioner is lackluster . I used a dime-sized amount on a decent sized section of clean , damp hair ( how I always condition ) . It did not give me much slip . I finger detangled and that was n't very productive with this conditioner . I then detangled with a comb to see if it is good for that . The comb glided through , but I suspect only because I had already finger-detangled . I would honestly have to do another test to see its detangling capabilities , but I wo n't bother because it did n't even condition my hair.It did not condition my hair at all . I left it on for 10 or so minutes before rinsing with cool water . My curls were not at all defined or decently moisturized . It was disappointing , because I love other PM products ( The Conditioner , Awapuhi Mist ) , which have left my hair conditioned , moisturized , and beautiful . After rinsing this detangler out I followed up with a cowash with Herbal Essences Hydralicious , which defines my hair and leaves it well moisturized.The only positive thing I can say about this is the scent . It is neutral , and smells like baby powder to me . I like neutral scents because of my sensitive nose to fragrance . The consistency is medium-thick , and it is yellow in color.I am returning this bottle to Ulta , where I purchased from . *Only buy PM from an Ulta store or professional salons paul mitchell 's website lists . Otherwise you risk buying fake , old , or tampered product .	-1
Kind of rickety and not much power . There 's something called I think Soft N ' Smooth out there I liked much better and I think was cheaper . Save your money on this one .	-1
I 've know about henna and used it before in the past . It is well known for its amazing shades and therapeutic effect on hair . I got Surya Henna Strawberry Blond . Of course I was not expecting to see a salon quality hair color , but maybe a slight difference in the shade.My beautiful strawberry blond hair turn dirty brow/gray and root did not get touched by the color at all.Please do no waste your money and time . If you decide to use henna as hair treatment please go with colorless .	-1
Unfortunately I had to re write my original review which was very positive but after 2 weeks since first time use of this product , I must update my frightening discovery.I 've been losing a lot of hair . Especially while being washed . It comes out in clumps . It falls out every time I stroke through it or when being comb or brushed . It seems I 'm just leaving a trail of hair every where.The good news is I have thick hair so I have lots of it but this loss of hair is quite alarming.I went to my hair stylist over the weekend for a hair cut and when she comb through my wet hair , she caught a clump of hair fall out . She gasped . I told her about this henna and said I 've been losing hair since use ... I also read from another reviewer that she also lost a lot of hair so I guess I 'm having the same exact problem . Just be warned for any other persons interested in using this product . Not sure what could be causing this since I did not have any other allergic reaction to the dye.Other then that , this would have been a perfect product . The ingredients in this product is quite alarming . I thought henna suppose to be much better option then conventional hair dye but it 's actually the later ... Stay away from it .	-1
Does n't smell the best , and I left it in for 45 minutes with the plastic cap on and the only color change was my scalp turning orange . My hair is exactly the same color as before I applied the henna cream . My hair was natural , no dye or anything . All natural dirty blonde hair and still dirty blonde after applying the henna .	-1
THE COLOR IS GOOD BUT IT DOES NOT STAY ON VERY LONG . YOU WILL HAVE TO RE-APPLY IT EVERY FEW DAYS .	-1
Dark brown gives you nearly a BLACK head of hair . And , yes the instructions were followed to the letter and the hair was wrapped in plastic for not less than one hour - ewwwww uggghhhh	-1
This ingredient , propylene glycol , is in Surya Henna which is listed as one of the top five toxic ingredients	-1
Bought these because I heard that boar bristles are good for stimulating the scalp and help to distribute sebum oils that your scalp produces to help encourage hair growth . First of all , the little clear & # 34 ; porcupine & # 34 ; prongs are LONGER than the actual boar bristles , MUCH longer . So when I went to brush my hair , the boar bristles do n't even touch your scalp and barely even touch your hair . Only the clear porcupine prongs touch your hair . I will return this immediately .	-1
I bought this brush because I was told that it was the best brush to use on your hair . Static . Nothing but static . It 's a nice brush , but so much static .	-1
After 6 months of use , it stopped working for me . I thought maybe they changed the ingrediants but not sure . Very disappointed because it gave me great IBS relief . Not sure what to do now .	-1
Took the entire package and it was like I took a placebo . Did n't work whatsoever . Do n't waste your money .	-1
This product seems to be working okay , but the price is double what you can find at walgreens . I will shop for it there from now on . And in the heat I think it killed at the benefits of this product with the long delivery to me .	-1
Digestive Advantage just did n't seem to have any impact on me . It certainly did n't make anything worse , and I assume the probiotics in contains must have done some good , but it just was n't the IBS solution I had hoped for.However , if you 're a fellow IBS sufferer and desperate for a solution , give it a shot ! ( I 'm seeing plenty of good reviews out there -- it must just depend on the person )	-1
Not sure if I noticed in my bowl movements . Not sure how I feel about the product . Might work for others but not for me and that 's ok .	-1
This probiotic did not work for me unfortunately . Hopefully others will have luck with it . Everyone 's body is different . Goodluck .	-1
I bought this at my local drug store..I only took 2 vitamins , ,Wow never again , felt like i had the flu ... The first one made me go to bathroom all night , i take them in morning with water..Then i took the 2nd one , thats when i thought i had the flu , I was so sick , it was coming out both ends at the sametime ... I dont recommend this product if you have a sensitive intestine and stomach , I wont take this again ! ! !	-1
This was a real disappointment . The directions are very vague and the products cheap . If you want something that 's in the kit I would look for it in a Sallys or online and get that 1 item .	-1
First of all , the DVD in it is so old that it will not play on any type of new technology . The instruction booklet is an overview , so that was no help . I had to go to YouTube . I still could n't get figure out what 1/2 of the items do , and the only one I did like was the monkey claws and they broke with in a month ( they look easy enough to make on my own ) . I would not recommend this to anyone , it is a waste of time and effort . It so sad too , I remember see an infomercial years ago on this and always wanted it . So , so , so diaspointed .	-1
Nexus used to be my favorite hair product brand because they used high quality ingredients that did wonders for my hair . But in the last 3 years they have repeatedly tampered with their formulas to cheapen their products and still charge high prices.I used to love Humectress conditioner . It used to be a rich thick formula that left my hair incredibly hydrated and nourished . Then they changed the formula about three years ago to cheapen it . Now it appears that this year they have cheapened it even worse . It 's just a cheap or mediocre conditioner now , not worth the price they are charging for something that is no longer salon quality.As soon as I tried this recent version it gave me an huge rash on my neck . I could n't figure where the rash came from because I stopped using it for several months ( despite buying the 33 ounce bottle ) because it was no longer a great conditioner . When I tried it again to use up the bottle , the rash re-appeared . Rashes are individual , not everyone will react the same way , but it was obvious to me that cheapening of the ingredients has consequences in quality beyond just not making it worth the cost.Google all the complaints on the internet for more info . Basically they have kept the same names on their products but completely changed the ingredients , misleading customers , into believing it 's the same product . None of their products are the same as they were 3 years ago . It 's basically either crap or mediocre stuff pretending to be what it used to be.Many of the reviews on Amazon are from BEFORE Nexus started selling mediocre products in place of the wonderful stuff they used to produce .	-1
I was referred to try this product to protect my hair from heat and to give my hair moisture . Well , I had bought this product over a year ago , and well I still have it . When you really like a product , it goes faster than the ones that you do n't like ( and do n't work well ) . This creamy looking goop makes my hands and hair feel like I 'm coating them when applying it to the hair . It does n't moisturize the hair well even though it wets it but when my hair dries , no moisture outcome . With my results and others similar to mine , I do n't know why Nexxus still costs so much . Needless to say , I wo n't ever try Nexxus again or any of its products . IF you buy this in-stores , PLEASE Keep your receipt so you can possibly get a refund .	-1
I started using Nexxus Humectress in the early 1980s , when I had to buy it from a salon . I loved how it deeply moisturized my hair ( after shampooing ) without weighing it down . I sometimes used a tiny bit on my hair when it was dry to smooth down frizzies . It was worth the salon price , and even when I lived overseas in the 90s I made sure to stock up on it when I was in the States.Unfortunately , the formula has changed and it 's no longer the wonderful conditioner it used to be . I bought a bottle a few months ago at Walmart , and I 'm very disappointed . It comes out of the bottle thinner and more watery , and leaves my hair limp and dull . It does n't rinse out cleanly the way it used to , and even the fragrance is n't as nice as it used to be . The price has come down since they started selling it at retail stores , and now I know why . I tried the new bottle several times before I realized what was causing me to have constant bad hair days , then I threw it in the trash.I get much better conditioning at a great price from Suave Professionals Humectant conditioner . I wo n't be buying this new Nexxus Humectress again . What a pity !	-1
Ok , so I 've been buying this product for the past 20-30 years . It was the ONLY product that cured flyaway hair without weighing it down . It was ALWAYS on my shelf . I never was without it and I recommended it to everyone.All of a sudden I 'm noticing bad hair days , day after day , with flyaway hair , no body , ick . I never thought I 'd give this product 1 star ... ..Change it back please ! This is now as good as any other cheap conditioner out there but for more money.I 'm going out tomorrow to buy the Suave humectress the previous poster suggested and this is going down the drain and in the recycling .	-1
So I was tired of buying those cheap , plastic ball tipped brushes over & over again . I wanted a brush that was good quality & would really last ! I did some research , and this brush looked like exactly what I wanted.. well , I was wrong , very wrong.This brush rips out hair like nobodies business . If you expect to remove any tangles with this brush the only way you 'll accomplish that is by literally ripping the hair out . I have straight hair , and that 's the result I got with this brush , I ca n't imagine if someone with curly or wavy hair tried to use it.In short , if you do n't want to rip out your hair , do n't buy this brush .	-1
It 's a nice moisturizer and it smells ok but it did not work for me after using it for over two months . My stretch marks are not from pregnancy and they are over a year old but I read some reviews from people in similar situations that had positive results so I figured I would give it a try . However , it 's just lotion , that 's all .	-1
The strong scent was a turn off as soon as I opened it and I wish I had returned it immediately but I thought that I would give it a chance . After having it for 4 months , I ca n't bring myself to finish the jar . I really like it 's sister productOlay Total Effects Night Firming Cream for Face and Neck , 1.7-Fluid Ounce , which is not as thick and is mild in scent . I 've purchased MANY Olay products to find the best ones and this Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment wins the medal for strongest perfume smell . Since my nose ca n't handle it , I am unable to rate it 's performance but it is too thick of cream for my normal-to-oily skin . Sorry , Olay , I ca n't rate it high like the rest of your products .	-1
I started using this cream and my first reaction was the smell . I 'm pretty sensitive to heavily scented things and it just made my stomach turn while trying to sleep . I started noticing dry itchy patches on my cheeks and forehead . I 'm not sure if this goes away after using it for a while but I 'm not willing to risk it . I really wanted this one to work since the reviews were so amazing . I 'm thinking about giving it away so it does n't go to waste .	-1
My mom 's been buying this moisturizer for a while , so when she ran out , I told her I can buy it for her from amazon ( because it was so much cheaper than the drugstores ) . Any way when she opened it , she told me it had an odd smell , different from the one she bought at the local drugstores . The color was also slightly different . She questioned whether it went bad , did the formula change ? So I emailed Amazon , and like always they have awesome customer service . They asked me to provide the lot number and expiration date . , I was able to provide the number but the expiration date was not found on the jar . They told me to discard it and that they would get back to me with either a refund or replacement . I 'm hoping for the latter . My mom loves this moisturizer and it 's so much cheaper than buying it in the stores . I 'll update the rating after I get my replacement .	-1
My previous reviewI have acne prone skin ... . Best thing about this cream is.. It does n't break out my skin.. This is a huge plus , tried so many creams but had reactions . It is magical for me in one way that it even settles my existing acne.. Do n't know how that can happen , I was looking at the ingredients , nothing special to work on acne I guess , but still it is helping with my acne and cleared my skin pretty good . In the morning when I wake my skin is soft . I have even seen the 'H ' between eyebrows and the lines on nose between my eyes are less visible ... So a definite keep ... Sometimes feel I should use it as my day cream , but have not tried ... My current review ... .They have changed the formula ... Previously the cream used to be light purple and when applied it feels very very light on skin ... But the new formula looks oily ... Feels very oily on skin and I had a very severe break out ... Wish olay could go back to old formula ...	-1
I barely dipped the tip of my finger in the jar ans used that amount on my face and felt like I rubbed grease on my skin . I also broke out from this . I am not saying the product is bad , it just did n't work for my skin at all .	-1
Everyone reacts differently , but this product irritated by skin and made me break out . Test it out on a small patch of skin to see how you react .	-1
I was looking for a light moisturizer to balance my facial scrubbing and cleansing facial washes , the second time I used it I woke up with itchy pinkish little bumps EVERY where on my face ( just like many other buyers said ) , the scent is nice but it 's way too strong and the container is TINY considering the price . If you never break out this may work for you , but if you have acne-prone/oily/sensitive skin do n't waste your money .	-1
Really wanted to like this product . However , it has some flaws.- The container is n't opaque , which means that the product is exposed to the sun . Retino - the key anti-wrinkle ingredient in this product - is known to break decay with exposure . So it should be kept in an opaque tube that is tightly sealed . That is not this product.- The smell is very strong , and they clearly color it and use tons of perfume . I ca n't imagine that this helps with anti-wrinkle or healing properties . But it does have the effect of driving my cat away at night because it is so strong.- After applying my hands become sticky . Really sticky . Strange feeling , like they 're becoming puckered . I immediately have to wash them . I do n't know what this is attributed to , but it 's quite unpleasant.Overall , disappointed in this product . I do n't think I 'll be buying again . After doing some comparisons , I prefer the Neutrogena Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream .	-1
I had high hopes for this night cream as I wanted to have a mositurizer for night and day . After two days I strated to break out bad all over my face . I even tried just using the product on just my neck and chest and noticed that started to break out there as well .	-1
I ordered this face wash based on great reviews and used it one time two nights ago with my Clarisonic . It dried my face and the second day when I woke up , I have millions of little wrinkles ( due to driness I guess ) all over my face . I was horrified . I contacted ( via Amazon ) the seller , Payless Beauty , and they do n't take returns . I wish I knew their return policy before I ordered it . I just wasted $ 30 and feel frustrated by the seller 's return policy . I will NEVER order anything from this seller .	-1
I was stoked about the previous reviews so I took a chance on this . I have super fine hair that gets greasy . I work out daily so it needs to be washed . I also read that doing a clarifying shampoo once a week can help make hair shiny . This however was too drying , my hair felt like straw , and needed a deeper conditioner than what I normally use . Wo n't buy this again .	-1
i have really hard water and it did n't help at all . makes your hair feel really clean and smell good but did nothing for helping to remove the rust and calcium build-up . also had crappy customer service . there was a mix up in the mail and i originally paid for shipping and i finally received it 2 weeks later than what i was told . and i never received the 1st original bottle . the seller was ez to get a hold of and they told me to let them when i received the & # 34 ; lost bottle & # 34 ; and the 2nd one they sent out . needless to say i only received 1 bottle 2 weeks later . will never ever buy from them again	-1
I 've deleted my prior review.. Be careful with this product ... . I used it once every 3 weeks to remove any buildup on my relaxed hair . I 've done ths for months and months ... . The last time I used it ... It completely stripped all of the oil from my hair and left me with matted roots and tangled ends . I could n't belive it . It took me hours of repeated oils and conditioner applications before I could get my fingers thoroug my hair . Sadly I lost the strands that tangled and have n't recovered from the damage as my hair is still breaking . I do n't understand what happened but I wo n't be using this ever again .	-1
I have fine , slightly wavy , dry hair . I 've used this and other heat protectant `` balms '' ( versus sprays ) and this one is pretty terrible comparatively . I use very little such that I 'm not even sure it 's protecting my hair , just on the ends , and it leaves my hair weighed down . The product itself is a bit sticky and not too runny but still difficult to work through hair evenly without using too much . It is best for blow drying versus hot curlers or flat irons . Also , it does n't smell great .	-1
I 've heard great things about this product so I decided to try it out for myself . I used 2 drops , rubbed it together in my hands , and put it on my hair from about halfway , all the way down to the ends of my hair . After using it , I realized it made my hair look greasy and it made it FULL of static . When I brushed it after using this product , my hair was full of static going in all different directions . I wo n't be using this product ever again .	-1
I had extremely damaged hair I was babying along with Revlon Butter Treat , it was looking pretty decent as it was growing out . Then I bought and tried Redken Cat . This product did more to damage my hair than anything I 've tried on it . I feel it stripped both moisture and color from my hair and left me with straw-like lifeless frizz and so much breakage I needed a haircut after using it . Maybe if your hair was in good shape to begin with it could handle CAT and actually be improved , but my experience is : Buy this - and give it to your enemies .	-1
I dont understand where all these rave reviews are coming from . I tried this on my daughters waist length wavy/curly hair and its sticky and does not do what it claims not to mention the smell-gross . It leaves a heavy coating on her hair and I cant get a brush through it . It smells like the eighties . Thats the only way I can describe it , like scents that were used in relaxer products in the 80 's .	-1
SOOOO dissapointed . This is super thick - like conditioner or lotion . It 's feels gross in my girls thin hair . It does n't work any better than anything else I have used ... but at least for those I was n't out $ 30 ! ( I bought the bigger bottle ... plus shipping ) .	-1
The spray is ok ... . At least for the first two days . After that the nozzle was completely stuck . The spray is hard as glue . Could not even open it up with a knife . So if you are looking for glueing or cementing something , this is your product . If you want an easy product that detangles , then think twice . I am returning the product .	-1
The description says it is for adults too , but it certainly did not work for me . I have long , thick , straight hair . I needed a detangler , but this stuff was completely useless on my hair . In fact , my hair tangled worse when I dried it , which tells me that the stuff I was already using works way better than this crap . Made my hair feel sticky . Also , the sprayer does n't spray and it leaks all over the place . ( yes , i unlocked the sprayer . it still did n't work ) Live and learn , I guess .	-1
You have to use a TON of this to detangle hair and its pricey . i wouldnt mind if it did what it says . when it drys you have crunchy hair that you ca n't comb through .	-1
I must 've put at least 15 drops into one of my bottles of polish before I saw any difference at all .	-1
This seller needs to get his facts straight since the product description is misleading , check out Burnout Website for the ingredients . Burnout 's Ocean Tested mix has some organic ingredients but this is not an acceptable mix although it offers higher ZO than their best selling mix which has 18.9 % ZO and selling for almost twice as this Ocean Tested mix on Amzon . Burnout does not specify certified organic or the percentage of organic in their mix but certainly dumps a lot of ingredients in the mix . I make my own sunscreen but for times when I do not , I need the same formula as I use in my organic sunscreen mix with fewer ingredients . Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection.Active Ingredients : Zinc Oxide ( non-nano ) 20 % Other Ingredients : Purified Water , Organic Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice* , Capric/ Caprylic Triglycerides , Sorbitan Stearate , Polyglyceryl-10 Laurate , Cetyl Dimethicone , Magnesium Sulfate , Organic Avocado Oil* , Virgin Hemp Seed Oil , Organic Cucumber Extract* , Organic Green Tea Extract* , Tocopherols , Organic Pomegranate Juice* , Helionori , Hyaluronic Acid , Ethylhexylglycerin , Hydrogenated Methyl Abiate , Polyaminopropyl Biguanide.Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one , blocks both UVA ( 320-400 nm ) and UVB ( 280-320 nm ) rays of ultraviolet light . Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks . ZO is insoluble in water , used in many industries , in ointments , creams and lotions . Non-irritating , non-allergenic and non-comedogenic , used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts . ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm , when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body , do not enter the bloodstream , and are not a threat to human health.SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream . If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes , for example , a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes . While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn , UVA rays damage the skin 's DNA at a deeper layer . Both radiation types can cause skin cancer . The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.BABO has 22 % ZO which is not organic but conventional even with higher amount of ZO than organic brand like BADGER with 18.5 % ZO but ZO is not the only ingredient in BABO so there are few issues with BABO formula . ZO is like mud , the higher , the better but ZO stays on the surface of the skin for protection so for many , high ZO will not work since it will be too heavy . For a small investment , sunscreens may offer me the possibility of avoiding sun burn , pain , cancer , medical bills , pain killers , etc . that come with exposure to the sun . For that reason , choosing a formula with the least amount of ingredients but high ZO is the best solution so one needs to read the ZO percentage as well as the rest of the ingredient , since it is the whole mix which counts not the high percentage of ZO only . A good sunscreen formula should not have more than a handful ingredients , at least 95 % certified organic , protect skin from sun , with no gums , no thickening agents , no perfumes , no alcohol , no restricted ingredients by any other countries , no chemicals , no additives and no softeners .	-1
sorry but it does not work , it gives more dandruff and it is a waste of money , i will never get it again	-1
Tested product on my hand first . Every small line stood out like skin was overly dry . Same look when applied to my cheek .	-1
Just o.k ... ..Gives a chalky finish , and seems to clog my pores . Usually a big fan of Philosophy products , but no this one .	-1
I generally love the Philosophy Brand . However , I am not a big fan of the Present . I used it for a week and it gave my face a rash . Then I waited about 6 weeks later to try it again and the same thing happened . I also experienced a break out of 2 pimples the second time around . I never ever break out on my face ! It also feels very heavy . However , I do have sensitive skin so that might be the reason . I will still continue to use Philosophy products , just not this one .	-1
Goes on really goopy like I 'd imagine Elmer 's Glue would feel.Never really sinks in or sets up so when foundation is applied ( even after the requisite 2 minutes ) , it streaks on in big , greasy lines and is impossible to blend in . The result is a big mask of goop that feels horrible.Yes it will eradicate lines , only because it 's so thick and therefore covers everything.I 've never had success with this . And I really gave it the old college `` go '' -I nearly got halfway through before just tossing it in the trash because I ca n't use it anymore -it 's useless to me . It just looks AWFUL . I had much more success with Covergirl Simply Ageless Serum primer w/Olay and Sally Hansen Natural Beauty Luminizing Face Primer . They 're much thinner , set up faster and provide a nice canvas for makeup .	-1
Not a fan of this drys my hair out horribly and tangles the hell out of it but it did help get the black dye out of my hair	-1
In a nut-shell , I was hoping to find a product to get rid of build up on my hair and GENTLY strip away that grime weighing down my hair . Oh , it got rid of the build-up alright , but then it went on to strip my hair of any body , shine , softness or life in it . I had to use and intensive hot oil conditioner on my hair for a week to get it to look at least presentable.I was very disappointed by how harshly it treated my hair . It was dumped ASAP .	-1
I like AC 's daily moisturizing shampoo which left my hair w/volume and softness . However , this gel is hard to work with . In dry hands , it 's too pasty so you have to rub your hands together vigorously to get this to spread and put on your hair evenly . In wet hands , it just crumbles and wo n't work . Do n't get me wrong , when you put this stuff in your hair , it will give it a hold without the ugly flaking and you can still get your hands through , though this stuff is slightly greasy . I think American Crew is a pretty good line of inexpensive products for hair . This product just needs some other ingredient in it to make it more pliable .	-1
I tried this several times , applying it to slightly damp hair , and damp hair , and wet hair.It always left my hair looking frizzy . I have thick hair . What I use now is Murray 's black bees wax . It 's about 10 times cheaper , and I look like Tom Cruise .	-1
Gives hair flakes , easily confused with dandruff.The main turn off was the chemicals in it . Here 's a list of alternatives if you are being cautious about what you put onto your brain:1 . Macadamia Healing Oil Treatment2 . One N ' only - Argan oil - Styling cream3 . Nature 's Blessings4 . DiFeel - Shea Butter OilI own all four ( 4 ) of them and very much like them better and do a much better job than this pomade . Not only are they organic , but cheaper . One'n Only is the most expensive one , $ 11.49 at local beauty supply store.I threw out this AC Fiber Cream barely used .	-1
i dont see any difference , hold for an hours at most . never again ill use this product . bye bye crew	-1
This is considered the `` Gold Standard '' or Men 's hair products , because for the most part , men have short hair , and like a matte finish . While a matte finish is fine , you do n't want your hair to look dried out and dead . Matte does n't have to mean `` dull '' , and that 's where this product finds most of it 's fault . The hold is pretty high , so that 's nice . But for a guy like myself who has naturally dry hair , this product just makes it look worse . No separation and very little texture . At least , it was that way in my hair.You have very little time to work it through the hair before it sets.Overall , it has good hold , a nice scent , and washes out easily , but it 's not meant for people with thick , dry hair .	-1
I 'm amazed that people described this product as `` heavy '' . I find it incredibly light-weight and cheap . I was n't expecting much for the price , but even at the Friday sale price this feels overpriced . I 'd be stunned if it held up any time at all .	-1
I purchased this hair dryer to replace my Super Solano that died after more than a decade . I loved the Solano , but I wanted to see if a significantly less expensive dryer would work as well . The good news is , it dries just fine . The bad news is that the concentrator attachment ( there are three attachments - I use the narrow concentrator every day for straightening ) is unnecessarily difficult to attach . For the first couple of months , it took a great deal of effort and force to get the concentrator nozzle attached . I had to twist and turn and manuever it every which way . Even when I managed to get it on , it was easy to knock it off during the course of drying my hair . I had to wait a minute or two to reattach it because the nozzle was too hot to handle . When it cooled down sufficiently , the twisting and turning began anew . When this happened numerous times during one attempt to dry my hair , it got pretty frustrating.As others have noted , the thin chrome finish of the dryer chips off very easily , particularly when using the attachments . After having owned this for about two months , the chrome is completely chipped off ( the dryer has a matte black finish underneath the chrome ) where the concentrator attaches . It does n't look great , but I do n't have to worry anymore about brushing chrome flakes off my clothes every morning.Over the past week , it 's gotten much easier to get the concentrator attached , and it 's less prone to fall off . I assume it just took a couple of months to `` stretch . `` Update 11/9/10 : The attachment no longer will stay on the dryer . I 'm reducing the rating to two stars , because without the attachment , this dryer is worthless to me .	-1
**Review about BLACK CHROME version . **It 's always a pain buying a new hair dryer -- you 're used to the one you had , annoyances and all , and it 's a crap shoot as to whether or not you 'll like the one you 've bought sight unseen ( although you 've read the reviews and are hopeful ) .I wanted to love this hair dryer , but overall I just didn't.The first thing I noticed is that it is HEAVY . Well , not a bag of flour heavy , but it certainly has a definite heft to it ( heavier than I was used to , at least ) and for someone who needs to spend a good 30 constant minutes holding it and moving it around ... it was heavier than I 'd prefer.The second thing I noticed is that the cord is REALLY long . I never gave much thought to cord length , but it is advertised as 10 feet and I 'm sure it is . I ca n't say as if I ever need a cord that long -- in all my years using a hair dryer , I think a 3 ' cord would be plenty.The third thing I noticed was that the attachments are metal -- which at first I thought was a bonus because it meant they would be sturdier . That said , since they are metal , they get HOT during use ! Surprise , I know , right ? Hee . But when you 're used to plastic and suddenly have metal and you forget and grab the end ... OUCH ! Also , the attachments were a bit of a pain to put on . I had to fight with one of them because it did n't seem to want to click on easily ( or at least as easily as any dryer I 'd used before ) . I did finally get it on , and thought `` Well , at least it will STAY on . '' Unfortunately , that was n't the case with the resin pick attachment , which , in addition to being super awkward to use , came flying off the end in about seven seconds . The other `` concentrator '' attachments were fine , but that pick one was useless.The fourth thing I noticed is that the button placement SUCKS . I managed to turn it off at least 10 times in the first two minutes of using it . SOOOOO frustrating . Just grabbing the handle to hold it would bump it to OFF . GRRRRR . I tried to be especially mindful of it for the rest of the usage period , and I did get better , but I still turned it off repeatedly.The fifth and final thing I noticed is that the hot is REALLY SUPER HOT . I mean , so hot that you do have to really be careful how long you point it at your scalp -- and I 'd NEVER use it on my hair without putting some form of styling protectant on it first.Taking everything into consideration , this was NOT the hair dryer for me . AT ALL . It was too heavy ( minus one star ) , had hard-to-attach and useless attachments ( minus one star ) , and had sucky button placement ( minus one star ) . It 's going back .	-1
I am really very happy with this hair dryer . I bought it after reading about what a dream ceramic/ionic dryers are and researching here on Amazon.com.The only reason I give this 4 instead of 5 is for noise . I had hoped that new dryers ( my last one is at least 7 years old ) might have quiter motors in them.This does what it says . My hair dried to styling point within 3 minutes instead of 8 . My frizzies were reduced by at least 75 % without the use of any syling products or leave-in conditioners . That alone is amazing and worth the price.Another reviewer mentioned that this was heavy , making it hard to use . I do n't notice a weight difference between this and my older Conair . I do notice that the nozzle is about an inch longer , so every now and again I 'll bump myself on the head , but that 's simply user error . : DI 've never been particularly handy with the attachments , but they 're there . It has two directional nozzles ( one plastic , one metal that scratches the dryers finish ) and one directional with 1 1/2 '' picks coming off of it.All-in-all this is an awesome machine that gets the job done in way less time and with great results . **UPDATE**After owning this for most of a month I am still very satisfied . My rating would stay the same . I am very slightly disappointed because the finish is already starting to chip off around the nozzle . I wondered how I had gotten glitter all over my hair and face ... it is the shiny finish flaking away . Glitter is n't the end of the world , and I do n't care what my dryer looks like so long as it works properly . Just a note in case others consider looks/finish when purchasing hair dryers . ***UPDATE*** lowered score to a two.This was a nice dryer while it lasted . It literally blew up in 2011 . I was drying my hair and the side exploded and the motor came flying out , narrowly missing my face . My ears rang from the `` pop '' noise .	-1
This curling iron worked well for my thick , fine textured , very long hair until it shorted out only TWO MONTHS after buying it . I used it maybe twice a week at most . Also , the dial for the temperature changed easily when I was using it because my hand was constantly bumping it . Last but not least , the cord tangled horribly . It 's a shame because the curling iron actually curled fairly well . I wo n't buy a product from this manufacturer again and I 'm looking for a new curling iron .	-1
I got this nail dryer and I was really excited , I did my nails that same day and I found out that the cool air button was broken , since the warm air worked I did my nails , the warm air blew powerful enough to make your nails dry . I had to returned the product either way since it was broken .	-1
This was not a genuine Dermalogica product . I returned it for a refund immediately with no issues . Definitely do not recommend .	-1
After reading all the wonderful reviews I had high hopes for this product . It didnt perform for me as an exfoliant.. I have been using it for a couple weeks now and have noticed that it doesnt even perform as well as Biore 's over the counter exfolliant .	-1
Make sure you read the ingredients list . This product contains several highly allergenic ingredients ! Hydrolyzed wheat protein tops the list , but the rest of them are n't that friendly either . Instead of the beautiful , glowing skin I was dreaming of , I got a rash and a burning sensation that lasted for two days .	-1
This expensive rice powder did absolutely nothing for my skin . Please try out sample products before wasting money on full-size products . I have problem skin -oily/combo/acne ... and after using this , I noticed my face felt `` clean '' but that 's about it . I can get the same clean feeling from a $ 5 Queen Helene or Garnier scrub . Only buy this if you 've tried it , and it has worked miraculously on your skin . I felt like it was rubbing rice powder on my face , and it felt really clean after , but that 's it ... . no actual change in my skin tone , nothing . Something like this should provide more effective results that can be seen and felt AFTER initial use ( long term results ) . Save your $ $ .	-1
I used this product for about 7 months . When I ran out recently it took me awhile to order some more . I have n't been using this product for about three weeks now and my skin is no different ( actually it might be looking a bit better ) . I have combination skin and am prone to brake outs on my chin with some minor blemishes on my cheeks from time to time . This lotion has salicylic acid in it which is supposed to be good for acne prone skin . My breakouts never improved while using this product and now that I 've discontinued using it , I have n't noticed any difference except that my skin actually seems to be looking clearer . Needless to say , I wo n't be restocking this item in my medicine cabinet since I never saw an improvement in my skin while using it . I 'm still using Active Moist as my general facial moisturizer .	-1
I cleans nicely , yes . But it irritated my scalp . I got red bumps from it , so I will not use it .	-1
I have natural dark brown thick hair , and have dyed it red with two chunks that I have bleached to a platinum level 9 blonde . The red when I do my roots always gets in the rinse and turns the platinum pink so I 'm always re-bleaching . Obviously I have some very damaged hair in these areas . I decided I needed to get them red to alleviate further damage but they wo n't hold color . This product was supposed to be a miracle but I tried putting on hair first and mixing with color , neither worked the blond spots only came out a slightly darker pink.In the end I used a temporary semi followed by a veggi temporary dye and the pieces are mostly a solid red now . This product probably works great for normal or only moderately damaged hair but it did n't work for mine , which had been all but melted off with bleach.I 've been coloring for 10 years now .	-1
This was a waste of money for me . I got it based on the great reviews . Oh well . I am glad it was n't expensive .	-1
I have read many blogs on which people rave about this product , especially for curly hair . I could n't wait to get to Whole Foods to buy the Direct Leave-In along with Smooth as Silk shampoo and conditioner . Unfortunately , I am quite underwhelmed . I find the Direct Leave-In to be too light for my hair . It also took a while to absorb , so it sat on my hair until my hair dried . Not cool . No one likes to walk around looking like they did n't properly rub the product into their hair . This could be because I used more leave-in than I normally use since this product is not as thick as my usual leave-in . I hope other reviewers have a better experience , but I will not purchase this product again .	-1
This product made my hair very dry , did not add any moisture to my hair . I will not be using it again .	-1
I 'm a black women who enjoys my hair natural . I heard a lot of hype about this product on youtube and several other blogs that were actually pretty referable . So I gave it a shot . At first it seemed to be making my hair soft , but the next morning , my hair was hard as a rock ! I could bearly pull it back in a puff . I had to suffer through work all day until I was finally about to come home and scrape that crap out of my hair .	-1
I bought this on the advice of a friend who heard great things about it . I also saw the reviews and that it was wirth a try.The bottle is cumbersome and a little difficult to get product out as it goes down . The smell ( which was the worse aspect for me ) is really terrible . If it was just neutral it would be okay but it has this strange unpleasantness to it that had I known I would have left it . The smell does not grow on you it just got a bit worse for me actually . I use it as a leave in after washing and it has not really hardened my hair as mentioned in another comment but it has not reall done much in the way of moistre either . I have been trying a few different products to find one that works for me and had I not spent so much on it ( I did not buy on amazon ) I would have given it away . But I wo n't let good money go to waste.That said , everyone 's hair is different and so what does not work for me , may do wonders for you . But I hate when I see all good reviews for a product and try it and it works terrible for me , I wonder did n't one other person feel like this ? Why did n't they leave a review . So my little review is just to make you tread with caution , and I hope it helps .	-1
I do n't care for this product much due to the white residue it left in my hair . I 've discontinued using this product . Besides as a natural hair girl , I was searching for a product that was all natural or mostly natural and this product does not fit that bill .	-1
I know it is a bit early for a review but I just can help myself , I just got the soap yesterday . In the other reviews that I have seen for this product a lot of people kept say how bad the soap smelled , but in my opinion the smell was not that bad at all . It smelled like peanuts but it 's nothing to over the top . That is all I can say about the product for now . I will write a review on the results in regards to my acne in a couple of weeks.October 15th Update ! ! ! To update you guys on my opinion of this product , I found it to be just okay , not great , not good but okay : ( . I did not notice a change in my acne at all . I stopped using it after 3 weeks and started using another cleanser . You can check out my profile page to see my review on the `` Other Cleanser '' .	-1
I knew from the other reviews that this would eat up AA batteries quickly so that was n't a complaint , but I just got it in November and now it does n't work . Of course , I 'm unable to return to Amazon . I used this about twice a week and never left it on for long periods . It just got slower and slower during the warm up phase ( to turn the indicator pink ) and now wo n't heat up at all . I 've tried replacing with several different batteries and even bought a new package last night to make sure . Nothing . I 'm mad that it died so quickly , but it really works beautifully , so I 'll give in and buy another . Maybe somewhere else so I can return if it happens again .	-1
I was losing eye lashes because of the eye lash curler so I thought this would do the same thing , Curl my eye lashes . Bascially it did nothing for me . I used it for about 15 minutes and tried to curl my lashes . Really did not work like your basic curler . I will keep it only because it is a pain to return .	-1
Maybe because I have stick straight , short eyelashes as I am Asian American but still , this did absolutely nothing for my lashes . I tried it before mascara and then after mascara , but nothing ! I 'll stick to my standard eyelash curler ( shuemera ) .	-1
I 've tried this with mascara and without . You should definitely use this without mascara and then apply afterwards . If you use mascara before using this eyelash curler , it just melts away the mascara so you have to reapply anyway.It also gets quite hot . I 've burned my eye lids a couple times and it hurts ! So be extra careful ! I would n't recommend this to anybody I know . After I use this I always have to use my manual curler but I use this only because I bought it and it feels like I wasted my money if I do n't use it once in a while . I think the idea is great but they should make the wand curved like a U instead of being flat . It 's not that good the way it is now.It does curl my lashes but not as well as my manual curler .	-1
Simple ... right ? Wrong . It 's simple if it actually works . Sorry to disappoint , but the product did not curl or heat up just enough to add even a little bend . Enough said : (	-1
I would n't say this is a BAD product . It 's well made , and like I said it gets very hot . Hot enough to curl other lashes I 'm sure . It also is n't that bulky so it 's easier to carry around than the awkwardly shaped metal eyelash curler . It 's also easy to clean since the top piece is removable . Fits well in my hand , does n't feel awkward or uncomfortable . Also the top of the curler is shaped well enough to reach the corners of my lashes.Performance wise : this tool lifts the lashes but does not curl them ( for me ) . I am half asian and have straight eyelashes that curl easily with metal eyelash curlers . I purchased this product for more natural and permanent curl without using waterproof mascara . I find that it ends up taking off all of my mascara ( waterproof or washable ) and looks worse than if I were to curl my lashes without mascara using a traditional eyelash curler . It gets really hot and it can burn if you 're not careful ( not a visible burn , just feel burning hot - it 's a little startling but nothing major ) . This product only works ( slightly for me ) with mascara on , not on naked natural lashes .	-1
I would n't recommend this . Perhaps my eyelashes are too thick , but it never curled them . It is a neat product in theory , and not expensive , but it never worked for me . I ended up buying a heated one that is very similar to the non heated ones that clamp your eyelashes , and it would perfectly . I 'd recommend something like that . For me , this was a waste of money .	-1
It is honestly not worth the money . After one use , I would rather stick with my regular manual eyelash curler .	-1
I try this product , from it getting good review in YouTube . It did not work for me . It felt nice the heat , and this product was delivered on time and package well .	-1
It does not create any visible curl . That 's all I had to say about it.Oh , and the battary dies within a week of use .	-1
Complete waste of your money ... I used it once and that 's about it . It does NOT curl your lashes . I would recommend buying the other panasonic eyelash curler in pink .	-1
I bought this and forgot to return it- so when I went to return it , it was too late- the thing never worked and it is super light- the quality of it is pretty awful . This product should not even be on the market .	-1
This thing gets really hot ! It really doesnt do anything to curl my lashes . It does separate them a bit but if you use it after mascara , it removes it a bit . Save your money .	-1
After maybe 30 minutes of using it I was able to get a very , very slight curvy in my eyelashes . I could 've gotten better results by using an old metal eyelash curler in 3 minutes for only a few bucks ! A total waste of money !	-1
I used this for a good 6 months before deciding it doesnt do diddly . I make my own eye serum that is more effective at fading dark circles than this . And more moisturizing and lifting too . For a lot less money . Pass .	-1
This does n't work at all - absolutely the worst . It takes forever to dry and has no affect - save your money .	-1
Welp , not great . Did n't really do anything . But I found a natural way to make it , 1 TBSP of gelatin powder , mixed with 1 and 1/2 TBSP of milk , heat in microwave for about 10 seconds , then apply to your face with a brush , let dry 10 minutes , peel off.BAM , there 's your strip , easy to make . can use Guar gum , xanthum gum , or Agar powder for a vegetarian mixture , because gelatin contains pork as you know .	-1
I was really excited for these to arrive because I have a decent amount of teeny blackheads around my nose and my boyfriend has heavy blackheads on his nose . They did n't work for either of us . It picked up some of the blackheads but not enough where there was a visible difference . I had to fight the urge to extract them myself because the box says your skin may be sensitive afterwards .	-1
These will not stick long enough to pull out anything even when I apply them to a very dry face . They certainly do not `` lock on and pull out dirt '' . I was hoping to pull out a blackhead but so far I have tried 3 of them and they just become loose or fall off long before the 10 or 15 minutes recommended to leave them on . Maybe the batch I got is n't sticky enough ? Not recommended .	-1
I guess this product does n't work on some people . All it did was dry up and then peel off . Pores stillclogged .	-1
I tried every possible instruction , and each time was the same : a few pores were clean . At I thought I did n't leave it on long enough , so then I tried it for a longer period of time a week later . I had high hopes , but it just did n't work for me . I actually cut one in half and tried it on my chin . I think it might have worked better there than it did on my nose ( despite the fact they said not to use it anywhere else but the nose )	-1
Having declared an all-out war against my pores a few months ago , I 've attacked them with countless highly-rated anti-pore product on the market.Besides being dry-ish and sensitive-ish , my skin is largely unproblematic.I 've only tried Biore Pore Perfect Deep Cleansing Pore Strips once , a few days ago . I followed the instructions perfectly , and after painfully ripping the dried out , Papier-mch & eacute ; d strip from my nose , I was slightly disappointed . The strip had successfully pulled out some pore-clogging gunk , but not as much as I had hoped . Despite the removed gunk , the pores on my nose looked the same an hour later ( if that ) . After a day , I think my pores had actually gotten larger . In fact , for the next few days , my pores looked the worse they had in some time.I 've yet to find a miracle product that would drastically improve the appearance of my pores . Using witch hazel as a toner regularly and wearing zinc-oxide based sunscreens ( sun damage , esp . by UV A rays , causes 85 % of skin damage and enlarges pores as a result . High SPFs only control for UV B rays , and zinc oxide is the most effective and most stable of UV A blocks ) religiously has helped . I was really hoping that these Biore strips would be the thing that drastically reduces the appearance of my pores , but no such luck .	-1
I 'm 43 and these strips have been around for some time now . Over the years , I have tried these strips and was left disappointed . I 'd stop then years later try again , hoping the product had been improved . Each time , I came away with the same result , disappointment.I have pretty oily skin and get acne in my nose and it enlarges my pores . I got these strips again a few weeks ago , again , hoping they 'd improved . But they did n't . These strips cost $ 8 for 14 strips.I used an entire box and each time I used one of the strips , it did n't work . The instructions say leave on your nose for about 15 minutes , which I do . When I remove them , the strip is clean and fails to serve its purpose . I think its safe to say , I 'd never buy or use these strips ever again . Sorry Biore ' , for me , these strips were a flop .	-1
My friend raved about these strips and convinced me to try them..I did , and nothing happened ! I have an average about of blackheads around my nose and I thought the strips would get rid of them and I 'd be able to see all the black gunk on the strip . I followed the directions to the T and yet they did n't remove any blackheads . The strip was clean when I took it off ... and let me tell you , pulling the strip off hurts so bad ! ! My eyes started to water and my nose was pretty red.My nose was pretty smooth after though ... but I do n't think it was worth it . I will not buy these again .	-1
These strips have something in them that makes my whole body itch . I have to take allergy medicatication after using .	-1
I really , really want that super-gross pore strip experience of pulling the most disgusting things ever from my nose , forehead , and chin . Alas , these pore strips just do n't seem to work for me most of the time . I know I have clogged pores . I can see them mocking me in the mirror . So I cleanse , prep , wet and pray that pore strip onto my nose , wash the dishes and check out People.com , and then get ready for the halelluia moment when I see what gross havoc the pore strip will reveal , and -- nothing . It 's like I get a little plaster cast of every single blackhead on my nose , but it does n't actually adhere to anything , maybe one or two . Forehead ? -- forget about it . China -- nada . Every now and then , by the grace of the pore gods , I get a strip to work somewhat , and I feel so grateful to be a normal human being.I have a feeling these strips rely on a certain skin pH as well as proper skin preparation in order for the plaster to adhere to sebum , and pH is something that varies from person to person , and from day to day in the same person , so it might be that Biore and I just do n't have chemistry that is making pore magic happen.After using four strips out of the box of 24 , following instructions and with no success whatsoever , I contacted Biore to report my dissatisfaction with the product and get some advice on why they might not be working for me . I got a very nice letter thanking me for my helpful feedback and a $ 10 coupon for more Biore products . I guess they really believe in me and want me to practice.Bottom line : I will use the coupon for more pore strips ( because it 's the only Biore product I 've seen that does n't have parabens ) but I wo n't actually spend money on them again unless I start getting super fantastic , consistently gross results .	-1
I read and followed the directions exactly as written on the box . I even let my teenager try one on his nose . After the strips had been on our noses for about 15 minutes and started feeling really dry , we each pulled them off . He was impressed . Me , I was n't too impressed . It did n't feel as though it cleaned my pores ; in fact , I needed to scrub off some gunk that the strip left on my nose.My son did n't have gunk . Maybe because he has younger skin ? I tried the strips again and got the same results ; it does n't feel as though my pores are being cleaned and I still get residual gunk.Oh , well . At least one of us liked them !	-1
Although , yes these strips work to get the dirt out of your pore , they stretch out your pores when you pull them off and getting rid of enlarged pores is almost impossible . And when you stretch out your pores it is easier for them to catch dirt and its just not good ! Do more research !	-1
I BOUGHT THESE AT WALMART AFTER WATCHING A YOUTUBE VIDEO STATING THAT THEY WERE GREAT FOR BLACKHEADS ! THESE BARELY TOOK ANYTHING OFF MY NOSE , MOSTLY ON THE SIDE BUT NOT DOWN THE BRIGDE WHICH IS WHERE I NEEDED IT MOST ! ! ANDDDDDD THEY BRUISEDDDDD MY NOSE BIG TIME ! IT LOOKS LIKE I GOT PUNCHED ! SO NOT REPURCHASING THESE , MAYBE MY SKINS TOO SENSITIVE.PS LEFT IT ON FOR THE RECOMMNEDED TIME	-1
I was really disappointed by this product after hearing all the hype . I have very large pores on my nose and expected a lot of junk on the strip when I removed it . Nearly nothing . I need to try it again , and will update after I do , but it 's hard to get motivated to use them again after the first experience . : - (	-1
I do n't care much for pore strips in general . This is the only brand I have ever used . The first few times I used it , it did n't see much of a result . The skin on my nose felt softer , but my pores were still clogged . I tried opening up my pores more by holding steam up to my face for a few minutes , but I had the same disappointing result . I had better luck by simply squeezing my pores with a wet washcloth and scrubbing it with my Olay Pro-x cleansing system . I regret spending my money on this . I think this could help people with extremely large and clogged pores .	-1
This did n't do much of anything , keep your money . I 'd rather have spent more money on something that works . This did n't do anything and it is n't all natural . When I first brought this last year it claimed to be all natural . They covered the real ingredients label , with a stick on label that did n't list Parabens . Peel it back to see it contains Parabens . I do n't like deceitful companies like that .	-1
ok i got scammed and sent it back . please do not tell me any one would say this really works . my sister and i are laughing at ourselves for believing this stuff would work	-1
I have very dry , sensitive skin , and this treatment was a little too strong for me . For the record , it is a good consistency and if my skin could have handled it , it might have given great results . : (	-1
First off , let me give a glowing review to the seller for getting this to me so very fast , and with free shipping . Bishop 's Discount Depot is awesome and I would/will definitely buy from there again-hands down . This in no way reflects negatively on the seller-just in my disappointment.The product ... Burt 's Bees Lip Shimmer ... not what I was looking for . It feels pretty good on the lips , but no real strawberry taste/tang , which was my first disappointment . But even that is not as off-putting as the baby pink ice-pearle finish . I was under the impression that this would be sheer-not a true glossy gloss by any means , but something more like Aquafina 's lip balm , with maybe a little more shimmer . I do n't know why I thought that it would be like that , but I definitely was n't expecting pearle . It 's a creamy , ice-pink , pearl-ized gloss-not a sheer shimmer- that is reminiscent of my pink make-up follies in the 6th grade-a dark place I dare not revisit in my adult years.Maybe I did n't read the product description well enough ... not sure . But really , really disappointed after all of the great reviews . Guess I 'll keep looking for that perfect strawberry gloss/balm/shimmer/something.I 'd send it back but it would just be too much trouble . I 'll put it in the `` fail cosmetic '' basket I have on the shelf in the bathroom .	-1
I have been using this for a while . The smell is very strong and it sometimes burns my eyes . As for my skin , I have not noticed any change at all with this product and I do n't think I 'll finish using the container .	-1
This could be a good product , but the smell does n't go away , it sticks around , yuck ! Try REN Omega 3 serum , it has all the good oils , but does n't stink .	-1
I bought this because of the positive reviews & the natural ingredient ; however , it 's too sticky even i used only tiny for my entire face . I tried it only twice in two consecutive nights , and I still ca n't stand the sticky feeling on my face . So I returned it next day . I have been using many different kinds of serum ( fr dept stores / drug stores ) , i think the royal jolly makes it sticky or too rich for me . it may be a great product if the weight is not that heavy . BB becomes my favor since I want to use natural product to my skins .	-1
I read a lot of reviews and thought this might be pretty wonderful - but it 's really not.The lavender scent is the only real thing that I like about it , since the oil gets everywhere and does n't appear to provide any exceptional benefits to my skin . Another reviewer suggested using the remainder as an eye makeup remover , but for me it seems too heavy for even that application.So I 'm just using it up on my body when I get out of the shower - no point in wasting it .	-1
I thought with the name `` Hyaluronic Acid '' in the name of this moisturizer , it would be one of the main ingredients , however , it 's number 12th or so on the ingredients list . I was n't impressed with this cream , and it has a strong floral scent ( plumeria ) . If you like that , it 's fine , but it was n't what I was expecting . There are better hyaluronic acid products on the market . I am taking this back to the store I bought it from.Good things : I do like many other hydrating ingredients that are great for the skin included in this cream : aloe , green tea , Vitamins E , C & A . The name of this product is just misleading .	-1
Returned this item , vendor kind to take back . I found it very drying and would n't buy again . It 's up to you !	-1
Good seller . When the brush broke off in the bottle on first use they replaced it as soon as I emailed them a pic . That said : wish I 'd asked for a refund . Since I started using this stuff my ( normally fine ) nails have begun to split and crack . I thought is was because of the winter but then the weather changed and I realized it was n't the cold at all . This base coat is just terrible for my nails . I 'm throwing it out .	-1
I bought this due to I read this was one of the top hair sprays . I did n't like it , it felt like I was using aqua net ! ! LOL remember aqua net ? ? This hair spray is just to stiff for me , it reminds me of the girls in high school their hair looked really good but not one hair moved , like they had helmet on their head , the wind would blow , but their hair , not one hair moved LOL , or a big section would get a gust under their hair and a big section of hair moved lol.. and they would n't turn their heads all the way , they thought they would mess up their hair ! ! LOL.. that was back in 1988 ! Lol.this is just my opinion , if you do n't want your hair to move AT ALL . This is for you.. Lol.. And no , I did not put a lot on , no more then I do with my tresesme hair spray and my hair is touchable and moves and the wind will blow my hair around . Lol .	-1
All three girls in the house tried this and it was not a fave . It made our hair sticky almost , and the smell was not pleasant .	-1
I bought this product originally because of all the rave reviews I read about it . I 'm sure it is a good product , but it just did n't work for me . It did n't make my hair any softer . I did use it until I used it all , but I wo n't be repurchasing it.BTW , I have very healthy , straight , fine hair .	-1
The reviews on this cream are pretty glowing , but I have to say I was not at all impressed.It was very watery , compared to what I was expecting . The sort of cream you need for your feet is going to depend in part on how nasty your feet are . Well , mine are pretty nasty . I have thick , nasty callouses on my feet . I think it 's genetic , as my dad 's feet are the same way , and it 's not like we got them that way from a life time of barefoot farm work . I noticed my feet turning nasty around the age of 8 , which is also when puberty started to creep up on me , which is also probably when PCOS began to rear its head . Diabetics supposedly tend towards nasty feet . PCOS is supposedly related to insulin resistance . IR and diabetes are kind of related - I know the IR/PCOS came from my dad 's side of the family - and I think the nasty feet did , too.If you have run of the mill kind of dry feet , maybe this cream will work for you . The one good thing about it is it soaks in mostly right away , so you do n't have to do the cover up with socks and let it soak all night thing . So maybe if you want a little moisture , but then want to put on a pair of sandals , this is a good lotion . But if your feet are hard core nasty and you are hard core about fixing them - this is n't what you want.Maybe it has changed since these reviews were written ? Someone else mentioned it is THICK . It is not ! I was much happier with the Eucerine Plus Intensive Repair body cream in the little four-ounce tub than I was with this . It is thicker and feels like you can really rub it in well . I have been alternating that with flexitol ( or store brand flexitol ) , and scrubbing with a tweezerman Pedro file ... and it 's been working very well . Lots of cream + socks at night and I am hoping to have nice presentable feet by summer . There is another cream made by Kersasal that combines urea and an exfoliant ( urea is supposedly what you really want to moisturize thick calloused feet ) that I would like to try next , instead of using two different things , but it seems kind of pricey , compared to using the two items . Amlactin also has a foot cream that looks promising - but again , pricey . I do n't know which of those I will go with . But this stuff I have to say was not worth it . It 's just too runny , you ca n't really rub it in to thick , tough skin like you can a serious pasty sort of lotion . Try the Eucerin Plus in the tub , or something else all together .	-1
This gel is not the same as the other self-tanning lotion I have used in the past . It does NOT dry in five minutes , I see NO color change , and the odor remains for hours , even after I tried to wash it off . Do not waste your money .	-1
If you 've ever gotten your Jersey Shore on and gone to a salon for a spray tan , Neutrogena 's Micro-Mist is hardly the same thing . Neutrogena is a brand I trust , but this stuff has more problems than benefits . Oh wait , I ca n't think of any benefits.Problems : if you continually spray this in your bathroom , your walls and floor will get a tan . I applied mine in the shower.The scent is not for me , and the amount of fumes made me wish for a painter 's mask . Granted , this may have been because I applied it in the shower , an enclosed space , but still , I did n't like the scent.As careful as I was , I ended up with a streaky tan and missed spots . I 'm going back to Jergens Daily Glow to get my tan on .	-1
This is the 5th brand of spray tanners ( banana boat , fake bake , tan wise , and true blue spa ) i 've tried out . By far the worst . Unlike the others which all gave me decent color this one was little to no color . Plus , I think this smell was the worst behind true blue spa . The only thing I liked about it was the fine mist spray . Pointless though if it 's not gon na work .	-1
I bought this stuff on sale , and despite all the glowing reviews , I 'm going to say that this is not for everyone ... myself included . I this this product would work really well with a second person involved to apply the product . Perhaps it 's because I 'm new to spray-on tans , but my results were disappointing and embarrassing . I only sprayed this on my legs . I was sure to exfoliate and shave . I sprayed as evenly as I could . The color was lovely , but blotchy ... I had white patches here and there . Worst of all , though , was that the product dripped , and I did n't realize it . The next day , my calves were white except for the drip marks running down them , and my heels and arches of my feet had pools of super-dark `` tan '' on them . It looked awful . After reading up some , I 'm going to switch to Fake Bake . That product is rubbed on , and has a bronzer so that you can SEE where it 's being applied . No worry of drips . There 's a great review on there -- first one -- that gives advice on other products to use to make a perfect tan every time . Meanwhile , this stuff will go in the garbage .	-1
But for the amount of wipes you receive it is kind of a rip off . I just want simple wipes to remove my makeup . But $ 11 every 25 days is a little much . Probably wont purchase again .	-1
I wanted to love it but after using it for the first time I developed a rash but I was n't sure if it was from this or something I ate so I gave this a break for a week and used it again and got a rash again so it was just a waste of money for me .	-1
This AND the mint julep mask break me out like crazy . The mask dries out my face and burns , and the scrub does nothing but `` buff '' my pimples and then create new ones : (	-1
The kit was smaller than I expected . Everything seemed just a touch bigger than the `` free gift '' deals you used to get with cosmetic purchases in some department stores.The gloves were poorly constructed ( it looks like the person who sewed it could n't hold the seams straight on the sewing machine ) , and I did NOT like the smell of anything except for the almond cream . The hand repair cream , in particular , had a sharply medicinal and astringent smell that I did not find at all pleasant . I ended up throwing away everything except the almond cream and the gloves.I LOVED the almond cream . This almost redeemed the entire package for me . It 's very thick , but not greasy , and has a light and pleasant almond smell to it.Honestly , the kit might have been a decent-to-good purchase for about half the price since it did let me sample a bunch of products I 've been curious about , but at it 's current price , I did n't think it was worth the purchase . Looking back , I wish I 'd just bought some well-constructed spa gloves and a bucket of that almond cream .	-1
a family has been using this daily for years -- and then was diagnosed with an eyelid infection . probably had nothing to do with tis product , but stopped using it just in case .	-1
I do n't know what all the fuss is about . This product is very drying of the delicate eye area and it actually hurts my eyes - not good ! Also it 's not very effective in removing eye makeup , especially long-wear/waterproof mascara - which is supposed to be its selling point.Bobbi Brown 's Instant Long Wear Makeup Remover is better , and even plain old Pond 's Cold Cream does a better job and both are much gentler - no pain ! Sorry I 've used it otherwise I 'd return for a refund . Spend your money on something else .	-1
I have some thinning in my part , and have been using Joan River 's Great Hair Day for years . It gives a slight itch sometimes but is easy to brush on and gives full coverage . I bought the Toppik after reading reviews of no itch and how it works better than Great Hair Day . I kept shaking it on my head and it did n't look like the powder even came out . Then I slowly see a pile of powder forming on my hair , and I had to mix it in with my fingers . I even tried using the Great Hair Day brush , to no avail - the brush did n't pick up on the Toppik powder . I used the Toppik applicator for parts which I bought seperately , but that did n't work well either . I 'm back to using Great Hair Day and the Toppik is sitting ignored in my closet .	-1
I really had high expectations for this product based on the highly rated reviews , but I was very disappointed . Now I will let you know that I am an African American with natural hair ( sister locks ) and i have noticed my locs are n't as thick as they used to be so I wanted to see how this product would work . Well when I put it on , the color was a bit weird . Though I ordered black it was black greenish gray looking . Weird is all I can say . It kinda reminded of cigarette ashes or something and it just did n't adhere well to my scalp and between my locs . Thankfully , I found this product called Caboki ( i think that is the spelling ) and it 's unbelievable how good this product works ! It 's amazing ! ! ! I actually thought I would be disappointed with it like I was with the Toppik because usually these products are made for Caucasian type hair , but it worked miracles for my hair . My daughter is a hair stylist and I asked her to look at my hair and tell me if she noticed anything different . She just said my hair seemed thicker . When i showed her what it was I used on my hair , she was impressed . This stuff is literally like fine hair in a can or bottle or whatever the container is ... .that you can shake on your hair . The best part i found is that when I rub my scalp it does n't come off and get all in my finger nails . Just an amazing product . Anyhow , in my opinion Toppik is n't the product for Ethnic ( or at least natural ethnic ) hair . I do n't work for the Caboki company , but I would n't mind investing in the company because i will definitely be buying more of that particular product so I gave Toppik two stars because I would not have found that product on youtube had I not been searching for Toppik .	-1
shows like I have put dried mustard in my hair . After a couple of hours , it 's gone . Will not try again .	-1
I really do n't like this mat . I wanted one for travel and it does n't lay flat . The Velcro is all over the bag , I thought it had a small Velcro closure ... But both sides have it . It is bulky also . Not for me . I needed something for my curling wand . It gets really hot and burned a towel , I guess I need to keep searching .	-1
Had it not smelled so darn bad : ( I actually had to throw it away the other day , after failing to ever use it because I just could n't take the smell lingering on my hair.It 's such a strong scent , and nothing quite gets rid of it.The scent it like pouring cough syrup on your head . Robitussin smell.I wish I 'd like it , really .	-1
It did nothing for me ! I have just bleached my hair and was looking for something & # 34 ; intense & # 34 ; but this is n't it ! It really did n't help with smoothing or detangling , I would n't buy this , I much prefer 'it 's a 10 ' .	-1
After reading reviews I really thought this one was going to be the one for me . Instead it did nothing . It does smell good . Sort of clean scent . I used it 5 times and almost 1/2 the bottle is gone .	-1
It lasted a very short amount of time , and the packaging is such that you ca n't take it apart to get whatever 's left in there out when it starts running low . I totally do n't get the buzz surrounding this product . You can get better highlighters from practically anywhere at a lower cost . Try Benefit 's highlighter if you 're looking for an awesome product ( I think it 's called Highbeams or something ? ) and if you 're looking to use it as a concealer , seriously , try virtually anything else . It 's nothing special at all . Really . Do n't believe me ? Go ahead and waste your money and see for yourself afterwards . I love YSL 's mascara and I 'm always happy to pay a little more for things that work better than drugstore equivalents , but seriously , I feel like an idiot spending 70 bucks for like 15 or fewer uses of a subpar product . Do n't fall for it . Go for a sample if you can track one down before you invest .	-1
I had high hopes for this product according to the rave reviews . It 's either a product that people love or not care for at all . I saw no volume or thickness on my short bob style haircut . In fact it made it flat and oily . I have tried it on damp hair as well as dry hair . I have tried different amounts . Rather than being wasteful I am going to give it away . I have much more confidence in my Chi haircare products that I will experience a good hair day .	-1
This product is VERY pricey and I 'm on a tight budget , but I heard good things about it so I thought I 'd give it a try . I 've used it religiously along with the Anti-Fade shampoo . I also follow all the rules for keeping red hair vibrant : do n't wash for 48 hours after coloring , do n't shampoo too often , wear a hat in the sun , and do n't use heat styling products too often.I was pretty upset to see that the red color rinses off my hair in the shower when I wash it , just like with other anti-fade products . Having used both the shampoo and conditioner for 3 months , I have to say that my red hair has n't stayed any more vibrant than when I used other less expensive fade protection products . The color looks drab after 2 weeks.I ca n't justify spending this kind of money for a product that does n't do what it promises to do for my red hair .	-1
I tried this with the conditioner after reading tons of reveiws , I gave it three tries ! Some reveiws said use very little , so I tried a few times , what I got was tons of static & dry unmanagable hair ! Worst hair day ever ! I did buy it at a local salon & thank goodness I could return it . I do however love the leave in repair conditioner by Pureolgy !	-1
this shampoo smelled real nice but did n't seem to keep my hair clean as long as i would have liked . i still had to wash my hair everyday	-1
I really tried to like this shampoo and waited until I used an entire bottle before posting this review but it was hopeless from the start . The most important thing when looking at reviews is to determine if the reviewer has similar hair to yours , the problem is most people do n't specify this in their reviews so I figured will all the good reviews I would take my chances but this shampoo is horrible and let 's not even get started on the price ( $ 25 for a small bottle ! ) .I have long straight hair but I have a lot of hair . I also apply a base color and highlight my hair . My scalp tends to be very oily with dry ends . From the first time I used this shampoo it made my hair ( which is normally soft ) feel dry and brittle but I figured that was part of the clarification process . No , it still feels like straw . The worst part about this shampoo is no matter how many times you apply and rinse it out , when you dry your hair it still looks oily and dirty and you can see the oil and feel it when running your fingers through it . Please refer to product photos to see photos of this . The purpose of a shampoo is to clean your hair , no one wants to look like they have dirty hair . After a full bottle , my hair looks no better than when I first started using the shampoo except now it looks oily all the time and feels like straw . I have drug store $ 5 shampoo that is much better than this one . Do n't throw away your money like I did . Skip this shampoo !	-1
Even when I use only a pea size amount of this conditioner , it makes my hair limp and flat . Not for me . It does smell good though !	-1
Having tried their shampoo , I was hoping for similar results from the conditioner . For me that was n't the case and I would not buy this again .	-1
Nexus used to be my favorite hair product brand because they used high quality ingredients that did wonders for my hair . But in the last 3 years they have repeatedly tampered with their formulas to cheapen their products and still charge high prices.I used to love Therapee shampoo . It used to be almost foamless , lightweight , and enriched the texture of my hair each time I used it . Then they changed the formula about three years ago to cheapen it . Now it appears that this year they have cheapened it even worse . It is now a gooey weird heavy shampoo resembling any cheap $ 1 brand you can get at a supermarket . And it weighs down my hair.Google all the complaints on the internet for more info . Basically they have kept the same names on their products but completely changed the ingredients , misleading customers , into believing it 's the same product . None of their products are the same as they were 3 years ago . It 's basically either crap or mediocre stuff pretending to be what it used to be.Many of the reviews on Amazon are from BEFORE Nexus started selling mediocre products in place of the wonderful stuff they used to produce .	-1
I bought this shampoo at a local beauty supply store a year ago , and it was GREAT . It had great scent , moisturized without drying my hair , and I only needed a quarter-size amount to suds up my long hair.I ran out recently and bought a new bottle , and I had to triple check to make sure it was n't a different shampoo ( it is n't ) . The consistency of the shampoo has changed from creamy to runny , the color has gone from milky white to dirty yellow , and the scent is barely there . On top of that , it requires at least 3 quarter-sized pumps of the shampoo to even suds up my hair a bit , and it dries out my hair , and makes it fall out.I 'm so disappointed in Nexxus . I attempted to find their contact information to speak to customer service and they do n't even provide a number or email address ; all they offer is an automated response system that 's computerized . So I typed in , `` Formulation change '' and it came back with , `` We often change our products to improve them based on customer feedback '' . Really , Nexxus ? So you decided to replace your working , quality product with a cheap imitation and charge the same price , and you think that 's what customers want ? Think again . Looking for alternate shampoos now . Do not recommend !	-1
I bought this product at first thinking it 's price and brand would knock it out of the park with long wondrous eyelashes . I 've got to say , my $ 7 bottle from the drugstore truly gives me the lashes I was looking for , long wear , smear-free , easy to apply . I think it 's the CoverGirl Volublast something or other in the orange tube . The drugstore mascaras are incredible these days , and for me , Diorshow had nothing extra to offer to make it worth the price . I found that it did n't bulk the lashes much unless I spent a lot of time applying layer after layer , and did n't hold the curl as well as my drugstore brand .	-1
after reading all the reviews , I was excited to try this mascara . Unfortunately , it made my eyes red-rimmed and itchy . I stopped using it , tried it again , same thing happened . Someone visiting me saw the mascara and asked if I liked it because she had an allergic reaction to it ... so it seemed like a common enough issue . I 've tried so many mascaras and most often they just are flaky , gummy or some other cosmetic issue , but no other mascara I 've tried made my eyes red and itchy like this one did . So disappointing ... more wasted $ $ $ !	-1
The first time I used this product I found that it smelled different than my previous can . I also noticed that my hair did n't respond well to it . I looked it up and found that the can Tigi sells is 8.1 oz . The can I received is actually 8.5 oz . even though the description says 8.1 oz . Tigi does not make an 8.5 oz . can . I 'm quite sure this is a knock-off Tigi product . Amazon did refund my money when I contacted them . Buyer beware .	-1
I had purchased Growth in order to grow out a mistake that the salon made . I asked for a trim and shaping ... what did i wind up with is a above the chin cut with layers , argh ! how can someone misunderstood 1 inch trim and keep my hair below the shoulder do n't they understand . I researched how to communicate to the hairdresser what you want in a trim , I even showed a picture front view , side view and back view or shoulder length hair with shaping . I ordered a 2 month supply of Growth , wanting my hair to be 6 inches below my shoulders again . after 1 week of using this , the product made my hair like straw , unusual clumps fall out and my head started to itch badly even though i rinsed for 2 minutes in cool water . I should have known it is too good to be true . I did start a liquid vitamin regimen from a different web site , and I noticed in 3 months my hair started to feel silky and shiny , in 6 months my nails are smooth and do n't have ridges , not peeling or breaking , and my skin has a dewy look and not old looking , I have n't had a cold since I started taking the vitamins in 2004 even if i was around a bunch of sick people , i still would n't get sick . The vitamin i have been taking for so long you ca n't get in stores ... it is from a websiteawaernesslife.com.It is a combo of herbs , minerals , and vitamins that promote healthy hair and encourages stubborn hair to grow ( but it may take a little longer , depends on individual ) and no your hair wont fall out ... it is the opposite , hair gets stronger , healthier and silky-shiny .	-1
I love trying new shampoos and conditioners but this one was a waste of time for me . I needed so much shampoo just to really get my hair to feel clean . Then the conditioner left my hair feeling like straw . I do n't have a coarse texture hair by any means but after using the shampoo and conditioner together I wanted to scream . I still take the vitamins and use my regular shampoo and conditioner and my hair has done 10x 's better . So unfortunately I have to give the shampoo no stars and the vitamins 5 stars .	-1
Now , maybe I 'm a bit confused . I did not see a value here . It does NOT help hair growth at all . Sure , it smells good . Yes , the shampoo does clean very well . But I saw no additional or faster growth . In fact , I think my hair is growing slower using this stuff ( not confirmed ) .Obviously , your results may vary , but I 'm simply sharing that I saw no appreciable results from this stuff .	-1
Its ok , did not notice anything yet , but I will wait and see until I finish the whole btl .	-1
You know the old saying `` If its to good to be true '' Gave this product a change and it was a waste of money..Didnt work . Shampoo doesnt lather and the conditioner smells like crap . Dont bother	-1
Alright , I admit I have never seen , felt or smelled 100 % shea butter in my life ! So , technically , I can not say if this is the real deal or not . But even if it is , you definitely do n't want to rub this on your skin , for simple fact that it smells awful ! Instead , I have turned it into a paste and used it , along with jojoba and castor oil , as hot oil hair treatment . The shampoo afterwards takes care of the unpleasant scent . I have to say , it works wonders ! Hey , if life throws you shea , make some butter with it . : ) UPDATE******I decided to do my hair 'mascara ' again , but this time using a lot more shea butter than oils . Let me tell you , my head started itching a minute after applying it , and even after shampooing and rinsing my hair twice , my head still itched and my scalp was redish ! ! I thought `` Wow , could I be allergic to 100 % pure shea butter ? ! '' So I did a google search and found this : '' '' The Food Allergy Research and Resource Program reports the shea nuts do not belong in the list of commonly allergenic tree nuts . There are no reports of allergic reactions to shea nuts or its products . `` `` I 'll let you take your own conclusions about the purity of this shea butter , or even if it 's shea butter at all . As for me , I threw it all out and definitely wo n't be buying from this seller again .	-1
Ok , I just got my raw Shea Butter today , and first off the container was dented and then duct taped like it had been thrown against the wall . When i first opened the container , the stench practically hit me in the face . It smells DISGUSTING ! ! When i tried to scoop some out , it was so hard and brittle i had to put it on top of my heater to soften it up a bit . When it finally started to melt ( which it went from completely hard to oil ) , i put some on my hands and my face and it feels completely greasy , ( i definitely wouldnt use it on my face during the day ) and the smell is definitely lingering , so I 'm going to have to wash it all off before work . I know that since this is a natural product , it takes a little time to `` work '' so I 'm going to give it a shot . I 'm just only going to use it at night so i can wash it off in the morning . I also bought the Dudu Osun Black Soap that i ca n't wait to try ( it smells like pine trees ) so maybe that will pair well with the shea butter . I just think that on first application , Vaseline with SHea butter moisturizes the same , if not better than the raw shea butter ... .and it smells a wholeee lot better ! ! ! !	-1
I ordered this from Nature and Herbs and paid a total of twelve dollars and sixty-one cents including shipping for 16 oz . Nature and Herbs shipped very promptly , shipment was wrapped in a padded mailer and then a cardboard mailer . The butter was packed into two 8 oz plastic tubs . This is my first purchase of shea butter , so I do n't have anything else to compare it to , but it smelled fresh - vaguely like cocoa butter . It did n't seem rancid at all . It 's very thick . The Amazon product description says it 's organic , but the label on the container only says `` 100 % Pure Africa Shea Butter . '' I was willing to pay more for an organic product , but I do n't think this butter from Nature and Herbs is organic.Here 's the suspicious part . The color is a BRIGHT YELLOW . Natural shea is supposed to be ivory in color . This means either a root extract has been added to dye the product yellow OR this butter is NOT true shea butter , but rather African butter from a different tree . So I 'm not sure I have the real deal . I 'm going to have to order from a different seller for comparison . `` Shea Butter comes from the Karite tree and can be a variety of colors ranging from a slight yellow to an off white . Shea butter is never a bright yellow , the bright yellow butter is actually African butter which comes from an entirely different tree . The most expensive shea butter is East African Shea butter , because the butter is rare . `` Amazon does n't allow me to post links to this information , so just do a google search for `` Yellow Shea Butter '' and watch the YouTube video that comes up in the search results.UPDATE 3-21-13 : I ordered KAKOSI brand organic shea butter from the seller Icemans Thunder . This is the real deal . It was ivory in color and had a slightly different texture from the yellow butter . It comes sealed in a heavy bag and was nine dollars and ninety five cents with free shipping for 16 oz.KAKOSI 100 % Pure Organic Raw Virgin Shea Butter ( 16oz/1 Pound ) Solid/Cream Temperature DependentYou can also find KAKOSI brand organic cocoa butter : KAKOSI Organic Cocoa Butter 16oz Bagged Solid/Cream Temperature Dependent	-1
I really liked this product when I first started using it ... about the first two tubes . While my lips did n't seem plumper , they definitely seemed to stay softer and moisturized ( I stopped having to use balm throughout the day ) . And the tubes last forever just using it once at night.I do n't know if they changed the formula with this last tube or what ... .but my lips are staying dry like never before . I 've started having to use balm throughout the day again and exfoliate my lips more often , too . I 've used the product for about three years now ... .it 's not like this is a season that 's different . And my skin/hair is n't getting dryer overall . It really does seem to be this product that 's the culprit.I 'll go back to my other products ... wo n't be buying any more of this .	-1
Do n't waste your money . I have been using it twice a day since I received it . I ca n't see ANY difference in the size of my lips . It is very sticky .	-1
I love shea butter and have been using it for a few years now . I 'm away from home for the summer and just have n't had time to go the nearest natural/african store and pick up some shea so I figured I 'd just order from amazon . This stuff is disgusting . Its super oily and has a gritty consistency . The package says 100 % shea butter , which is clearly a lie . This is not the kind of shea that is smooth and supple and reduces between your palms into a warm softening oil ... . it 's something else .	-1
when buying any product or thing online , you run the risk of getting a bad batch . I got a vary bad batch . It was grainy and lumpy , not smooth at all . I 've been using shay butter in my hair for three years now , and it has never looked like what i got . Well ill be sticking to buying them at my local beauty supply store . This product was so bad , that i had to trow it out.. Never Ordering Shea butter online again .	-1
So far , I have n't been able to use it because it 's hard as a rock . I brought it out into the AZ sun & it has n't softened any . I might try microwaving it as others have suggested , but I do n't want to nuke the entire tub . I think I 'll just throw it away .	-1
I make my own ( mostly-organic ) cosmetics , so I 've used a number of different products from a number of different brands , and this has got to be the most disgusting smelling thing I 've ever received . The rancid smell was so strong it permeated all of the lotions I made - none of my essential oils could mask it . Not only that , but the yellow color was so bright that it stained my clothes it touched . I ended up just tossing it , because it was n't worth the trouble of sending it back . I did later buy Grade A ivory Shea butter from Ghana ( via Halal Today ) and it was amazing ! It has the typical nutty scent of Shea without it being overpowering and blends/melts well into my lip balms an lotions , as well as being great used direct . Buy that instead .	-1
did not come with any information at all just a business card , packaging was less then desirable , it was taped like a 6 year old did it- the lid does not fit and the heat made it melt and leak every where , NOT HAPPY NOT AT ALL ... ... ..OH AND THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT A STAR IS CAUSE I HAD TO.. : (	-1
I love Shea Butter and I am sure that this product would have been wonderful if the canister was not cracked open when I received it . I can not attest to the quality of this product because I did not use it for the reason stated above .	-1
I have an autoimmune disorder that makes the skin on my palms very , dry , and they peel and sometimes bleed . I 've used L'Occitane Organic Shea , mixed with Aquafor , after perscription ointments and creams did n't help . I 've had good success with my existing routine . But the L'Occitane is $ 39 a can , which is quite pricey , for me . So , when I found this , I was excited to use it . Especially after reading the description . The price is fantastic which is why it got 1 star from me.As for my issues : 1 ) It stained my gloves , and I got a tiny piece on my nightgown which is stained too . 2 ) The smell is hideous . It reminds me of terrible baby vomit . 3 ) After going through all of this , it did n't moisturize my skin nearly as well as the L'Occitane Organic Shea Butter , mixed with Aquafor . I did mix this product with my Aquafor as well.I should say too , this product is very hard . So you 'll need a makeup or other little spatula to use it .	-1
Shipping was FAST but it 's super hard and has to warmed up in micro for 15seconds to be able to use it but I got this for 2 stretch marks that I have recently noticed behind my legs and used this product twice a day for 1month and saw no results at all so I threw this junk to garbage where it belongs !	-1
& lt ; UPDATED REVIEW > After using this for a few more days after posting my original review , I am updating it because I am now fully convinced that yellow coloring has been added to this as well as other ingredients . It actually leaves a yellow stain on my hands and clothes . This is NOT 100 % shea butter . I actually went to an african market near me and showed it to them and they compared it with their real shea butter . It is nothing a like . Do not buy from this seller. & lt ; ORIGINAL REVIEW > Im a little suspicious of this product , it smells like shea butter and feels like it too , but dont understand why it is so yellow . I have been to africa and seen raw shea butter and its usually greyish or off white . This is way to bright and yellow as though color has been addded to it . Other than that , its still great for hair and skin but I dont think I will buy from this seller again .	-1
I bought this item actually to add to my all natural pest control mix that I make myself . I opened the cap & it is a good thing that I would not wash with this body soap b/c my husband & I are in agreement that it smells just like the old timey drug store perfumes they would sell called Jovan 's vanilla musk , plain musk or white musk . I can not stand the smell of this as it reminds me of a knock-off perfume sold in Flea markets . Sorry , I like to be honest with my opinion with my sense of smell . I can not stand it but hate is a strong word so I am settling for do n't like .	-1
I 've been using African black soap in a bar , and thought to give the liquid version a try . The liquid soap smells almost the same as the black soap bar , but very hard to rinse off . It leaves residue on my body . I am going back to the bar soap .	-1
The African Shea Oil was not what I expected . I expected an oil , but the product was creamy like a moisturizer . I suppose this is because shea oil crystalizes once it sits for a while . I would have liked to have known the texture of this item before buying it , because I was expecting an oil . The oil is oderless which is good , but before buying , be sure that you want `` shea oil '' , and not shea butter or any type of natural oil .	-1
It may be better for people with dry skin . People with oily skin like me should really avoid this.It caused me severe pimples	-1
A friend of mine recommended Shalimar perfume to me . She said it was so beautiful I had to try . So during my next trip to a perfume store , I asked for Shalimar . Sprayed it on paper , and then on my wrist . Both the paper and my wrist smelled so terrible to me , that I felt as if I was going to vomit . Could n't wait to get home and wash it off my wrist . Very old-smelling , nasty , and pungent perfume . Like some kind of old rotten wood/pines . This is not to offend anyone . I understand that every perfume smells different on different people . I also understand that what one person likes , another may not like at all . We all have our own tastes in perfumes . Well , this is the case for me with this particular perfume . To me , it smells so ancient that it reminds me of old rotten/moldy woods ! Yuck !	-1
I like JLO but this fragrance is just discusting . I hate it . One of the worst smelling perfumes of the century . I would not spend one cent on this . I collect perfumes and have huge variety . I can tell you this is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever smelled . LIVE smells much better .	-1
I really didnt think that this perfume would have such disgusting smell.Maybe its not original from JLO s perfume ? ! Anyway i dont advise this product	-1
Grapefruit , orange flower , neroli , rose , amber , sandalwood , jasmine , vanilla , orris & a base of musk come together in a curvy bottle to form a soft , feminine & sensual scent which deserves 5 stars.However , half an hour after application my skin flared red , blotchy & very itchy . A real shame as the fragrance is brilliant , so good that I kept on using my 100ml bottle despite the irritation.Try before you buy ! ! * ` Live ' , her third fragrance is fabulous - I suggest those with sensitive skin like myself to try it ! ! !	-1
My friend got this for a Christmas present and she has been dumping it on her head or something because it is OVERPOWERING . A young woman and even an older woman smells much fresher and nicer with just a hint of perfume . Not sprayed head to toe and stinking like a polecat.I would recommend Cabotine or even 5th Avenue ( have a look at scentiments dot com ) . And please ladies , do not use too much . You can not cover up a dirty body smell by dowsing yourself with cologne . Have a nice refreshing shower or bath and then apply the cologne sparingly .	-1
I did not care for this perfume . Did n't receive any compliments and I 'm sure on somebody else is fine everybody chemistry is different . Did n't work for me .	-1
I used to wear this scent a few years ago and I received a lot of compliments on it , so either my body has changed dramatically or I got a & # 34 ; fake & # 34 ; one or all of the above..Even if I spray it for a room deoderizer , it smells cheap and rancid . This is the nastiest stuff ever .	-1
It smells old and stale . Very unhappy . Hope Amazon gives me a credit so I can order another bottle of Eternity .	-1
this cologne does n't last or have any scent , I do n't know what the shelf life is on this bottle but the life in this bottle is dead .	-1
this is by far the worst cologne i have ever had ( or purchased ) , either all the positive reviews are false or i have got false cologne ... the very first time i have sprayed this the smell was so bad its impossible ... this is my personal experience with this cologne , just be careful when ordering ...	-1
i bought this perfume for my mom and they are fake im so mad about this . dissapointed TOTally ! ! ! ! please check out	-1
I want to be honest this to me is more of a water-based cologne . I mean it is in the sweet smelling cologne its not in the Musk it 's a very light maybe even a Ocean Spray Cologne to me I would n't recommend it but everyone has their own option I 'm into sweet smelling and musk this is a category on its own .	-1
I love how this opens , and I sensed musk and vodka straight away at the top without knowing the listed notes . Unfortunately , this is turning sweet on me , too sweet . And the white florals are n't right for me . Too bad too - love the opening otherwise . Have to scrub - the white florals are just too irritating for me . ( PS - I often have this reaction to white florals , particularly with CK & Givenchy . Armani joins that list . )	-1
I read the reviews and almost everyone was favorable , so I took a chance and bought this without smelling it . Big mistake . BTW , I have Burberry Brit and Burberry Touch and both of those are pretty good so I was looking forward to the Burberry original and I really wanted to like it . It smells like a house at Christmas time . Think cinnamon , pumpkin pie , spiced apple.If you want to smell like that , give it a try . It is a cheap , synthetic , imitation to traditional bay rum .	-1
This is one of three perfumes that I bought on amazon recently . I based my choices mainly on the reviews , which is why I felt safe buying this one . Two of the three I really like ; not so with this one.I do n't know of I got a bad one or what but the scent is horrible ! It seriously smells like raid bug spray . I will say that once it dries down the scent turns from bug spray to a very strong floral scent . For me it 's too heavy once it dries down and I just ca n't get around the bug spray scent .	-1
This juice is too feminine smelling for a man 's cologne . I do n't like it at all . I sprayed some on me at the store and it took hours to get rid of the smell . This juice lasts which if you like the smell is a good thing . This is not the way I want to smell . Many people do seem to enjoy this scent - I am just not one of them	-1
I really wanted this perfume for a long time , my girl friend gave me as a present.But i was very disappointed with this because it lacks longetivity and i dont quite like the way it smells ... definitely not for me ... ..	-1
I worked at a perfume boutique for a while and was able to take testers home every once in a while , this was one . I do like it , but bottom line , im glad I did n't spend the money on it . It 's very very strong which is not my taste . I prefer lighter fragrances that are more discrete , not the kind that suffocate everyone in the room . That 's basically what this one does . Like I said , it 's a nice smell , but after wearing it for a few hours ( just one spray ) my nose starts to burn .	-1
Love Dolce Gabbana , light blue toilette - last bottle I purchased was from a department store and I loved it . One of the best eau de toilettes on the market . But do n't purchase it here , something is wrong and you ca n't return it . Besides that , I order 1.7 fl . oz . and they sent me 1.6 fl . oz . and charged me $ 59.00 even that I would n't mind but the scent lasts minutes not like the bottle I purchased two years ago - it lasted 6 to 8 hours and even then you could still smell it . People are complaining and Amazon does absolutely nothing . I ordered Boucheron eau de toilette and the same thing . I 've learned my lesson - read all the reviewd on different fluid oz . and you will see what I mean . Just do n't read the reviews for the one you are purchasing . Those 1 reviews tell you a lot - same toilette and some have 4 stars and other toilettes have 1 star .	-1
First , I am not knocking this seller . My review concerns the perfume only . I had such high hopes concerning this scent . I had read many rave reviews . When I received a sample scent in the mail , I was shocked at how much I disliked the fragrance . To me , it smells very similar to Anais Anais ( which can be bought at a much less expensive price ) , and I have never cared for Anais Anais . Both perfumes are overbearingly spicy to me . I really like soft , fresh and sweet scents . Light Blue had nothing that I liked about it . I suggest buying a `` sample size '' first of any perfume and make sure that you like the scent . What smells great for one person does not smell great to another person . Reading the reviews , I thought I 'd love this scent . But to be honest , I hated it .	-1
It 's not the original , I sprayed it on and within 10 mins I was second guessing myself as to weather I used it or not . I would not recommend anyone waste their money on this product that 's being distributed by amazon .	-1
I hate this cologne it smells like my grandpa 's musty arm pits mixed with right guard deodorant from the 1970 's .	-1
It was rather strong , which i do n't mind . However , it seemed like it had one too many scents trying to over power each other . It had an underlying smell of Joop . I bought Claiborne 's Bora Bora and was very impressed with it so thought I 'd give this a try . At least it was cheep I 'm sure one of my friends will take it off my hands .	-1
Sorry , this cologne is n't that special . It smells very similar to the variations of Axes . It is very strong , and does last ; but it smells too much like other cologne . Most of the reviews on this product are bogus ; who writes reviews on cologne that they have not purchased through Amazon to say how many guys and girls they attract ? Sorry , but your cologne is not going to make you a hit or miss . When a girl who smells nice walks past you in a bar , it probably has n't significantly raised your chances of approaching her . It bugs me that so many of these reviews are fake methods of advertisement . Look for the `` Amazon verified '' reviews from people who actually bought this through Amazon ; not all these fake reviews produced by Mambo ...	-1
I 'm really disappointed when the perfume came in . When i smelled it , i was expecting to smell something with mangos in it . Boy was the description wrong , to me the perfume smells like gardenias , which is going to make me sneeze during the allergy season . And what 's even more disappointing is the fact that I ca n't return it . Yeppy , I 'm stuck with this damn thing , woopy-do .	-1
um ... was not what i expected shouldve known you get what you pay for.. cologne packing looked used and the top of the bottle was wet.. smh as if someone sprayed it on them then shipped it to me.. i didnt expect that at all.. product is in the trash.. if im not the first person to open it im not interested.. its just the way i am.. the city dump can appreciate the smell	-1
Such a teenager scent . I used to wear this when I was 16 . My boyfriends loved it but they also wore Liz Claiborne scents ... ugh ... It was inexpensive and the nicest I could afford at the time . Better to save your money for something better .	-1
I did not care for this product . I did not like the way it smelled on me . I would not buy it again .	-1
Shocking . If you like the smell of a nursery home that smells odd , this is the scent for you . That is the faint smell it has . It is WAY diluted , and I can understand why ! Would never buy or recommend .	-1
I do n't know if I got an old one or what , but this perfume smells like spray starch . Or like a cross between spray starch and those old , unscented hairsprays ( like `` Aqua Fresh '' ... do they even still sell those ? ? ) .Was totally bummed because everyone seemed so happy with this scent and I bought based on the reviews.I ordered the `` L '' by Lolita at the same time and it smells great ! Nothing at all like this other ( and reviewers said they were close sisters ) , so maybe I did get a bad bottle.Update : After 2 hours of smelling like spray starch , I scrubbed my skin with a hot washcloth . THEN it still smelled , but it smelled good ! Musky/powdery/vanilla like people described . Still smelled strong , just no spray starch . And it smelled almost identical to the way the `` L by Lolita '' smells right out of the bottle .	-1
I will never love this fragrance ... ever . It 's so strong and gives me a headache ! If the devil is a woman and wears perfume ... this is it !	-1
This is a good price for the product , although if you live near a Marshalls or TJ Maxx , you can get a whole gift set for the same price as this 3.3-ounce spray . How do I know all this ? Because I 've tried to wear this fragrance . I 've really tried to give it a chance . I like most of the old-school `` heavy hitter '' fragrances that many people find baroque , cloying , and dated ( for example , Giorgio , Poison , Youth-Dew ) . But Red Door has something about it that jars my senses ; something that makes me want to run for the hills and/or the barf bag . It has some individual notes that are lovely ( rose , orchid , honey ) but there is just too much going on at once in this fragrance . At least on my skin . Your mileage may vary .	-1
Mary UPDATE : This is my 2nd . time ordering and I received the wrong RED DOOR they sent me a bottle that is listed on AMAZON for $ 24.89 and it smells entirely different then the cologne that ( I always purchase ) that I have worn for more than 25 years . I can not send it back due to shipping requirements . I think AMAZON had better check out this company , nice way for this company to make money . I will buy my RED DOOR in a store from now on . I have been with AMAZON for quite a while and I will not put up with this any longer ... Please do not buy from this company as you can not be sure you are getting what you order and you can not return the product . I will put this in the garage sale someday.Update : 09-26-2013 Well . Well , Well . This is a NEW PHOTO THE SELLER HAS PUT UP and this is what I received ! ! This is not what I ordered.BEWARE BUYERS FROM THIS SELLER ... I can not believe this company has still not sent me the correct cologne that I ordered and paid for..	-1
The problem with this scent is that its getting WEAKER AND WEAKER BY THE YEAR ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I have to apply this three times a day now where back in the nineties I only had to apply it once and that was it . Im not spending my hard earned money on something that I have to use 3X as much to get the same effect of what used to be . Im not the only one who is noticing this WEAK AND WATERED DOWN VERSION OF PERFUME these days . Elizabeth Arden is trending this way with all the perfumes now . Someone noticed this in 5th Avenue perfume too ! I will not be buying another bottle of this thats for sure . Good luck Elizabeth Arden , women do know the difference ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
Red Door puts Poison & Giorgio to shame . One spray will do or it will announce your arrival before you.It opens with honey-drenched white florals . Morphs into a rose , just a bit soapy , eventually a bit powdery . Takes a long time to dry down . Pleasant & wearable for me ... in about 2 hours.If you like extravagant florals , this one might be for you . I 'm glad I opened the red door but I doubt that I 'll do it again . I 'm gon na keep this red door closed . However , I love this version : Red Door Velvet By Elizabeth Arden For Women , Eau De Parfum Spray , 3.3-Ounce Bottle	-1
The smell does not last at all , in an hour or so , you can not smell it ... very weird ( I love the & # 34 ; door & # 34 ; . ) . I am not sure if it is watered down , I will not get it again .	-1
I WAS NOT REAL HAPPY ABOUT THE SMELL OF THIS STUFF ! EKKKKK SMELLS JUST LIKE A RUBBER TIRE . IM SURE SOME PEOPLE LIKE IT BUT NOT ME ! ! ! !	-1
Although I initially liked the light fragrance , it does not hold at all . The staying power is zero and it is not even small enough to be carried on in your purse , so u can keep spraying yourself . Waste of money and didnt know that Amazon.com did not allow perfumes to be returned . Wish I knew before ordering : (	-1
so many reviews about this cologne , so I had to try it , well , it is not great , it is like a cologne for really old people , I can not return it so I just put it back in the box and took it to the salvation army , I am sure someone will like it . wasted of money here ...	-1
I think this one is lacking good low notes and a little feminine . You better be wise and careful to pull this one off .	-1
This perfume make me suffocate , when i gave it giftI immediately warn them about it because it give you breathing problem.And make u suffocate the smell is very strong .	-1
I believe it may be the melon notes , but along with the powder and floral notes sits a heavy , almost musty scent that is not my cup of tea , in fact I sprayed some around the room and when my niece came in she asked me what that smell was , I told her and we both agreed this was a very unpleasant scent , love white diamonds , will stick with that : - )	-1
Estee Lauder did not have a gourmand/foody fragrance in their lineup during the Flowerbomb/Angel/Pink Sugar trend , so in order to meet the `` me too '' rush , they quickly slapped together this generic fruity gourmand that wants to be unique and distinctive , but it 's about 15 years too late . It 's a harried , boring composition that wishes it were as delicately delicious as Hanae Mori Butterfly or Dior Hypnotic Poison but fails to come close to either ; trying to please everyone by being mediocre.It is a highly forgettable gourmand/floriental that does not linger in one 's memory nor draw comments the way an Angel or Flowerbomb would . If you want to be special , buy an *original* fruity gourmand ( i.e . Lolita Lempicka , Coco Mademoiselle , Hanae Mori ) . If you want to be `` me too '' , then get Pleasures Delight .	-1
I have ordered this perfume many times and bought it from the department store , only TODAY did I realize that I this perfume was ordered for me and never arrived ! disappointed I do n't know who sent it to me so I cant contact them to tell them I never got a bottle -	-1
I waste money on this when I was 16 and it smelled too mature for me.I got compliment from mostly older women so ended up giving it away to my friends mom .	-1
dont like the smell has a strong musk odor.. yuck if that what they mean by smell like a man.. then keep it.. other than that delievery was on time as projected.. but dont like the smell i wouldnt advise it unless your a fan of musk.. winters coming how about some deer musk	-1
This just stinks . I got no compliments wearing it . It 's too sweet and a foul funny primary scent . I would n't even use it as air freshened .	-1
I took a chance and purchased `` Design '' by Paul Sebastian because of the glowing reviews . I was told by someone that it reminded them of an old lady in church . I found it kinda strong , and I agree it has an old fashioned thing going on.I guess thats due to the warm musky notes .	-1
This scent smells like a dated 1970s cheap perfume . I do n't even know what to do with it now . I do n't see how it could benefit anyone 's or anything 's olfactory senses . Using it would only be torture to any creature . What does one do with a bad perfume ? I 'm open for suggestions .	-1
Im dumbfounded by the reviews on this perfume , because most of them say it has a clean fresh scent . So i purchased it and it smells very musty and thick . nothing clean , fresh or crisp about it . I took it to work to see if if was me and asked how others thought it smelled and they said , old , musty , nasty , etc . out of 23 people , not a one said clean or fresh . So Im confused by the reviews here .	-1
The perfume is fading away VERY quickly . In fact , it is so lightly scented that even immediately after applying it I can barely smell it.I am not very fond of the fragrance either . It smells like washing up soap , not the usual fresh and invigorating smell of Arden 's perfumes .	-1
I need more moisture for my leave in . This feels like I 'm misting plain water on my hair . It does n't detangle ... At all . My hair feels soft but that 's pretty much it . I wo n't buy it again .	-1
This stuff was a little too greasy for my hair . I also did n't care for the scent . the scent was too strong and too masculine . I also did n't like that my jar did n't have the ingredients listed.For the record I have I have 4A-B hair .	-1
what can i say that i have n't already ? i am trying out different styling gels/pomades for my young son 's very unruly hair . this one is too greasy and does n't hold at all . after a couple of hours , it just looks wet and greasy . and contrary to other reviews , this does leave a residue . at the end of the day , not only does it look greasy , it looks like we never wash his hair ! it is also very difficult to wash off . other pomades i 've used washes off easily with just water . being & # 34 ; natural & # 34 ; i thought that this would be easy to wash but no so . my search continues ...	-1
I had this product . It did nothing at all . Its serves no purpose . Waste of two bucks	-1
This wasnt what I expected out the oil . When I recvd the package it was no in good shape and the oil was leaking out the package	-1
I purchased this and the yellow tint threw me off . It is low grade and since I purchased it for my hair ; I can not use it . I will be heading to the grocery store for food grade .	-1
This works as your basic , bottom-line flat iron . If you have decent hair to begin with , go for it . But do n't expect to get any great curls out of the barrel , because it 's too awkward to work with easily . I was n't happy with its temperature , since I need something REALLY hot to get the job done for my curls . I used it solely as a straighter , and it hurt my hand after a while because the way you have to press it together gets hard to do . It 's lasted me a long time with no breaks or anything , but I would n't buy it again.If you have difficult-to-manage hair like me , invest in something that 's of quality ( ask your stylist ; I 'm going to buy a TS-2 ) . Expect to buy something that can heat to at least 400 degrees and costs aprox $ 80 . If you 're up for it .	-1
It 's nice that it comes with two brush options and a concentrator attachment - but for me there were some real cons : * The cord is really short ; you need to have a plug in above the counter-height to make it the most user friendly - and I 'm only 5 ' 3 '' * I was hoping to use this instead of a hairdryer and round brush , but your hair has to be almost dry to use this . Guess that 's fine if you have long hair ( as shown in the pictures ) , but it does n't work well for shorter , fine hair that needs to be styled from the moment you start drying it or it will be stick straight . * The diameter of the handle is too big ; it makes it cumbersome to use . * This is REALLY loud , much louder than other hairdryers I 've had.This all could be due to the fact that it 's not a high end brush/dryer ; maybe you get what you pay for . Glad I got it on a Lightening Deal .	-1
I purchased this hot air brush from CVS but found it cheaper at Harmons ( $ 18 plus 20 % coupon ) . Not sure which stores are available in your area . I tried this brush on towel dried hair with anti-frizz leave in cream and styling mousse . I had to go over the same area over and over . I made sure I had a small section of hair ( found people trying to dry in large sections ) and it did not work . It left my frizzy and limp . It has a low and high setting but would prefer a middle setting . I would purchase this at a walk-in store so if it does n't work for you then you can return it . I also saw it available at Walgreens . Amazon may have a cheaper price but you are taking a risk since you have to pay return shipping if it does n't work for you .	-1
I bought this item expecting to use it as a curling device for my hair . It frizzed my hair and added not curls . Stay away from this one !	-1
The base get 's SO hot that it will burn your hair and you ca n't control the temp . Look for the Helen of Troy , it is a plastic/rubber base and brush . I have two in different sizes and love them .	-1
I like this product becAuse it has 3 different attachments and has a strong motor . The only thing is it does n't have a cool air option . Be cautious too in handling the attachments , they can get very hot and I learned the hard way . It does the job ... not too thrilled about it though	-1
This item is probably good for some people , however , I have much better results drying my medium fine hair with a blow dryer and round brush , I do n't like it .	-1
These hard bristles do n't grab hair , so it makes curling and drying almost impossible . I returned it . I do n't see how this could work for anyone .	-1
It was okay , not really what I wanted so I gave it to a friend that really liked it and worked great on her type and texure of hair .	-1
For the price of this I expected more . It 's hard to handle and the ends keep coming off . I 've let my two girls try it and they did n't like it either .	-1
I am disappointed in this brush/dryer - it only tangles in my hair and does not produce the detangling or curling effects described . For me this product was a waste of money . I opened the package so can not return . What is missing is sufficient heat to make the product effective enough to produce straightening and/or a slight curl on the ends . I used once and found this brand/style does not really detangle ( actually the opposite ) and left the ends of my hair nearly untouched . To be fair I should add I am African-American w/medium length hair so that may be a contributing cause of insufficient heat/poor detangling effect . Just saying .	-1
I received an old model ... They sell the Infiniti PRO CS32BX and I got Infiniti CS32XR ( 2009 ) ! I did not see it was a third party seller ( fulfilled by Amazon ) , otherwise I would not have bought it . I had too many issues with 3rd party sellers . Items were incorrect , or old , or used . This happened too frequently . Plus returns or refunds are always a nightmare.Amazon offered a free return / refund which is appreciated . I ended keeping it minus a discount.But still ! This is not very re assuring to see that I get more and more bad experiences on Amazon with 3rd party sellers .	-1
This was n't all that . The spray is hard . It shoots out too harsh . It keeps your makeup in place but if you your forehead inches for some reason do n't scratch cuz it looks as if your skin is peeling . You ca n't touch your face at all . Not even pat it . It looks flaky if you do .	-1
It does keep your make-up in place , but it really stings my face when I put it on . It 's your decision if the burn is worth it .	-1
I did not like this product . I tried it and it did not do anything for my hair , so it just sits in my cabinet . I bought it based on the reviews , but it is as one person said , you have to try it for yourself . What works for one person or even most people may not work for you . I bought another product and I love it..	-1
All it did was make my hair greasy and I used as indicated for over 2 weeks and did not have positive results . I threw it away . It was a waste of money .	-1
I have light brown hair , bought both Coffee Bean and Mocha to darken my hair . NEITHER worked . I followed all instructions , left it on 30 minutes , it just does not stick . Waste of money .	-1
I knew it was temporary , but it hardly showed up at all and lasted a day . Maybe on blonde hair it would last and show up longer , but anything beyond a light brown and you really will need Manic Panic or something .	-1
Does n't really work for me : (	-1
I ca n't sit here and say that I got a bad bottle , because I also own the 20 Vol bottle of this product and it caused the same effect.While it gets the job done , it will make your hair extremely dry ... while washing it out ! ! wtf ? Thank god I got a hair cut before hand and my hair is rather thick so hair breaking off was n't a big issue with me , but this developer caused it ! I have never had my hair dry out like it did with this ! The first time I used my 20 Vol ( same product ) in conjunction with Wella Hair toner and I thought at first it was the toner that caused my hair to dry out . Now I know better.Now , so people do n't try and blame the fact that I 'm bleaching my hair by saying : it 's normal that it will be dry , as the problem , let me tell you it 's not . I have had to do sessions as my hair was a level 1 to 2 . ( that 's black to very very dark brown for those who do n't know ) Before I used this product I used myL'Oreal Quick Blue Powder Bleach 1 LbwithIon Sensitive Scalp 40 Volume Creme Developer 32 oz.twice ! That 's a 40 Volume developer people . It never once fried my hair like this did . Dry it out yes , but not to this extent.Imagine my surprise when I go and use the this 30 Vol developer ( as I did n't think I 'd need the lift a 40 Vol provided as it seemed like overkill ) several weeks later , my hair back to being normal and with all it 's lovely natural oils , only to find my hair course and dry and like straw . ( THIS WAS WHILE I WAS WASHING IT OUT ! BEFORE EVEN TOWEL DRYING IT ! ) My hair was matted to my head like I had been running and sleeping in the wild ! I 've had to keep my deep conditioner in longer that I 've ever had to and if I could I 'd slap the makers of this shit . It 's a terrible developer . I do n't know how other reviewers can say it 's great and what not , because it was n't ! This and the 20 Volume is going in the trash . I think I 'll stick to the Ion developer brand thank you very much . This is what I get for trying to get something little cheaper .	-1
I buy wig spray for two main reasons : to condition my wigs and to give them a nice sheen . Additionally , I like for the spray to have a nice smell especially since I 'm using it on synthetic hair . Well , I do not like the spray because unlike the name of the spray , it provides no luster , shine , or sheen to hair and it smells like straight alcohol which is a turnoff . The only benefit is that it slightly conditions but considering the other drawbacks , it is not worth the money .	-1
I have 4 a natural hair . I have tried it as a moisturizer on wet hair : a real mess , it had a gel like feeling and it just sat on my hair , made my ends incredibly tangled . Luckily for me , I was just given a sample to try it . This is definitely not for me , ever again .	-1
I have been looking for a protein treatment for months ( I have relaxed hair ) . First I tried Organics hair mayonnaise , and my hair was left weak and breaking . Then I tried Aphogee 2 step protein treatment , and instead of helping , I experienced even more breakage once I was through with it ( and I followed the instructions to a T ) . I am disappointed , since the reviews shows that this product worked well for others , but not for me .	-1
If I could give it a zero I would , it made my hair tangle so bad I lost so much hair when I detangled it , I follow the instructions carefully , it made my hair dry , knotted and horribly hard , I almost spent a whole bottle of conditioner , in my entire life I never experienced so much breakage and shedding , beware ! !	-1
This product contains animal protein , as in it 's not animal-friendly . There are plenty of vegetable or synthetic protein products out there . Try Dieci by La Brasiliana . You can get it for a great price on Amazon ~ $ 14 , and the texture feels great on the hair . The bottle is a good size too , 8.8 oz . Plus , it 's no 2-step process , so simpler than this.The seller should post the ingredients ; I only found them out from another websie . It 's not worth killing an animal , taking any life , just so we can look good .	-1
Bought from Sally 's . I used it as instructed exactly on the package.While it did seem to make a difference in making my hair look and feel more smooth , the stench is overwhelming and lasts for days.Sorry , but no results are worth the odor from this stuff for me .	-1
Everyone raves about this product , but it 's not all that . Yes , it makes your hair super smooth- when you apply it . When you 're in the shower , your hair will feel like silk when you wash this out . But after you 're out of the shower and your hair dries , this is a crappy conditioner . In comparison with my cheap herbal essences conditioner , it does not make my hair smooth or soft , it almost seems drier than usual , and I ca n't smell it on me like I do with my regular conditioner .	-1
This has no effect on mosquitos thought it would be a repellentwith a nice smell , I read many times that mineral oil clogs pores and induces pimples and acne which I am prone to . Regarding softness , it does make your skin so soft ..	-1
Doo Grow Thickening Hairdress received 2 stars for several reasons . First , the price is a rip off . I saw this same product at the local dollar store for $ 4 less than what it is selling for here . Secondly , because I was looking for a hairdress without many harsh chemicals and one that was ideal for 4b type hair , I was disappointed to see that petroleum is one the first listed on the ingredients list . As research shows , petroleum is not good for most individuals with 4b type hair because petroleum blocks pores of the scalp resulting in slow hair growth . Third , the product is thick and makes my hair greasy even if I use a small amount . For every negative characteristic , I deducted one star . The main good quality about this product is that it has a nice smell . For African American women looking to transition to natural hair or who already have natural hair , I would not recommend this product .	-1
These African-American hair products are so bad , I would not accept them for free . They do not cause hair growth especially in natural hair rather they clog your pores and cause hair loss .	-1
Doo gro usually gets stellar reviews from nearly everyone , but the product is so greasy and it clogs your scalp ! It does n't penetrate it ; it sits on top of your scalp . I used it after a wash , and instead of having moisturized hair when it dried , I had dry and crispy tresses . I like to use the optimum hair dress line , and I wanted to try something different .	-1
I got this hoping it would help my thin hair . I just naturally have baby fine hair and was hoping this would help . It 's terrible and all it did was make my scalp dry .	-1
Makes you dizzy . Besides that , they test it on animals , not wash it off from their skin and let them be tortured this way . Want to sponsor them so they continue this ? Your choice .	-1
Short of a couple of blackheads here and there , I do n't get much acne . I wanted to use this to try and clean up said blackheads , when they occur . I do n't have sensitive skin or anything , and typically astringent usually stings a little at first when applied for me , but this was downright painful . It hurt really , really bad . Ouch .	-1
the formula is very runny I like a thicker cream consistency to moisturize my eyes to help stop the formation of wrinkles , also it burns alittle for me the concentrations in the product are a little high for me and irritated meI will not be repurchasing anything more from this brand because I have been going the natural route and It has been working so much better for me with more results	-1
this product did nothing for me , no reduction in wrinkles , under eye circles etc . i do n't know why i bought it in the first place . i think i 've used it before and the results were the same but i decided to give it another try . wrong ... do n't waste your time or money	-1
I 've been using this for awhile now and gave it a chance . My eyes look as though I 've never used anything at all . I would not recommend this product .	-1
I did n't notice any difference with this product.i have dark crcles but it did nothing ffor that . would not buy this product.i do believe I got a rash from using this product .	-1
At the beginning I was happy with this cream . but after couple of weeks my eyes became extremely irritated and show allergic reactions , and I had to stop using it and try Neutrogena .RoC has oily and shiny base that i did n't like it at all .	-1
This is rediculous ! ! You packed a 0.5 oz tube of eye cream loose in the same box with 27 lbs of cat food ! You did not bubble-wrap the eye cream , you did not place it in a protective box , you did not do anything to protect a small tube of eye cream from 4 heavy bags and 48 cans of cat food ! The tube was flattened ; it was the most expensive single item in the box . If I could give you zero stars , I would .	-1
Wishful thinking this product would actually do anything for my eyes . Just another over rated product , keep your money . It is however less expensive here then in a drug store .	-1
I took my time and researched if this was a good product . It was n't bad , 22 dollars but I wanted one that I wouldnt waste time , money and hopes on . It has been 2 weeks and my bags are still there..waiting to be unpacked , so to speak.I am thinking of trying the loreal one that another reviewer recommended . Also there is a cheaper version at walgreens , their studio 35 version for 15 dollars and there is also the garnier one . I will try them next week or 2 weeks from now ( I will keep using the ROC ) and I will update this review .	-1
This order was weird . Package arrived on time , however , box was very damaged and old looking . Made me feel like someone had this product sitting in there medicine cabinet at home and decided to mail it to me . Not happy with how it look - worried something is wrong with it so probably wo n't use it . Waste of my money , next time I 'll drive myself to the local drug store .	-1
I dont know where the hype come from , but i am a 21 male , i use computer like 12 hours a day- a typical nerd and my eyes looks really bad , so i decided to buy an eye cream , since i am very good looking when i was a child , but now i am ugly , so maybe because of the eyes that make me ugly then i am eager to try this one , too bad i bought 2 of them , then it turn out to be disaster , i cant even look at me in the mirror , my dark circle is worse , and it also swollen , it also makes my eyes red and blur my visionWheni stopped using , then it back to normal , you cant believe how depressed i was after this , i dont want to sit on a computer all day long , i want to go out and mingle with people , i want to laugh with them , to be a normal person , but my face didnt allow me to , some night i cried alone , why was this happening to me ? What have i done wrong to be so unfortunate like this ? As a teen , i got acne and acne scar , my parents who are cruel also treat me with disdain , they are lookism so they hate ugly people , even if it is their son , i am from asia so parents have the right to treat child like beggar , because us children have to depend on them.Then with nothing to lose , i googled the best eye cream , and i foundDermalogica multivitamin power firm developed by national dermal institute , wow what a miracle , the dark circle is vanished , i look ten times better . I go to class and every girls in my class staring at me , twist their hair , smile at me , my crush is there , before totally ignore me , now cant take eyes off me . Ok this seem like a fairy tale , but for some person , having a beautiful eyes will totally change how they look , and luckily it is me , after years of being a total dork , i am more confident now , i am dating the girl i have a crush on , Which just make me wonder how shallow people are when judging other by looks , but we have to accept it.So just ignore this roc eye cream , or if you still want to buy it , i have 2 nearly full bottle which i will sell for a very cheap price , anyone interested ? Take My advice and buy dermalogica eye cream instead , even if it is expensive ( 40 $ ) $ it worths every penny , and you can use it for 3 to 4 months	-1
I bought this eye lotion so I can get rid of my dark circles around my eyes , but all it did after a month of use , was to slightly reduce them . They are still very visible . I had high hopes because of all the reviews I read about it . I 'm not going to buy a new one , I 'll try another brand .	-1
Wanted to love this stuff but it was just ok . Did n't notice any difference from any other eye cream Ive used . Get something cheap at Walmart..will probably do the same thing this does..	-1
Maybe this cream worked for other people , but it did nothing for me . This is no different than any other cream I 've tried . I was really hopeful as the cost is cheap and the reviews were positive . It did make the skin under my eyes soft , so that was a plus . But , I will still be searching for a cream that helps my dark circles .	-1
I really do n't have many wrinkles , bags , dark circles - have been blessesd at 62 . Thought I better start using an eye cream to keep things that way ! This product is VERY HARSH and my skin can take most anything . Second day I woke up with bags , dark circles and swelling which took 3 days to subside . Be very careful with this product .	-1
First off , let me say I did not order this from Amazon but bought it at a dept . store . My review is on the smell of the perfume . It 's very heavy and I did n't like it , but that 's my fault for not trying it before buying . I never took it back and it sat for years on my dresser and just recently I started using it as a bathroom air freshener . It works great for that ! I just do n't like wearing it on my person ! : - )	-1
I visited the EL counter at my area Macy 's store . The associate color matched both my Mom and myself . My Mom has a bit darker skin than I ( or at least I thought , even though my ancestry is Spaniard ) . The associate insisted that desert beige was `` my color '' . We bought our recommended shades and at first the product worked well . My skin has 1-2 pimples at a time , if even that . I have pretty dry skin and very red patches on the nose , chin , and upper lip areas . She assured me that this product would cover my issues and that the medical grade polymers that it contains would make it last all day ( a major issue I have is it not lasting ) . I am now a few months into using the product , and can say that its WAY too light for me . When I apply it , it has a watery/milky consistency and even leaves visible streak marks all over my face . There is no way to blend this stuff in , because it dries and adheres so quickly . I am a huge EL fan and have used a shade that we bought in Europe in their Equalizer line , which I was going to that counter to buy until she recommended this one . I am wearing Equalizer now , and can definitely tell a different . They no longer make my toasted almond color , but I am using it sparingly until I can get them to find me a comparable shade . Equalizer might not last , but it sure looks natural . Furthermore , Double Wear has dried out my skin very badly and caused it to feel like it was burning at times . The product flakes/peels off my skin in layers whenever I apply it . I use moisturizer along with it , and bought a primer but have not been able to use it yet . I contacted EL and they claimed that they will be sending me a replacement Double Wear , which as of now I have not received . I plan on going back to Macy 's and either buying EL 's other like Clinique ( which I used when I was in middle school , many moons ago ) . I just do not enjoy Double Wear and do not plan on changing from the EL company 's products , just will try another product .	-1
I have been searching for a long-lasting , full coverage , lightweight foundation for a long time . I tried Amazonian Clay . It lasted all day and provided great , flawless coverage , but it was much too cakey and powdery for my liking . After returning the Amazonian Clay , I decided to swing by Macy 's . I had a card for a free consultation and a 10 day supply of any foundation . So I felt like I had nothing to lose , so I took advantage of that . The girl who did the consultation told me my shade is Dusk ( 3C1 ) After applying this foundation , she asked me what I thought . I was n't exactly sure how to respond . The girl did a great job applying it , I just was n't crazy about how it looked on my face . Shortly after my consultation at Estee Lauder , I bought a bottle of Boots No 7 Double Wear Beautifully Matte . I 've been using that for a little less than a week now , and I absolutely love it . I decided today to try the free sample of Double Wear.This makeup just is n't for me . Even though the girl who applied this for me told me it was full-coverage , I do n't agree . I think the coverage is closer to medium than full . It also did n't give me a very flawless finish . It did an okay job of covering up the redness , but you can still clearly see the bumpiness underneith this makeup . I also do n't like the way this makeup looks on my face . It does n't look very natural in my opinion . You can definitely tell I am wearing makeup . I also have some very fine lines . So fine you ca n't even see them with the naked eye . But after applying this makeup you can see them clear as day . I 'm also not sure this is the right shade for me . You can clearly see where the makeup has been applied to my skin . My skin is light/medium with cool undertones . My skin is n't fair , but it definitely on the light side . I think a shade or two lighter might have worked out better . I also agree with a previous reviewer who said this is like applying paint to your face . That is pretty much what it looks like when its dry.This foundation is too matte for my liking as well . It looks cakey and thick on your face . But I also think that I 'm allergic to something in this product . Ever since I applied it this morning , my face has been itching . It 's enough to be distracting . I also found this makeup very difficult to remove . It took a lot of scrubbing.When I compare the two , there is simply no comparison between this and the Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte . The Beautifully Matte foundation provides full , yet natural looking coverage , contains sunscreen , is oil free and hypoallergenic . It lasts until I take it off at night . It also gives my face a smooth , flawless finish . It covers both the bumps and the redness very well . Even better , the Beautifully Matte is much more affordable . It sells for $ 13.99 as opposed to a rather pricey $ 36.99 for the Double Wear . Who would have thought that I 'd prefer a drugstore foundation over a high-end one ? Certainly not me . But in my opinion , the Beautifully Matte is superior to the Double Wear . I will not be purchasing a full-sized bottle of the Double Wear . I 'm glad I tried it out , but no thanks . I 'll stick with my Boots No 7 Beautifully Matte foundation .	-1
If you 're buying a Chi here without a full warranty , it 's most likely a fake . The knock offs cost ten bucks from China and can be found at all the Asia hair shows.Do n't fall for it ! If you do buy from Amazon , make sure you compare it to the real deal in a salon within 30 days . Check everything from screw colors to weight . If you find a fake , report it to Farouk , and complain to Amazon customer service so they take off the crooked sellers .	-1
I have a Sedu flat iron and decided to purchase the Chi because I read the reviews and lots of people said the Chi was great . WRONG , WRONG , WRONG ! ! ! I am African American female and I swim each week . I need an iron that will straighten my hair and not dry it out because of the constant chlorine and washing . I used the Chi last night and it dried my hair out . My hair has never looked like this . It used to have body and was shiny . I am returning the Chi tomorrow for a refund . I am going back to the Sedu- do n't think they sell it on Amazon but the Sedu is a great iron . The Chi is awful .	-1
I got this straightener for my birthday and it worked wonderfully . However , 20 days later it died for no apparent reason . It had n't been dropped or damaged in any way . It just wo n't turn on anymore , no matter how many times I push the `` reset '' button on the power outlet . I 'm pretty upset about this . When it comes to Chi , just spend the extra month or so saving up for a real one from the store , not this one . At least when it 's from the store you can return it after 20 days .	-1
No temperature control and is always super hot . The ceramic `` flat '' parts do not come together perfectly . My hair gets snagged quite often . Build quality feels cheap compared to similarly priced products.This was my first flat iron and I loved it at first when I bought it three years ago . I tried other similarly priced flat irons and this one has been in storage ever since .	-1
Have heard great things About CHI . THis One in particular Did n't work properly . one of the sides did not heat up . Did n't have any problems returning it .	-1
I purchased two of these . Both did exactly the same : stopped working with no reason at all ! The light still on but the iron will not warm up . A waste of money .	-1
I was warned that this product would break after a few months . THE REVIEWS WERE TRUE ! Sad to say that because I really liked it . If you want a CHI , buy one that is lifetime warranty . I wish I had .	-1
Everyone 's probably going to hate me for this review , but oh well . I know there 's this rumor going around that you MUST get a Chi , they 're the best out there ! They 're ceramic and that 's healthiest for your hair ! I ca n't tell you how many times I 've mentioned to a girlfriend that I 'm shopping for a new iron , and how many times I 've heard in reply , `` You have to get a Chi , '' and then I think to myself , `` No way . '' The reason is because none of the perceptions of this iron are true . Ceramic is not the healthiest for your hair , and Chi is not the best quality . I owned this Chi as my first flat iron and I thought it was amazing at the time because I did n't know any better . Looking back in comparison with my other irons now , the thing damaged my hair big time ( even with the faithful use of protective products ) , it did not get as hot as I needed it to ( which meant more times swiping it over the hair , causing even more damage ) , did n't straighten well , I could n't control the temperature etc . etc . Now that I own a Nano Titanium flat iron ( by Babyliss ) , I ca n't believe the time I wasted on this piece of junk . No , I do not work for Babyliss . Titanium is the newest technology and if it is Nano then it can actually help improve the health of your hair . My new one heats up to 450 and glides like butter through my hair in one pass.I simply can not give this brand a good review when I know what else is out there .	-1
I do n't flatiron often , so I wanted something that would be a long-term investment and when I first bought this iron , I was really impressed . But , after only a few months , I noticed the plates were cracked and the cord connection was damaged- and for a higher-end/pricier iron , it was kind of a let down ( not to mention safety hazard ) . I 've been using the old standby ( Jilbere Ceramic-Tools 1-inch from Way Way BACK-IN-THE-DAY -- Now simply sold as Ceramic Hot Tools I think ) and I think I 'll stick to that for now , although I am considering purchasing a Solia in the future as/if the feedback is positive .	-1
DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER . Seller sold me an imitation CHI flat iron . I was suspicious from the get-go when noticing that the product manual did contain any number to call for CHI product support . So I contacted them for a return label ( there was no specific address on the package indicating where the product shipped from ) and they said they would send a return label out that week . NEVER DID . Anyways , life went on and I forgot to follow up . Yesterday I came across the iron and decided to give it a try . Not only is the flat iron a total knock off but a CHEAPER THAN CHEAP knockoff at that ! One of the iron plates fell out mid-styling , landing on my leg and severely burned me . Moral of the story : this seller is dishonest and the products they sell are budget knock offs -- -- cheaply made and to be frank , dangerous . Do not buy from EVA .	-1
I decided to buy one because of the many great reviews from this and the fact that it was a bestseller on Folica . When I did use it , my hair was softer and did not seem as fried as with other flat irons . However , after about less than 10 uses of this , I noticed how the light never stayed on and when the light went off , it got too cool to straighten the hair . I got frustrated to the point that I went back to my previously used hair fryer . I bought mine for less than 50 bucks on ebay and always wondered if I got a fake or not . I did find a great article that is a start in trying to figure if you have a real one or not . I thought it was helpful. [ ... ] If the site does not show here , all you have to do is type in your search minus quotations , 'determing if your chi flat iron is fake ' . It should take you to an article written by a huge seller on ebay that is probably reputable as they have many positive feedbacks .	-1
CHI was my first 'expensive ' flat iron and I thought it was amazing . It did wonders to my hair over the cheap $ 30 brands . But my flat irons would always break after a year . After my second one broke I gave up on CHIs and went with higher end brands . Right now I have a Solia . Now THAT is an amazing flat iron . It blows the CHIs out of the water and it does n't cost all that much more . CHI 's can get your hair reasonably smooth if you work at it . But the problem is having to go over one section of hair two or three times does two or three times as much damage . CHIs do n't minimize frizz and their temp setting is iffy at best.Trust me . Save your money for a higher-end flat iron . Your hair will thank you , your bank account will thank you in a year , and you 'll save so much time in the mornings .	-1
I bought a Chi to straighten my thermally reconditioned ( but still curly ) hair at home . I was spending a fortune at the salon ( $ 40 a pop b/c my hair is long , thick and curly ) so I took a risk and plunked down over $ 100 for the Chi ( 2 '' ) . I loved the Chi while it lasted - I blow dryed my hair with a round brush ( which left it poofy and frizzy ) and then used the chi once my hair was dry to get silky smooth hair . It took me about 30 minutes to go through my thick hair and it really worked . My hair lasted frizz free until I washed it again . I only used it once a week b/c of the heat plus the chemicals in my hair . However , as I was using the chi last week , it stopped working half way through straightening my hair . I tried several different outlets and nada . It wo n't heat up anymore . I plugged it in this morning and it was ICE cold . So , the Chi is going back . Luckily I am in the return window for folica . I have ordered a Solia instead . Hopefully the Solia will prove more durable .	-1
This just crapped out on me one day & Farouk would n't take it back . Pissed me off that I spent so much on a straightener that did n't even last a year !	-1
This powder is more like translucent powder rather than a base . It has very light coverage that does not last more than a couple of hours ( if that long ) . The color is a bit pasty and flat and simply sits on the surface . While using the foam pad included with it , most of the product remains on the pad , while using a brush to apply , it flies all over the place with product loss . I feel that it is best applied with your face a bit moist in order to secure the powder in place . Personally I will not purchase again , I am not happy with the quality .	-1
Read all reviews hoping this would be for me but it is n't . I applied with light thistle brush and it enhanced every pore on my face . The color was dull , got the medium natural . It appeared greyish in color . The one positive , it felt like nothing but I did break out badly from this powder . Since I stopped using it , my breakouts are healing.I have used them all , high priced dept stores , drug store ... pretty much MANY brands . I gave up and I ran errands at target and picked up the maybelline mousse foundation . I could n't believe it , but this stuff was a perfect match to my skin , so light and does n't come off . $ 7 go figure .	-1
This stuff was too dark and cakey . It aged me ten years all the powder settled into every crevice and did n't smooth anything out . Also not enough coverage for my skin . I have lots of scars from previous acne and this did n't help me out .	-1
I have used this product for over 7 years and it used to be great ! Over the years it seems to be turning more orange . I ordered this hoping it would be more brown than the DARK , but it is n't any different . L'Oreal in the department store is better than Sun now .	-1
I was tanning using a bed and sadly , my legs did n't tan as deeply as the rest of me was and so I bought this product based on reviews . This product sucked ! It did not go on evenly and dried so fast that as I was applying it that there were streaks . I still have over a half of a bottle of this and it is going in the trash . The color is n't too bad , but I will try another product next time I self tan where I need to . Also , don'y get it near your hands or feet or you will look like an oompah-looompah .	-1
I bought this based on the great reviews that it wo n't leave streaks but it does . I 'm sad because I actually like the color . It 's a nice brown not orange at all .	-1
doesnt work for me ... looks green and streaky . Not for me . If you looking for a good self tanner that doesnt look fake go with fakebake or million dollar tan . I havent personally tried it but I hear that st. tropez mousse is very good as well .	-1
Used as directed , after one week , twice a week it does not get what you would consider `` dark '' , also it has the most nasty spotching in just 2 days . Going back to Loreal Sunless or Banana Boat . I highly do not recommend this .	-1
I am not sure if I got a bad bottle or what , but this definitely is n't as good as the reviews . I thought maybe it was just me that it did not work on , so i asked my cousin if i could use it on her . She is as pale as anyone i know . I barely seen it after 5 hours of the application . I have not seen a difference on me either . I really think that they sent me a bad bottle . I got the ultra dark which is not dark what so ever !	-1
Drive to Sally 's and purchase TANWISE for 8 $ ! ! ! ! It Is pretty much the same product ( consistency , and smell ) but with GREEN undertone which turns a very deep brown when dried . You will see the greenish undertone when applying Tanwise which will tell you that the dried result will turn brown ! SUN LABS does not have this green undertone and tint , so when it dries it has a hint of orange , ( nothing crazy like Jergens , Million Dollar Tan , San Tropez and Tarte ) . If you are n't too picky with your self tanners than this is a wonderful product . However after trying MANY self tanners I have come to the conclusion that My favorites have been Fake Bake ( reddish undertone.. giving the look of a little suburnt ) and Tanwise ( green undertone that turns a very deep tan.. after a sunburn ) have been personally the way to go . Sun Labs to me is well overpriced especially for the type of tan that it gives . Again everyone is different so this may or may not be the product for you .	-1
I got a small bottle of this at a natural store , and tried it for a few days . Every time , this would give me teary eyes and where I applied it , I would have pimples . It 's also a very greasy lotion that 's hard to wash off . I 'll stick to coconut oil instead . : /	-1
I thought this product would have more natural ingredients so it was n't a good buy for me . I wanted to use it on my face for more moisture but I feel all of the additives would probably clog or aggrevate my skin . I gave it to my son to use as a lotion .	-1
This product is greasy , and it has a powdery smell - like cheap creams . Well , what can you expect since it is a cheaper product ... .I wo n't buy again for sure !	-1
I used to love this hairspray but NO MORE ! The company changed the spray head design and the darn thing clogs soooo frequently , the spray pattern is all messed up . You wound up with hair spray ( almost lacquer-like ) in my eyes , on your forehead , everywhere but your hair . The company should know better - a hard hold spray is thick and drys very hard , so they need a good spray head design and a cap , so it does n't clog so easily .	-1
I am African American with type 3 hair . I also have fine hair . I recently got a light relaxer to relax the curl.I was hoping this product would help to keep my hair sleek . I work out daily . After workouts , I am drenched head to toe . I apply the Fructis sleek and shine on my hair while it 's still wet . Using a soft bristle brush , I brush in the product . My hair is nice and sleek . Then I spray in this product . My hair shrinks into tight frizzy curls . As others say , this product does to work on fine hair.So disappointed this product does n't work for me . It is awfully expensive .	-1
I have very dry mature skin and this cleanser was drying . Did not work for me at allContinued to use it for a couple of day and then returned it..	-1
If your definition of `` make up '' is some lip gloss and talc powder on your face , yeah , you can give 5 stars . It just does n't clean heavier , longer wear make up like Revlon , L'Oreal , Cover Girl , Maybelline , etc etc . I tried some a friend has and even she complained of the same failure of this product to clean and it 's not like her make up was set with cement , so please ! ! Can people just tell the truth ? ? ? Now we just use extra virgin olive oil on cotton and swipe off our faces , then wash with the St. Ives green tea acne facial wash .	-1
* Garnier Fructis Curl Products worked better for my hair* Try the Garnier Fructis curl inject mouse and curl spray gel* I thought that the Tresemme would have won over , but GF curl products won hands down for my med-thick , wavy hair .	-1
leaves marks in your hair as it goes through , cheap , not worth it , spend more .	-1
I was looking forward to this iron , my hairstylist had used one this size last time I went . The item took awhile to get here , about 5 days instead of 2 even though it was Prime . I took it out of packaging and plugged it in . Nothing , it was dead . I tried a few more outlets and it was still dead . I returned it for a refund and will have to look aroung elsewhere .	-1
i dont have alot of money to spend on just a flat iron alone so when i saw this i didint even check the reviews i just bought it lol i was desperate what can i say : P but um i have noticed after using it for 3 months it has broken alot of my hair off and it doesint work well at all on wet hair as u have to usually wait five ten mins for it to reheat up again and sumtimes even while im using it it quits reheating up even when my hair is not wet the upside about this iron is it eventually cools down if ur not using it instead of staying hott which is nice if u forget to unplug it or sumthing i wouldint recomment TESTING it as in that would be very stupid ha i just realized that when i was putting on my makeup and i had to set the iron down for about 10 mins i have tried the really expensive nice hott irons curly hair runs in my family and my cousens have the realllly expensive 100 200 dollar hair straigheners and if u have the money i would just go ahead and buy those its wayyyyyyyyy better in comparison to this it makes this iron seem like crap hah..anywyz i kinda wish i would have spent more money on a better hair straighener but oh well..than i would have been BROKE lol so yaa ... ok well hope i helped later	-1
The plates are not quite smooth enough for my very curly hair . I am sticking with my chi ( I was looking for a straightener with an auto shut off and discovered the newer version of the chi that now has one . I switched to it , and it is easier on my hair ( does n't catch at all whereas this one does a little ) .	-1
I liked the concept of this portable hair dryer so I purchased it before a trip . I 'm not sure why , and I could have ended up with a faulty model , but it broke after being used three times . The plastic near the handle broke and got sucked up into the motor , rendering it unusable .	-1
Read the other reviews ... I wish I had spent more time reading them ! This hair dryer lasted 1 year to the day almost . While it worked , it was very nice ... . though the retractable cord feature stopped working shortly after purchase . But I did like the concept - a folding handle with a retractable cord . Too bad the quality is so poor . STRONGLY ADVISE - DO NOT BUY THIS BLOW DRYER . There are too many reviews like this one .	-1
I eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it 's retractable cord and folding capabilities . Even the price was attractive . It really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus . I thought I had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly . Now for the bad news : the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time . Then , the folding handle , low and behold , broke in half one morning . ( Of course , the warranty had long expired ) . This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers . When I 've replaced hair dryers in the past , it was been because they 've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out . I 'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone , while very appealing , can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer 's lifespan . I 've now purchased a T3 Tourmaline ( a featherweight , quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle ) which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan .	-1
My last retractable cord dryer had more heat settings than this one , so I do miss the old one . This one is okay . There are some articles that indicate `` ionic '' hair dryers do not dry hair faster than normal hair dryers . I thought it did dry my hair faster -- perhaps that is due to me pairing up this dryer with a hair paddle brush.As to the retractable cord ... I would occasionally have problems getting the cord into the last dryer I had , as I occasionally have problems with this one . If the cord does n't go in the first time , pull it all the way out , make sure its not twisted , and try it again . I often have to push the last inch or cord in.May 2013 : I 've changed my mind about this product . Anything I throw out after a few months of use deserves only one star . I finally got fed up with trying to work the cord back into the device , and was concerned that the cord was actually starting to fray . I purchased a Conair dryer with retractable cord ( that I do n't have to fight with ) and heat control settings .	-1
It says that it 's dual voltage , but it took about a minute to burn out after being plugged into a 220 outlet in 220 mode . Also , the mechanism to switch between voltages requires a screw driver , so make sure to do that BEFORE your trip . Because most of us do n't bring screwdrivers when traveling .	-1
This stuff will leave you orangey . I would not bother with this stuff . I found Jergens products better results then this stuff .	-1
Have returned all products - one leaked all over contents - 3 were missing . Still awaiting credit to my account for returned goods on 12-29-09 - today is Jan 24 ! ! !	-1
I feel like one of the few people who really does n't like this product , but after trying it twice over the span of a few years , I can honestly say it does nothing for my skin . I inititally tried it a few years ago , but was n't impressed , so I stopped using it . Last month I got some as a sample , and decided to give it another try . Same thing , it did nothing for my skin , and I noticed that a few pimples popped up and they would n't go away . Once I stopped using it my skin cleared up and looked fine . If you 're unsure about purchasing definitely get a sample first .	-1
It smells nice and I love the natural ingredients . But it actually made my dry scalp worse ! I tried many different times and compared to to other shampoos to be sure it was n't a fluke . But sadly it really did worsen the problem . I will try to give it to a friend !	-1
it did n't work as well as I had hoped it would . I had high hopes that it would be a true henna mask for my hair but it seemed to dry it out and make it feel like straw .	-1
The first ingredient in this oil is soybean oil , not tea tree oil.This product is not pure tea tree oil but yet a blend of more than 20 different ingredients : safflower seed oil , rose hips fruit oil , sweet almond oil , peanut oil , BHT , Aloe Barbadensis , Fragrance , Phenoxyethanol , Methyl Paraben , etc.I was very annoyed to see all the ingredients once I received this product and immediately sent it back , for I wanted pure tea tree oil since I use it on my face for acne purposes and this product would clog my pores because of all the extra ingredients.Since contacting them , they have listed all their ingredients on the amazon page . When I first bought this product , no ingredients were listed .	-1
I 've used this product before and it worked fine . But I think I got a bad batch or something cuz it was n't red it was orange and now I 'm hoping it does n't turn my hair orange .	-1
i hate it the smell . it did nothing to my hair . my boys hate it being around me , they said it smelled like drool after you wake up from a nap .	-1
These are by fat the worst , low quality cuticle cutters I have ever used . You have to force them to open when they close and it just makes the process slow and annoying . I thought maybe I had a defective one , so I bought another and it was the same thing . Spend a few more dollars and get something better .	-1
This is absolutely the worst clipper ! It BARELY clips the nail - it 's more of a bend/indent/tear/cut sort of ... Maybe I got a dud ?	-1
I found this to be a waste of money . This chips off and dries out your nails , especially if they 're already in bad shape .	-1
I do n't know what it 's this product but along with the peeling that others have mentioned , the useful life of this product is disappointing . I used this product in Fall and Winter of 2012 , skipped Spring , and now I 've pulled it out for Summer and it 's doing that thickening that polishes that are past their shelf-life do . I 've rolled the bottle between my palms , shaken it , and even added a few drops of remover to loosen it up to no avail . The polish is clumpy and the brush is stiff . I bought this bottle around September of 2012 and it 's already gone bad on me whereas I have cheaper nail polishes that I bought 3 years ago that still paint like the first day . Do n't know that I 'll purchase this again .	-1
For me the only thing that this does is dry my nails , and the bottle is so small . I personally dont like it and it does not remove the polish as fast as i expected for pure acetone , i wont be buying it agai !	-1
I use gel polish and you are supposed to soak off gel polish with acetone . This acetone did not soak off very well . Cutex acetone worked much better . I was just looking for something cheaper than the gelish harmony acetone remover so I tried this .	-1
This product did not work well for me . I did , however , notice that although my nails did not grow longer , they did not chip and split as much . I would have given this product at least 3 starts for that fact , except that the bottle was half empty when I received it . I did not get the promised .45 oz .	-1
First of all , do n't use this as a base coat . I did it on accident and it feathered my nails.The second time I used this product I used a regular Sally base coat , two coats of Sally polish , and this top coat . I got chips after only a few hours . Also , this top coat made the polish look weird ... like it had dots in it/discoloration ... it 's hard to explain but it seemed like the chemicals in the two Sally products were at war.The third time , I used a Maybelline polish and I did n't get any weird dots or discoloration . This polish makes a nice shiny top coat , but this is supposed to be a NO CHIP polish . Does n't work . I got chips in less than 12 hours . I was careful to really get the edges of my nails , too.I 'd be happy to find something that gave me two days of pretty nails !	-1
It made my nail polish chip ! I thought that the polish was crappy because it chipped the same day ! I reapplied color and `` no chip '' and it was worse . I had to take it all off.I 've tried the same polish with Nailtiques 2 Plus , and I held up to TWO WEEKS ! ! ! !	-1
Used three times with Essie , OPI , and Revlon polishes , on clean nails over base coat and two coats of color and plenty of drying time in between.Hours after application , strange cracks and stress marks formed in the polish and chipping and peeling occurred overnight.This really needs to be taken off the market ...	-1
This product has ruined at least 3 perfect home manicures I did . I bought a top coat so my nails would n't chip within a few days . I certainly got what I paid for , because my polish gets weird visible cracks within HOURS of application , and then simply flakes and peels off in giant strips . I 've never seen the effect that this product had on my polish . If not for the fact that it peeled away 3-4 different brands of polish ( Revlon , Essie , NYC , and sinful ) , I would 've just assumed it was the quality of the polish itself . Luckily I reused an older color that I had used before with success , and was able to determine that this was the problem . Would give it negative stars if possible.Shockingly , does not have the same effect on toes . Not sure why .	-1
This top coat peels and bubbles . It is the worst top coat I have used in recent memory . I threw it away after trying to use it a few times .	-1
The other night I used this `` no chip '' top coat over a really cute ( and time consuming ) design I never did before on my toes . I was SO amazed at how SHINY and NICE they looked after they were done ! It looked like I got them done at a salon ! The next day ( not even 24hrs later ) I was out and noticed a big chunk chipped right where a rhinestone was ! I was SO upset after all the work I did to them and how long it took me ! It was chipping off in hard glass like pieces ! I came home and took it all off and used a different nail color polish because I thought the new color polish I used was the cause of all this since it was very thin and had to be layered a million times . So I used a different color polish and same design : ) I was actually going to use the same `` no chip '' top coat again since I did n't know it caused the chipping and was so shiny and pretty ! But I figured I 'd wait till the next day so my nails could fully dry over night . For some reason I decided to look up this top coat to see reviews before I put it on and WOW am I glad I did ! I realized it was the `` no chip '' top coat that ruined my toe nails this whole time ! And I was JUST about to put it over my nicely redone nails again ! Looks like I 'm using another top coat ! WHY does this stuff say no chip if it chips quicker than anything else I 've ever used ? ! ? HOW did it ever get passed the people that test it ? ? I 'm SO sick of products that do n't do what they 're supposed to do ! It 's a shame because this top coat is the nicest glossiest clear coat I 've ever used ... And now I have to toss it because that glossy glass look only lasts under 24hrs ! Boooo !	-1
I 've been doing my own nails for probably 15 years and this is by FAR the worst top coat I 've ever purchased . Compete garbage . I do my nails in the evening and the very next day after using this top coat , more than half of my nails are chipped . My nail polish would last longer if I did n't even use a top coat.Do NOT buy this . I will be writing a letter to the company to tell them what awful garbage this product is . Sally Hansen , I will never buy any of your products again . We 're done .	-1
I have bleach damaged asian hair which I am trying to grow out so I can chop off the damaged hair . I am using the Mane n ' Tail shampoo ( which REALLY works ! ! ! ! ) and thought I should give this a try since it 's the same line . But the first thing I noticed was the awful smell . I thought this product had gone bad , but when I read the other reviews , other people commented on the smell as well . I am sorta sensitive to smell , for example , if I go to Sephora and try sampling more than 4 different perfumes , I will get a headache and feel nauseous . I could not try out this product long enough to see the results because of the smell . But if you are not too sensitive to smell , maybe you should give it a try . The shampoo definitely works , maybe this does too ?	-1
This product did n't make a different in my hair what so ever . It also has a really nasty smell which I could n't stand so in the garbage it went ! ! !	-1
I wish the seller would have listed the product ingredients because , I would not have ordered it if I had known that the first two ingredients are Petroleum and , the next ingredient is mineral oil . BIG NO NO because , these two products are the worst things that you can put on your hair because , they do not really absorb into the hair shaft therefore it never fixes the dryness in your hair but , gives you a false shine . It is hard to wash out of your hair and , off your hands . TOO GREASY . I will not ever buy it again .	-1
Ladies on hair journeys be ware this product contains two of the no no ingredients for black hair , mineral oil and petrolum and they are listed as the first two ingredients so although it says herbal gro . It 's going to clog your pores and cause your ends to break . Dont be fooled . I accidently picked the wrong product will return . On a side note though mane n tail has a creme version of this it does not have maximum listed on the outside . That is the good stuff for naturals it will leave your hair soft and manageable and it has a lot of good ingredients in it . Also for those of you who use Qhemet Biologic heavy olive and olive cream or the burdock root this ( the herbal gro creme therapy it 's called ) is a cheaper substitute same results . save your haie	-1
I really loved the bright apple tones of Be Delicious , it was very fresh and clean . However , it faded quite fast . It left me with a boring , powdery , perfumey scent that I found old fashioned . I was actually quite surprised and expected a much more lasting and consistent scent for the price . If the scent had stayed the same as when I first put it on , I would have given a high rating as it starts out great .	-1
So I read somewhere that people are generally drawn to food- smelling fragrances and that apple was a favorite . Big mistake on my part shelling out money for this on the basis of what I read . It was not pleasing to my olfactory at all , I do not recommend both this one and the DKNY Red Be Delicious , both were not well done in my opinion !	-1
My nails are brittle and break easy . I like trying new things , but this was not a good option . I liked the apricot smell , but the cream did n't really absorb into my nails , they kind of got moisturized , but not protected , and definitely not as good as other brands I have tried . I would recommend Solar Oil or Burt 's Bees Lemon Cuticle cream . I even like Lip Smackers Bubble gum flavor lip balm for my nails - it is super cheap , rubs in quickly , and gives a beautiful shine . It may sound weird but it works !	-1
I bought this because it can be used for a base and top coat . The first 5 times I used it it worked fine . But , not it is very gloopy and thick so it is very hard to use . So disappointing . When I now use it as a top coat it forms little air bubble on the surface of my manicure . All the other Sally Hansen brands are pretty good . In fact , Sally Hansen extreme is my favorite drugstore polish . Not buying again .	-1
My nails were ok , but I wanted them a little longer and stronger . Not only are they shorter , four of them back to the quick , NOW they are peeling . Both index fingers and middle fingers are in bad shape .	-1
I have been using this product for a while and consistently have had the same issues . As a base coat , Double Duty works decently . I use a lot of polishes containing glitter , and Double Duty makes it really easy to remove the polishes - otherwise the glitter sticks to my nails and is next to impossible to remove . However , it also tends to peel up at my cuticles , and eventually my polish will catch on clothing or a towel and peel off in a large sheet . It makes removing polish easy and fun ( but horribly unhealthy for my nails ) .As a top coat , this product is the worst . I can let my nails dry for 4 hours , go to bed , and wake up with imprints of my sheets in my nails . Hours after using it , I can still leave fingerprints on my polish or smudge it . There are other base/top coats out there that are similarly priced and work much better . Would not recommend .	-1
While this is good for a base coat , it is awful as a top coat . The first time I used it as a top coat , I thought ok maybe I used too much as it was quite gummy and I was getting imprints in the coat from other things . The second time I used a very thin layer and same thing - it was gummy and within a day , some of the polish ( along with gummy stuff ) was peeling off . Would not buy again .	-1
My nail color already came off . I wash my hands a lot at work ( medical field ) and i needed something that would keep my nail polish on . this did n't work . it started to chip off after two days at work . so annoyed .	-1
terrible it dry up right away I wont buy this sally hansen again either all there nail power chip right away	-1
Be careful when applying this to your face . I suggest spraying on your hands in small amounts and applying to your face as evenly as possible . if you do n't get it even , you can end up with large dark spots on your face and they do n't wash off for days . Unfortunately I have some light colored freckles . This product will tan your freckles and make them darker too . Has a coconut scent or a scent that reminds you of suntan lotion ... .more like a cocoa butter scent .	-1
I have used at least 20 different face tanners and this one in my opinion was the worst . Did not work , and stunk . I usually love Sally 's products ... but this one def not .	-1
I got this product so that I would n't have to rub any product into my face as I find this to stimulate outbreaks . So I wanted a fine mist to spray to my face and not have to rub in . This product sprays out unevenly and does not meet my requirement . I paid a premium by ounce for this effect but will end up using on my body instead .	-1
I have been using a nail strengthener which works wonders for my nails but seriously dries out my cuticles . Anyways , I purchased this stuff when I ran out of my cuticle cream and it 's pretty terrible . It 's more of a watery consistency than an oil and is n't very moisturizing . I would n't buy it again or recommend it unfortunately : (	-1
This was awful ! ! The smell is just like & # 34 ; old lady & # 34 ; and it was too intense . I got it for the kids and thought it would be a great value but I could n't take the intense smell . My grandmother loved it and so it is now at her house !	-1
This stuff did not even create the slightest change in my hair color . I would have sent it back if it was not too much work .	-1
This dye turned my hair so very dark I have to wonder what the heck they did to package it wrong ? It was indeed 8RG , and I used the colorcharm compatible developer ( in level 10 since I do n't need lift ) , and I did not over develop it ( 15 min ) . I have never had over-darkening issues from Wella or any other brand.My hair went from level 8 light strawberry blonde to a mousy medium brown with a little red in the sun . It was at least a level 6 in depth and very dull . Not at all the titian ( coppery red ) color indicated ! ! Beware ... what you get might not be what you 're expecting .	-1
Find a fresh out of college girl to dye and tone it for you because this s*** is unhealthy and you can go wrong with it very easily !	-1
First I did not purchase this product from Amazon but I wanted to share my experience . I have been dying my hair off and on for 20 years . I am not a licensed professional but God has given me a gift for doing hair ... I tried this Wella Color Charm in Blk Cherry thinking it would make my hair uniform in color since I colored the ends of my hair with a Loreal product that basically washed out when I relaxed my hair . This left the lightened ends a orange red and where I had highlights it left that as well . My hair was not the rich dark black cherry I expected to achieve and I used a 10 vol developer for deposit only . I bought 2 boxes of this plus the Color Charm developer . Very disappointed ... perhaps I am not meant to have red hair . I have since colored my hair oriental black using Bigen.Also if your disappointed after using this product do n't bother contacting Wella ... they are so unprofessional they do not respond to customers even if you go through the BBB . I will not use a Wella product ever again !	-1
I tried to cancel this order like 2 minutes after I ordered it because I had gotten the wrong color . The seller emails me back , the next day , telling me I can not because it was already being processed ( even though they could have ) . But I decided to try this color anyways so I would n't of wasted my money ... YEA RIGHT . I wasted my money . In my opinion this color is not what I expected . I had medium brown hair and it turned out orange ... like a fiery red , sun orange . I hated it so bad I had to go to the store and pick up some different haircolor to get that crap off my head . Someone else may like it , but I sure did n't . And it did n't help the seller screwed me over .	-1
I say do n't waste your time instead of money because this was cheap , but so not worth it ! I used this in hope of getting dark hair on my too-damaged-to-chemically-dye hair . The box itself is so cute , with its little bird . I think honestly that 's why I was lured in , by the way it looks . However , this did nothing at all to my hair but make it smell like hay . I followed all instructions , boiling the water and mixing well . I was really excited for this . But the henna did not mix well at all ! It wasnt finely ground to allow for easier mixing/application . This was the messiest henna I have ever tried . Believe it or not , there are some out there that are n't a mess to mix , apply , and wash out . Oh , and once I washed this henna out , my hair was THE SAME . I hoped in a few days when it `` settled '' it 'd get darker , but nope . I have read many other upset users who believe the leaves are too old to give color , and this company uses `` expired '' product . I would n't be too skeptical about that idea . Do n't buy this if you 're considering . Try Rainbow or Henna Hut !	-1
I have been using Henna for a while now , specifically Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams . I came across this brand and thought , why not ? I have very short , light brown hair , which had been colored previously with the Red Henna Hair Dye 100 Grams ( purchased from Amazon ) . It was time for a re-color and thought I 'd use this brand instead . I followed the directions and got ... a very light cover . In fact , it does n't really look like I colored my hair at all.The other brand , gives me a deep , beautiful , red . This one ... well ... you know when your hair color starts to fade ? That 's how my hair looks now . It looked better before I even began to color it , last night . Yay me ! ! ! A waste of money and especially time , for less than mediocre results . Not happy with results at all . Will not repurchase.This being said , my mother likes it . So I guess it 's really a matter of preference . My mother 's hair is medium/dark brown and while it does really make her hair look red as my other henna product does , it 's alright for her . I personally did n't like it .	-1
Unless you can not find an indian store , then it is ok . I do not like the price , it os overpriced . I found a store , I was lucky , where I was able to buy a five-pound bag and it saved me a lot of money . At least the greys fade , it is not black , but it does not matter , as long the greys hide . I have used this before , and it worked pretty good , I just do n't like the price , it is overpriced compared to the regular Henna I have bought for more volume and a great price !	-1
I bought this serum because all the reviews at the time said it was very moisturizing . That was not the case for me . It completely dried out my skin and made it tight and uncomfortable all day . I would not recommend this product to anyone .	-1
Did n't work for me . Caused blemishes . The more I used it the worse my skin become . When I stop using it my skin came to its normal state .	-1
My hair is coarse and I need to condition it with oil . I thought this would work well , due to rave reviews and the olive oil.The description claims it is made for different hair types . But my hair did not feel conditioned after use . Also , I get a much more shine with One n Only brand argan oil conditioner , which costs less .	-1
I bought this hair dryer after doing a ton of research and thought it would be a good investment . When I first started using it , it worked great . I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards . I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight ( along with a round brush ) and it did the job amazingly well.Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks . I could n't believe it . I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks . This was n't even overused or anything . In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it , I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week . After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year . In fact , for about 4 months out of that first year , I did n't even use it right after I had my son . That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that was n't working properly.I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.If you need a good hairdryer , look elsewhere . I 'm just glad and lucky that the sparks did n't land on my hair and cause a fire or anything .	-1
I recently purchased the T3 Tourmaline II dryer and had great expectations . My hair came out exactly the same as with my cheapo hair dryer I bought for $ 19.99 . I would think after paying out $ 149 plus shipping for a blow dryer I would have noticed a difference . Nothing different . I expected my hair to come out with a salon look and I got the same flat hair no matter how much time I spent on styling my hair . I have short , layered hair and thought this dryer would add some volume but nothing changed . Luckily I have a 30 day return policy so I 'm sending it back for a refund . Save yourself the shipping cost and buy something else .	-1
Seemed to work OK at first although I did n't notice much improvment in speed of drying . It is lightweight and easy to handle -- but it is hotter than I 'm used to . After 6 months , my hair started to feel dry and had zero shine . My hair had always been very healthy and shiny before . My hair stylist noticed it and could n't figure out what was wrong . After about 9 months , I switched back to my old hairdryer and my hair was instantly healthy and shiny again . Maybe this hairdryer is good for some people but it was bad for me , and costly !	-1
Its a nice item to show off . It looks pretty . However it is is useless ! . Yes , it can scrape a bit of callus here or there but it takes LOT of time , energy and patience.After using it for 2 weeks , I started usingBario Electric Callus Remover . Use this machine . Its pure magic and does in 5 minutes , what the above buffer will do in 2 weeks ! I am returning the buffer to amazon .	-1
Looks like 100 % aloe vera gel , but is n't . Did n't work at all . Ordered the lidocaine version from the same company and it healed right away plus no pain .	-1
I wish I had looked beyond the subtitle & # 34 ; 100 % Gel & # 34 ; as there are a number of other ingredients added that I prefer not to use . It contains mostly aloe vera gel but adds additional ingredients such as Tetrasodium ETDA , DMDM Hydantoin , Diazolidinyl Urea , & # 34 ; plus stabilizers and preservatives to insure potency and efficacy & # 34 ; ( unnamed ) . These chemicals are used commonly in cosmetics AND there are competing opinions regarding their safety . I spent some time looking them up because I wanted to know for my own choice ; I should probably just get some aloe vera plants to have the fresh 100 % stuff . When I have used this product , it stings and causes redness on my skin so I will look for something else . On the good side , you get a lot for your money and the bottle is a sturdy well-made pump style that I can reuse .	-1
I 'm writing amazon about this FALSE ADVERTISING.The top of their page says `` Fruit Of The Earth 100 % Aloe Vera Gel '' but the bottle does not contain 100 % aloe , it contains a gel which has a bunch of ( possibly dangerous ) additives added to it ! Shame on Fruit of the Earth for putting all this crap which MIGHT BE carcinogenic in their aloe which people use because they want a NATURAL product.I 'd give this 0 stars if I could !	-1
I bought this gel as a natural way to help heal a couple of spots on my face where I had a breakout . The first couple of days I only used it as a spot treatment and though it did n't work wonders it did n't have any adverse effects . I then made the mistake of applying this over my whole face before going to bed . I woke up the next morning with a rash over my entire face including my eyelids . I was horrified ! It was only then that I read the ingredients of this product . Not only is it not `` 100 % aloe vera '' & `` alcohol free , '' this stuff is toxic ! Shame on me for not reading the ingredients before using this product . Shame , shame , shame on this company for claiming to be 100 % aloe vera !	-1
I am not a fan of this aloe gel , I purchased this to use on my face because I have really oily skin that breaks out very easily when I use lotion . But this aloe gel still leaves my face dry and leaves a lot to be desired . One good thing about it though is that it is fragrance free which is nice . I would not buy this product again ,	-1
No , I am not a scientist but I am literate . I do n't want products I use to cause me cancer . Fruit of the Earth ? More like , 'they do n't provide health insurance . ' I 'm sure this company hires chemist who could think of more natural ingredients to use . I will NEVER buy this product again , but thanks for encouraging me to grow my own aloe plants . I liked this product , but not some of the ingredients , and I know you can do better .	-1
This product is harsh and very drying . I have very dry mature skin and have found that skin like mine needs to be polished not scrubbed . Pots need to be scrubbed , not skin .	-1
I hate face washes that leave you skin fealing just as oily as it felt before you washed it , which is what this scrub does . I buy scrubs to clean my skin ! This scrub is aweful . Maybe it does the `` anti-wrinkle '' job , but frankly I ca n't stand to use it more than the 3 times I tried , so I will never know . If you like a CLEAN feeling after you wash your face , go with the Clinique Exfoliating Scrub . It works VERY well , and leaves your skin feelign fresh , bare , and clean . I should have known better , if it 's not broken DO N'T FIX IT ! ; )	-1
I am in my late 20s , so please take it into consideration , but I really do n't like this make up remover.OIL-BASEDIt has oil in it ! After a few days taking my mascara off with this product , I got an ugly , huge pimple under my eye . Since it is in the delicate eye skin area , there is not much I can do about it , just wait ... Well , today is a 4th day and it is still far from disappearing : ( If you have oily , combination skin like me , please think twice before you get this oil-based make up remover.EASY TO SPILL / CONTAMINATEOnce you take the cap off , there is nothing to make the & # 34 ; hole & # 34 ; smaller , you just stare right into the bottle . Is that even hygienic ? DOES NOT REMOVE MASCARA EASILY NOR SMOOTHLYI have hard time to remove my Lancome mascara ( regular , not water-resistant ) . It did not feel smooth on my eyes at all . I was more satisfied with a cheap Sephora eye make up remover than this one .	-1
This towel is pretty much useless for the purpose it claims : it will not hold your hair in a towel turban , and it ca n't be used for flopping whatsoever ! I would have asked for a refund if I had n't thrown away the package .	-1
The fibers of this towel do n't agree with my skin or my hair . When I use it on my hair , it is more frizzy etc . I made my own `` towel '' out of t-shirt material , and it works a lot better than this . If you have straight hair , I think this towel would work well , but curly hair is a different story : )	-1
I wanted the microfiber towel but the beauty shop I was in did n't have it , just this head wrap . I tried for a few weeks but could n't get it to work satisfactorily , so I took it back in . The clerk showed me how to use it , though , and I tried again but it still had the problems of it being unwieldy and too tight that others have reported.Trying to make it a towel , I then attempted to remove the elastic , but it 's sewn in , so I just chopped the blasted thing apart and use it as a strange , star-shaped towel .	-1
I bought this towel with the intention of using it turban style to `` plop '' my curly hair and dry it faster . The turban style is hard to accomplish ( it took me several tries to figure out how to make the little rubber band go around the button to make a turban ) and not good for plopping . I use it sideways so I can plop and encourage curl formation . So for curly heads , if you want a microfiber towel , stick with the regular ones . The turbans smush your hair and wo n't really work for plopping unless you use them just as you would a regular t-shirt or microfiber towel.The Diva Dryer does not dry my hair faster , as advertised . I do n't notice any difference when using the Diva Dryer compared to using a plain old men 's t-shirt . Both will absorb excess water ( the t-shirt will feel wetter ) and my hair will not be discernably drier after using the Diva Dryer . Thus , I do n't think this costly towel is worth the money .	-1
This is simply a regular old towel , there 's nothing microfiber about it . It 's big , bulky , and takes a long time to dry vs. real microfiber which is thinner , softer , has some stretch to it , and dries quickly . It also has a strange design , other hair turbans are far easier to use and secure than this , the tab and button do n't work properly . If you want microfiber make sure the material actually feels like microfiber . If you do n't know what microfiber feels like go to a store and feel the difference .	-1
This is a nice idea that doesnt work at all . I bought this to have a small , light , neat way to keep my hair out of the way while using facial masks , bubble baths etc ... but the thing wont stay on your head , it rides up so your hair is exposed , it pulls uncomfortably at the front of your hairline -- it 's pretty useless.Stick to using a towel and save your money .	-1
UPDATE : After posting a question on a forum [ ... ] , I was told how to attach it . The fit was still rather tight , which is odd because my hair is not that long . The towel , which I also bought , fits better.The material wicks away moisture while perserving curls.I just tried it for the first time and could n't hook the button after three or four tries . The towel dries well , but all the struggling to find the button and loop only roughed up my hair , which is exactly what a curly-haired person wants to avoid because it creates frizz . I hope I do n't have to wet my hair all over again.I 'll try a few more times . If things get better , I 'll update my review . If they do n't , back it goes .	-1
The fabric and size of this hair towel is the worst I have ever used . I have at least one of every hair towel on the market from over the years because my hair takes forever to dry so I need to wrap and then blowe dry after awhile of soaking the water out.The size is ridiculous - it squeezes my head so hard it gives me headache in 5 minutes or less-granted my head is sensitive but has never been sensitive to a hair wrap . It 's agony to wear this . The fabric has an awful static quality to it - it sticks to everything , zaps your head or hand with static , collects everything from the dryer , lint , strings , anything it can suck off of other fabrics , it does . But the worst part is that it is rough on your hands . The inside is soft but the outside snags and catches on your hands , or a blankets/pillow case if you lay down , it 's just the worst quality and most expensive hair towel I have found .	-1
This product DOES have a fragrance to it . Additionally , I found it just does n't clean as well as regular soap . I did n't feel clean using this product . I felt as if there was a layer of dirt remaining on my skin and sure enough , using an alcohol prep pad , I was able to rub my arm with the prep pad and it came up dirty and dark . After washing with regular bar soap , the alcohol prep pad comes up clean . I ca n't explain it but I do n't like the results .	-1
I was very excited to try this new Dove Body Wash . I use body washes on a daily basis as part of my showering routine and often have dry skin . The dryness is worse right now for I live on the east coast and this has been a very cold winter thus drier skin . My skin can also be sensitive but it usually happens when something irritates it . I have found a few brands of body wash that I love and get me clean while keeping my body pretty solidly moisturized . This Dove product is advertised as a skin nourishing wash with a new NutriumMoisture technology . I did not have high expectations . I thought it would definitely be as good as the other products I 've been using but could possibly be a great addition for when I need more moisturizing on my skin.From the first try I was not happy with this product . It says it is fragrance free but it has a scent to it that is definitely unpleasant - certainly not a fresh or renewing scent . At first I thought it was just a standard soap sort of smell but with each use it got more bothersome . I used this product for 10 days and I can honestly say it added no moisture at all to my skin . Even a basic body wash does a better job . My skin got drier than its been in months and the product also caused some minor skin irritation . After the tenth day I quickly returned to a reliable body wash and had to apply body moisturizer for a couple of days before my skin returned to normal . In all honesty I have never had a problem like this with any other body wash. And whenever I 've purchased one promising to be a deeper moisturizing formula it always has been . Never has a product dried out my skin like this . I got the sensitive skin formula to be on the safe side and am very glad I did . If this bothered me , imagine what the regular formula may have done . I used to love Dove products but was very disappointed with this body wash .	-1
This Dove `` unscented '' body wash replaces the former Dove Unscented Body Wash in their line . I find that while this one is just as creamy and nourishing as the original , this one has a lot of fragrance in the product despite its claim of being unscented . The old version was truly unscented.Comparing this to the new line of Dove body products , it seems that they have increased the amount of fragrance used in all their new products and this new body wash would seem `` unscented '' by comparison when in reality it should be described as moderately scented.I tried testing this product out on my hands before trying it on my body in case of an allergic reaction , but the scent of this `` unscented '' body wash was so strong that it gave me a headache from just from the residual perfumes on my hand . However , my hands did feel soft and more moisturized.A big thumbs down to Dove for false advertising and for discontinuing their true `` unscented '' bodywash . NOT recommended for those seeking a lightly-scented or fragrance-free product .	-1
Until I did online research , I assumed that the FDA -- the Food & Drug Administration , which regulates food and medical industries for public health and safety -- would have standards for labeling a product `` fragrance free '' or `` unscented . '' But , surprise ! The FDA does NOT regulate those terms after all . `` Fragrance-free '' products can and do include fragrances to mask the smell of other nasty ingredients.Apparently , the convention is for manufacturers to claim a product is `` unscented '' if the manufacturer just covered up the scent of the stinky chemicals ( as Dove did in this case ) . `` Fragrance free '' would further imply that no additional pleasant scent ( like lemon or vanilla ) was added on top . Still , by FDA rules , they do have to list `` fragrance '' in the ingredients if they used ANY fragrance.I myself am not environmentally sensitive , but I have friends who are . I stay far away fromTide HE Original Scent Liquid Laundry Detergent 2 X 50 Fl Oz ( Pack of 2 ) and Bounce 80168BX - Fabric Softener Sheets , 160 Sheets/Box , but I do n't expect this body wash to cause similar , dreadful problems for my friends , because the scent does n't linger . ( The scent is a pleasant , light , baby-powder smell . ) So , while Dove is not breaking any regulations by labeling this body wash `` unscented , '' even though there is fragrance added , they 've let the marketing department mislead and betray their customer base , who has come to expect more transparency from the Dove brand.However , the body wash `` stripped '' my skin too much in the shower , so I used my trusty olive oil bar soap directly afterwards to help restore some of my skin oils.Not Dove 's best effort .	-1
Fragrance is one of the leading ingredients in body care to which people are sensitive . In fact , many people , myself included , that have few other sensitivities are sensitive to fragrance.I read the comments & products review carefully before choosing this product . Even the ingredients listed in the product page do not list fragrance . I bought it even though several of the reviews noted that it was scented . These same reviews appeared on the page for the scented version of the product , so I thought I 'd chance it.Because I have very dry skin , I was excited about a non-scented moisturizing body wash.In fact it smells like plain old Dove soap . The scent was very strong on opening the bottle . IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT `` UNSCENTED '' IS PROCLAIMED ON THE FRONT LABEL . `` Shame on the makers of Dove for pulling this stunt . A truly unscented or fragrance-free version of the body wash would be welcome.Shame on Amazon for allowing them to put misleading information that can affect people 's health on the product page .	-1
I love Dove products , and used them on my children when they were babies . I use Dove now . So I was surprised and disappointed in this product . I know it is for sensitive skin and is hypo-allergenic , therefore , mild . However , this product is so mild that I did not feel clean . This is due to the very light fragrance and thin feel of the soap . I `` know '' it is cleaning me , but I keep using more , just to be sure . No one wants to come out of the shower confused . So , although I believe in this company 's products , I wo n't be buying this one ... .jodie marino nachison , spouse .	-1
Left a bad residue smell on you after you used it . I use dove all the time but forvsome reason this product just left the worst smelk on your body afterwards	-1
I really wanted to like this one . Unfortunately , unlike almost every Dove product that I love , this one leaves a film on my skin that I just do n't like . The formula seems to be just a bit too thick . The smell is good , but the actual use just not up to what I expect from Dove products .	-1
I 'm not into smelly product . Even things like Dove that has a fairly neutral scent . The smell from this product is still on my skin 12 hours later . YUCK -- did not bother my skin at all -- lather was so so ( not overly sudsy however not as strong a lather as I would like ) would have given it 3 or 4 starts except for the lasting scent ... But the scent just annoys me . Feel the need to take another shower with something that wo n't leave a lasting scent .	-1
For allergy suffers , like me , it is imperative that we purchase and use products sold as advertised . Based on the bottle label the Dove Sensitive Skin Nourishing Body Wash is unscented . It is not . If you read the fine print on the bottle label it contains the word Fragrance . To me this means the product contains a fragrance/perfume/scent which means the product is not unscented.As for use : The product smells like Dove soap and it does work . Albeit the product made my eyes water when I used it.If you are not sensitive to fragrances/perfumes/scents you might like this product . For me I will take a pass.I do recommend purchasing and using Cetaphil Restoraderm , Skin Restoring Body Wash , 10-ounce or any of the Cetaphil products . They are truly gentle on the skin.Do not recommend .	-1
I am a big fan of Dove beauty bars . Every ( which is not that many ) dermatologist that I 've run across has suggested them for proper skin care , so there are always bars in our showers.If you used these bars too , you know that they are very mildly scented and generally mild and non-drying to skin . So imagine my surprise when I tried this supposedly gentle wash for sensitive skin and found that it 's not all that gentle . I tried it on my wind-whipped winter skin and found that it made me itchy . In fact , there was a slight burning sensation -- although the burning was on my chapped cheeks . Arms did n't burn , but were itchy.This left me wondering where the moisture was.But the real negative to me was the smell . It was n't mildly scented like the bars , and it certainly was n't unscented . To me it had a very strong , too strong , chemical smell . It was strong enough that I feel compelled to warn people with the kind of asthma that can be 'set off ' by chemical smells to avoid this product.I ca n't recommend it to anyone .	-1
This has a very dry , cotton-y , almost paper-like note that makes me instantly want to vomit when I smell it . I get no fruits , no florals , just the smell of a heated-up dryer sheet that you found mixed in with your clean towels . Far , far too heady and dry for me , which is unfortunate because this frag is so popular and I smell it everywhere I go .	-1
Add this to the files of perfumes almost everyone loves except me . I wish I loved this more than I did , but I just do n't . I love the citrus topnotes that I smell on first sniff , but underneath those there 's this weird musky smell that 's not light and summery at all- more masculine and after-shavey . When wearing this I ended up smelling like a man , and I 'd rather smell this scent on a guy than on me .	-1
This was my second purchase but I 'm not sure if this is original . The smell fades away so fast . I like that comes with a big bottle .	-1
Did n't really like this fragrance at all . A waste of a purchase . I would n't do it again , not even for the price .	-1
I liked this hair dryer at the beginning , It seemed fine . But only for 2 months . After 2 months of using ( only 1 person ) , it stops once in a while - about once a week . Now , it is not on for High , only Low works . It 's been only 2 months and 2 weeks now . But I can not return this one either because the return expired already . Do n't buy this one , I do n't want to pay this much money for 2 months of hair dryer .	-1
This blows hair at a very high power , but for me it just made my hair tangle . I 've had better luck with my ionic hairdryer , which keeps the hair silky and soft . I sort of wish I had n't spent the money on this .	-1
I had a 4-star review up for this dryer . But today I had to change it to a 1-star . It started smoking this morning . I was not doing anything different or unusual . Then it made a noise like the motor was dying . And , then it completely shut down . I checked the lint screen and it was completely clean and debris-free . After an hour cool down period , the BaByliss will still not come back to life . I had to fish my old ( lightweight , but not as strong ) Bespoke Labs T3 out of the cabinet . I hope BaByliss will replace it . If they do - I 'll make sure to update . If there is no update , BaBlyiss did not do right by me.UPDATE -- Conair sent UPS to pick up their defective dryer promising me they would replace it . I was impressed with the customer service at first . Well , they picked it up alright - but they never replaced it . DO N'T BUY IT ! ! !	-1
This blow dryer vibrates terribly in your hand while using and that makes it very uncomfortable . I returned it and got a refund .	-1
Had for less than 6 months and it pooped out . went cold . while i was on vacation ( not cool ) ... . save your money and buy the remington - titanium - that is what i replaced this with	-1
I 've used a lot of irons and my experience with this one was not great . First , it is shorter than it appears to be . If you have a lot of hair , it 's really not long enough . Secondly , the plates caught my hair . Perhaps I just got a bad iron , but I only used it for 5 mins and it pulled out 20-30 strands of hair ! Thirdly , it did n't get nearly hot enough . No where close to 420 degrees . I had to stop using it and plug in my old iron that I had been getting ready to throw away .	-1
I was super excited to try this sunscreen for my young kids and myself as I have been searching for a good chemical-free sunscreen . Well despite the chemical free CLAIM on the front of the bottle just read the label- there 's tons of them in there ! It 's quite expensive and I got burned using it at the beach despite frequent re-application . Seventh generation is the way to go for a truly natural sunscreen !	-1
I will not use this sunscreen but with that said it is unfair to misrepresent facts or not update a review when one knows otherwise . The top reviewer is claiming CONTAINS PARABENS . That is a pure lie and although she/he admits otherwise , she/he still does not change the heading of his/her review . That review is as misleading as this sunscreen mix just because it contains ZO . This mix does not contain parabens , contains ZO which is great but unfortunately the rest of the mix are non-organic unwanted ingredients.Active Ingredients ; Titanium Dioxide5 % , Zinc Oxide10 % Inactive Ingredients ; C12 15 Alkyl Benzoate , Caprylyl Glycol , Cetyl Dimethicone Copolymer , Chlorphenisen , Beeswax , Disodium EDTA , Ethylhexyl Palmitate , Ethylhexyl Stearate , Hexyl Laurate , Hydrogenated Castor Oil , Methyl Glucose Dioleate , Octododecyl Neopentanoate , PEG 25 Hydrogenated Castor Oil , Phenoxyethanol , Polyglyceryl-4 Isostearate , Propanediol , Purified Water , Sorbitan Oleate , Stearic Acid , Tocopheryl Acetate ( Vitamin E ) , Trimethylated Silica/Dimethicone , VP Hexadecene CopolymerWhy add chemicals when the purpose of the sunscreen is to protect one from harm . To add salt to the injury , this a company where their CEO goes around Hawaii 's kindergartens in the name of educating kids about sunscreen while promoting Blue Lizard but yet Blue Lizard would not disclose ingredients of their sunscreens on their website at all . Someone in Hawaii 's government is surly enjoying the fruits of his/her work alright . I wonder why anyone in Hawaii has never addressed this issue ... READ INGREDIENTS . THE HIGHER THE ZINC , THE MORE PROTECTION.Zinc Oxide is a physical sunscreen rather than a chemical one , blocks both UVA ( 320-400 nm ) and UVB ( 280-320 nm ) rays of ultraviolet light . Chemical sunscreens are less effective and carry unnecessary health risks . ZO is insoluble in water , used in many industries , in ointments , creams and lotions . Non-irritating , non-allergenic and non-comedogenic , used by athletes as a bandage to prevent soft tissue damage during workouts . ZO must be NON NANO / UNCOATED UPS -2 ZO which has a mean particle size greater than 30nm , when applied to the skin do not get absorbed into the body , do not enter the bloodstream , and are not a threat to human health.SPF is a measure of how much longer someone will be protected from UVB rays than someone wearing no cream . If the sun reddens unprotected skin in ten minutes , for example , a person wearing SPF15 can be exposed to the sun without reddening for 15 times longer - 150 minutes . While UVB rays are behind the redness of sunburn , UVA rays damage the skin 's DNA at a deeper layer . Both radiation types can cause skin cancer . The EU recommendation is for sunscreens to offer a UVA protection factor that is a third of their SPF.I make my own sunscreen as well as I purchase sunscreen for times when I do not have time to make any since I need to surf . For that reason , when I purchase a sunscreen mix , I need the same formula as I use when I make my own organic sunscreen mix since it only requires few ingredients but for more protection like my nose , I bump the zinc . Zinc is what you see surfers put on their nose for protection . The more zinc , the more protection but it means a mix that is more like a mud since zinc is a powder that I purchase and add to VCO.Blue Lizard Baby- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Chemical-Free- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- 10 % Zinc Oxide ; 5 % Titanium DioxideBlue Lizard Face- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- Oil-Free- 8 % Zinc OxideBlue Lizard Sensitive- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Chemical-Free- Paraben-Free- Fragrance-Free- 10 % Zinc Oxide ; 5 % Titanium DioxideBlue Lizard Sport- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Very Water Resistant- 6 % Zinc OxideBlue Lizard Regular- SPF 30+- Broad Spectrum UVA/UVB Protection- Very Water Resistant- 6 % Zinc OxideThere is a reason why sunscreen companies do not provide any images of the labeling since that will disclose the active and inactive ingredients . The inactive ingredients are extensive in Blue Lizard , check their Internet site but more importantly compare the cost of any sunscreen to better brands with hardly any ingredients except few organic and a very high amount of zinc like 18 % zinc not 5 % or 10 % zinc . Blue Lizard 's ingredients vary so much from their Face mix to the Original mix to the Baby mix since they offer more additives , less zinc with noticeable price fluctuation . Cancer does not differentiate face skin or leg skin , it is all the same so why apply anything that has less protection to different part of the body . Ingredients get soaked in regardless of the skin location so compare ingredients since it is like consuming those ingredients when applied to the skin . A good organic 3oz 18 % zinc mix should not cost more than $ 13 and for less when on sale . I get lots more when I make my own , much , much more and I get to control the zinc percentage in the mix as well .	-1
Not impressed with it at all . It did n't really deliver a shine and seemed like it was full of alcohol rendering the hair dry and harsh .	-1
My order took a little too long to come , so I went a picked this up at Ulta before it arrived . I have to say that I did not get the results that everyone else here claims . First , the smell was too strong and like pure alcohol . It felt like I was spraying hair spray in my hair . I used with the Rusk flat iron I ordered ( which got returned ) , and my hair felt stiff , hard , and dry . Unfortunately , I ca n't return this because its a flammable product so I guess it 'll add to my collection of unusable products .	-1
I really want a product to tame the frizzy hair , I thought this product would make it and I was totally wrong . If you are a person who always use hot tools to tame the frizz , and style your hair , then this is a good product for you . I have curly hair , very frizzy , but I really want something to help me with the frizz without the need of hot tools , I do n't like to use them , my hair is already dry and coarse , so this product is not even close to what I was looking for . I should saved that money and buy again Hair Milk from Carol 's Daughter , that 's the product that really makes my day in a humid day , this experience would teach me to do n't look for something new , when the old stuff works perfectly fine . I wo n't buy it again .	-1
I 'll be honest - I only bought this because my favorite perfume does n't have a conventional cap and could not use it with my Travalo . I thought this would be a good alternative because I could spray it directly into the glass bottle and take it with me . The first day I got this I loved it . It was so easy to use and it seemed to be secure . However , after a couple of days it started to leak in my purse . At first I was n't sure if it was because I had n't screwed it on tight enough , but when I went to unscrew it I noticed it was definitely tightened as much as it could go . I have no idea how this leaked , since it seemed to be secure , but it did and I was n't happy to see that my expensive perfume was totally wasted . At least two good things came out of this : ( 1 ) Luckily I did n't fill it up completely in the first place specifically for the purpose of having leaky atomizers in the past ( lesson learned ) and ( 2 ) at least my handbag smells good ! : /	-1
Very hard to open for filling . Once filled I took it on a trip , and carefully sealed it in a ziplock bag . Perfume was completely evaporated by the time I arrived . Junk . Too large also .	-1
these things are pretty monstrous . I have n't even used them yet because they hold wayyyy too much perfume . I ended up ordering another set that came with 5 , and they 're much smaller . This set is fit more for if you wan na pack ONE perfume for like several days in one bottle . I 'm more the kinda person who carries a few different perfumes at a time.Would n't recommend unless you use the same perfume everyday .	-1
First of all , before this product even arrived , the company started emailing me asking me to review it IF I liked it . Two more such requests came by email during the following two weeks , during which time the product arrived . What an atrocious practice that is.I 've used this now for six months or more , and there is no improvement to my dry hair at all . As far as a facial spray , it 's pleasant enough to use and provides a little dewiness for a short time . I do not live in a dry climate at all - just the opposite . I do n't think there 's enough NaPCA in it to do any good.This was a waste of money , the company was obnoxious , and I would not buy it again nor recommend it to anyone .	-1
I am sorry but this did not work for me . I am African American with super oily skin . I have tried Cliniques ' Pore Perfecter & it works great with controlling shine & blurring pores ! ! !	-1
I ordered OC8 in the past , the picture shown above is the one I got previously and that one worked great . Although it did n't last 8 hours it lasted a good hour or 2 and left my face matte not shiny . However when I ordered this through Amazon , I got the newer version , not pictured above . That one does not work at all ! It leaves my skin slick and shiny and does not matte at all . Not sure if I was sent a fake one or not but it did not work .	-1
I bought this based on the success reported by other reviewers . Sadly this did not get rid of razor bumps for me , it stings , and clogged a pour that ended up requiring a doctor 's care . Best of luck to other purchasers , but I will not be buying this product again .	-1
I picked up this product at a store that I work at and was pretty excited to try something that might actually work . See , I have razor and ingrown hairs all over my legs and being a girl ... . well lets just say it not nice to the touch . I 've just used up my first bottle . I still have dark spots , none of that improved ( perhaps it would work better on the face ? ) . It helped my ingrown hairs some , however I still had a significant amount . I 've so far tried everything from AHA to glycolic on my legs after I 've shaved and so far no luck . I 've just ordered tend skin ... so I have my fingers crossed .	-1
10 years ago , I started to wax my bikini area and always used Tend Skin to prevent ingrowns . I never had to worry about ingrowns . Three months ago , as I was looking for good deals for Tend Skin , I came across Princereigns on Amazon and read all the positive reviews . Most people seemed to have a positive outcome , plus it was gentle and had pleasant smell . I thought `` ca n't go wrong , I 'll try it out . '' I was never unhappy with Tend Skin but it did dry out my skin so I was open to trying something new and Princereigns seemed promising . Girl , was I wrong ! ! ! I did n't know how great Tend Skin was in preventing ingrowns until I stopped using it and started to use Princereigns . I gave Princereigns three months to redeem itself ... that was too long ! ! ! I was way too optimistic . Currently , I have so many bumps and ingrowns , it 's too embarrassing to wear a bikini bottom ! I have never had so many ingrown hair in my life . I just received Tend Skin in the mail , and hopefully , it 'll help my waxed area clear up before I take my vacation in 3 weeks . I 'll be sure to use extra moisturizing lotion when I use Tend Skin . I 'm never going to use Princereigns - I wish there was a money back guarantee . Even my husband who uses Tend Skin on his face got more ingrowns while using Princereigns . I wonder if you 're better off not using anything at all than to use Princereigns ( to save money ! )	-1
I am a big fan of the PCA line , it has been the only thing to work on my adult acne ( mainly the A & c ; serum , BPO cleanser and nutrient toner ) . However , I have been using this product for over a month and I do not see any change on the lines under my eyes . I am so used to having fast results with their products that I expected to see some kind of change after the first month . What I can say about this product is that as small as it is I still have A LOT left , PCA products can be expensive but they do last a long time . I will write another review on my third or fourth month.UPDATE I am a big fan of PCA skin products and I had to update this review because I really believe I was sold an expired toner and other PCA products . I stopped buying PCA products on amazon after comparing them to the ones I bought with my dermatologist or @ skinstore.com . I noticed that while everything was the same the expiration dates on the products I bought on amazon where different and where able to come off . Sadly I ca n't remember the vendor but there must be a reason why they are cheaper here when other sites like dermstore.com or skinstore.com will not even give a small discount on PCA products ( PCA products are always excluded from promotions ) .The A & C ; serum I bought came in the old container that had a defective pump if you buy this serum on other skin care sites they have the newer ( better quality ) container which is a bit taller and has a better pump.With that said choose the vendor carefully .	-1
I ordered this product for my sister because she has a Machete . I ordered it under the assumption that it would be brand new , especially since it says it comes with a one year manufacturers warranty . Once I received the product though I found that it had not only been opened , but that it had been used . I did not pay for a used product ! I paid for a new one . So I 'm very upset to say the least , it would be great if had n't already been used by someone else.I would highly advise against ordering from them . I would rather go to the Knife Guys in the mall than order from this seller again , and I hate the mall .	-1
I had worked with marcel irons before so I decided to try this one by Hot Tools . Cool color but difficult to control . Curls did not last . Tip too hot to the touch so unable to use the assistance of other hand to control curl on the iron . Handle is marcel so it swivels and constantly moving . Just too awkward to keep so I had to return it . Make sure you are almost a pro at working with marcel handles before purchasing this iron .	-1
Love marcel irons , but this was clumsy . Good company and product , but not for me for adding more define curls to my natural long waves . Still looking for that perfect tool that gets results fast with no long time effort .	-1
More money wasted on a product that claims to reduce the under eye puffiness and dark cirles . Tried the product for over 3 months morning and night , it did not work .	-1
I really tried to love this & # 8230 ; but could n't . It gives my under eye area a uncomfortable tingle , makes me tear up and cry-and I do n't have sensitive skin . Nor have i ever had this issue with any other under eye gel . I 'm sorry it did n't work , but love the little jar . I use it to make homemade eye cream in .	-1
I have always had long natural nails and recently 3 nails split and were catching of everything driving me crazy . Saw this product and did n't realize there were stages as in # 1 , # 2 and # 2 Plus , # 3 etc . so on and so forth . I order # 2 formula PLUS . Just staring using it and within 3 days my got worse , the were peeling right straight across and leaving ungodly lumps . I then read the directions and realize I purchased the incorrect product Plus 2 should have been used for first time users . I should have ordered Forumla 2 period and forget the PLUS business . I had to go back to that thick stuff Sally Hansen SELLS call 'hard as wraps'.Please read the direction for Nailtique before you purchase this product and do n't make the stupid mistake I did.People just see the reviews and jumps to buy nailtique , the descrptions should stipulate more boldly which is the starter bottle - when you first see this product , they all look alike . Hope this helps new people .	-1
My experience with this product was very disappointing . It does not last -- chipping off the next day ! And it made no noticeable difference in my nails . I would not recommend .	-1
I have been using Nailtiques faithfully for over a month ... ..WHY does it peel ? ? ? Everyday I have to remove & start all over again . I have purchased all the proper products to enhance it 's performance . Yes , my nails grow but are peeling a lot ! There has to be a secret to why this is happening . I do wash & dry my nail & go by the book for application.Anybody have any answers ? ? ? I am not pleased at all w/this product.I have now switched to `` PINK GEL COAT . '' Not peeling , is a thicker product . It is `` gel '' so it does allow nails to be protected . I shall now try & compare .	-1
Not for dry or sensitive skin - much too harsh , strips the skin of natural oils leaving it parched and tight , which is sometimes a good thing , but this cleanser is much to strong for dry/sensitive skin .	-1
I love Shea butter , however I am heart broken that this product did not work for me . Yes it did moisturize and detangled my curly thick hair , but at the price of having dandruff the next day . I really really wanted this product to work , but unforgivably my scalp was not having it . I have many other Shea butter items in my hair regime so I was completely surprised how I had so much dandruff with this product . ( This has nothing to do with the seller..my item came perfectly fine . )	-1
Made my hair feel worse leaving it in . Even with using the slightest amount . I did n't care for the smell either .	-1
A lot of people love this as a leave in , but it did n't really do much for me . It seems to be too thick , and it seems like I have to use more than I would like .	-1
I had high hopes for this as shea butter is so moisturizing , but it is so heavy it is unusable . Very disappointing .	-1
There is nothing special about this conditioner . You might as well use mayonaise in your hair . This product is not necessary for anyone .	-1
I was a little skeptical of the reviews that said the smell was too strong for this hair conditioner because it had so many other good reviews ; however , if you dislike scented hand creams , do not purchase this product . It seriously gave me a headache because the smell is so strong ! Flowery sweet smell ' yikes ! On the other hand , if you like strong flowery smells this product could be just for you .	-1
I do n't get all the hype surrounding this primer . It really did n't do anything for me . I recommend Urban Decay or Too Faced primer instead .	-1
great primer ... But that 's it . No coverage at all.. And it smells like paint thinner . If u have $ 50 to blow on a primer buy this ... But you sure as heck can find a ( just as good ) primer for a third or fourth of the cost of this product . Wo n't be purchasing again .	-1
I purchased this with the thickening spray ( see my other review on that ! ) as it advertised like a light conditioner for fine hair that does not need heavy , weighty conditioner . I also was lured that it could be used the day after you wash your hair to prep it up a bit . It really does n't do anything but become somewhat gummy . Wasted $ $ $ $ $ again !	-1
Ah , not as great as the kerastase products , albeit significantly cheaper . Makes my hair sticky when it 's humid outside .	-1
I do n't notice any difference in my hair or styling when using this product . This has been disappointing for the price .	-1
I do n't know if it is just me but I think this product smells a little like a wet dog . the smell really turned me off but it also made my hair sticky and tacky feeling . I have n't used it before this so I am wondering if it is expired or a bad batch ?	-1
Seaweed conditioner is good but the lotion is not all that good . I read the ingredients on the bottle I bought . Rosemary and other herbs was listed first . So I thought it would be ok for me spray more . It appears to me that the makers of this product kept the acrylics and alcohols hidden from in its contents . My hair felt stiff with less shine .	-1
This shampoo is pricey , and it has some fragrance I could live without , but it does clean product buildup out of hair . My hair is fine , and I must use some product to style it . Of course , eventually product starts weighing my hair down . Then I need to use a clarifying shampoo . In the past I 've used Suave , but I ca n't find their clarifying shampoo locally any more , so I had to try something else.Sunday Shampoo works . I only need one wash , no repeat , just like it says on the label . Now I can get my hair back to fluffy again . I use this only occasionally , so it 's going to last a very long time.Four stars , because it costs too much , but I do recommend it.Update : Now two stars because the price is over $ 30 per bottle . I would not recommend any shampoo at that price !	-1
I bought this conditioner because I had used the shampoo and liked the smell . Usually conditioners are life savers , they create a manageable soft head of hair rather than a tangled mess . This conditioner , however , did not deliver . After using it , my hair was still tangled and felt like it had nothing on it . Yes , it smells nice , but like another reviewer mentioned , I prefer a product that does what it says . My hair is not fine but I do use color and used this because it was supposed to be good for treated hair . No thanks . I got better results from John Frieda ... .at a much lower price . These BB products are way overpriced for the quality .	-1
I used Bumble and Bumble Thickening Spray for years to provide volume for my thin hair and turned several people on to the product . Then they changed the formula to Bumble and Bumble Thickening HAIR Spray . The new product not only does n't provide volume ; it smell and feels icky and mats my hair down . Bummer .	-1
After having read all the positive reviews , I was expecting really a lot . But no matter how much I tried , I was never satisfied the result . If I apply very little of it , there is no difference . If I put a bit more - it right away makes my hair greasy and gives it a dirty look . I experimented at least 10 times : both following the complicated instructions ( curling hair around the finger ! ) and just leaving them dry free , and was never happy with the way they looked after drying.ADVICE : I was recently on a trip to Turkey , and got there a wonderful spa treatment , a part of which was they just massaged some natural oils into my scalp and told me to leave the hair oily for a while . The next day , after I simply shampooed my curly ( usually quite frizzy ) hair and let it dry on its own , it looked truly wonderful - silky , shiny , soft , and very lively ! No product I ever tried could do the same ! So I browsed a bit for `` HAIR OILING '' , and for the last month have been regularly massaging some natural oils onto my scalp 1-2 times a week before going to bed , and shampooing the following morning . My hair has never looked that beautiful ! And I do n't need expensive conditioners any more ! And they say that a simple natural soap actually works the best . Much cheaper than $ 60/set for shampoo+conditioner , very healthy and very effective . I vary the oils I use : jojoba , coconut , olive , soybean - all with great results . This is how people have been treating their hair for centuries before the cosmetics industry realized that there is a profit opportunity in creating hundreds of the products ( none of which is properly tested ) . Anyway , I do n't want to be pushy , but I thought that if you thinking of buying Curl Concious products , you may consider natural oils instead , and may be you will benefit from them as much as I did.ADVICE 2 : In my pursuit of natural hair care , I recently came across another great advice for having silky and shiny hair . After shampooing ( no conditioner ) , rinse your hair with lemon juice mixed with water ( 1 lemon + 1-1.5 cups of water ) . Apparently , it removes all the soap residues that are left on our hair after soaps/shampoos , which harden our hair and make it bushy . They say a mix of vinegar with water has the same effect , and that it 's better to use vinegar on dark while lemon on blond hair . But I am afraid of the vinegary smell , so I have tried lemon only ( though it 's perhaps more expensive than vinegar ) . It works like magic ! After the very first time my hair were silkier and livelier than I ever remember it . If you want to learn more - browse for VINEGAR or LEMON RINSE .	-1
Im a great fan of all kerastase hair products and normally almost all of them are awesome . This is just regular , not so intensive , i could definitely get a better kerastase product for this money , not worth it .	-1
I have been using the Kerastase line for about 5 years . Normally my hair feels conditioned just after using this shampoo . I used the shampoo today and it was like putting dollar store shampoo in my hair . Buy the product , just not from this distributor .	-1
horrible ... .just horrible . does not take the knots out of your hair and does not make your hair smooth . The worst I have ever tried .	-1
This was runny , and smelled funky . It did not do anything for my hair . I was new to B & B , and this was recommended to me . I tried it and used it twice , I just could n't get used to it . The smell , the texture , the way my hair felt and smelled after . Hmmm , not a good decision on my part .	-1
This conditioner is HORRINBLE . You have to use a ton and even after your hair is like starw . I ahve very healthy hair BUT after using this my hair looks disgusting	-1
I have been purchasing this Bumble & Bumble hair tonic from a local salon and using it for a couple of years . I would give the product based on that experience 5 stars , but based on this Amazon purchase , I give it 2 stars . I wo n't go so far as to call this an `` imposter '' like another reviewer , but I do agree it is different . It still works ok for my purposes : like other reviewers I have fine straight hair , and this product works better than water to refresh my hair between washings . I spray lightly all over my bed-head , brush it out , and then blow dry . However , I used to be able to go 2 days without washing , but with this Amazon bottle , I can only go one day before my hair starts to look greasy . Also , one of the main reasons I first bought this product was the scent . My salon bottles always had a strong , delightful , minty , tea tree scent that made me feel invigorated and happy . The bottle I purchased from Amazon has a faint scent that is medicinal and vaguely offensive like formaldehyde . I had a bottle with a little left over from a salon purchase , and I compared it with the Amazon bottle . The bottles and labels are very similar , but not identical . Further , the Amazon bottle is not as `` milky '' looking , and once shaken has a perma-froth on top , whereas the salon product 's froth soon dissolves . This may all be due to normal manufacturing differences ... or perhaps the Amazon product is older or was left in storage with temperature extremes that changed the emulsion properties or broke down the essential oils . Just speculating , but do be aware of the potential differences if you choose to purchase this product from Amazon . **Update : I decided to get another bottle from a salon and not use what I bought from Amazon . I 'm back in my former B & B Hair Tonic bliss ... The owner said that ( rumor alert ) salons that are going out of business will sell their overstock to resellers , and you can end up with old bottles that are way past their expiration date . I do n't know if that 's the case here , but it could explain it .	-1
One more over-rated and over priced Kerastase product . Again , ... one can get the same results w/a much , much less expensive product . When something is suppose to add volume , ..I expect to see REAL volume ! I know it ca n't do miracles , ..but dont hype it up and price it up when it does just a mediocre job at best .	-1
If I could give this 0 stars I would . I have thin blond hair and when I first started using this I had good results and told my sister she had to buy a bottle too . Half way through the bottle I started to have MAJOR breakage . My hair became so brittle I had flyaways all over the place from the breaking . The exact same thing happened to my sister 's hair and she 's not happy with me as you can imagine . If you want to risk your hair go for it but I wish someone had let me know about the damage this shampoo causes before I bought it . I started using Avalon Biotin thickening shampoo after I tossed this product out . Not only is it less expensive but my hair is finally starting to get healthy again and growing back . Save yourself from damaging your hair and go with the natural Biotin .	-1
I bought this product about a month ago after reading about it in a few magazines as a wonder product . The marketing buzz was the wonder , not the product . It leaves my hair feeling 'crisp ' rather than soft even when I blow dry . My stylist recently recommended Moroccan Oil and used it before a blow-out . Loved the way my hair looked and felt after that product . I 'd recommend it or a few other cheaper products over this one . Feels gloppy out of the bottle and stiff on the hair . Too bad I wasted $ 20 on it .	-1
I always cream my hair before blow drying it . I lovr Bumble and Bumble 's shampoo and conditioner but I was deeply dissatisfied with the styling cream . I would much rather use a drug store styling cream brand . I have very long hair and I only need to use a dime of this styling cream because it is so greasy .	-1
I do n't know what I '' m going to do . Why did they change it ? I 've been using it for years and years , there 's nothing else like it , and now it does n't do what it used to . I emailed the company and asked why they changed it . It does n't do anything at all for me now . I end up mixing it with some gel from the drugstore - just is n't the same . Bleh .	-1
I generally really like Bumble and Bumble product . I thought this would be the grooming creme with a little extra hold -- it is NOT . While also a creme , this one is stickier and actually holds up less on my short , textured ( male ) hair . I do not like/recommend this product . In fact , I just saw it at a retail store for $ 6 ( YES , SIX ) and passed on it .	-1
I read a lot of good reviews , so I decided to give it a try . It does n't seem to work that great for my hair . I have curly/wavy shoulder length hair so I thought it 'd be good . It just does n't do much for it . It 's pretty expensive too . It may just be my hair type , but I wo n't be purchasing it again .	-1
To say that I have fine , stick-straight hair would be insulting to the stick . It takes me forever to work some blow-dryer magic in the morning to get my hair to a point where I am not ashamed to leave the house . If I do n't do that , it remains plastered to the sides of my face , a pathetic , limp , and lifeless disaster . Enter Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray . I have had mixed luck with B & B haircare products in the past , but I thought I 'd give this stuff a try . I have tried using this spray various ways : applying it to shower-fresh wet hair and letting it air dry , and also using it to prep my hair before blow-drying and styling . I can honestly say that I noticed absolutely no difference in my hair whatsoever after using this product . It was a major waste of $ 25 . I 've read other reviews and I do n't understand why people claim this stuff is so great . Most of the five-star reviews come from people who already claim to have wavy hair , or who use this spray as the first step in a 50-step process . Well , if I sprayed this on my hair , blow-dryed it , curled it , teased it , and applied some other styling products , I bet I 'd have beachy waves , too ... and still would have wasted $ 25 and several extra minutes of time during the styling process . Bottom line , if you have hair like mine , I suggest avoiding this product .	-1
For far less money I could have bought a cheaper & # 34 ; beach wave & # 34 ; product . This had high reviews in a magazine I read . I bought this to use on my daughters long straight hair . Followed the directions to a T ... .either wet or dry you have to use so much product is is absurd . The waves even using a diffuser did not stay in sadly . There are others on the market that do work and a MUCh cheaper ! I would not waste my money .	-1
This shampoo does n't really smooth hair and I found it to over-strip hair of oils leaving hair with excessive static electricity : not exactly the greatest attribute . There are many smoothing products on the market and this one is far from good .	-1
Left my hair frizzier than ever . It 's like the moisture has been sucked out . i bought all three parts of the set to make sure it 'd work as advertised and the results were comparable to herbal essence . Regret significantly .	-1
If your hair is curly or dry , this is NOT the product for you . `` Use sparingly '' my eye ... I would need to use 1/4 of the tube to get anything close to the effect I thought I 'd get from this product . Using this creme is pretty much the equivalent of misting your hair with a non-sticky shine spray . It does n't do ANYTHING else : no hold , no separation , no style or texture at all . It does provide a neat sheen , but if I 'm going to pay this much for shine and shine alone , I 'd expect much more shine than this delivers . I even got FRIZZ after I used this . Not at all what I was looking for . The only redeeming quality is the smell : it smells divine , like a tropical flower garden . However , I do not want to pay $ 10+/oz for frizzy-yet-flowery hair . Sorry B & B ; , but this is ridiculous.If you 're looking for something to give your hair texture , light hold , and a satiny look , go with B & B ; 's Grooming Creme . Now THERE 'S a product that actually works . I would ONLY recommend Brilliantine if you have very short hair and simply want a shiny 'do with no strings attached . Long haired folks , save your money !	-1
Well , gee , I wish I would have gotten it . But I still have not , nor have I received a response from the company I purchased it from .	-1
Ok , Glamazons , you know I do n't lie when it comes to products and that I do not get paid by any company for reviews good or bad . With that being said , do not spend your money here . One of the first five ingredients in this shampoo is Sodium Laurel Sulphate . Not only does it act like a harsh detergent , it strips your color . On a good note , this shampoo does contain protein . You do not want to use it long term if you 're gon na go ahead and buy it . It will start to do the opposite and your hair will start to break . If you 're looking for a great line that was developed for really damaged hair , try de'Cinque Science . You have to buy it from a professional , but you will get miraculous results . You can also buy Aphogee from Sally 's and do it yourself , but , read the directions on the bottle carefully before you do . In all honesty , I used to use this shampoo before I became a professional product ingredient specialist . I did n't understand why it stopped working after about three weeks of using it . It was because I had too much protein built up in my hair . My color was fading fast as well and I was doing my color every 2 weeks . Not kidding . This line is owned by Loreal btw.xoxoxoLicensed Beauty Pro	-1
I do n't like it . The system is so so but the wax that comes in it is 4 thumbs down . Cheap cheap wax that does n't harden enough to pull the hair out evenly and cleanly . It turned out to be a big gooey sticky mess ! The wax does not remove easy from skin and basically has to wear itself off your skin due to the fact that its gooey and removes nothing . The warmer and everything else seems to work fine but you may want to purchase a better quality wax .	-1
I have been using Aztec healing clay for about a year and really liked the results , so I thought I would give the Red Clay Powder a shot , and perhaps end up alternating the two . I applied the mask , and left it on for fifteen minutes . After washing it off , I noticed it really dried my face , and I will mention that I do not have sensitive skin . This led to a reduction of time the second time I used it , but I experienced the same dryness . The third time was n't a charm . It caused me to breakout , when I am not prone to acne . Needless to say , I threw the remaining powder away .	-1
Maybe my skin was just dry , but it made my skin hurt really bad , like it was burning . My face was red for a minute or two after I took it off ! but there was n't really a . Difference in my skin . I just used water , too . And I do n't really have sensitive skin either	-1
I tried this product because I had seen a review for it and was out of my powder . The upside to this powder is that I only paid $ 8 something for it . In this case it 's definitely you get what you pay for.Out of the shipping box the powder was everywhere . There was still the majority of the powder left so far so good . I used the powder only to find that it does n't apply well . I 've never had a powder settle in some of my fine lines but this one does . It does have a smell although it 's not terrible . There are much better products out there .	-1
I bought this for slight acne on my chin because I was sick of using the liquid concealers and decided to try it . It smells bad , makes it look like you have dust on your face , did n't hide any acne , and the powder gets everywhere , on the floor , on your hands , etc . I wo n't complain about liquid concealers after trying this anymore .	-1
when i got this i got glue remover instead and i had to pay like 10 dollars for everything to ship it back for a refund of like 6 dollars	-1
OK , this product held the tracks so so , however I did not find it to be any better than the standard black glue that you can buy at any beauty supply store ! I recommend these 2 products which I purchased at Amazon ( c-22 citrus solvent for removing tracks , glues etc . Salon Pro 30 second glue # 02416 , excellent glue and is does not clog inside the bottle as the standard beauty supply kind does ! It is a synch to pour this glue onto the track.Liquid Gold glue is cool as far as the brush ability however it is extremely messy . As you replace the brush inside the bottle , some of the glue drips stringy strings of the gooey glue onto your hands , sink or perhaps floor if you are not quick to put the cap on . This product is very difficult to remove from surface and hands . The standard black up simply rubs off between your fingers without adding any other product to enhance the removal process and washes out of the hair pretty quickly with little to no remanding residue.I chose this product because I thought it was a better feature as it offers a brush . The sticky drips and mess that it makes is NOT worth the effort . After one application I threw the bottle out . Once I removed my 2 tracks I had to not only use the solvent that I recommend but once my hair dried I found that much of the glue was still in my natural hair ! It was difficult removing because I had already wrapped and dried my hair . Needless to say I almost combed chunks of my natural hair out because I did not know the residue of this glue remained ! Try the 2 products that I suggested , one will easily remove glue track etc and the other holds tracks nicely and is a breeze removing from counters , skin and hair .	-1
I was surprised when I received this and all of the bottles were liquid . ( I had used another brand which is a gel and which sticks to the hairs much better . ) and , if you do n't cover everything around the brow with petroleum jelly , the surrounding skin will stain . there is a stain remover , but it often does n't get all of the stain off of the skin.I just did it this afternoon and one brow came out looking good , and the other brow has stains around it , even after using the stain remover.they also give you wood sticks to use and tell you to put cotton at the end of them . have n't they heard of q-tips ? I wo n't buy this again . while once you dye the brows it can look good , it is too cumbersome . its like they have n't changed this product since 1950 or something . they could make it a gel , which would make it much easier to use . I 'm going to try the Godefrey eyebrow tint , as from reading the reviews , it seems easier to use.update : 18 or so hours have passed since I dyed the brows , and my skin is still stained , even after using the stain remover again . WILL NEVER USE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN .	-1
Just did n't work . Spent all day reapplying it ( six times in all ) and I ca n't see any difference ... nada ... zilch ... zip . I have med brown hair & lashes ; and was hoping to skip mascara for awhile ... sigh..it was too good to be true . Maybe this would work better on light lashes ? Roux Lash & Brow Tint Black 1.5 oz .	-1
I was not keen on ordering this product , however , the company that I wanted that is not on Amazon would not be delivered within the amount of time that I needed it . So , I had no choice . But , I also figured that as it would do the job , then I would be more than satisfied and perhaps continue to order this product.When I received the product I read through the manual and I already made up in my mind , that I did not like the idea of it coming within a liquid form . The products are well organized and labeled in addition to having simple instructions that anyone can do . However , I was n't too pleased with the application process , which tends to drip if your not careful . Anything liquid tends to put a little fear in me , as there is always that risk that it can leak in the clients eyes.It does come with & # 34 ; toothpick & # 34 ; applicators , which I do n't find helpful nor productive . The eye pads are too small for most eyes and with both applicator and eye pads , you just end up getting frustrated and using whatever you can to get the product on in the most affective way.The final result ... partially colored , time consuming , messy and risky .	-1
I decided to ignore the other reviewers . Bad idea . This product is expensive garbage . It 's messy and complicated and more importantly , it really does n't work . Using identical process , I wound up with one eye dyed and one eye much less dyed , I looked like Petey the dog . The only good news is that it all wore off within a few days . SAVE YOUR MONEY !	-1
Do n't waste your money . This stick does n't cover very well . I thought this would be a soft , creamy stick that would be easy to apply , but it is hard and difficult to work with . You need to wet it first , then it is a struggle to get the color on your hair . You need to press very hard ; it hurts your hair . I 'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because the color does get on your hair so I ca n't say it does n't work at all . There are better products out there . Try the ones that come in a tube with a wand . There are a few different brands of the liquid type on Amazon . Buy those instead , they are all good .	-1
So I 'm starting to have silver hair at my temples , which drives me crazy . They are very thin hairs . This is a giant waxy crayon that you wet and rub on the gray hairs , but for my temples that means the skin under the hairs also turns orange - a dead give-away that it 's been colored . Also it 's a light orange , so it 's not quite bright silver but it definitely does n't math my auburn hair . I tried rubbing it on my fingers and then just running my fingers over the hairs directly but it did n't cover the silver at all that way . So this is not for me . Maybe it 's better for parts near the back of the head .	-1
This product is messy - you would n't think so being in a stick form and all ... It also looks very fake . It has a very opaque , matte finish - kind of like shoe polish . Since my gray hairs are at my front hairline , I need something more natural looking . But I would n't recommend this to anyone because of the overall poor quality .	-1
Terrible product . No improvement in over 30 years or so.Product still stinks to high heaven , has no easy application method and will still stain your towels a nice purple if it gets on them.Product result is unremarkable . Odor is still in your hair after it dries.There are much better shampoo in products on the market today to enhance our lovely gray hair . Amazon sold this and sells the shampoos also I believe . Shimmer Lights shampoo ( even have generic ) is the best product for your money.Can also use this Roux product to brighten blonde highlights etc .	-1
I was trying to get the brass out of my bleach blond and perhaps even get it a bit grey . This is not the way to do it . Forget those YouTube videos . This wo n't get you nice blonde hair and it definitely wo n't get you grey hair over a blonde bleach-out . And it smells bad and is super runny .	-1
I have somewhat oily skin . Thought I would give this a try instead of my normal mineral powder , Everyday minerals . I knew it would be lighter but thought I 'd try . It was just simply not enough coverage to help even out my skin tone . For me , it really did n't help smooth out fine lines at all . I found it to be VERY drying on my face and that 's saying alot since I have an oily T zone area . I liked the smell : ) but that was about it . I 'm returning mine.Update : Well ended up using mine as a `` setting '' powder for my concealer under my eyes and chin . Works great for it . I then put on my mineral powder on top . Helps keep the concealer from fading away .	-1
I was surprised to discover that this product , a lotion advertised for sensitive skin , contained fragrance . I bought it for my daughter , whose skin becomes broken and itchy when the weather turns cold . After a minute or two , she started to cry and begged me to get it off of her . I wiped it off with a wet towel . Then I tried it on myself . It hurt my mildly irritated skin as well . It also STINKS . It is not a nice fragrance -- it does n't add to the product 's sensory appeal in any way -- and it is detrimental to my family 's skin .	-1
I have mature skin and am sensitive to ingredients and occasionally have rosacea . Due to a bad reaction with a product with SPF ingredient Oxybenzone , my face was having a bad Contact Dermatitis reaction . I came to Amazon to read reviews and pick a safe product to use while I was so irritated . I settled on this item and onCarapex Natural Anti-aging Night Cream with Elastin & Collagen , for Dry to Combination Skin , Fragrance Free , Perfect for Sensitive Skin , 2oz 60mlSebamed has a very faint floral scent . It has a very silky texture and is easy to apply and rub in if you wish . Since I was trying to protect my skin while not making my skin reaction worse , I applied the CARAPEX first with no serum r other products to be sure I was only evaluating one product at a time . In the middle of the night my eye area was feeling very dry . I was not able to apply the Carapex there due to it 's thickness and now I also see the label says not to use on the eyes.But I saw no such warning on this product , so I applied a very thin layer most delicately to my eye area . During the rest of the night my eyes swelled up . I could feel it but did not want to get up again . To my shock , by morning one was completely swollen shut and the other was very swollen.While I may LOVE this product after my dermatitis reaction is gone - I feel I need to warn others that this item WILL AGGRAVATE AN ALREADY UPSET SENSITIVE SKIN.In a month or two I will come back and do a patch test , and then full face if I can . If this reaction does no repeat _ I will raise my stars . But I feel I must warn others with very sensitive skin . I will try to post a picture - I do not like leaving negatives unless they are earned . I would like to point out that I did NOT get his cream In my eye , only in the eye area .	-1
I 'm 22 . It did n't break me out , but made my skin shiny and oily , especially my forehead . This will work for Normal/Dry skin . That 's the only reason why I gave it 2 stars .	-1
My skin had just begun to clear up so I figured I 'd give this highly rated cream a try but it only resulted in breakouts.After about one week of use I began to notice I was breaking out again and my blackheads were only getting worse.I would n't recommend this product to someone with oily or sensitive skin . Also the strong smell irritates the skin .	-1
My daughter and I both bought this . Different skin types and differing degrees of dark circles , so we figured it had to work for one of us . We 've both used it faithfully 2x/day for 3 months . ZERO results . Absolutely no difference for either of us . We might as well be rubbing water under our eyes . Save your money . This product is 100 % worthless .	-1
Hylexin is a waste of good hard earned money , I have serious dark circles and after all the reading up on the product I was so excited that something was on the market that would help make my racoon eyes disappear , I used this product for months followed the directions to a tee and it did nothing . save your money , or if you must try it , try to get it at a discounted price so you wo n't feel like you were taken .	-1
After two months using this cream , I have not seing any results . I am moving to a different product .	-1
Listen to the other reviewers . I wish I had , I could have used the money for a really nice dinner out . I still look like a close relative of Richard Nixon after using the product faithfully until the tube was empty .	-1
I bought this perfume because I liked how it smelled on someone else . However , I have to say that I was really dissappointed when I used it.Firstly , I found that I had to spray a lot of it to really be able to smell the frangrance . Then , I realized that I did not like how it smelled on me . It seemed to have a chemical scent on my own skin . I wish I would have gotten a tester of it before deciding to buy 3.4 oz worth.I do have to have to say that I gave it to 2 stars only because I happened to like how it smelled on someone else . So , I would not discount it completely . I would encourage you to make sure it smells good on you personally before choosing to purchase this perfume .	-1
THIS IS NOT A GOOD COLOGNE AT ALL I MUST SAY THAT THIS COLOGNE IS AIMED FOR OLD MEN LIKE 60 OR SO I DO N'T EVEN RECOMMEND OLD MEN TO BUY IT ITS HORRIBLE GOOD THING I TOOK A WHIFF OF IT AT A DEPARTMENT STORE BEFORE I PURCHASED THIS . I HAD IT ON MY WISH LIST FOR A WHILE BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS BUT CLEARLY PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE HONEST REVIEWS , OR THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WROTE THE REVIEWS ARE OF AGE . AGAIN I DO N'T RECOMMEND THIS TO A YOUNGER CROWD OR EVEN A MIDDLE AGE CROWD .	-1
I do n't know if this is because it was old or if it 's because it is & # 34 ; De Luxe Splash & # 34 ; , but it does n't smell exactly like the PS cologne I am used to . It 's close enough , but I would not buy this again	-1
Very sad that i didnt get amazing results . I would actually leave this in my hair for longer than two minutes and it still did not help any . My hair is so rough and horrible split ends i dont know what to do . I will def not repurchase this !	-1
I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought this . I used this on a weekly basis for the last two months and could not understand why my hair was so dry and breaking . Yes my hair was healthy , thick and transitioning . This product should be used with caution if your hair is not dry or damaged . I thought my hair was moisturized and did not realize I did not have the right moisture protein balance . I used this in the shower and not under dryer . Do not use heat on hair . Cover with shower cap . Hair was tangled and brittle after rinsing out , even to the point where it was matted at times . So everyone 's hair is different . My personal experience was that I used it too much and too often . I will be shelving this for a while at least for a month or so . My experience had me really seconding guess the natural process , was tempted to relax . Thought transitioning hair could n't possibly be this dry , brittle and breaking . So if your hair is healthy this is not for your ... ..as the bottle does say stop using once hair is healthy ( think I missed that ) . Btw bought organics hair mayonnaise and I could n't be more happy . Hair is stretched , moisturized , and not tangled . Proceed with caution and make sure you are using it for the right reasons , as it works for many , just not me .	-1
I 'm not sure where all these glowing reviews are coming from , but I am not at all impressed with this reconstructor . I 've used it several times and each time it leaves my hair feeling limp and tangled afterwards . I much prefer the reconstructor that comes in the Optimum Care relaxer boxes which leaves my hair feeling thicker and smooth . This stuff is going in the garbage .	-1
Its not a bad product , but its also not a good product . This does nothing for my hair , Ive had hair lotions that worked better than this . Im not sure if its hair lotion or conditioner , but Ive used it as either and its just whatever , so Im not going to waste money re-purchasing this . And on top of that , it doesnt smell good , like , at all , so Im not even going to finish the bottle : -p	-1
This deodorant works fine when my wife is n't working out . However , deodorant is especially useful for when one does work out . When my wife works out , she said that the combination of her BO and the deodorant actually smells worse than straight BO .	-1
All these high priced hair treatments including the high priced Moroccan oil are nothing but cheap silicone filled garbage . Yes , they make your hair feel soft and shiny , but a day or two later , you have greasy silicone build up which is a pain to get rid of . Do your research before buying .	-1
Could n't stomach the smell of the product , so I never use it ! ! Smells like a man 's cologne which I DO N'T want my hair to smell like ! ! ! Gave the bottle to my husband and HE DID N'T LIKE THE SMELL EITHER ! ! ! WO N'T be purchasing this again ! ! !	-1
I 'm not impressed with this smoothing cream . I ca n't see any difference at all when I use this . I wo n't be buying it again .	-1
I need maximum strength . Volume too light . No difference in loss or thinning . Hair is still not filled in . I was disappointed .	-1
I did n't do anything for my hair than any other BIOTIN which is why I will not be repurchasing . ( I 'll stick to Spring Valley brand )	-1
My doctor suggested I take a daily biotin supplement to help my slow-growing hair . I used this particular product for two full months , and here 's my experience : Initially , I started with 1 pill , but it did n't seem enough ( due to research , which says 10,000mcg is better ) , so I increased my daily dosage to 2 pills . I can say for certain that my nails grew like CRAZY with this supplement . But , it did n't help the hair on my head in ANY way , though it made my skin extra smooth . Here 's the caveat : I have noticed some body hair loss on the arms/legs , which concerns me - that 's not normal . So while I think this may not necessarily be a bad supplement , I am re-thinking taking more of it ( or Biotin altogether ) due to the body hair loss . **UPDATE ( April 3 , 2011 ) : I have decided to STOP taking this Biotin supplement because I have noticed more body hair loss on my arms , which I never had before . Now that I 've stopped for a week , there are tiny hairs growing back out , but they are very fine . Not sure if this is my individual reaction to this product , or to Biotin in general , but it is best not to take it further . The hair on my head does not seem to be affected one way/another with this supplement ( or perhaps I lost more being on it ! ) , but my nail growth has slowed down ( which is okay ) . Now it makes me wonder about the quality of the product , or biotin in general , ... because it 's supposed to make your hair grow , not cause hair loss . **UPDATE ( June 11 , 2011 ) : The hair on my body is nearly back to normal since I stopped taking this supplement . Not sure if it 's the quality of the ingredients in this particular brand or biotin in general , but it caused patchy body hair loss all over . Now I 'm certain it was the biotin because 3 months later , the hair that was gone on my body is back ! The supplement may not affect everyone in the same way , but it definitely does have side effects for some of us . **UPDATE ( December 17 , 2012 ) : I just found out that biotin INCREASES testosterone in the body . That makes total sense that many who have taken biotin in the hopes of decreasing head hair loss have instead ended up with body hair growth and cystic acne instead ( a definite sign of excess testosterone in the body ) . I believe the whole `` biotin will increase hair growth on the head '' is a marketing scheme that even physicians are buying into without doing their research . Do not recommend for hair growth !	-1
I took these twice daily for 3 months . I got no results what so ever . I switched brands first to purvana and got shiner , thicker hair . After 4 months , quality control issues with purvana caused me to switch to a vitamin shoppe brand . So far so good . Will update in 3 months .	-1
Sorry , I 've never had break outs on my face and this product caused me to break out in rather large bumps ( like acne ) . I stopped using the product until the problem resolved and tried it again , and the same thing happened , so I 'm not able to use this anymore . Looks like I wasted my money .	-1
I received itchy skin when I applied this . When I stopped using this product the itchiness went away . Guess I am alergic to it .	-1
I bought two of these -- one for me and one for my mom . I am embarrassed to even give my mom 's to her because this & # 34 ; emollient & # 34 ; & # 34 ; cream & # 34 ; is n't even like a cream . It is thick , hard to spread , very greasy ( gets on my pillow ) , but worst of all , it smells terrible . I would never buy this again and do NOT recommend it .	-1
It looks like hardened Vasoline coming from the tube . It smells like perfumed Vasoline . It is very thick and greasy .	-1
was expecting something a lot better after reading the reviews . i believe i may have had an old bottle because it smelled cheap . sadly , can not return it as stated in amazon 's return policy for flammable materials . pay more and buy it in person .	-1
I should have done a little homework before I ordered this . Should have gotten Aqva Marine heard its noticed more with a sweeter after tone . This cologne is not very potent its scent is n't bad though it smells like Bvlgari was a little puzzled with this one trying to go in a much different direction than other aquas . Marine should have been the finished product but that 's just from hearsay have n't smelled it myself . Kind cautious to but marine I usually love Bvlgari colognes ... ... cool bottle .	-1
i have been using jadore for 14 years and this is a bad joke , the bottle and the soap smell and the overall experience i wish i could give it 0 stars , bad customer service , bad everything , do not order . I am so upset that amazon allows this	-1
Out of the four scents only one doesnt make me gag , I cant even remember which one it is because its at work and doesnt get used much	-1
I 'm asking myself the same question over and over : Why did I spent money on this ? Not just that , I also got nFresh Ginger and Pink Grapefruit ! They are worthless , the scent disappears after a few minutes , even body mist are stronger and long lasting than this ! I truly ca n't understand how so many people are so AMAZED about this fragrance . Maybe I had high expectations , who knows . I mean , I have good fresh , clean fragrances that are amazing and way worth the price ( and you can find them here at a great price too ) like Lalique White and Mugler Cologne . My advise is : Save a little more money and get a real fragrance that at least lasts more than 5 minutes !	-1
I was so let down by the scent ! ITs pungent to say the least but does not make my nose do cart wheels at all . At first it smells like Tigress perfume ( back in the day-remember ? ) but then it gets weird on me . Maybe its just my skin but I do n't care for this but absolutly LOVE LOVE LOVE White Diamonds and Diamonds and Sahphires to piecies ! This one bombed as far as Im concerned with the scent . I do n't care for Diamonds and Emeralds either because of the strong gardina in it . EWWWWW ... ... ... .im not a gardina fan in the least .	-1
Certainly not in the Hugo Boss , Armani , CK perfume class . I put perfumes in classes based on the scent smell not necessarily the name . This is in the B class . I am not impressed with it . I use light perfumes , its decently light but stays till the next day , so the staying power is good , but it just does n't have a classy smell . If you like the CKone , D & G light Blue you may not like this .	-1
I was looking forward to buying and using this product . I have only used three colognes my whole life . Chikara ( INCREDIBLE COLOGNE but TO PRICEY and SMALL BOTTLE ) , Mambo By Liz Claibourne ( DECENT COLOGNE but NOTHING SPECIAL has a GOOD PRICE though ) , and this one ( WENT STRAIGHT TO THE TRASH AFTER SECOND USE ) . When I first opened it I immediately thought it smelt horrible like a cheap cologne you can find in a thrift shop or flea market ! Then I thought I would get some other opinions . Maybe I was wrong ? Asked some girls I know and Not one person liked it and all said the same thing ... It smells like an old man .	-1
I got Grey Flannel from Amazon after reading all the reviews . The first time , I used it I got really turned off . Not planning to use it any more.Will not recommend to anyone .	-1
I bought this for my husband and its not a keeper ! The scent is way to strong.. Almost overwhelming ! It 's not a sexy scent at all .	-1
I bought two bottles because I thougth women will be crazy about the smell . Why would I think that way ? Reviews from all over the web . Nobody ever asked me what I am wearing when I used it . Nevertheless , the jet black bottles are cool to look at .	-1
I read the good reviews about this cologne and decided to get it for my husband as a gift . I never smelled the scent , so I was taking a chance . After wearing it , he smelled like sweet cooking spice . We thought maybe the smell would die down , so he went to work with it on . He said that people kept asking who was wearing cinnamon scented cologne while he was there . He knew it was him , but he did n't say anything ... LOL ! I do n't like it because of the constant smell of cinnamon spice which reminds me of strong Big Red gum . I kept getting queasy , so we just decided to throw it away . Maybe his body chemistry just did n't go with it . Overall , If you like the smell of pumpkin pies on your skin , then I would suggest this . If not , do not buy this scent . And from now on when it comes to scents , I will have to sniff before buying .	-1
I have purchased these a few times on amazon and it has been great expect Amazon must have changed the company it purchases its fragrances as this was a cheap knock-off version of the actual eau de toilette . I can not risk purchases these anymore through Amazon as the customer service rep could not even disclose the manufacture of these fragrances . I am back to buying Amariage on Macy 's even if it cost more money ... at least i know it is the authentic brans .	-1
Bulgari black is a fairly one-dimensional cologne , in my opinion.Those who glorify it as being a manly , black rubber-smelling , industrial city cologne are pushing it quite a bit . You do n't really get that , but rather vanilla , tea ( the type they use does have a slight latex `` rubber '' quality , but not what you 'd smell in a garage , for good or bad ) , and iris . This is not very masculine , and it is unisex , there is no denying that.I do n't think it has much complexity , nor does it change much for the entire duration of a wearing.I guess that women will like this on a man , however -- in fact , they could probably wear it . It is fairly non-offensive . I think you could wear it anytime , even in the office -- it wo n't knock anyone out , but it wo n't make you feel like you are driving a car and burning rubber.My recommendation is to try this before buying if possible . After reading the many glorious reviews on this and the whole `` It smells like rubber ! '' thing , I tried it and said , `` This is it , vanilla and tea ? `` Who might like this : Vanilla and tea lovers with a metrosexual `` air '' .Who might dislike this : Manly men who want a scent that exudes power and gravitas.Despite being called `` black '' this is not really a `` black '' EDT ; For that , you might want to try Lalique 's `` Encre Noire '' ( dark , earthy vetiver ) or Van Cleef and Arpels ' `` Pour Homme '' ( Soapy , dirty floral ) .	-1
It 's heaven on spice and price , and powdery as well . Not sure if this counts as a cologne or a fragrant hockey puck-obviously Bulgari 's designers did n't work to hard on this one . Are they going to make a baseball cologne next ?	-1
Giving my bottle away tomorrow . I tried to like this stuff but it is to sweet smelling . Also there is an odor in it that flat out just makes me ill . It smells good on someone else but I cant wear this stuff . Very cloying . If you ( a Man ) like to smell like sweet vanilla this stuff is for you.Buy the cuba red ( I have ) ALOT more manly smelling ... spicy good sent .	-1
The title pretty much says it all . Don ; t know any other way to describe this then to say it seems as though it was designed to cause a headache . The scent is beyond horrible . The only saving grace is that it wears off quickly . Gave it two stars for fast shipping and good packing , but the cologne itself ...	-1
Shipping was okay therefore they earned the one star BUT The smell was bad . The packaging was horrible . Wish I did not buy this product . I would not recommend the product nor would I buy from the seller again . I threw it away .	-1
This stinks . I would not buy it again . I can not stand the way it smells and I am very disappointed in this .	-1
I was looking for a perfum with pheronomes ( if it exist ) , they add this product as if it real . Did n't smell as perfum reallydid n't smell , nor last . I did n't return because it was too expensive to do it , and does n't worth to spent more money . An otherscam .	-1
This smells great but it is not the original ... . my momv got it and she immediately could tell that this was not fhe reall one	-1
was very disapointed with this . it didnt smell as i remebered it actually smelled like it was old , very strong and unappealing . i used to wear this scent and if it had smelled like this i wouldnt have . what a shame some companies try to push off their old products in place of new .	-1
I 've worn Youth Dew for years and have always bought it through Macy 's . When I saw that Amazon carried it , I was thrilled . Same price , but no-cost shipping on Prime , and I did n't have to go shopping . ( I hate shopping . ) So I bought it and got it a couple days later , and it just does n't smell the same as Youth Dew -- believe me , I know how Youth Dew 's supposed to smell ; nor does it last even half as long as the perfume I 've been buying from Macy 's for years . So I guess it 's back to get-in-the-car-drive-to-Macy's-and-buy . Yes , I realize there are more important problems in the world . But when you spend $ 34 on a bottle of your favorite perfume , you want it to be your favorite perfume .	-1
I 've worn this fragrance for many years and received so many compliments ! I even had one man run after me ( seriously ! ) in a store asking what I was wearing : ) But now . . .I noticed changes a long time ago - the lotion that used to be so rich was now lightweight - both in texture and fragrance . Then the fragrance starting changing until today it is no longer the unique and wonderful fragrance it once was . They took a beautiful and classic fragrance and just ruined it . Another reviewer said it best - it now smells like bug spray.I quit buying two years ago . It 's like losing part of myself - I was so identified with Youth Dew .	-1
