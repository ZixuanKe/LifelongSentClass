I enjoy vintage books and movies so I enjoyed reading this book . The plot was unusual . Do n't think killing someone in self-defense but leaving the scene and the body without notifying the police or hitting someone in the jaw to knock them out would wash today.Still it was a good read for me .	1
This was a fairly interesting read . It had old- style terminology.I was glad to get to read a story that does n't have coarse , crasslanguage . I read for fun and relaxation ... ... I like the free ebooksbecause I can check out a writer and decide if they are intriguing , innovative , and have enough of the command of Englishthat they can convey the story without crude language .	1
I enjoyed this one tho I 'm not sure why it 's called An Amy Brewster Mystery as she 's not in it very much . It was clean , well written and the characters well drawn .	1
I think I have this one in both book and audio . It is a good story either way . good ol ' Maul .	1
I have a version of `` Star by Star '' that does not include the novella `` Recovery , '' so I downloaded this book onto my Fire . `` Recovery '' tells of Leia 's recovery after she was nearly killed in `` Balance Point . '' If it was meant to tell the story of the healing of Han and Leia 's relationship , it surely failed . There was far too much action to attempt much more than a few brief moments or reconciliation . They have a deeper understanding of each other but not much time to work on it.Is it a necessary read ? Not really . I could have skipped it ( I actually did ) and not miss much . It felt like the extraneous part of a book that had been edited out , like in the DVD 's , where it 's billed as the extras . People pay to see those extras . I did . It was worth it , but probably not to everyone .	1
I was hoping to find this one in book form . The story looks like it will be good when I get that far in the series .	1
Really should n't have Han Solo on the cover as he does n't come into the story.This story is all about Chewbacca and his family.I wo n't give anything away , but it is a nice , if short , read .	1
I absolutely love this book . Though it is short it was written by Zahn . Any Star Wars fan knows this book is a good one . I would recommend this book to anyone who loves Star Wars .	1
This story by Louis L'Amour was the very first of his novels that I ever read . Novels with a western theme were not my thing when I was growning up , so imagine my surprise when I just sort of drifted into this book one rainy afternoon . I guess I was attracted to it by the fact that it opens in New York City , not the deserts of New Mexico.Anyway , I soon found that L'Amour has a writing style just as smooth as silk , and I found myself sliding into this book as easily as if he took me by the hand and led me to an alter . Since then I have read several more of L'Amour 's books and have enjoyed all of them . I will review them here over the next few weeks , time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose . Others have outlined the text already , so I wo n't bore you with yet another outline . I 'll just say that if you have not read any of Louis L'Amour in the past , this would be a really great place to start , or even to get reacquainted . While you do that , I 'm gon na find another L'Amour book to read . : )	1
This is how it was in the big gambling and corrupt cities of the eastern seaboard . Then go out west and become a real hero . Again , the video was also good .	1
As an aspiring yogini this is required reading . It 's not an easy read but it 's essential and the translation was good .	1
I thought it would be instructive to compare this Charles Johnston translation , sutra by sutra , to Chip Hartranft 's Shambhala version of Patanjali 's Yoga Sutras . I 'm glad I also have the Shambhala book , because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher . Here are some of the funnier ones : * Through the weakening of the causes of bondage , and by learning the method of sassing , the consciousness is transferred to the other body . * Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood . * In the internals of the batik , other thoughts will arise , through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I 'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators , Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras `` aphorisms '' , pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom , while sutras are interdependent . I kind of agree with that . But , being an older translation , the word use is a bit quaint . For example , Johnson likes the word `` psychic '' , but more in the sense of psychological , not extrasensory perception . He uses the phrase `` judicial action '' to connote `` reflection-free '' . He 's fond of the word `` unwisdom '' , which Hartranft translates as `` not seeing things as they are '' . And he does over-explain sutras that do n't need that much explanation to comprehend . But then , Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that , if you 're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures , you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book . Translations are always tricky , so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters , you 'll achieve a better understanding of the original work .	1
I 've been an occasional reader of the Wall Street Journal for many years , but had never really considered subscribing to it . For the most part I 've been happy to get my news for free online from a variety of sources , but of late I 've been craving a more consistent access to the kind of high quality news stories that WSJ is known for . I decided to check out several subscription options , and compare them to each other . The Kindle version , even though it is very limited in many respects , turns out to be pretty good and in line with my expectations for what I wanted to get out of reading WSJ.Once you subscribe to WSJ , you can setup the delivery to any one of your Kindle devices or enabled Kindle readers . You can also manually download the current issue of WSJ to another device , but the automatic downloads are enabled for only one device at the time ( you can change which one in the online Kindle setting at any time ) . Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired . As you may imagine , the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper . I do n't mind this all that much , as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper . The exceptions are the graphs and charts , which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle . The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu , and I am overall pleased with the navigation options . In terms of formatting , I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version , but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you wo n't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle ( not even in the tablet version of Kindle software ) . Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun , and definitely add to the overall `` reading '' experience . However , they also add to the size of the download , and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet , the download can be choppy . For me these videos are a nice addition , but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes , yes , Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive . However , keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed , something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper . I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication , and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get . We 've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines , but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides , and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles , then I 'd definitely recommend that you check it out . So far I 've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read .	1
When it comes to speed and convenience , there is no better way to read the Wall Street Journal . With almost no advertisements , you just get the articles and pictures in a very concise and easy to read format . With wireless delivery , you get the paper delivered to your Kindle , no matter where you are , as soon as it comes out.I ca n't say enough how much I enjoy this version of the Wall Street Journal . With it being in my Kindle am able to have it with me , whenever I 'm looking for something to read . Perfect for the commute and for unexpected waits.My only complaint is a small one . In the `` Page One '' section of the paper , it has several `` What 's News '' blurbs , after the first couple articles . While this is useful on the print version , it is annoying and distracting on the Kindle . You get the first paragraph of articles deep in the paper , with a link to get to them . Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper , this is detracting , disrupts the flow of reading the paper , and is pointless . I really wish that they would get rid of these `` article teaser links '' , but in the mean time , I 'll just have to get used to skipping them.Overall , I really love the WSJ on my Kindle . I highly recommend you get it in this format . Good luck when you cancel your paper version , though , as they 'll keep delivering it to you long after you cancel ( so they can keep reporting you as a reader to their advertisers ) . Magazines and newspapers are the best thing about Kindle .	1
I downloaded to read while sitting at the ocean ! Something cool about reading the journal and being at the beach ! I like their articles !	1
The 2 month free trial is well worth a try . I 'll say that up front.Second , NYT is a great paper . I have n't gotten newspapers in a while , due wanting to cut down on the amount of trash I generate , and because I got tired of excessive advertising . Blah , blah , blah ... . now that I 'm getting NYT as a wake up each morning , I 'm remembering what I was missing.I 'm spending 20 minutes per morning reading through the parts I find interesting . It 's good stuff . I 'll probably continue after the trial is over.That said , I agree that that price is a tad high . I 'd be much more comfortable with less than $ 20 per month , considering how much is stripped out.Also ... someone at NYT should read these before they go out . The Bridge column last week made numerous references to the missing diagram . I can understand leaving out some pictures , but vital pictures should never be left out . If you 're going to leave out pictures , I think all the static Op-ed pictures can be left out . The bridge column without diagrams is pointless , so it should be added to items to strip out -- or to include diagrams with.Good science section so far . I miss the crossword . Even if the crossword was n't interactive , I 'd love to see it . I have some grid paper.NYT is really close here , I think , so with a little more care , they could have something less frustrating to send out. -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- I 've decided to continue subscribing . I 've been reading NYT in bed before getting up for awhile now , and it 's a great way to start the day . I 'd still like for it to be better , but reading the newspaper in bed in the early morning is a new joy I do n't want to give up .	1
There is so much information packed into each daily issue that I just do n't have time to read it all and read my other books and kindle magazines too . All the news that makes the New York Times such a great newspaper is included in the Kindle edition minus the ads . If you have time to read it daily it is well worth the $ 19.99 monthly subscription price .	1
I am particularly partial to the & # 34 ; Book Review & # 34 ; section . I read the KINDLEedition so I 'm not awash in newspaper advertising etc . It gets me up tospeed on the news ... at least what they want to tell us ... on a weekly basis .	1
I admit I am biased , as I already loved the content of NYT.I love reading about finance , entertainment , style , and of course current events . The Kindle edition is easy to navigate , filled with pictures and is a pleasure to read.The Kindle edition does exactly what it supposed to do - making it a great reading experience . On occasion , I might supplement this by looking at the online edition ( if I MUST see a color picture , or something ) . The online editions can be hard to read , and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have , but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork , the paper arrives early each morning ( no more missed papers ) , easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition , in a great reading format.Well done !	1
Here it is the premier newspaper of New England sent automatically to your beloved Kindle while you sleep.No more trudging out in the snow only to find a wet , soggy , glop of dead trees ! Nice !	1
I live in a town adjacent a 'medium ' sized city in Massachusetts . The local newspapers leave a lot to be desired.When I REALLY want to know what is going on ... I read & # 34 ; The Globe & # 34 ; ... It gives me what I want to know in a timelymanner .	1
Tis is a good short story but I was hoping for more I 'm not a big fan of the yuzan vong war series but this was good anyway more would have been better	1
There is n't one aspect of the book that I do n't like . Fast paced action , the one that good action movies are made of ; characters that are captivating and of course love that conquers all . Written well , paced well and , simply put , page turner . Thumbs up in my book .	1
I 'm a real fan of romantic suspense , but rarely enjoy the series-length novels . this one was terrific , credible details , great speed and tension , smokin ' hot chemistry and reasonable character development . gon na go buy more Stacey books !	1
I was able to get this book several years ago free for my Kindle and I 'm just now getting to it in my `` to be read '' list . I 'm not quite sure why , but it does n't recognize that I got it on Amazon anymore as it usually does at the top of the product page . I wish this book had been longer . The only real problem I had with it is that , even being short , I would have preferred that it have chapter demarcations . That would make it so much easier to find a stopping place or see how close to the end of a chapter you are when you need/want to do so . That 's not so much of a big problem when the book is short or you 're reading a novella , but it 's still nice . I really felt for the characters in this book and they seem mostly real to me , but there was a bit of irrationality mixed in that I do n't think would have completely been that way in real life . I wo n't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that . If you like light adventure stories with a smattering of intrigue and suspense , I think you 'll enjoy this story , especially if you like a tad of sexual tension and titillation . Have at it ! I ca n't wait to read the next one .	1
Alex Rossi aka Sean Devlin is leading a double life -- he 's the founder of Devlin Group as Sean Devlin ; and he 's Alex Rossi ( his real name ) , one of Devlin Groups senior agents . His lifetime goal has been to find & kill the man who murdered his mother.Grace Nolan is an ex- agent , and considers Sean Devlin a friend . When her young son , Danny , is kidnapped , she 's forced to ask Devlin Group to help her find & rescue him . The kidnapper just happens to be the killer Alex is seeking , and the killer knows the secret connection between Grace & Alex -- -Danny is Alex 's son -- -although Alex just found that out . He 's furious Grace never told him about Danny . She was furious Alex shot her just before she found out she was pregnant ! ! This romantic suspense book has plenty of action scenes ; tense moments ; great one-liners ; and great secondary characters who more than likely will have their own stories ; I.e. , Gallagher & Carmen .	1
It was a romantic suspense novel , quick read with predictable events . Well written and well balanced . I enjoyed it while I was sick with the flue and it kept me interested . I read it in one day . It is n't the best I have ever read but in general I would give it 4 stars out of 5 .	1
I enjoyed this book a great deal - very witty and a pleasant read . I actually did laugh out loud a couple of times . Thanks , free classics !	1
This is Twain 's satire of contemporary religious mores . It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime , and like much of his later work , it 's slightly cynical and very sarcastic , although more upbeat than , for example , _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall , but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can , or to scholars writing on Twain 's religious views , more than to casual Twain readers . It 's mildly amusing throughout , but no more than that , and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It 's a fairly short read , at 630 kindle `` locations '' .	1
I fell in love with the show and thought I would read the stories themself . Thease stories are so twisted . But a fantastic read .	1
This is a pretty good collection of the Grimm Fairy Tales . It was translated into pretty simple English . This is just a few of the Grimm 's stories and there are a lot other books out there with more than just these stories . This was a good quick read of some of the Grimm Fairy Tales , and I would recommend it to someone who is looking for a quick read of a selection of the Grimm Tales .	1
I was excited to re-read this . It 's been years , and each tale came back as a vivid reminder of my youth . A great book !	1
The book is the authors account of a portion of France after Germany 's attempts at occupation during WWI . The author is quite descriptive as he documents the scenes of death and destruction throughout his stay on the front lines . I found the book of interest both politically and historically . If one is seeking a glimpse of history through the eyes of someone that was present at the time , you should not be disappointed . The book is somewhat short but a good read nevertheless .	1
A manual on desert island survival in its own right , this book besides having the old Verne slow build to a climax that I love so much has a LOT of interesting little asides that give a lot of information about attitudes and behaviour of the time , from the treatment of the the castaways towards each other , the land around them , and the animals . Worth reading .	1
This classic is a must read , especial for anyone who has read 20,000 Leagues .. Even if you simply watched Walt Disney 's early film adaptation your sure to enjoy this story . There are a few place where it drags a bit and some of the language usage is dated , but that some how seems to add to it 's charm .	1
Simply outstanding even though I 've read it before . Verne is an outstanding writer for a n y generation . Offer this to your children .	1
I would highly recommend this classic to everyone from young teens to our most senior adults . Warning it is a long , involved tale that ca n't be read in one evening . Since every character is a man , it is a less than sentimental journey . Though they are definitely some tearful scenes . One character is a former slave , but is treated as the others ' equal though somewhat condescendedly . I enjoyed looking back at a culture and customs that are long gone . And no spoilers , but you may want to read another Verne classic when done with this one ...	1
I could not take myself out of the book once I got started . It had a great amount of mystery , some of which could be figured out ( especially if you are familiar with Jules Verne ) however , there were a lot of twists and turns the kept me guessing . He must have done a tremendous amount of research to be able to describe all the things he had these character had to do in order to survive . Like I said , Very Educational .	1
One of the better fiction books I 've read in a long time . Jules Verne is a master at subtly building suspense !	1
Again , if you 've already seen the movie , this book only serves to clear up a lot of things in the movie that did n't make sense . I wish I had read the book first , then I would n't be so jaded .	1
Not at all what I had expected . I was thinking it would be like the movie but was very pleasantly surprised .	1
As old as this story is , I had never read it . Love Kindle free classics for android . I love the writing style and language . Very descriptive . A great author , a great sci-fi mind . Very enjoyable read .	1
I came into the book expecting it to be great , and I was surprised that it exceeded even my own inflated expectations . I 've read many of Jules Verne 's works , and I can sat that I was thoroughly amused the whole time I was reading this book . I 've come to the realization that very few writers today even come close to the marvelous works that were wrought by hands such as Jules Verne . Would I recommend it ? YES ! If you enjoy a little bit of Sci-Fi , a lot of adventure , some laughs , and some good time well spent you 'll love reading Jules Verne 's & # 34 ; The Mysterious Island & # 34 ; .	1
You ca n't go wrong with Jules Verne . His scenes are so graphic , accurate and well-researched and it draws you into the story .	1
In true Jules Verne style - rich descriptions - real characters - adventures and action . Downloaded by mistake but thoroughly glad I did .	1
This book was inspired by the true story of Alexander Selkirk , who survived alone for almost five years on an uninhabited island off the coast of Chile.It is a very interesting story with a lot of imagination by Verne as it is written in the later 1800s . It starts in 1865 , March , Richmond , VA . The capital of the Confederacy is under siege by the Union Army under Lt. Gen. U. S. Grant.Five men , Cyrus , Pencroft , Herbert , Neb and Gideon , and a dog named Top are trapped in Richmond and wish to escape from the town . The weather is bad , but there is a balloon tethered in the middle of town , and the storm seems to provide some cover as the Confederates are less attentive with the storm . They get into the balloon with a dog and set off on an adventure . They are blown west by the storm , and end up over the ocean , with the balloon losing altitude , when they very fortunately to crash on a tropical island , which turns out to be volcanic and large enough to have a variety on the island.Interesting that Verne uses a balloon which is only coming into use , as the device to get his folks onto the deserted tropical island.The five men are a good collection of skills and personalities and work well together . Captain Cyrus is their knowledgeable and inspiring leader with an engineer 's practical knowledge . Pencroft , is a practical and hardworking sailor . Gideon is kind of a `` everyman '' -- observant , strong and resourceful and loving . Herbert a young , man learning and becoming a naturalist . It is a well done book where the whole crew works hard to make a life for themselves on the island using what is available . They do an excellent job using what is at hand , and make chemicals including nitroglycerine , using what is on the island.A well done and interesting adventure tale . Hard to always appreciate that it was written in 1870 , as it has aged well . An enjoyable Verne adventure novel , certainly one of his best .	1
I have been trying to go through the classic books off and on through out the years . I have found many of them so interesting and refreshing . This book was no different . It has great characters and a wonderful story line . I recommend it if you enjoy a bit of sci fi-ish books . : )	1
A true classic . Not like the movie where they fight large dinosaur . A good tail of survival and the will to get by . A good read for any age . The true adventure and a lesson in human nature . Good over evil and how to best understand the wishes of others .	1
Great read for Jules Verne fans . A little simplistic in the details but he had to get the characters a long way in a very impossible situation . Suspend your disbelief that much and he will lead you to the final scene that will have you slap your forehead for not seeing it coming . Lot of fun .	1
Mysterious Island was my first read by this author . It was a long read but very detail that made the island come alive . Lots of surprises .	1
Took a long time to read and get into STORY . Overall a good but slow reading book . Would recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science . It has an interesting turn .	1
At 1st , I did n't realize who the author was . This is a wonderful finish to & # 34 ; 20,000 Leagues & # 34 ; . Kept my interest .	1
the is a story about man , life , working together for the betterment of all.the betterment of this group of man.the respect life , all things intended .	1
This is another of the old classics that Amazon has released in eBook format . I read this story first over fifty years ago while it was being held between the hardback bindings of a library book in conjunction with Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and In Search of the Castaways . After I discovered how exciting Jules Verne 's writings truly were I started reading all of his books that I could find and I most certainty appreciated every one of them . When I saw `` The Mysterious Island '' in eBook format on Amazon I simply had to have a copy . It is now my desire to acquire all the books that I have read and the books I now have in my personal hard-copy library , in the eBook format . Even though we have grown up reading hardback and paperback books , enjoying the smell of printer 's ink and experiencing the feeling of a good binding and fine paper in our hands , we no longer are able to collect them in their original format due to lack of available shelf space . I have discovered that being able to carry all of my books around in my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 is not a bad way to go after all . Hunting through book shelf after book shelf for a novel or digging through box after box of books which we had to place in storage because our books were completely taking over our home , looking for just the right book , has unfortunately become unrealistic . However I regress and this is a review about Jules Verne and his book `` The Mysterious Island '' Read it , I believe you will love it .	1
Jules Verne 's Guide to Survival . I enjoyed the adventure . This is one classic you do n't want to miss . Not only is it fun to read , but you might learn something as well . The next time I read it , and I fully intend to read this book again , I 'm going to keep my laptop at my elbow so I can find pictures of some of the animals and plants mentioned . I 'd especially like to know if their `` horses '' are real or make-believe .	1
Takes place in 1800's.Five castaways . Good mystery and well written . Will keep you coming back to find out ... .who did that !	1
I have read all Jules Verne 's stories but all are worth re-reading . I believe most have been made into movies so for me it is worth refreshing the story especially this one as the movie never did it justice . The dated language is a little difficult but fun if , like me , you use the dictionary often to search out obscure words and phrases . For anyone who never read or saw this story/movie I strongly recommend it as good early science fiction .	1
Very nice reference . Is helpful if you are looking to learn the best way to make knots and their different applications in real world situations .	1
In his day A. Hyatt Verrill was mostly known for his adventure and fantasy stories . Today Verrill is mostly remembered for this little book on knots.Knots are one of mankind 's oldest inventions and over the millennia we have evolved thousands of them . Knots are used by everyone from sailors to brain surgeons to join and hold things together . In this book Verrill gathers a few hundred of the most useful knots , shows how to tie them and gives a little bit on their background and uses.The instructions and the accompanying illustrations are clear and at least for the simpler knots makes tying them easy . A wonderful book for everyone from Scouts to sailors to armchair browsing .	1
The title kind of gives away the fact that the children will become orphans . The time in which this story is based shows that life was hard and that people could die in a short time without medication and for unknown reasons . I enjoyed the book but had one problem with it . They pulled Mary 's two front teeth but then they kept talking about how beautiful she had become ! Seems a little strange to me .	1
I picked this book because the blurb about it intrigued me and I 'd never heard of this book . So far I am more than halfway through and have been enjoying it . It 's a sad book though in many ways and I 'm not sure it will necessarily have a 'happy ending ' but it is good nonetheless .	1
This was obviously a vintage book . I enjoyed the style and window into another world and time . Should be required reading in high school .	1
This was a wonderful book , it gave a glimpse into what life was like for the poor and destitute . It was also inspirational . I highly recommend this book	1
I absolutely love this book ! I am so glad I found it and wonder why I never heard of it before . It was just as exciting as my discovery of the Anne of Green Gables series and had a similar feel to it . The English Orphans was written around 1855 and is a classic rags to riches story . I was glued to my Kindle for two solid days and enjoyed the story and the characters immensely . I experienced both tears and laughter . Highly recommended !	1
I was not disappointed , sometimes sad , sometimes happy but always keeping you turning the pages , I most definitely would read more of this author.You need to realize that it is set in times past , but that only sets the stage for how grateful we should be to live in the here and now.wonderful tale . a keeper.The English OrphansI went to kindle store and downloaded several more of her books and ca n't wait to start on them . ( I went for the freebies so do n't know how the 3.00 plus books would be . ) formating , english etc . may be better .	1
Felt like I was right back in Parochial school in Philadelphia . It was so great to get back to the basics !	1
What a glorious read ! The language is lovely , the story compels you to keep reading , and author knows where his story is going . What a sheer pleasure to pick this book up . What a heartbreak when it was done . This is a classic , not a cheap paperback time filler . You will not be disappointed with Morning Star .	1
Interesting book about the Ottawa and Chippewa Indians of Michigan in the 1800s etc . The Indian author Andrew Blackbird wanted to get an education , and was a hard worker , but the money that was sent by the US Government , was not really available to him , as the system , including agents and friends disposed of it first . Another documented case where the system of Indian Agents really did not work well for the Indians , but rather was used by the agents for their benefit . Typical where the system is captured by the persons operating the system , and not by the people the system was set up to serve . He did an excellent job of collecting historical information , and creating a english to the local indian tongue dictionary . A little gem of a book .	1
As far as fairy tales , there are no big surprises here , mostly typical fairy tale fare , which is not a bad thing , but they resembled European fairy tales so much in form and function , that I wonder if its the translation , or if indeed Indian fairy tales are just very similar to European ones . If you enjoy European style mythology , then you will probably like this short set of tales .	1
Once again , I have finally read this classic story for the first time . I was vaguely aware of the story line but thoroughly enjoyed reading it from cover to cover .	1
You have got to love the classics . They are timeless portals that you can lose yourself in at any age ! !	1
I have never seen the movie ( was there a movie ? ) . This book REALLY stirs your emotions . ( Sometimes you wish you could go back there and kick some of those bleeps bleeps ! ) It is an excellent story ! Excellent !	1
THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK.. ! ! it is a classic book that you must have in your collection . i always enjoyed it since i was a kid	1
This book contains everything , mystery , love story , suspense , it has it all . It is like reading a modern thriller without all the filthy language , wich I hate .	1
This has hundreds of things Lincoln said and did . Most of the humor is subtle , and none of it will cause peals of laughter , but this book is definitely enjoyable reading . The intro tells of how Lincoln used humor throughout his life , and following it is a calender of important events in his life .	1
when I open my kindle app to read some I really do n't want to put it down . It is quite macabre to think this is for children . There is no Disney light in these fairy tales	1
Fairy tales are usually thought of as children 's literature , and in terms of how much children in particular are fascinated with them this categorization is not without a merit . However , most good fairy tales tap into some social or personal tension , a fact of life , or a natural phenomenon . They often take rather ordinary situations and push them to the limit of what our imagination considers plausible . Fairy tales are thus a form of reductio ad absurdum of common sense , and they often help us see various life situations in terms of their most basic principles . This is why fairy tales have had , and continue to have , a lot of fascination with adults as well.Most of us have grown up with fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen or Brothers Grimm . There is a sort of cannon of western fairy tales that have become part of the common patrimony of the entire world - Little Red Riding Hood , Snow White , Rapunzel , and many others . However , these fairy tales are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the European fairy tales , and there are many other folk tales that are not as familiar as these and yet are equally beautiful and imaginative.This collection of the English fairy tales is as great of a collection of fairy tales as they come . It is rather fascinating to see that even thought many fairy tales reflect certain English cultural norms , the basic structure and the motifs are surprisingly familiar . We have villains and heroes charged with an unusual and demanding task , monsters and unusual magical objects are everywhere , there are damsels-in-distress aplenty , and most tales take place `` once upon a time . '' All of the tales are very well written and the language is crisp and contemporary . The dialogues , however , are replete with colloquial English expressions and turns of phrase , and these characteristics give the fairy tales a very folksy feel . This collection will be a great source of enjoyment for children and adults alike .	1
Not like the cutesy fairy tales that are around . Enjoy reading some of them that I have read before and reading different ones I never heard of .	1
These stories were written in a rough tone and have an unpolished feel to them . This is not necessarily a detraction , and some tales were better than other , but it was occasionally wearying to read them in the poor grammar of colloquial speech . Hence , four stars .

Simon Lebeaux inherited Seaton House from his uncle . He is recuperating from an injury while staying in the seemingly haunted house . Simon is haunted by his memories of one fateful night with a beautiful stranger . Simon has stayed away from women for the past four months and intends to keep it that way until one rainy night when another beautiful stranger shows up at his door.Lottie Santori is in Trouble , Pennsylvania , researching Josef Zangara for her psychology professor . Zangara made Seaton House an exclusive hotel in the nineteen thirties and was later convicted of being a serial killer . Lottie is overprotected by her five older brothers , so she is relishing the idea of solving a mystery or two while relaxing and hopefully finding a hot guy to fool around with while she 's at it . Arriving at Seaton House during a thunderstorm , Lottie meets Simon and falls instantly in lust but Simon clearly wants nothing to do with her . Lottie 's not giving up though ; she plans to discover the mystery surrounding the house and Simon , all while trying to seduce him into bed , but strange things are happening . Is someone out to get Simon ? Or is he going crazy ? Leslie Kelly has written another hit with Asking For Trouble ! This funny , sexy , and sometimes spooky story is a blast to read ! Simon had me from the beginning . His haunted memories and guilt-ridden soul made me want to hold him and never let go . Lottie is a sweetheart ; she 's beautiful , witty and fearless too . The chemistry between Simon and Lottie simply sizzles . Asking For Trouble is just as entertaining to read as Here Comes Trouble , the first book in this series , and with Trouble Or Nothing still to come , readers get plenty more from the town of Trouble , Pennsylvania , where something scary and passionate is bound to happen !

Finally a Texas newspaper in Kindle format.Way to go Amazon ! !	1
I love Analog Science Fiction and Fact . I remember reading it when I was a kid and was just recently re-introduced to it when I bought a paper copy of it at Books-A-Million in Madison , TN . I was so excited to find that I could have it delivered automatically to my Kindle every month that I subscribed immediately . The fiction is always first rate and the Fact articles and editorials are always right on the money . I look forward to receiving it every month , and it does n't hurt that I save $ 2.00 per month off the news stand price . I highly recommend Analog Science Fiction and Fact to anyone who loves the genre .	1
This series of love was just what I expected of Mrs. Jackson . She never disappoints ! I 've been a fan of hers for long time . I recommend all her series .	1
great read from beginning to end . the characters come alive for the reader . ca n't wait to read the rest of the Westmoreland series .	1
Wine and romance perfect combo Bella Andre delivers again , a story of three friends all escaping the daily life of the city and each indulging in their weekend getaway with three men who know how to break down the walls around their hearts . Each struggle with the new found love they have in men know how to wine country after disastrous relationships make them second guess themselves but three Napa men prove to them that a second chance is nothing to be afraid of .	1
I started these in the order they were written , not that it matters , just my choice . Each one was better than the one before . I do n't like to divulge too much info as it spoils the read sometimes . The brief descriptions give me enough to go on as to whether I want to read a book or not . These were really page turners and just when you thought you knew , you were wrong ... or were you . I really enjoyed these and look forward to more .	1
Great value for the money . I am a fan of the author and when i got a kindle it was one of my first purchases . I had read a few of the books in the collection years ago , but this way i got to re-read and it didnt cost a fortune .	1
Great story . This author is really good . First time reading her . Ca n't wait to pick up this storyline with the next McKettrick !	1
As always Sharon sala comes away with another amazing story ! Thanks for another great read . They keep getting better and better !	1
Whether writing as Dinah McCall or Sharon Sala , this author never fails to deliver a well crafted story . I enjoy stories about realistic people and this is a fast paced , intense love story and drama .	1
I enjoyed the reader 's digest very much . If I could figure out how to get it on my Kinkle I would	1
I 'm well old enough to remember when the Reader 's Digest did not have advertising ( it began accepting ads in the 1970s ) . I quit buying Reader 's Digest because it seemed to contain nothing but advertising , and was difficult to find articles . The Kindle edition of Reader 's Digest solves that problem nicely . No ads . Just the articles and regular features .	1
I loveddddddddd it . Amazing , something new for me to read . I was so into this book and I am starting to read this author more , love her writing style and would recommend . By the way LOVED the ending when they reunited in her father 's office *sighing*	1
Adventure , thrills , action , great detection . Who can do better than Sherlock Holmes ? I love this collection so much that I have read them 3 times so far ! ! !	1
This authorized 2-volume set ( joined into one fabulous ebook ) from Random House/Bantam contains ALL the Sherlock Holmes novels and ALL the collections of Sherlock Holmes short stories , including ALL the stories in `` The Case Book of Sherlock Holmes '' frequently omitted from some other so-called `` complete '' sets ; this set truly is 100 % complete . EVERYTHING Sir Arthur Conan Doyle ever wrote about Sherlock Holmes is here : all 4 novels and all 56 short stories . The informative introduction by Loren D. Estleman is an added bonus ( though it appears twice in this ebook version , once at the start of each of the 2 volumes as originally published in paperback by Bantam ) . This ebook edition is very well-formatted , comfortable to read , has an active TOC ( in which the short stories are presented in proper order ) , and even accurately depicts the graphic representations in `` The Dancing Men , '' unlike many other versions which substitute the word `` graphics '' for the drawings . This is undoubtedly the very best Sherlock Holmes collection currently available in the Kindle Store . ( The non-Holmes set of 10 `` Tales of Mystery and Terror '' is sometimes added to incomplete Holmes sets to boost their story total . There is no need for this complete Sherlock Holmes set to do so , but if you want it , `` Tales of Mystery and Terror '' is easily obtained separately as a public domain freebie in the Kindle Store . ) So if you love reading these beloved classic Sherlock Holmes mysteries , this is THE ebook edition to purchase -- and paying only $ 2.99 for Bantam quality ( rather than going with some incomplete , unauthorized , no-name , ebook bundler ) is a very good deal.ADDENDUM : Since the above was written Maplewood Books has come out with a now updated and truly complete edition of its own at 1/3 the price of this Bantam version . `` Sherlock Holmes : The Ultimate Collection '' costs only $ .99 and is one you may wish to compare to this .	1
One cent per month ? Ok . I bit.I 'm glad I did . Updated several times a day ( whenever they feel like blogging ) on a wide variety of subjects . The other day an article was about an early 1970s car , and how it influenced later models , etc . We had thoughts on the Grammy Awards , recipes , new devices , book reviews , on and on.Previously , I would turn the Whispernet ( or whatever it is called ) off in the morning after receiving my newspapers . Now , I tend to leave it on all day so I can enjoy ( or skip , as the case may be ) any new Amazon blog.Why not five stars ? Due to the presence , in many articles , of links for you to click : IF you were on a computer . Since the Kindle will not follow those links , they are a bit intrusive at times.UPDATE : Now its free ? Heck , why not .	1
This was a good Highland series book , I enjoyed it very much and you will also , Just a fun read .	1
Whoever wrote the synopsis of the story did not read it . She was n't trying to drive him away with sweetness . She really was sweet . Though apparently not to sweet to casually give away her virginity . But give her credit she is smart enough not to mention it to him and get away with it . No real point to telling him . I know some readers felt that she should have remained a virgin because of the time period . But unfortunately girls have been talked out of it by the wrong guy throughout history . Nothing new on that front . Anyway still a pretty good story .	1
I really enjoy the character & # 34 ; Hawke & # 34 ; created by this author . Who expects a the piano player in the bar to be a gunfighter fast as lightning ! This series is enjoyable to say the least . Vaughan writes good stories .	1
Have read all of the Hawke series and just wish there were more of them ... Hopefully Mr. Vaughan will write more of them ...	1

D'Arc draws the reader in to her story from page one , engendering familiarity with her characters as if the reader has known them for some time.Belora 's and Gareth 's love is a tender , almost innocent romance , but do n't let that fool you . The story is filled with plenty of spicy scenes , including m & eacute ; nage scenes ! Setting the story in a fantasy realm gives the author a prime opportunity to create a valid reason for the m & eacute ; nage , and she not only makes you understand it , but agree with it.If you love dragons , knights , and sweet romances chock full of sexiness , this is a must-read !

Reviewed by Donna B. at You Got ta Read Reviews - A sweet taste of the forbidden , both arousing and potent , ensnares Angie as her boss entices her to spend Christmas at his house , in his bed . As she falls for his overwhelming charms , they are both surprised by the early arrival of his holiday houseguest . Ryan has always shared with his best friend , Wade , but as Wade sets his sights on Angie , Ryan begins to realize that sometimes , it 's better to act like Scrooge.Mackenzie McKade has spun an explicitly erotic tale of wicked , wanton acts and turned it into a heartwarming romance . Her descriptions are vivid and clear , her characters have chemistry in spades , and the tale is sexy as sin in Bound for the Holidays .	1
Sleeping with the boss is a bad idea . Angela Clarke tells herself this , but ca n't seem to care when Ryan Tyler wraps his arms around her on the dance floor at the company Christmas party . His proposition to spend the night with him is definitely much more appealing than spending Christmas Eve alone ... But she never expected the night to include handcuffs , or the unexpected arrival of Ryan 's best friend ! Ryan 's personal policy against fraternization no longer seems important since he hired Angie . He knows he must have her , at least for one night . But when sharing her with his best friend rouses uncharacteristic feelings of possessiveness in him , he realizes one night will never be enough ... Forget everything you THINK you know about Christmas stories ! I do n't care if you say you do n't like them , this one is smoking hot ! Truly , the holiday theme is really more of a backdrop for a very sexy and intense romance , complete with a m & eacute ; nage scene ! While this is n't a story about a m & eacute ; nage relationship , the scene serves very well to propel the romance between Angie and Ryan , acting as the catalyst that makes Ryan realize his deeper feelings for Angie.Once again , the readers benefit from Mackenzie McKade 's obvious love of cowboys with the supporting character , Wade . Not only is Wade hot and sexy , but he brings enough of his own story to make readers hungry for a sequel starring the dominant cowboy.I 'll say it again , while Bound for the Holidays is classified as a holiday story , no one who reads it will think of it as such . McKade has penned a steamy contemporary romance that will guarantee satisfaction year round !	1
Newly employed Angela Clark is at her company 's annual Christmas party . When her oh-so-sexy boss Ryan Tyler approaches and asks if she is familiar with layouts , she almost misinterprets his meaning and finds herself wanting to be laid out for his pleasure .

Because Christmas is the time for dreams , Ryan decides to test the waters to see if Angie will acknowledge what her eyes promise . Getting her alone takes a bit of planning since he happens to be her boss ; but once he gets her to his home , he has no plans to let her go.A possible snag hits the lover 's plans . Ryan 's best friend , Wade , has come to visit a bit early and wants to partake of Angie 's alluring charms as well . With this , Ryan finds himself in a bit of a dilemma ; for the first time in his life , Ryan does not want to share.Happy Holidays m & eacute ; nage lovers ! BOUND FOR THE HOLIDAYS made me put down my hot chocolate and grab some ice water ! Extremely sensual lovemaking and heady emotions get me every time , and Mackenzie McKade delivers that and more with BOUND FOR THE HOLIDAYS . Angie could be any woman who is attracted to her boss , and the fact that her feelings are reciprocated makes it all the more special . I loved watching Ryan 's feelings for Angie change from simple attraction to intense love.Mackenzie McKade has to be one of the most versatile writers I have the privilege of reading . Whether she is writing about vampires , bondage , cowboys , or a m & eacute ; nage , I can count on her to deliver a well-written , often naughty story that will keep me yearning for more . BOUND FOR THE HOLIDAYS needs to be in everyone 's stocking this season ! BOUND FOR THE HOLIDAYS releases on December 19 , 2006 from Samhain Publishing .	1
I would n't have exactly called this a prequel because it 's only a breath width 's in relation to the rest of the series . It 's not a bad story on its own . I got this one in late 2009 for free for my Kindle and I just now got to it on my & # 34 ; To Be Read & # 34 ; pile . It was short enough that I did n't mind the lack of chapter demarcations . I get ticked when they are n't in longer books at least 4 times the length of this one , but they 're nice in books that are 3 times this one 's length . If you like light suspense and a little bit of slap and tickle , this novella might be for you . If you like other books that are about intrigue or mystery I think you should give this one a shot . Have at it because I do n't think you 'll be disappointed . Just do n't expect a hugely fleshed out story for one this short . I ca n't wait to read the next one .	1
The day ( Friday ) before AJ is set to marry Kyle , she finds out her ex Cooper is going to be at the wedding . Cooper is having trouble accepting that AJ has moved on , but plans to go to the wedding for closure . Cooper 's is a very distant relative to a god , Eros , who is bored and decides to complicate AJ and Cooper 's lives . Eros makes it where AJ and Cooper repeat Friday over and over again . For a week solid they are repeating this day over . AJ and Cooper are still very much in love , but are fighting it.This book kept me very entertained ! I got a total kick out of the bored got Eros.Great light read for everyone to read !	1
This is a sweet read about true love . Everyone always has a day that they want to do over . This couple gets so much more than just a do over . AJ and Cooper will continue to try until they get it right whether they want to or not . The Gods don & # 8217 ; t give second chances so easily and when they do they make you work for it . Is their love strong enough to break the cycle or are they going to chase their dreams forever ? I enjoyed Cooper and AJ & # 8217 ; s story . The two truly love one another and make a great couple . As they work through their past mistakes the love that they have for each other shines through and they only need to grab it . As we watch the two repeat their day we see so much happen with just a split second decision in your day so much can change . It was interesting to see how their day would unfold with each new decision and with each change their bond only grows stronger.I received a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review .	1
Aislinn Campbell has done her best to keep from becoming too attached to anyone . Running from her ex has her moving from place to place after several months but for the first time she is unable to remain detached from the people around her . To complicate matters even further , she 's falling for her boss and has witnessed his death in a clairvoyant vision.Ex-Special Forces operative and owner of Turner Industries , Kyle Turner III , knows everything there is to know about Aislinn . He 's had her carefully investigated and he 's perfectly aware that she never stays in one place for more than eight months because of her abusive ex . She 's been his personal assistant for the past six months and he 'd desperately like to get to know her on more ` intimate ' terms . An anonymous email warning him that somebody would kill him in a kitchen gives him just the advantage he needs.Kyle 's been very thorough in finding out all about Aislinn to the point that he even knows about her clairvoyant abilities . Kyle 's decided that it 's time to show Aislinn that the passion brewing between them is too powerful to ignore . Aislinn tries to deny him - and herself . She even turns down dinner with him , until he uses his ace in the hole and mentions that if she does n't go out to eat with him then he 'll have to go home and eat in his ` lonely kitchen . ' He has no doubts that the warning email came from Aislinn and is n't above using it to his advantage . It 's obvious Aislinn is as attracted to him as he is to her but her fears about her ex are keeping her from even considering any sort of permanent relationship . Kyle 's positive he can protect her . . . all he has to do is prove it to her . Simple right ? Well , maybe not quite as simple as you 'd think.Annmarie McKenna 's TWO SIGHTED will delight readers with the fun array of characters , witty conversations , sexual innuendos , and enough suspense to keep you riveted to the pages . I loved the intensity of the relationship between Kyle and Aislinn . And I got a kick out of her friend Christina and Kyle 's ` groupies ' as she refers to them , Jon and JT , playful banter and sexual interest among the three of them . Ms. McKenna does a wonderful job blending emotional situations into the plot so that you genuinely care about what happens with each character and never want the story to end . Fortunately , Ms. McKenna does treat us to Christina , Jon and JT 's story in her follow up book - THE STRENGTH OF THREE - which is currently available.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1
i thoroughly enjoyed reading the book called Two Sighted . It was a very easy read and a lot of fun .	1
I loved this book for the originality of the basic premise . I was not familiar with the Matthew Hope series , but will definitely read more . I have always enjoyed the 87th precinct series . His character development continues to be excellent .	1
This is a very good book that marks the end of the Allan Quartermaine era in Africa . Great chases , battles , hunts , romance , and adventures fill its pages with a believable story and life-like characters .	1
It was written in an earlier time , but once you get past some of the stereotypes , you will just enjoy it . I did n't really want it to end .	1
Allan Quatermain is the final adventure of that hero as penned by the magnificent H. Rider Haggard.The beginning may the best I 've ever read . Who else but Haggard would start a story with the death of the main character 's only child . There is an amazing battle as well.The middle dragged pretty heavily for me . However , that was redeemed by a thrilling finale . Umslopogaas is a character that reaches out and grabs you , and his finale suited him well . I have to think he was one of Haggard 's favorite characters.Grab the free Kindle version , and you wo n't regret it .	1
& # 34 ; I am your father , Indy & # 34 ; . Great story of Africa in the last century and adventure for the pure love of adventure . And Indiana Jones continued the tradition into our century .	1
Yes , much of this story ( as with others in the Hot Zone series ) is superficial and silly - old fashioned letter writing , suddenly falling in love with the computer geek from work , the entire scene at the male strip club , etc . But , that 's kind of the fun of these stories . Personally , I 'm a sucker for a hot military hero or cowboy romance , and Male Call ( despite the awful pun ) reeled me in . For an hour or so worth of reading , this story is definitely enjoyable .	1
This romance book bundles the stories of heroes Sawyer , Morgan , Gabe and Jordan , 4 brothers who live together in their childhood home . Sawyer is the doctor , Morgan is the sheriff , Gabe is the laid back handyman and Jordan is the vet . Each man is in some way the pillar of their small town community , and other than being womanizers ( in a nice and respectful way ) , they are all perfect . For that I gave a 1 star deduction . One decent , halo-over-his-head glowing , handsome , tall , muscular , sexy , honest , single , well-endowed , straight brother is amazing , two is shocking , three is a stretch , and four is defying the laws of possibility.Other than that each story was funny , sweet , and thoroughly enjoyable.Sawyer is a divorced , single father of a teenage son who runs his medical practice from his home and does housecalls . He meets Honey when she loses control of her car and crashes into his fence . Turns out she 's suffering from pneumonia but is running from someone who 's out to get her . Sawyer shelters her and takes care of her and in the course of that they fall in love.Morgan is single , large and a temper to match . At least he only pretends to have a temper . His bark is worse than his bite , but everyone is so afraid of him that his scowl is enough to keep miscreants out of his town and everyone else on their best behavior . Misty , Honey 's sister , enters the picture when she shows up to help Honey prepare for the wedding . Morgan takes an instant dislike to her , a dislike which is only amplified by his attraction to her . He thinks she 's too seductive and flirtatious and a walking billboard for trouble . What 's more , Misty is broke , unemployed , and pregnant . Wrongly accused of stealing and had arrested and charged by her boss , then abandoned by her boyfriend when she announced her pregnancy . After learning of her situation , Morgan does a 180 on his opinion of her and works to clear her name.Gabe is the town 's handyman extraordinaire . He meets Lizzy , a redhead he does n't find particularly attractive at first , when she comes to interview him for a paper she 's writing on people who have performed heroic acts . Not only is Lizzy carrying around a lot of guilt over the death of her mother , but she has serious self-confidence issues . This is a true story of opposites attract . Gabe is as laid back as can be , who spends most of his free time lollygagging around the water and sunning himself . He is well aware of his attractiveness to the opposite sex and his own virility . Lizzy is as uptight as one can get , freckles and burns if she spends more than a few minutes in the sun , and has no confidence in attractiveness or anything else.Jordan is the vet with the golden voice . Georgia is a single mother of two who works as a dancer/waitress to provide for her children and ailing mother . Burnt badly by her ex-husband , she does n't trust men and does n't know what to make of 4 men who seem to spend their lives bending over backwards to help others . Especially Jordan , who is great with her children and who has her mother eating out of his hand . Of all the books , this one is the funniest . Jordan 's reaction to seeing Georgia dance in a skimpy outfit was priceless . However , of all the books , this one focuses too much on the other secondary characters . Between the romance brewing between Georgia 's mother and Misty & Honey 's father , and Sawyer 's son , I felt a bit shortchanged on the main characters love story.What I liked about all the stories is that everyone is likable . So many times in romances we get bombarded with alpha male , testosterone laden , treat the women like doormats heroes , it 's nice to get men who are both manly and sensitive . All the women had spunk which is something I also like . They all stood up for themselves when the situation called for it.Likable characters and cute stories . Recommend .	1
Lori Foster is hit or miss for me , but usually does an excellent job with shorter stories and anthologies . She 's able to make her characters come to life , even with the shorter word count , and can maintain the pacing , tension , and sizzle . These books are all part of her earlier work and are surprisingly good . I like the `` alpha '' , protective aspects of the brothers , and the way they take care of those they love . This bundle is a great value . Enjoy !	1
I love these guys ! Ca n't say it enough ! I bought the books individually , but this bundle is definitely the better way to go . Did I mention I love my Buckhorn Brothers ? ? ? : - )	1
I love a good highland story and have read a few in this series . A bit slow in some parts , but still a great read . Several of the chapters in my copy , had unfinished sentences at the end of each chapter , but was able to figure out missing words . Enjoy .	1
After reading the Duke 's story , I knew I had to read his brother 's story as well . It was even better than the first book !	1
I 'm so glad I found the sequel ! I enjoyed both books immensely . This is how Historical romance should be done ! ! !	1
I already liked the cheeky hero from reading about him in the first book , An Inconvenient Duchess . Always love a bad boy ! What makes this story so funny to me is him trying his best to stay out of the heroine 's clutches ( well , not really clutches ) and maintaining his honor . It is quite the turn around from a rakish hellion ! I started and finished the story in one day - it is a quick - but satisfying - read . It flows smoothly and has just enough tension . It is n't deep but it is good and I 'm heading out to find more of her stories !	1
This book is the sequel to The Inconvenient Duchess and focuses on the villain of that book . After leaving with the emerald necklace the Duchess gave him , he had joined the army and served with distinction . After he leaves the army , he must live one year scandal free if he wants a reward offered to him by the Prince Regent.Esme Danville lives with her abusive father who wants to marry her off to a man his age , if not older and just as abusive . Seeing no way out , she decides to become someone 's mistress and thus get the marriage called off . After seeing St. John breaking up with his mistress without laying a hand on her , she decides he is the one she wants . After hearing her outlandish and most unladylike proposal , he refuses and ends up taking her to his brother 's house , a place he is not welcome . They do agree that they may stay under certain conditions . The duchess tries to introduce her to eligible men without success . Esme only has eyes for St. John who is trying to live down his infamous and deal with an addiction to laudanum he uses to deal with wartime memories . It is hard to ignore Esme and his resolve slowly starts to crumble.After their inevitable return to London , Esme has to endure abuse from her father and despairs of not seeing St. John again . He does get the reward and faces one challenge after another to rescue her and get their happily ever after.Because I always wanted to know what happened to him after the end of the first book , I went ahead and bought this one.I think it is good and it kept my attention , something not all Regencies do . I do recommend it to others who read the first book not only because of St. John , but also shows how the people in the first book have prospered . I do suggest they read the books in order as events in the first book are mentioned more than once .	1
I did n't think I would enjoy reading about St. John Radwell after reading The Inconvenient Dutchess but the author turned his character into one well liked . Definitely worth reading !	1
My Favorite of the series . It is the story of Esme Canville and St John Radwell . St John was the villain in the first book of the series , The Inconvenient Duchess . In the years since the last novel , St John has transformed himself and is in the process of making himself into a respectable person . Esme , however , is looking for the villain . In order to avoid the arranged marriage her father has planned for her , Esme seeks St john to compromise her . St John , however , delivers her to his brother ( with whom he continues to have a strained relationship ) . As could be expected , however , Esme and St John become involved in a relationship.I enjoyed this book because of the character of St john . I really disliked him in the first book and almost stopped reading the book because of him . However , he has completely redeemed himself and I was deeply interested in how he has remade himself but still has to deal with his past . His care and consideration of Esme despite his temptation demonstrates how his character has changed.The book is a lighter read and is not overly complicated or intense , but I enjoyed it and recommend it .	1
I enjoy western with mystery and romance ! This was very good story about times gone by . I love that kind of story !	1
I finished The Stranger almost 3 months ago but could n't put my thoughts on it into words for a review.After reading the first few chapter I was unsure on whether I 'd read or not . I did n't like the idea of the hero deceiving the heroine but he grew on me and so did this story.5 years ago , Caleb and his half brothers pass the Shafton farm house and ask for a meal . Laura Shafton 's naive husband welcomes the strangers with open arms and soon the unthinkable happens when one the brothers attempts to rape the pregnant Laura her . Caleb tries to stop his brother but Laura 's trauma over the attempted attack and the murder of her husband has her implementing all of the brothers in the crimes including Caleb . The 3 brothers leave and Laura is left scarred , traumatized and a widow with a baby on the way.Fast forward 5 years later . After being released from prison ( being the caught scapegoat while his brothers get away ) , Caleb still remembers the pretty Laura Shafton and what happened at that ranch . He passes by wondering if she 's okay and what happened to her . When he gets there he finds Laura and her 4 year old son and seeing her scarred face and haunted eyes brings back the memories . To absolve himself for even being there , he offers to help her around her ranch . She cautiously takes the stranger 's offer and soon finds herself befriending the mysterious and rugged Caleb while her son falls in love with having a male figure around.I was really surprised to find myself actually liking this story . Laura is such a strong heroine . You 'll cry for all she 's lost in family , raising her son alone and losing her confidence in showing her face in town embarrassed by her scarred face . How she survived her ordeal and kept on moving makes her a heroine to love . Caleb is a hero you sympathize with . As a half breed ( American/Native American ) , you feel for him wanting to be around his brothers and accepted but realizing how evil they are and trying to fully break free from their holds even when they 're not around.I enjoyed Caleb and Laura separated and definitely together and her son is adorable and his relationship with Caleb and Caleb 's `` fatherly '' patience with him made me like Caleb even more.Overall : I 'd definitely pick this one up if I were you . Take it from one picky reader when I say that .	1
I have the Desert Rouge series all in paperback . I read them over and over . I 'm so glad that I can now get them as ebooks .	1
I discovered Jennifer Crusie 'late ' and really enjoy her books . As these are backlist books its a bit of a trip down a nineties memory lane ( where they have to use pay phones to make calls and use newspaper clippings for research ! ) . That said the plots are great , you want to believe in the characters and the romance is spot on .	1
This book was very good , but I wish it had more of an insight of what happened to Lance , Gabe and Evan after the island . How they managed their lives together . But all in all this was a good book . I recommend reading it if you are in the mood for a hot menage !	1
Great series so far . The second book is as wonderful as the first . The caricatures are wonderfully funny and endearing . Definitely worth the read . These books are short but you really get to know the caricatures .	1
This was a short novella and it had good tempo ! Bargaining with the devil sometimes makes strange bedfellows ( no pun intended )	1
second wind , a midsummer 's night steam . was written very well , i did enjoy your book , please continue to write , thank you	1
K.A . Mitchell is my favorite M/M author , her ability to create realistic characters is amazing . I love that in this story both men would be what I would call Alpha types , even though it 's primarily Jeff in charge , Ryan also steps up . Very realistic storyline , Jeff ca n't let out that he 's gay for fear of losing the time he has with his daughter , Ryan was in the Air Force so he 's been in that same scenario where he has to hide that part of him . The sex scenes this author writes are incredibly descriptive & erotic ; makes me feel a little like a voyeur ! I do agree with the other reviewers that the book does end abruptly and hope the story is continued.What I did n't like : 2/3 of the book is the story , the last 1/3 of the kindle book is advertisements for other books to read/buy . So very short story , but still a great quick read that I feel was worth the price .	1
At age of twenty-six , Lady Cicely Ware is considered to be quite on the shelf . She 's quite determined however , not to let spinsterhood keep her from knowing what it feels like to experience passion and she quickly comes up with a list of rakes that she believes will be able to teach her . She 's always been halfway in love with Douglas , the Duke of Ethingham , so during a waltz she propositions him . Douglas is stunned when Cicely asks him to seduce her and quickly refuses . Although Cicely is disappointed she resolves to move on to the next gentleman on her list . However , very much against his will , Douglas discovers that he ca n't allow Cicely to be in anyone 's arms but his . As they begin a sensuous journey , Douglas is stunned to find that every moment in Cicely 's company makes him only want her more . As they finally begin to realize that they are falling deeply in love , Cicely 's life is threatened and Douglas will do whatever is necessary to protect her . As the attacks continue can he find the person responsible before it 's too late ? Without a doubt Melissa Schroeder gets better with each and every book ! I love historical romance and admit to being a bit of a historical romance snob , so it takes a lot for me to truly become absorbed in a book in this genre . Melissa Schroeder 's Accidental series has certainly hooked me and Lessons in Seduction is a scrumptious feast that all readers of romance will want to devour !

Dragon Knights is a world where Knights ride dragons and not slay them . Wings of Change ( I Dream of Dragons I ) is a Novella that can be read before FireDrake or after . It give some backgroung and insite into Helos and the Gryphons . It does not advance the story line but does enhance it . Another enjoyable read in the Dragon Knight relm .	1
this is the fifth book in bianca d'arc 's dragon seriesi loved this story , the characters were amazing as to be expectedi love this series and would highly recommend it to anybody	1
I HAVE NOW READ ALL OF THE BOOKS IN THIS SERIES . LOVED EVERYONE OF THEM . THE CHARACTERS ARE AMAZING . I HIGHLEY RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ANYONE WHO LOVES ROMANCE , ACTION , SECRETS , SEX , INTRIGUE . I HAVE EVEN PRE-ORDERED THE NEXT BOOK THAT IS DUE OUT IN AUGUST . I CA N'T WAIT . BIANCA D'ARC WRITING IS AMAZING . ONCE I GET THROUGH READING THIS SERIES . I AM GOING TO START READING HER OTHER BOOKS . IF THEY ARE HALF AS GOOD AS THIS SERIES . THEY WILL BE AWSOME . THANK YOU BIANCA FOR GIVING ME A WONDERFUL TIME READING YOUR BOOKS .	1
I really enjoy this world of wild magic , with fantasy and romance . The unusual relationships are dealt with well . It 's good to see the diversity of the characters and worlds work so well .	1
You can not read this book without feeling the love and sexual adventure that exploded from the pages ... ..this is truly an exciting book	1
I enjoyed this book . It was fun to catch up to the youngest Mackenzie . I wish the book had been more a full length story , but it was good for a short story .	1
Vaughan has written a great western with a well chosen character in Hawke and supporting characters . You will enjoy reading this western and want to read more .	1
Francesca Hayley was having an affair with Italian millionaire Angelo Falcone . She tells him that she ca n't keep having an affair with him . He is n't very happy with that decision.Three years later Angelo has another chance with Francesca but he never saw the outcome coming.Many people do n't like books like this but this is the kind that I love and I can never get enough .	1
Langley never fails to deliver . I love a good shifter tale and this one definitely pleases . Dev is a reluctant hero , rising to the occasion to save his mate , Lainey , from an abusive alpha . Lainey is a spunky , cute , klutz who keeps his handsome mate , and the reader , laughing and groaning in turns at his antics . This fast-paced , sensual story kept me turning pages to find out what happened next . This one has a permanent place on my reader , because once was n't enough .	1
I absolutely love the `` funny '' werewolves of J.L . Langley . After Without Reservation , here it is With Love : Dev is a strong werewolf who arrives to Asheville for business . Like every good werewolf he wants to meet the local Alpha to give his respect to the leader . But the local alpha is a really piece of shit : when he meets him the alpha is trying to rape Lainey , an omega werewolf . So Dev saves Lainey only to find that he is his mate.Lainey is a little tiny beautiful man with red hair and amber eyes and with a propension for making trouble . But he is also an eager puppy in bed and Dev likes him very much , so does it matter if he will spend his life to take off from troubles his mate ? Here , like in the other books of J.L . Langley , the humor is a main aspect of the novel . She has a way to make you happy and to leave you with a smile in your face and also eager to read more . I ca n't wait to read the next enstallment in this wonderful series .	1
This turned out to be my favorite story in the anthology , Hearts from the Ashes . I found the idea of an alpha and omega werewolf romance to be refreshing . Yes , Laney is very much like an uke in a traditional yaoi story - but , I like yaoi . He is a little effeminate , which may seem stereotypical , but there are men like this . Certainly not all gay men , or even all `` bottoms . '' Yet , I rarely see readers griping about how so many romances have strong , handsome men either - why are n't they short and ugly to avoid being stereotypical ? Because this is a fantasy romance not real life ! Laney 's clumsiness is a little over the top , but his relationship with Dev is sweet and hot . I would have liked the characters to be more developed , but this is a short story not a novel . Langley sets the stage for her `` With or Without '' werewolf series , which gets more depth in the next two novels.Overall , I have enjoyed everything from this author , especially the werewolves . Check out the next two : Without ReservationsandWith Caution . Highly recommended .	1
Fans of the `` with '' series should recognise the overall wold in this short story . While this could be read as an unofficial prequel to the series , as these characters are mentioned briefly ( though not by name ) in Without Reservations , if you are unfamiliar with these novels I would read it after the first full novel . I enjoyed this one and did n't find Laine irritating like some others did ; not everyone can be perfect and it was a nice change from some other shorts I 've read . If you enjoy the series you 'll probably like this addition to it as well , I did .	1
Lady Amelia 's Secret Lover is a delightful short story about a couple who love each other dearly , but have grown complacent and comfortable in their marriage . It is funny , touching , and clever . I loved the way the tables kept being turned , and how the plot wove in and about the characters . The prose flows beautifully and is a joy to read . Lovely !	1
Lots of questions , lots of answers , all tied up together ! Am I ca n't put it down book ! Plan on reading it straight through .	1
I absolutely love Maggie Shayne 's books . I love how the stories stand alone but also tie together to reveal a wider world . This collection does not disappoint . Through the volume , the reader gets to follow the lives of multiple vampire couples as they try to secure their place in their world , find true love and stay out of the clutches of an evil government agency that is hell bent on destroying them . Great binge reading material !	1
Wings in the night , is a continuous arrangement of love stories telling how each character came to be . It is beautifully written and flows from one book to the next . I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great paranormal read !	1
This series was the first one that sucked me into vampires and the reading world in general . I picked up Wings in the Night and just could NOT put it down . So many amazing characters and I just love it so much . Maggie Shayne never ceases to amaze or thrill me with her incredible books . Get it ! ! You wo n't be disappointed ! : )	1

Absolutely fantastic series ! Sexy vamps , scary bad guys , well told . Loved all the heroes and heroines equally ... ca n't pick a favorite . Want more ! ! ! Please !	1
The Wings on the Night series is enchanting ! This series was the series that led me to Maggie Shayne , who I adore . I fell in love with the vampires from her series & reading this collection only served to deepen that love ! I own this entire series , but I jumped on the chance to own this collection on my Kindle app . Part one contains some of my favorite characters - Rihanna , Roland , Tamara , Eric , and list goes on and on ! Grab this collection and step into the enchanting stories of the immortal vampire ! Embrace the night & fall in love with these amazing characters ! P.S . Maggie is getting read to return to these characters in a new series ! Catch up one your reading while we wait For the new novels !	1
I love cowboy romances and Patrice is an excellent romance writer . I 've read a number of her books and will keep reading . I rather read then watch a movie .	1
How can you go wrong ? ! Hot steamy and a cowboy ! A little too short but yet good story . Readable in a few hours .	1
Rafe and Emma forever , I luved this book so much and wish i could read more of those two . Sad that book was too short , but i guess oh well ! ! ! Was happy that it was the best ever after for the both of them ! ! !	1
Great book . Second book of Jennie Lucas that I have read , and I have liked them both . This book has all the greats , romance , fights , turmoil , and then the love . The author is great I ca n't wait to find more of hers !	1
Love Stephanie Bond ! Comical stories , keeps you wanting more . Ca n't wait for another one . Romance an clumsiness with a little calamity lol !	1
Stephanie Bond is entertaining and never into all the unnecessary descriptive sex . She tells a good story without all the junk .	1
Fun holiday story and interesting characters . The story was unique with Cindy getting into some really funny situations . Bond is a very good writer , easy to read .	1
This is a very quick and easy read . The story is engaging and well written . The characters are real and the story line believable enough for a lovely story . If the book description catches your interest , reading the book should too .	1
London , 1817It 's time for another meeting of the BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB . This time it 's Ross Benson 's turn to share his wild tale of a sexual exploit that resulted from a reckless moment.Ross Benson is wealthy , titled , and thoroughly enjoys the London social scene and all that it entails . He 's earned a reputation among the women and has been very careful to avoid interacting with marriage minded young women and innocents . The last thing he intends to happen is to seduce the sister of his best friend Timothy.Cassandra Rollins far prefers life in the country . She detests crowds , could n't care less about fashions , and has no interest in any of the things that most women covet . She 's a true bluestocking and thrives on furthering her knowledge of the world about her through her love of books . The only trait that she shares with the shallow society women is her adoration of Ross.Cassandra 's sleep is interrupted by the return of her brother and Ross 's voices singing bawdy songs that certainly were n't meant for a lady to hear . The men are obviously inebriated but she does n't grow concerned until the singing stops and she hears a thud and a low curse . When she opens the door to check on them , Timothy is passed out in a sitting position outside his own bedroom with Ross trying unsuccessfully to rouse him . They manage to get Timothy to his bed and then Ross admits that he ca n't remember which guest room is his . Cassandra makes the offer to escort him to his room so that he does n't end up climbing into bed with her very formidable aunt . From a maidenly point of view , that offer of assistance may turn out to be a mistake . As she 's getting ready to leave him to ready himself for bed , Ross requests that she kiss him good night and she finds that she ca n't deny him the request and soon does n't want to deny him or the pleasures that they 'll both find in his bed . Will they come to regret the results of their reckless moment ? IN A RECKLESS MOMENT is the third book in Emma Wildes ' BROTHERS OF THE ABSINTHE CLUB . This storyline is full of all the loveable characters , passion and suspense that I 've come to eagerly anticipate about this series . I adored Cassandra because she is so different from society ladies . She 's extremely intelligent and honest , not to mention beautiful . With the combination of those traits she manages to snare Ross 's affection and keep him firmly enthralled with her . Ross has been living the ` privileged ' lifestyle for so long he does n't even see how self-indulgent and jaded it is until after he marries Cassandra . There 's just a little issue from his past poses a threat and I have to admit , I was fascinated by that twist to the storyline.While I do personally recommend reading all the books in this series - just because I 've honestly loved them - they can easily be read as stand alone stories and doing so wo n't detract from your enjoyment of them.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1
You are not going to want to be interrupted for one flat second while reading this one ! This one is full of two sweltering hot men and the little lady who loved them ! My level of expectation for this type of book tends to be on the high side of tolerant - I 'm willing to forgive some minor things if the heat is hot enough ( *wink* ) . What a surprise then to be shocked when I found a really great story filled with interesting multi-dimensional characters . This one has it all - lawmen and outlaws , cowboys and ranchers , doctors and rich folk , even Indian captives - and YES a PLOT ! Whoa Nellie ! Devin is a man to die for - hot alpha male all the way . But that 's not all he is . Caleb was also a shocker ( it 's always the quiet ones that give an outward appearance of propriety that will shock your socks off ! ) . And Meg - well boy howdy did she develop in this novel.I ca n't remember that last time I really got so invested in a relationship that I was talking to my Kindle . I may be old but I ai n't crazy . This is like a blockbuster movie by some A list director - completely worth the dollar 's to check out . Fantastic ! I want more !	1
I honestly do n't remember this book off the top of my head so I sadly would have to say that nothing stood out for me	1
This is a fun and engaging story , and frankly I have enjoyed this book much more than I expected . Good action sequences and continuous plot twists . A great story for scifi fans .	1
I ENJOYED THIS SET OF BOOKS SO MUCH . IT IS A TIMELESS WORK OF ART . THERE IS SO MUCH ACTION , ADVENTURE , LOVE AND SUSPENCE . I THINK IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING IN SCHOOLS . WHAT A GREAT STORY .	1
Burroughs ' Barsoom novels were among the first science fantasy books I read as a child long ago . In fact , I still have all eleven volumes in their original Ballantine Books paperbacks stashed in a box , along with numerous works by Heinlein , Clarke , Asimov , and others from the 1960 's and 70 's that I ca n't stand the idea of giving up . At least I know I can read them digitally when I want to . Too bad the entire series is n't part of this set.Burroughs ' writing style would be considered comically stereotyped and hackneyed by modern standards , but the themes of chivalry , bravery , and respect for others are timeless - even though they might be considered out of style by modern standards . Some ideas are worth preserving , and IMO these types of stories do that very well.I grew up with these types of stories . I want to make sure my grandson can , too .	1
I bought this to read before I saw the movie . It can be tedious because our language has changed so much . The way the female characters are portrayed is indicative of the period in which the novels were written . Of course the science is way off base buth then this was written long , long ago in another culture .	1
I bought this series because I had heard about the movie out recently and needed something to read for a trip . I had never read anything by this author , but of course had seen the Tarzan movies as a kid . I was pleasantly surprised although it takes some getting used to the style of writing . I thouroughly enjoyed reading these novels .	1
I wanted to read this before I watched the movie of the same name . I am glad I did . Burroughs tells a great story but is a bit long winded at times . Overall the story is great and worth the read .	1
This was a really fun read ! I loved the writing style . All the characters had personality and were exciting to read about ! I loved the little twist at the end : ) Great story !	1
I really enjoyed this Victorian Romance by Diana Bold . Her hero had always tried to be perfect , always tamping down his own needs and desires . But Emma , the brash American he marries for money , turns his world upside down . I will definitely read some of her other books .	1
Once again Diana Bold has written an enjoyable story full of rich complex characters . You ca n't help but root for the hoydonish American and her straight-laced British hero . I enjoy how all of her stories have a different approach to romance . She writes with the same intriguing tone and yet none of them mimic the other except in her broad range of storytelling.Emma has come to London with one purpose in mind -- use her over generous dowry to win a titled husband . She is determined to fulfill her mother 's dying wish to show the American society who shunned her that she could land a peer . She is equally determined to find a man for herself . A man she could love . Michael is in need of an heiress . But will he be able to handle this fire-branded American ? Will he be strong enough to let go of his British reserve for the love he has always longed for ? I fell in love with her secondary characters as well . Emma 's father was my favorite character -- he cut to the chase which I loved . Jane was another favorite of mine and I believe her story strengthened the book instead of detracting from it . Altogether it was another solid story by Diana and I will look eagerly for the next in this series .	1
it was a refreshing story . i loved the heroine . the hero seem to be impulsive . the hero got off easy about the money and the things he said to heroine . i would have loved to see the hero punished a little by the heroine .	1
London - 1867Dylan Blake has spent twelve long years in dedicated service to the Crown . He 's sold his commission with the hopes that his father would allow him to take over one of the many Blake estates . His father refused and Dylan 's attempts at finding comparable employment on his own are proving unfruitful . He may be the son of an earl but his situation is getting dire . His has very little funds , is on the verge of being evicted from the boarding house where he 's staying and his father 's hatred for him is blatantly obvious.Because of her large dowry , Lady Natalia Sinclair is a highly sought after young woman . She has no illusions about her many would-be suitors - they 're all far more interested in her monetary value then her . Besides , she 's perfectly aware that her father will select her future husband and therefore the endless parties and courtship techniques are pointless . There 's only one man who appeals to her , Captain Dylan Blake , but he 's a second son and does n't possess a title.Dylan takes great pride in infuriating his father and what better way to accomplish that then to arrive late for his father 's all-important annual ball . Receiving one of the prized invitations is considered a social accomplishment - there are only one hundred guests to his shindig and Dylan throws off the whole thing by arriving late . While most of the guests are horrified at Dylan 's audacity , Natalia is intrigued . She 's read newspaper articles lauding his military accomplishments and would love for a man like him to court her.Dylan escapes from the stuffiness of the ballroom along with his friend Lord Basingstake . Once there , Dylan is confronted by Lord Jonathan who makes a wager regarding Dylan 's ability to charm a woman of Jonathan 's choosing . The woman chosen is Natalia and all Dylan has to do is get her to agree to a second dance - something which no man has thus far been able to accomplish . The wager is for one hundred pounds.While he 's never had any trouble charming any woman , Dylan will soon discover that Natalia is unlike any other woman and she sees right through his good looks and bluster and sees the empty shell of a man he 's become . There 's no emotion behind his request for a dance and because of that simple fact she turns him down . Dylan 's life is about to change in a major way - all because of a good woman who 's too smart to accept any less than all of him . Throw in a few well-hidden family secrets and Dylan may just find the one thing he 's always wanted - someone to love him unconditionally.Diana Bold captivated me with THE AMERICAN HEIRESS and I really wanted to know more about Dylan and Natalia 's story . Dylan 's need for love and acceptance really pulls at the heartstrings and makes you wonder why his father hates him so much . Natalia is impossible not to like - she 's smart , beautiful and not at all pretentious . I loved the emotional turmoil both characters experience throughout this storyline and especially enjoyed how Dylan learns about the family secrets his father tried so hard to keep hidden from him . This is a wonderful tale and I highly recommend both THE WAGER and THE AMERICAN HEIRESS - trust me , you 'll want to read all about Dylan 's brother Michael 's trials and tribulations with a very improper American woman.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1
Great plot and new ideas . The characters are consistent and believable . The suspense is phenomenal and the pace just right to keep you wondering but not ever bored .	1
Author Steve Peek has managed to straddle two worlds , bring his characters through the veils that separate them and still maintain a shroud of mystery around his tale , Longclaws . Are they from the realm we refer to as Hell ? Are they behind the legends of the vampire ? Are they going to cause me to sleep with the lights on for a while ? Longclaws are predators with super-human strength , speed and bravery in their world , where survival is a constant battle . Each member of the clan has an important role to play , vital to their survival , yet , we do not meet them as individuals because that seems unimportant , they are what and who they are , able to see the big picture in the battle for survival , fiercely loyal to their clan and their traditions . When one Leader finds a way to cross the veils that surround their world from ours , it is to survive . Humans are unknown demons to them , weak , yet with the will to survive that is respected by the longclaws . If not for their passing through these veils or ley lines a young boy would never know how to belong to a family , how to feel loved , or how to find self-respect . I wondered if there was a villain in this tale . I saw factions fighting for survival in the only way they knew how ! Steve Peek 's writing style is almost dreamlike , blending Indian folklore , ley lines , myths and legends into a tale that will stay with you , in a hauntingly beautiful way . He grounds his tale with humanity at its finest , everyday people coping with the impossible , often mirroring the clan 's will for survival , but who will win in the end ? On a personal note , I absolutely loved the writing , the plot , the characters , the style , the pace and the world-building ... .my anticipated nightmares , not so much .	1
Author Steve Peek has created a world that embraces many legends , werewolves , vampires , the like , as beings of an alternate dimension . Gates allow them passage to out world . Ancient humans had learned ways to shut those doors down , building such as Stonehenge , the Indian mounds of the Americas , and other such structures around the world . But as humans spread and built , those impediments were destroyed , weakening those lines connected worldwide.And a pack of Longclaws have found a way to cross over into our world . In their own dimension , they are far down the food chain . In our world , they are incredibly fast with claws protruding from hands made for slashing , cutting up their prey.In northern Alabama forests , cut off by a collapsed bridge and rivers swollen by the torrential rains , there will be a battle between the clan of longclaws and two families , the Masons , from a long line that watched the mounds for just such an event , and an old Indian woman and her granddaughter.Most excellent .	1
Bought this kindle version for my mother to read on her ereader ; easy purchase , easy and immediate delivery ; overall transaction great	1
An Arab youth finds an old jar in a cave in Jordan and in it is a scroll . He takes it to Ramallah to his cousin to get it translated because it might have Kabbalist secrets and is questioned by an Israeli security service . His body is found after being rammed by a car.Greg McKenzie , retired OSI from the military , is hot headed and blurts out his opinions , which keeps him from advancement in the military and makes enemies for him with the Nashville Police Dept . when he worked there as a Detective for the D.A . 's office after retirement from the military . Greg and his wife Jill visit Israel and the mid-east where a souvenir street vendor convinces Jill to purchase what appears to be an old scroll and she tucks it in her carryon . After picking up their luggage at the airport on their return , they find the locks on the cases have been cut off and the luggage rifled . Immediately after returning home , Jill suddenly disappears and Greg gets a phone call telling him they will exchange Jill for the scroll . Greg takes it to two different professors who translate the scroll for him . The story continues filled with murder , close escapes , car chases , a Palestinian radical group , an Israeli radical group and Jordan all after this scroll . The story is page turner , fascinating , fast moving and not very long . It is an easy read and entertaining . I recommend it .	1
This book was a fast-moving story from start to finish . I read the next two books in the series and so I purchased this book and I was not unhappy about it . The author did a wonderful job of describing the settings and characters and also the plots . I felt like I was traveling along with the McKenzies on their travels to Israel and also in their hometown of Nashville . Now that I caught up on the background , I am ready to read the next book in the series.Greg and Jill are a wonderful married older couple who are an interesting family and I want to find out more about them and their friends . Also this book has some interesting information about the Holy Land with a modern-day look at the tension between different countries and nationalities . I recommend it to anyone wanting a mystery that makes for a fast read with a lot of action on every	1
Another great Greg McKenzie book-this one involving an ancient manuscript and danger -and the possibility of World War III . A real thriller-another book that I could not put down .	1
This book took longer to read than I feel that it should have . It did n't really capture my attention from the start . There were too many different entities at work in this novel that sometimes made it seem like filler instead of background .	1
Although well-written with a fascinating hook , without reading Atwood 's Surface first , there 's not much for me to connect with in this book . Bad on me - as it should be evident that reading Surface first was a must to get the most from this book . I gave it 4 stars because I felt it was incredibly well-done , well-written and thought-provoking . Now I just have to go back and read Atwood 's book to get the most from this read .	1
I loved the wonderfulDiving in Deepby K. A. Mitchell so much that I decided to check out her other work . HOT TICKET is a short , fun , and surprisingly emotional read by this great author.This is a cute book with great characters . The beginning is a bit confusing because the author chooses to reveal background info very slowly , but the rest of the book flows smoothly as the pieces begin to fit together . Elliot is a sweet geeky guy , and Cade is sensitive and smart despite his rebel appearance . The men have more in common than they think , and they begin a steamy affair.The sex in this book is extremely hot but still tasteful . The two men have fantastic chemistry , and they seem to understand each other on a deep emotional level . Despite their very different exterior appearances , they are kindred spirits.The conflict in this book is mostly internal , and is mostly from Cade 's end . He has been burned by bad relationships in the past , so he has trust and commitment issues . Elliot is much younger and very inexperienced , and Cade ca n't imagine Elliot wanting to stick around.K . A. Mitchell is very good at character-driven romance . The tiny bit of external conflict is secondary to the relationship and the romance , and Ms. Mitchell puts a lot of focus on feelings and growth rather than on the external forces that interfere.This is a short book , just under 80 pages . It will make a wonderful addition to your `` Rainy Day '' list .	1
This is the best to describe this book due to the main characters are from opposite side of the track and comes from two different worlds but in serving community service they meet and find that are so much alike and have so much in common . In the difference they fall in love and build the perfect relationship and learn how to love and care for each other and over look the differences .	1
I just love K.A . Mitchell . This story may be short , but its great ! Cade is a pierced , bad boy , a free spirit . Elliot is an uptight , do everything by the book , make no mistakes kind of guy . Until Cade brings out the naughty in him ! This is a wonderful opposites attract story .	1
This is part of a series I read and I loved the whole series I also have some on Kindle .	1
This book is just fun . Written in a lighthearted way , that will make you smile . There are a few serious issues talked about , but they give the reader an insight about the characters reactions . This a short book and a quick read but it contains a satisfactory love story . Enjoy .	1
This book reminded me of that reality tv show Dating in the Dark . I enjoyed this one . It was good , but the ending sort of ruined it a little for me . Not completely but enough.Basically , Delia is trying to get more people to support the library . It 's not doing so well and the Library Appreciation day is coming up and she knows she needs something huge to get people to show . She tells everyone a surprise visitor is coming . Little do they know it 's Bobo , the retired hockey player that lives in town and his act has been done over and over again . That is until Justin Archer shows up out of now where . Voted American Woman 's sexist man alive . Unfortunately , before Delia could ask him for his help he leaves.Delia finds herself locked in the basement with Justin and he wants to keep their identities secret . Mainly , because he does n't want the girl to recognize him as the sexiest man alive . What Justin does n't know is that Delia knows exactly who he is . They talk for hours and hours and really get to know each other . Without being able to see each other.The ending was a little too gooey for me . I 'm thinking there should have been some hard feelings in there somewhere . Things do n't always work out the way you want them to . I 'm thinking if the ending was a little more dragged out , it would have made more sense . Or at least been more believable . It was a cute fast read .	1
I had read all these years ago . I recently found Wings in the Night Part 1 for a real deal and decided to download to my kindle and revisit one of my favorite series from long ago . I got caught up again . I then immediately upon finishing part 1 downloaded Wings in the Night Part 2 and read all of them . I am now looking on the Wings in the Night Web Site and checking for Rhiannon 's Chronicles and info on the new books coming out . This series does not disappoint . It matters not if you are revisiting it or if you are a first timer . It will set the scene for the new books and/or give you a great series for your immediate enjoyment . I highly recommend .	1
What would you do if several years down the road you run into someone who meant the world to you and hurt you ? Alanna was dumped by Leon and turned around and married his brother . She was pregnant with Leon 's child at the time . This is a short story of what happens when he see 's her again . It was very complete even as a novella in the telling . I have read several Julia James stories and still enjoy rereading them .	1
I did not want to put it down , this is a great read . I truly loved it . Very well written . It felt like I was a part of the whole thing , I kept on talking back and forth what I thought should happen . It is a must read , loved it very much . Keep up with the good work Maureen .	1
I really loved this series . I think this was the best book in the series . I enjoyed Dane and Solange story .	1
Life is full of challanges and obstacles that we must overcome . We must learn to master things around us as well as ourselves in order to be successful and lead a healthy fulfilled live . Author , Dennis E. Bradford Ph.D. , shows us how to do just that in 7 steps . With plenty of quotes and unbiased opinion that author presents some interesting concepts and visualizations to help you acheive all you seek in life . My only issue with the book is that there is a lot of stuff that you can tell is written by a doctor that could be offset by adding a sentance or two of laymens terms so that it is easily understood by all and not so huh ? what 's that supposed to mean . Overall though great read , very interesting topic and I would love to see more on this topic keeping in mind not everyone has a degree .	1
This book is packed with useful and interesting ideas . And I 'll agree with the other reviewer - there is no filler content either . I enjoyed the read but to save time so others can get on to it I will share that I think the chapter on habits was my favorite . Recommended !	1
I do like m & eacute ; nage books ... however I much prefer when the female gets ALLLLL of the attention . Yes , I am selfish that way . That 's my guilty pleasure when I read . With that being said I was torn between a 4 or 5 star review . So in fairness I went back and read the ARC again . I was given a copy of this story in exchange for an honest review . After my second read I decided on a 5 star review simply because this story has what it needs . It 's short , but you are introduced to the characters without feeling rushed . You get enough background info on each so that it makes sense without any extra fluff . There were a couple of odd sentences or typos but nothing that would make you regret the time it takes you to read this novella .	1
Another great story from Ms. Kallysten . I will admit that I was n't as big of a fan of Lisa as I was of the of two . I normally like really strong confident women but she was just a little too sure of her self for me . As usual the sex in this was extremely hot and very well written . She does really well with making you connect with her characters in such a short time . I look forward to more in this series .	1
My , my , my my ... ... ..Good lord Kallysten you sure know how to bring a reader to the edge . I immediately formed a perfect picture in my mind of Bret , Lisa and Leo and watching it play out before me in the written word just proved to me that as far as an erotic paranormal writer goes , you are on top . The story maybe short but the reader will not feel short changed when finished . I guess if there are really vampires out there , they need somewhere to go where they can let their hair hang down and not hide what they are but revel in it . Somewhere that humans can mingle , vampires can dine and all enjoy what the other has to offer can be found On the Edge .	1
The first book in the On the Edge series is a fast and erotic must read.Catering to humans and vampires at his new club , Brett Andrews thought he had it all including the beautiful vampire , Lisa . When Lisa & # 8217 ; s old lover shows up at the club , Brett begins to fear that he will lose her , but that & # 8217 ; s not in Lisa or Leo & # 8217 ; s plans at all.This short and fast smooth flowing plot is brought to life with vivid images , intense emotions , and strong compelling characters that grab the reader & # 8217 ; s attention . The author has created a fascinating world of vampires that captures the imagination and ensures that the reader wants to know more . The frequent sex scenes are scorching hot with menage and anal sex and well written and sizzling with passion as well as emotion.This is an erotic serial paranormal race that is entertaining and engaging and takes place in the fascinating city of Haventown where humans tolerate vampires . I can & # 8217 ; t wait to read the next installment .	1
OMG ! ! This was so good , I could n't put it down . The characters are so passionate in this story . I ca n't wait to read the next stories . Story full of interesting characters , lots of HOT sex ! ! I highly recommend this book .	1
Ok , so this book is relatively short , coming in around 9200 words , under 40 pages . Right off the bat it starts with a sexy shower scene - my favorite ! I do n't know what it is , but the water , the steam , the whole thing just sets me off . Here we meet Brett and Lisa , human and vampire , respectively . And as it turns out , they are in a relationship , eleven months so far.I felt like they were really great together . They had a playfulness , and you could still see they cared for each other beyond that flirtation . They respected each other for what they were , and so when Lisa went to the club downstairs to feed , Brett ( and I ) thought nothing of it.But here I 'm going to break off from the characters for a minute to talk about On The Edge , the club . This place is very much a character in the story , itself . It 's vampire and human friendly , a place for them to meet and mingle , and sometimes even more . Drink blood , or `` dirty wine '' , or anything else a mere mortal might enjoy . It 's a place with alcoves and overhead walkways , loud music , and great ambiance.In the club , Lisa runs into an old friend - Leo . Right away their familiarity puts me on edge a bit . Um , hello , what about Brett ? ? So when Lisa brings both of them back to the home that Brett and Lisa share , I can definitely understand - and agree with - Brett 's apprehension.But that Lisa , she 's a smarty . And there comes a point in this story when I got very angry with her , I felt betrayed for Brett , and in a very bad way . I called Lisa some very bad names . But like I said , she 's smart . Do n't underestimate that girl , and do n't think her heart is in the wrong place.And Leo ? He turned out to be one of my favorites of the five I met through these two books . I absolutely adore this man , and his lack of inhibitions . He 's tall , dark , and handsome . Sexy and mysterious . Dangerous . All of the above , and all things vampire.This story was m-m-f and m-f-m. And it was so wonderful and beautiful , and unbearably hot . I definitely recommend it , and I definitely recommend reading it first , before moving on any more in the On The Edge series .	1
After reading the Out of the Box series I just HAD to learn what the story was with Brett , Leo and Lisa . They 're appearance in those stories had piqued my interest.The club On The Edge was only 3 months old but it had been an instant success with the people of Haventown . Both human and vampire alike . It 's success was so great that it 's owner Brett had to hire more help . After a hard day of interviews he was ready for a quiet night at home . Instead he found himself in whole different , but much more pleasing situation.Though short I loved reading this . Number one , the whole idea of vampires and humans mingling and having fun on the dance floor and in the dark alcoves makes me shiver . It makes me want to put on my dancing shoes and a slinky dress ! The second thing that made this a hit for me was how easy it was for me to slip into the story . Kallysten has a way of making a reader feel as if they 're part of the story , not an outsider looking in.Kallysten 's writing is smooth and extremely hot . She never fails to give her readers a fantastic tale that leaves them panting for more !	1
Brett Andrews has been living with and loving Lisa for almost a year . He adores watching her stalk prey in which to feed when she goes to their club downstairs . Tonight is no different , except Lisa brings her prey home and Brett finds out he is a vampire as well.Lisa adores Brett , more so than any other man in a very long time . When she sees Leo at the club , she ca n't help but bring him upstairs . Lisa has a plan . She knows Brett 's secret desires and has one of her own.On the Edge kept me on the edge that is for sure . Delightfully erotic , I found Brett 's attraction to Leo just downright arousing . Lisa knew what she wanted and was not afraid to reach for her dreams . M & eacute ; nages are one of my favorite types of books to read and On the Edge was just the perfect read for me . Full of sensuality , it left me satisfied.Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

do n't normally write reviews but think enough of this book to share . I thought the characters were all very interesting and the plot development was very unique . Not a story i 've ever read before and was certainly meaningful and fast paced . Loved the ending !	1
I would best describe ths novel as a romantic thriller/mystery . Probably more of a thriller as it has more of an international flavour . Set in the art world it is filled with spies and political intrigue.Kay McCann is an artist , a Master Artist . She has been involved with two very different men , Peter Lawson a world renowned painter and Jason Allen a gallery owner and expert in art forgeries . Each man has their own agenda where Kay is concerned , each man is manipulative and coldly calculating . Kay unwittingly becomes a pawn between the two men.I enjoyed the premise for this novel . I could n't quite decide who Kay would ultimely end up with . Kay was a well written character , open , generous and forgiving . IMO too forgiving at times . I did have some qualms for Kay , as she was quite blinded and naive with both Peter and Jason . For a Master Artist who was able to convey so much emotion through her art I expected her to be more & # 34 ; worldly & # 34 ; or aware of what was happening around her , the repercussions of her actions.I did enjoy this but I do agree with another reviewer that the pace did lag a bit in the middle and it was n't all tied up as neatly at the end as I would have liked . Well worth a read , an interesting story . A few typos here and there but nothing to quibble about .	1
They say that fact is stranger than fiction . Could this work be the exception to the rule ? Beautiful insights to a world most of us ca n't even imagine . A work of art can inspire emotion most visceral in nature . This story is such a creation . It will become a very beloved friend I think .	1
This is a fun example of the timewhen writers were paid by the word and quantity was a living .	1
The protagonist in this story is a very clever fellow indeed . Only Frank Herbert writes such cerebral short stories.I recommend this short story .	1
Okay ... at first I wasnt to sure how I would feel about the book given its stalkerish description . But I loved it . I found myself laughing a lot in the first couple of chapters while at the same time believing the chemistry . My only complaint is that it is rather short .	1
ENJOYABLE READING THAT GRABS YOUR ATTENTION WITH HER BACKGROUND OF HER CHARACTERS ENTWINED WITH HEARTWARMING , CAPTIVATING , SENSITIVE AND SEXY WRITING WITH HER ENDING MAKES FOR A WONDERFUL ADDITION TO MY FAVORITES AND WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR .	1
Hailey Jennison was uncomfortable with her body , and had always been shy because of it . She had developed early , and had to constantly deal with unwanted attention from men . She did n't go out very often , but did enjoy getting together with her friends on Friday nights . They had recently become obsessed with a neighbor that provided an exciting sideshow for them . He is a construction worker named Gage Warren with an incredibly sculpted body he did n't mind showing them frequently . One night when Gage caught them looking in his windows , they scattered , but not fast enough because before she knew it Hailey had been dragged to his apartment . He had been attracted to Hailey from the first moment he saw her , and now that he saw his chance , he was going to take it.After they had been together a couple of weeks , Hailey finally told him what he had known all along . She was afraid he would leave if they did n't have sex , and equated it to her dad leaving her when she was just a small child . Gage could n't believe she did n't get it . He was completely in love with her , and now he just had to get her to believe it . There was no way he would let her get away.Gage and Hailey are a fun couple . Hailey has a lot of issues to work out , but Gage loves her and is willing to wait as long as it takes so they can be together forever . His family is also priceless . Most people have meddlesome family members , but the fact that two of his work in the mental health field , make the dynamics even more comical since they feel compelled to constantly give advice .	1
It does n't matter that she looks as if she stepped off the pages of Penthouse ; Hailey Jennison is socially inept when it comes to dealing with men . Currently her only glimpse of sex is the Friday night peep show her and her friends partake in . A construction worker across from her friend 's apartment could put a Greek God to shame with all the muscles that adorn his body . Gage knows that the source of all his wet dreams for the past six months is part of the female group who ogle him every Friday night as he prances around in the nude . Deciding to take a chance he finds himself blackmailing the blond bombshell into a dinner date . Now all he has to do it keep his mouth from ruining the best shot he 's ever had at love and lust combined.All you need on a blistering cold day is a hot cup of chocolate and a steaming hot book to cuddle up with . Enjoying the Show provides the steam with whipped cream on top . A total chick book with its quirky comedic parts : a group of women who put the ladies from Sex in the City to shame and a man even a grandmother would drool over . I found myself with an uncontrollable grin as I read how two beautiful people with less than stellar social graces came together for one fiery encounter after another . Marie Harte did an excellent job creating two characters , Gage and Hailey , you could n't help but love as you laughed at their growing relationship . The added plus for this book is Gage 's family ; if only we all could grow up with such an eclectic and open mix.Indyreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
This book does not require a lot of mental power or understanding of a story . It is a good quick read with happy ever after at the end . Do n't look for a lot of plot or storyline but not bad for something quick and dirty .	1
Amy works way too hard as a lawyer and basically has no personal life . The good side to her working so hard is always getting to see Justin , a man she 's wanted for years . Amy and Justin end up having to go to Hawaii to finalize a case they 've been working on . Little does Amy know that Justin has wanted her since the day he saw her . While in Hawaii he intends to make his feelings known and give her one of her secret fantasies.The book was n't very long , but it was very sweet . There was a good relationship between Amy and Justin and very little drama . Both characters were nice , had great chemistry , and seemed believable . There was n't a ton of information in the book either , but since the characters had known each other for years the way things happened in the book did n't seem unrealistic . If you want a sweet , sexy story this is a good one that wo n't leave you feeling depressed .	1
Amy Parker had only room for one love in her life , and that was work . She was a junior partner at the law firm she worked for , but her goal was to make senior partner by the end of the year .

He planned to stake his claim to her this trip , and be the master of her body from now on . Amy was a different person in Hawaii . She was relaxed and free . Justin liked this Amy , but he knew also the problems they were facing , and the roadblocks she would throw in their path . They were competitive colleagues , and he was younger than she was . He did n't care about any of it , but knew that Amy would be over thinking this to death . Justin decided he would be the one to give Amy the life she deserved , as well as the best Christmas present he , and their client Mitch Magruder could possibly give her.This was a very sensual and sexy Christmas short story . Justin is a no nonsense laid back kind of guy while Amy is the ice queen , and always in complete control . He shakes her up , and makes her want things she thought she could never have .	1
Justin and Amy make quite a pair . The sex is hot and the love is sweet . He understands her and loves all of her . Once Amy lets go she loves Justin right back .	1
It had been almost a year since Belle had been home to see her family , but she was determined to spend Christmas with them away from the disillusionment she felt about her job and current life . She knew she had some serious decisions to make , but wanted to enjoy her family for just a little while . Belle had n't had a life at all . She was working eighty hours a week with absolutely no friends or dates to take the pressure off.Belle Taylor had always had a crush on Rafe Bettencourt since she was a little girl . They had been neighbors since before she had been born . Even now grown up as an attorney , she felt the same tug at her heart when she was near him . When she arrived home , her family was horrified at Belle 's appearance . She had lost a lot of weight , looked overly tired , and had the darkest circles under her eyes . Rafe long considered family could n't believe his eyes either . He had stopped thinking of her as simply family since she had graduated from law school , and decided this was the time to make sure she knew she was his . Rafe knew they had many issues to work out like the fact that they lived in two different towns , but he knew the time was right for them.Good Christmas story . I liked both of the huge nosey overbearing families with deep connections to each other going back years . The romance between Belle and Rafe just further cemented the bond between those families .	1
I loved curling up with this over the Holidays . Belle and Rafe are so cute together . They are a believable couple with all the family `` drama '' wrapped up in the story . It had great character development . I think many women her age will see themselves in Belle . We all worked too much out of college and found it difficult to put family `` first '' when we were starting out in our careers . Where was Rafe when I needed him ? ! ? ! ? I also enjoyed an insight into the Portugese culture , especially around the holidays . I wish more authors would incorporate different cultures into their books . Love comes in many colors and cultures.Get some tea , your favorite quilt , and curl up with this book , you wo n't be disappointed !	1
I was intrigued by the description , sucked in by the sample , and pissed when I found out there was only 3 books in the series . I liked it that much . Thankfully she branched off this trilogy with the glass trilogy so I can continue to get my fix .	1
This was a wonderful short story.I absolutely loved the characters and the fact that they were in their 40 's made it even better.I most certainly want to find this suite Ethan had on my next cruise !	1
This story is so emotional that I am unable to read it without tissues . A great story about the power of love and forgiveness .	1
To make it very clear : this is a short story . Very short . It also does n't have any sex scenes and character development is shallow at best , with the exception of the heroine , Heather.Heather is the human mate to two wolf shapeshifters ; when buying supplies , Heather , friend and shapeshifter Niko and her mates ' father are ambushed by hunters . To make a short story shorter , Heather is blamed by her mates who think she was responsible for the attack which ended in their father 's death . She 's gravely injured , yet they turn their back on her and leave her to die . She 's rescued by a hunter ( a good one this time ) who tries to nurse her back to life.What follows is standard typical romance stuff and would be spoilers , if that 's possible . What makes this story very good for me is more about what 's left out . This is n't erotica , despite the steamy books Banks usually writes . I do n't know if it could even be called a romance , since there 's not a lot of romancing going on . It 's more of a love story ; characters torn apart because of a misunderstanding and brought back together not because of hot sex , but rather love and the ability to forgive . I did n't particularly like the mates and if it were me , they 'd have been kicked back to the pack and I 'd have run off with Niko.This is n't a perfect story ; things get wrapped up far too soon and because of the length and that fact that nearly all of the narrative focuses on Heather , her mates get the short end of the stick in terms of character development . They go from feeling betrayed to wallowing in grief because of what they did in a very , very short amount of time . There are only really five characters and no explanations at all of things like the pack and how Heather came to be with them.Still , this is a nice , sweet story that can be read in an hour . Think of it as an appetizer for one of Banks ' other books .	1
Heather is the human mate of Cael and Riyu . While out with her father-In-law , they are attacked by hunters and with his dying breath , Cael and Riyu 's father mistakenly blames Heather for his wounds . When Heather stumbles into the pack , instead of being comforted , she is cast aside by her mates who believe she is the reason for the death of their father . Heather is unable to fathom why her father-in-law would lie but is even more confused as to why her mates would believe she would do something so vile . So , Heather does what her mates ask of her even though her heart is breaking and her body is weak . She leaves.I bet I used a box of tissues with this baby . Talk about emotional . I swore after the first scene that I would hate Cael and Riyu until the end of the book . Honestly ? I hated them for about five minutes . Then I became immersed in their saga to find their mate and make amends . I wanted them to beg for forgiveness and my hateful inner woman wanted Heather to never forgive them . But , the power of love won out and it made for a tremendous Christmas story of love and forgiveness.There are many reasons why I love to read Maya Banks . A book like Love Me Still is just one of them .	1
Loved this one ... . Quick read , one sitting , but loved these characters . Great chemistry . Steamy sex . Well suited for a rainy ir snowy afternoon .	1
Interesting plot and totally fresh idea . I enjoyed it alot , a fun and fast read . A paranormal/sexy/hot/romance with a bit of a message . I 'll absolutely continue with the series . Happy reading ! DawnBee & lt ; 3ps . IF you wake up next to a monster after a one-night stand . Do n't try to kill it with a tiki torch . It will just bleed a nasty colored , goopy blood-like crap all over your place . lol !	1
Prequel to the series , this is more short story than anything else . Funny how you can find a sweet story amid fire & brimstone.This does NOT need to be read in any order and stands on its own quite nicely . This is something of the set up for the rest of the books . In fact , you will probably enjoy it more if you already HAVE read some of the other books.The writing is thick with imagery and sensuality- as is Ms. Showalter 's trademark . Do n't look for depth- just desperation and passion . It is more of an experience than a story . It wraps around you like a smooth glass of port.In case you are not familiar with the series , you should know that this novella is actually a bit of a departure from the style of the rest of the books . This is one of my favorite series- hot , sensual , dark & dangerous . This story is more of an aside , like a fable within the Lords of the Underworld universe .	1
I think a lot of romance authors forget to set up the background to the story and the reader misses out on a lot . The prologue does n't necessarily have to be really long or the length of the average book , it should just be long enough to set up everything for the series including the tone of it all.The reader is introduced to the Guardian of Hell-Geyron a beastly grotesque creature , and the Goddess of Oppression- Kadence who is beautiful beyond words . Both have been stationed by their respective sides to guard and protect the wall into hell . Kadence is bound to the wall so much so that if it crumbles she will die . Geyron sold his soul to Lucifer and for that he is positioned to make sure that everything in hell stays there . Kadence and Geyron have held these positions for centuries and they have never spoken until now . Even though there were no words passed between them there was a mutual respect and attraction.The wall is beginning to show signs of damage and Kadence has to figure out a way to repair it . Geyron could not help , even though he desperately wanted to . In order to save the wall Kadence ended up making a deal with Lucifer , one she would later realize was a mistake . While trying to repair the wall and take down the Demon Lords , Geyron and Kadence vocalize their feelings , desires , and wants for one another . This is where it starts to get messy . The Demon Lords have begun to truly destroy the wall . Without revealing too much I will say that in the end all the Demon Lords are stuck in Pandora 's Box.All in all I really enjoyed this The Darkest Fire.Visit us at Fairytales4grownups.com for the full review and everything Romance Novels like many more reviews and our blog .	1
This prequel seemed a little odd to me at first , not knowing anything about the series , but as I continued in the series I liked it more and appreciated it more , for its backstory . The characters are good , if what a little confusing at first , but overall a short , but good read .	1
I first picked this up from Harlequin when they rolled out Harlequin Mini . I really liked being able to pick up a romantic short story ... sometimes a quick read is the perfect pick me up . I enjoyed this quick read by Jane Porter . I found the pace kept me interested in the every moment of Estrella and Carlo 's romance .	1
This book was just one more great example of Delle Jacobs Scottish tales . I love her writing . It takes you into the story and makes you part of it !	1
I 've never been one to read any kind of romance novels , but since I got my kindle I 've been perusing through different types of genres . I have read several of her novellas , she is good for keeping you entertained . Fast paced and spicy , they are not for someone who blushes easily . I really like this one , I love the differences in perspectives from the two main characters . Worth your time to read and keep writing Karen , cuz some like it hot . Haha .	1
This short novella was in deed , a very H-O-T read ! The characters were well developed for a short novella & the storyline & plot was quite interesting . Brittany and her two best friends had just won the lottery and Charlie is their financial advisor/planner . Brittany & Charlie have a passionate & hot interlude that leads to hot , scorching sex & plenty of them too ; ) Brittany is an emotionally wounded heroine as evident by her past & Charlie is sexy Mr. Nice Guy where he helps break down Brittany 's barriers . They are opposites , yet they are perfect for one another . This was definitely a super sexy read . I highly recommend this if you 're looking for a hot erotica . Ca n't wait to read the rest of the series !	1
Hot book that made you feel for them and had you sitting on the edge of your seat throughout it all : ) Definitely recommended !	1
I got this as a freebie for the kindle and I must say for free , it was enjoyable . The story is a short one , it is about Lacey , who is a personal trainer and appears to have problems keeping men longer than a few months . Story starts off with her finding her boyfriend cheating on her with her friend Christy . She did n't feel sadness for Evan , the guy she 's been seeing for the past 6 months . She was more sad about the fact that she was single again , lonely and was n't sure why she could n't keep a guy interested.Nick has been Lacey 's best friend for the past 5 years so when he heard that she was finally single again , he did n't waste a minute . He wanted to be with her , to console her , but also to take the opportunity to make her see him as more than a friend . He has loved Lacey for so long that he would do anything to show her how good they could be together . He would do anything for her , even if he had to pretend to be her `` sexual teacher '' .Once they began their `` lessons '' , Lacey could n't believe all the things Nick was making her feel . Could she risk ruining her friendship with Nick ? Can they be both friends and lovers ? Cute short story , but best of all , it was free .	1
Taking friendship to a whole new level-Lacey Vaughn is tired of being dumped on by men . It-s clear she needs help in the ways of seduction . Over cappuccinos , Lacey shares her worries with pal Nick Stone . Being the good friend that he is , Nick offers to give Lacey a few pointers in the ways of sexual pleasure . From his first touch , Lacey forgets all about lessons . Now all she wants is more of his luscious body and skillful touches.Nick-s craved Lacey for months . He-s done watching her waste herself on losers . It-s time she saw him as more than the dreaded good friend . He-ll do nearly anything to have the little spitfire all for himself . But in order to get Lacey past her insecurities , Nick will have to put it all on the line-including his heart-and pray he doesn-t lose her forever.THOUGHTSIt was n't a bad read for me and I still enjoyed it . However , I love Blade 's story more within the series 'Tasting Candy ' that man was so sexy within that book . But , this story held its own . Its good to read best friend to lovers story.. I also enjoy their family with all 3 books . I would recommend the series , but I 'm stuck on Blade so I might not be the best person to recommend right now.Steamy & sweet , that would best sum up this book .	1
I love that these characters are real so you can relate to them , and still the romance ( and the love scenes ) are hot , hot , hot !	1
Wow ! out of the chute action , romance and one Hot Outlaw named Cal Ryker ! ***************This is a follow up from RIDING WEST ( believe me when I say it means Celia was `` hehehe ... riding Parker West ! `` ..not the compas direction.. ) I suggest ya'all read that one first ! Cal is one dreamy Cowboy , with a quick draw and a reputation that sets the other 6 members of the train robbing gang to thinking twice before denying his offer to trade his share of the take for the woman they took hostage . Cal 's original plan to just keep Laurel safe until he can return her to her family , goes awry when they find themselves alone for 2 weeks ! ... ... . ( 2 steamy weeks ) What starts out as a hasty rescue winds up as more of a heartfelt romantic tale complete with smart , sassy and sexy dialogue as only Emma can conjur . This is one short tale that packs alot of romantic pillow talk and honest character development that will make you `` sigh '' and beg Emma for more , more , more of those West/Evans 's stories .	1
I very much enjoyed . It was sensual , and romantic.. Cal and Laurel were wonderfly done . I cheered for her through the entire story . A bit of mystery and a lost sole finding home . I could almost hear the wind in the trees . Miss Wildes painted such vivid pictures with her words.Will add Miss Wildes to my authors to watch.Storyline : outlaw romanceIntimacy : sensual , but not eroticEnjoyment : read with out stopping , did not want to stop for dinner.Book length : 41,000 wordsKindle length : na read in ePub format	1
Others are more comprehensively detailed -- A Night To Remember comes to mind -- but this book , first printed in 1912 , is what they had instead of People Magazine and Breaking News on CNN . It 's the fresh-off-the-press first stories of the passengers , the ship , the wreck . It 's one of the more human of accounts , and , paradoxically , one of the more informative as to the technical information available at the time . A must-have curiousity for Titanic students .	1
We all know about the conspiracy theories around the JFK assasination . There 's more than you can count . Contained in this story is a great fictional version of what may have happened.The two main characters are reporters who are looking for a good story but soon find themselves in way over their heads . I 'd like to write more about what they uncover while working on their story and the dangers they encounter while doing so , but I do n't want to give away any major plot points . Part of the fun of reading a book like this is discovering things as you turn the pages and I do n't want to spoil anyone else 's fun.I 'll just say this : There 's enough good suspense and action in this novel that I kept turning the pages and had a hard time putting my Kindle down until I got to the last page . It 's a very compelling story and the author did a great job with it.This was the first book I read by author Dave Conifer . After reading it , I definitely want to read more by him .	1
Two journalists - Joe Jonas and Abby Reno - are assigned to cover yet another crackpot conspiracy theorist with his own idea about the JFK assassination plot . However , there may be more than meets the eye this time . Now Jonas and Reno have to find the truth - against the wishes of their editors and other people who are trying to kill them to keep decades-old secrets dead and buried.Dave Conifer does an excellent job of explaining the major real-life players of the JFK scandal to readers who may not be intimately familiar with the intricate details ( *raises hand* ) . Combining the pace of an action thriller with the backdrop of JFK , the author uses one of the biggest scandals of the 20th century to weave an intricate tale of historical fiction in `` Man of Steel . ''	1
I really enjoyed this book . I especially liked that the author had closely read the Warren Reports and utilized it in the storyline . There was great action and the plot never seemed far-fetched to me . I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series .	1
Joe Jonas and Abby Reno , two reporters from different papers decide to work together to investigate , then write the definitive story about the Kennedy assassination based on information they happened upon . I do n't buy the authors approach to the assassination but I will buy the story he created to make his case . This was an interesting read which held my attention till the end , and even then I was sorry to see it end.The Starlight Club ( Starlight Club , The ) by Joe Corso .	1
What we have here is a very interesting free Kindle download . `` Babylonian Laws , '' which most of us were ( I am not sure if this is still the case ) exposed to in Junior High , or at the very latest , in High School , are of course more popularly known as `` The Code of Hammurabi '' and are the oldest known ( I stress `` known '' ) laws we presently have access to.This copy , which was published in or around 1903 by C.H.W . Johns ( 1857 - 1920 ) contains all the know elements of this code . Some of the material here is rather fragmented and much has been lost down through the ages . After all , this work was created around B.C . 2285 - 2242.In this particular work we are given a very nice forward by C.H.W . Johns who was an Assyriologist and Church of England Clergyman . Johns has quite a number of academic papers under his belt , this being one of them.After the introduction the actual code , or what we know if it , is recorded in all of its known sections . I personally found this to be an interesting read . I must admit to having never read the Code in its entirety before and this gave me a golden opportunity to do so.The reader will find that almost all aspects of society at that time were covered . Quite a number of the situations found during those times no longer exists , but on the other hand many do and for me it is interesting to note that mankind has not changed all that much down through the ages.It is of particular note the various punishments required for infractions of many of these laws . I covered the first 15 or so pages and I fear to tell you that had I lived at that time my life would have been rather short due to the fact that the death penalty seemed to be the main form of punishment ... with drowning and burning being at the top of the list as to methodology.These laws , while quite primitive in our eyes , covered trade , marriage , slave ownership , concubine management , farming , trade , social interaction and on and on.This is not a good forum to discuss all of these laws item by item as a large number of volumes have been published down through the years addressing this code and most have easy access to these works - if of course , there is interest.For those that are familiar with our current laws ( those that possess a far greater understanding than I care to have ) will be fascinated as to how this Code has influenced the laws of various societies down through the years.This , as I said , is a free down load and it is a most worthwhile download . This is a part of our history ergo , we all need to be at least somewhat familiar with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks	1
And I am only sorry that not the entire series is out on Kindle , I hope one day it will be . This is a serious story with heart pounding emotional stuff . In the end is is a story of hope , finding grace , acceptance , healing and love . It is a fitting story to end this series with .	1
This was a great read ... . spellbinding accounts of the Jewish resistance to the murderous tyranny of Nazi Germany during Hitler 's reign of terror ... .. I 'd love to say it was encouraging but instead the accounts are real- '' ish '' ( I did think it was a true story at first ... .. turns out it is supposedly based on accounts ... I will be wanting to research some now ! ) and stories that need to be told often enough that we never forget what happened to over 6 million people while the world did nothing.My only downside was the `` intimate scene '' relayed on two occasions ... .. I would have liked for a younger audience to be able to read it and not have to get through those ... .. these are definitely stories that need to be told to a new generation ... . other Holocaust writers have done this well ...	1
Loved this book as well . Loved the endings and how the babies were born . I thought that was sweet . Not a waste of money . It was some parts that were upsetting and the hero did seem like a jerk at times but overall the book was great .	1
Love , love , love this book . The author did a wonderful job writing this story . I think the three of them are perfect together . There will be funny moments that will make you laugh . I love this book so much that I purchase a book and the ebook as well and I have read both forms multiple times already . I definitely am looking forward to reading more books from this author . Her latest update to this story `` ever after '' was also beautifully written and introduces new possible characters for a new book . Ca n't wait to see Paige McKellan next book .	1
Jules Kingston has always known that it would be her duty as her fathers ' heir to become Lioness of her Pride - she just did n't know she would have to assume this position so soon . Her fathers have decided to step down as Leos of the Pride and in doing so have made Jules ' life a living Hell . It is the tradition of her Pride to have two Leos and one Lioness in charge . Much to Jules ' dismay , when her fathers step down , every lion in the direct vicinity is sniffing after her trying to get her to mate , and she 's tired of it . Ready to run , Jules comes face to face with the two men who have no qualms about claiming their mate.Luke and Gabe Beckett knew three years ago that Jules was destined to be their mate and went to her fathers to cinch the deal . Of course , Jules ' fathers neglected to tell her that bit of information and when she finds out , she does exactly what they 'd thought she 'd do -- she tries to run . She does n't get very far and when she 's caught by Luke and Gabe , Jules is taken to their home and claimed . The mating will come later once she accepts her position . Time is not on their side , however , because Luke and Gabe are n't the only lions wanting Jules . Now they must accept a mating challenge with the hope that they will be the victors.Claiming Their Mate was a great book ! I loved how Luke and Gabe could sense Jules ' thoughts and feelings and did their best to make her comfortable in her new home . Jules ' temperament often seemed off to me -- I wanted her to care for the brothers as much as I could tell they cared for her . But , despite that , I enjoyed the foray in the White Sands Pride of lions . Claiming Their Mate was sensual and highly charged . It was a well written m & eacute ; nage that was almost innocent in its sensuality because of the lack of a certain sexual position shown in most m & eacute ; nage stories . The ending was sublime , although it seemed a bit cut off because I would have loved to have seen Luke , Jules , and Gabe at home in their own bed loving each other . However , that was n't enough to keep me from reading another book by Paige McKellan . She is on my radar now , and I ca n't wait to read more of her work ! Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I enjoyed the story and thought it was well done . While like the other reviewer I did n't care for the foursome the rest of the book was done well . It did n't fit into Rachel 's character in the book who was so hurt and cautious . I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series but not if there are more secenes that seem completely out of place or character .	1
When she was young , Rachel 's aunt entertained her with fanciful tales of people who could change their form at will . Now , years later , she discovers those tales are shockingly real . And if she is n't surprised enough about that , her aunt 's final will instructs her to find her OWN inner beast , discover the lost totem that will protect the town and all its inhabitants , and to mate with her dazzlingly sexy protector , Burke.For a novella , the story and characters are remarkably well-developed . It 's just the right length for someone who does n't have much time on their hands to read before going to sleep at night to induce some very vivid dreams . There are some questions left unanswered in Rachel 's Totem , but , fortunately , the other novels in the Cougar Falls series will clear them right up .	1
Max holy male hotness ! `` hot damn , Max thought , watching the little dynamo that was Emma in action . Why the hell did n't I stop by here sooner ? He 'd been busy setting up his practice , true , but you 'd think he 'd have made the time to stop by . Be neighborly . '' Max plays dirty to get what he wants from Emma , `` hmmm . In that case , I suggest we go out to eat . Maybe after I feed you you 'll be more willing to tell me what I want . '' And he 's blunt , `` and then I 'm going to take you home and eff you raw . '' As her eyes widened , he added , `` And , baby , that will be better than good . '' Emma she has a temper until she gets what she wants , `` she was still snarling at him until he led her into the woods . She stopped snarling when he got naked . When he changed , she began purring . '' I can tell this will be another series that I like .	1

Can she handle the changes that will make her one with Max ? The Wallflower has it all . It is hot , sexy , and funny all rolled into one -- just my kind of story . Dana Marie Bell 's characters come to life for me and I want to be Emma when I grow up . Some of Emma 's one-liners had me rolling on the floor laughing ! When Max realized Emma was his mate , nothing could keep him away and Ms. Bell was able to portray the raw power of an alpha male . Emma , on the other hand , is just as strong as she is funny and I love that in a heroine.I am Joyfully Recommending The Wallflower and ca n't wait for book two to find out what is going on with the Halle Puma.Jambreareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I thought this was a good story with a lot of potential , but felt like it ended just as it was getting good . There were enough characters and potential plot lines for it to have gone at least twice as long if not more .	1
Overall , I was absorbed in this story and the semi-abrupt ending has really left me for wanting more . Do n't get me wrong on the ending though . It was abrupt only in the fact that I wanted to know more and there was n't any . I 've already checked out Kaye 's site and the only other novel listed is Angelic Avenger , which I do n't believe is in this series . I 'm 99.9 % sure of that one . So , I 'm going to be hoping there 's more to this story in the future because I really want to know . Definitely a great read for anyone looking for something new.For my full review , check out Literary Escapism .	1
Read all the series , all were a quick read , great sense of humor , enjoyed the series and the stories , great read .	1

This is the second time I 've read this book and I do n't know why I thought it was only OK the first time . This time I loved it . The characters and their interaction were wonderful .

Jolene Benate has had to put her life completely back together over the last six years right after she was told her husband was dead . Now she is a deputy marshal on an elite warrant team . It 's not been an easy road and Jo has succeeded , if you do n't count the fact she ca n't move on from the love of her deceased husband.Paul Benate gave up Jo in a move he thought would prevent her from ever being harmed . Paul has a brain that many would love to control and while he likes working for the military , he missed Jo every day these last six years . When a report shows that Jo has been found and is a target , Paul demands to get back all he lost.When Jo and Paul meet again , the fireworks are many and pointed . Jo is hurt and angry that she was lead to believe Paul was dead . Paul wants to begin again , but first he has to convince Jo to both forgive him and to understand . Love brought them together and drove them apart . Now when the danger to Jo seems to follow her , will love be enough to give Paul and Jo another chance ? Still Mine has several of my favorite aspects in a story : hot sexy scenes , engaging main characters , and enough suspense that it makes you want to read quickly to find out the ending . Jo has grown up and found a career even while loving the husband she believes is dead . Paul made a decision he thought would save Jo from danger and was given a second chance . From the moment they met face-to-face , I was drawn in and could not flip the pages fast enough . Even before giving in to their passion , I could feel the strength of it . I was quickly reminded that the emotions that give passion can produce equal fear and anger . Watching Jo and Paul try and work out the past to hopefully lead to a new future for them showed me that a true and deep love never really dies . When the danger comes from an unexpected angle , at least for me , I loved seeing the depth of the trust that had been restored between Paul and Jo . Still Mine is equal parts hot romance and suspense , which I found not to be missed . The cliffhanger ending leads me to hope that just maybe Jo and Paul will show up again soon in another book.Joreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

Morgan Crenshaw has spent all the time she intends to blending into the office background . She 's a woman on a mission and if that means trading in her tomboy look for ` skank ' clothes complete with thong underwear then so be it . Over the past year she 's watched her boss , Ridge , parade his various dates in front of her , and she 's determined to finally be the woman he desires.Ridge Casey has had the hots for Morgan since the day he hired her to work at the architectural firm but since she never showed the slightest interest in him he was n't about to put a strain on their working relationship . Seeing her sitting at her desk looking like sex personified is almost more than he can handle . Fortunately Morgan puts him out of his misery and admits that the radical change in her appearance is all for him.Ridge and his business partner Carter are expecting an announcement regarding a bid they 'd put in for the design of the Honor Center . They 've lost out on the last two bids they put in so everyone 's hopeful that this time is the charm . As soon as Ridge sees Morgan the bid and anything business oriented takes a backseat to staking his claim on her . He considers her his woman and seeing her all gussied up brings out the caveman attitude in him - heaven help her if she 's dressed like that for some other man.Once he learns that they 've wasted a whole year pretending not to want each other , Ridge is n't willing to waste another moment . He certainly is n't going to allow any other man to see her dressed so provocatively . Like the alpha male he is , he drags her away from the office and takes her to his place where they proceed to cement their relationship . There 's just a little problem that crops up - Malone and Casey have lost out on the bid and this time they know that someone in their business is selling inside information to the competition . Is it possible the changes in Morgan and her seduction of Ridge are intended to cover up her involvement in sabotaging the company ? Annmarie McKenna has quickly garnered many readers attention with her smoldering hot storylines and memorable characters . Who has n't been ` in love ' with the boss , a coworker , or even a teacher ? Morgan 's shy boldness really struck a cord with me . She 's got an air of innocent hopefulness while still maintaining a confident air . Ridge is wonderfully alpha while still being vulnerable . I was charmed by his insecurity where Morgan 's concerned . I 'd love to see a follow up story for Carter - possibly with a hook up with the office ` witch ' Amy Lee . I admit it I really did n't like her but I could easily imagine Carter taking command of her - in a very good way.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1
I loved this short story , Morgan has wanted her boss for a year but since she 's the original tomboy/girl next door , she has n't been able to get up the courage to let him know she 's interested . Finally she decides to dress the part and it really works.The plot was good , the action is fast and furious and there really is a story . The entire story happens within a few hours but it 's well paced and well written and above all the price is right ! I like Ms. Jacobs !	1

After working undercover as gay lovers for the better part of a year , returning back to their lives was n't easy for FBI Special Agents Alex Ware and Shawn Matthews , especially when it turns out Shawn wants to continue being Alex 's lover . Shawn has been in love with Alex for years , but out of respect for their friendship and working environment , he never revealed his feelings . Their undercover assignment was fate telling him this was meant to be , and Shawn took full advantage of the opportunity to finally show Alex how much he loved him.Alex never thought of himself as gay and had even less of a clue that Shawn might be gay . This was an assignment and you did whatever was needed to survive . The fact that he actually liked kissing Shawn and his body came alive every time Shawn touched him only made their undercover identities more believable . Once the sting was over and they made their case , things would go back to normal , so Alex believed.A Matter of Necessity was a romantic comedy with added suspense and drama . Shawn was a lovesick puppy who drove Alex absolutely batty and I loved every minute of it . Who would n't want this gorgeous g-man with a sexy Australian accent declaring to anyone who would listen how much he loves you ? Alex wanted to believe he did n't want Shawn , but he knew he would be lying . He wanted Shawn just as much as Shawn wanted him , but Alex was afraid of the stigma of being gay . I did feel for Alex and his struggle to come to terms with his attraction to another man , and Shawn 's sweet , lovingly aggressive pursuit of him only added to his struggle . Even though Shawn and Alex took a while to see eye to eye about their relationship , they never lost respect for one another as teammates or their fierce protectiveness of each other . The reactions of their other teammates from the Bureau to their relationship was a mixed bag , with some reactions fitting perfectly to the comedic tone of the story . I very much enjoyed reading A Matter of Necessity , a definite Joyfully Recommended read.Leyreviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

This remarkable novel follows the journey of two mind-melded companions through the dangerous landscape of a post-apocalyptic future Earth . By healing a wolf , a mentally gifted man gains a lifelong companion who travels with him to visit legendary north-country tribes . They meet extraordinary characters along the journey and discover a destiny that is sure to shape their future.An important destiny awaits the bonded travelers . Will people seek out technology that nearly destroyed Earth or follow the path of nature and self-discovery ? The author 's vivid descriptions of places and people takes readers into a mysterious future world filled with danger . The journey is worth taking and the characters are worth knowing.This is the second book in the Shape Shifter series . It can be read on its own , but the reader will get a much better experience by reading Syren Song first and then reading Melder . The reviewer who discounted this book surely did n't understand the importance of the shape-shifters to the overall composition . I recommend both books to anyone who loves animals and quests .	1
What to say ? This book is just wonderful . I am normally not a fan of apoplectic fiction , but this book transcends that genre . It is adventure on a grand scale condensed into a small but varied cast of characters . I loved it and honestly feel that it will appeal to a broad range of readers .	1
You Send Me by Toni Blake is a 2009 Harper Collins publication.This very short story with approximately 55 pages centers on a young woman in 1957 named Millie who is in her early twenties but still under the thumb of her parents especially that of her father . While on vacation in Montana , Millie meets Johnny and it 's lust at first sight . But , Johnny is the type of guy Millie 's father would never approve of for his daughter . So , when push comes to shove will Millie once more submit to her father 's will or will she finally stand up for what she feels in the right direction for her life to go ? This book is a prequel to & # 8220 ; Letter to a Secret Lover & # 8221 ; . However , the story can stand on it 's own two legs and winds up being a really sweet love story . Two people who are from very different backgrounds quickly forge a bond that is powerful enough to give them the strength and courage to change the path they are on.I picked this one up in the kindle store during a promo and it was either free or 99 cents . I see that it is now all the way up to $ 2.99 . Since half of the book is the story you are paying for and the other half of the book is a preview for a new book by this author , I do n't know if I would say the story was good enough to merit such a high price . If you catch it on sale then buy all means check it out . But , it took me about 15 minutes to read it , if that . Just sayin.This one gets 3.5 stars rounded to 4	1

All of David Ridge 's books help me understand the scriptures better , I bought this one for kindle for easier scripture study and reference .	1
I have struggled in the past to understand these Scriptures . David Ridges helps understand this book of Scripture in a way that it 's easy to understand with background information in front of each Section , and his comments where needed . I should have bought this series of books years ago .	1
I give this book 3.5 stars . The characters were endearing esp . the hero but I could n't quite buy the whole premise . There was just something right from the beginning that did n't sit well with me . It is worth reading though .	1
It was a great book worth the stars it seem any age could it price was great so download it	1
The feel of time and place are so well developed I could almost smell the salt air . Likewise , the characters had sufficient depth to make what happened to them matter . The only criticism I have is the environmentalist agenda , while appropriate with the story context , came across as artificial which tended to detract from rather than add to the plot .	1
Sometimes I 'm not sure whether a long drawn out epilogue would live up to my expectation because just being happy with a lot of sex does n't make up a good read . But Reason Enough really did blew me away with only 45 pages . Damn . Megan Hart is still able to make me feel so much with only a novella . She cramped a few hot sex scene , Elle 's inner turmoil on her decision whether to have a child or not and all sorts of emotion running through her in a few short pages.Dan is amazing as always , is n't he always is ? Elle and Dan are now married and he is bringing up the question of having a baby . Elle instantly balked at the idea , she had made a terrible mum . Dan who is always being patience towards her did n't pressure her on the issue.We get to catch up on Elle 's relationship with her mum and brother , Chad . We also got Marcy , who is now so very pregnant with her first child . Is great to see Elle surrounded herself with friends and family and all the love . I 'm love this little novella to see Dan and Elle settled into their marriage life . But it kept me wanting more .	1
I loved being able to check in with Dan and Elle . I really enjoy the writing of Megan Hart . I love that fact that in this short story , I get everything I want : a little romance , some spicy sex , some thought provoking moments , the ability to see characters continue to grow and evolve . It 's just nice . If you have n't readDirty , you want to be sure to read it before this one .	1
it was good to see where Dan and Elle was . And that they was still together and so much in love .	1
This is a brilliantly executed biography by a Polish Jew who survived the Holocaust . He documents unimaginable horrors . He immigrated to Israel after the war , and later to the US , where he led a successful life . Had I know of this book when I taught high school history in San Diego , it would have been required reading . The book also provides an interesting history of the early settlement of Isreal . The comments by other readers regarding the poor formatting must have been fixed . I saw none and found the writing to be highly professional .	1
It 's hard to say I love this book but it does deserve 5 stars . It is emotionally very wrenching but very educational and a must read especially for all those who say the Holocaust is a lie . I ca n't imagine surviving the atrocities of the ghetto and the camp . Only a strong person can survive to live a normal life . A necessary read .	1
This book was more spiritual than any of Ms Hart 's books that I have read . I had always wondered why they called her work spiritual when so many of her books gave a smattering of sex . This one didn't.This book was not one of high adventure , but one of two fractured souls learning to love again . It was well worth the read , but do n't expect any hot bedroom scenes . This is just a good love story .	1
I read this series as a suggestion from a friend , and a whole year after reading it I find myself still thinking about the characters . I loved them and am now a Susan Mallery fan !	1
Always love this series and JCP 's writing is spectacular .	1
Psy-Cop is my favorite book series . This one is one of the best . It was well set-up and introduced some new characters into the Psy-Cop world . Some I even like/hate at the same time , not an easy feat .	1
I love the inexpensive classic collections on Kindle . What I did n't read as a child I can now read as an adult and appreciate them more than ever . Timeless and imaginative .	1
Everyone today seems to be aware of the book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz but only because of the film made in the 1930 's starring Judy Garland . The film was fairly faithful to the story but differed in some ways . The entire collection of the Oz stories is a splendid read for today 's children . All of the characters are amazing and some of the stories would make really exciting motion pictures with plenty of action and some really terrifying scenes . The book , Rinkitink in Oz , is one of these . It would make a great video game ! I highly recommend these books to everyone , young and old . It was wonderful to read them all again and I am so glad to have this collection on my Kindle !	1
These books never seem to lose their appeal . We all know and love the film , but it is fun to read the book on which it was based	1
I read it all they way through , all 18 books ! Must admit , I was & # 34 ; Oz 'd out & # 34 ; by the end , but the stories are cute and my granddaughters will enjoy them , when I read them to them .	1
Can you say - it 's the wizard of oz . You loved it as a child , if you never read all the oz books , take this opportunity .	1
Those who have never read an Oz book are culturally deprived . Baum created a world that everyone should visit . At any age . I was 50 when I first read about Dorothy and Osma and Tick Tock , among many others . I remember some clown movie reviewer who could n't figure out where Tick Tock came from in the & # 34 ; Return to Oz & # 34 ; movie a few years ago . I felt superior because I had read the books.Do not deprive yourself any longer of these books .	1
I had never read the stories , just loved the movie . It is interesting to see how Hollywood & # 34 ; adapted & # 34 ; the book to the screen . The stories are more innocent and , in many ways , full of variety and insights . I am enjoying them thoroughly .	1
This is a well written , entertaining story that will keep engaged through out . It is why reading is such a pleasure .	1
The retirement plan of the Kurev mob family is death ; either naturally or by hitmen . No one just leaves alive . Cynthia Beller and Lee Maxwell understand that first hand as her father Claymore and Lee , accountants at the same firm working the blood money of the Kurev mob , tried to quit at different times . Nine years ago Claymore and his family except for his daughter Cynthia were murdered ; three years ago , Lee survived the hit , but his wife and daughter were killed . Each of the survivors vowed separately vengeance.They meet for the first time as Cynthia having just finished a kill is about to leave when Lee enters the abode to assassinate the same thug . They encounter one another twice more before agreeing they have the same list and strategic BHAG . They agree to team up to destroy the Kurev family by dividing up the kills . Meanwhile though sympathetic to their cause and respecting them as he loves his wife and daughter that he might seek vengeance too if they were harmed , FBI agent Owen Dunham struggles with capturing the Grudge Ninja vigilante serial killer preying on the mob.This is an exhilarating serial killer thriller that hooks the audience because the key three players seem vulnerably human with remorse , regret , and resoluteness . The vivid story line is action-packed especially with the scenes of the kills . However , A.J . Scudiere 's tense thriller belongs to the Grudge Killer ( s ) and the cop reluctantly trying to bring them to the legal justice system even as he believes their vigilante justice is just.Harriet Klausner	1
I rarely give five stars . Giving five stars would mean that the book was without flaws . This book is as close to that as I have found recently . While there may have been a few mistakes in the story line toward the end , they did not detract from the overall story . And I am not going to tell you what those mistakes were . Another mystery can not hurt . By and large this was a great book that I highly recommend .	1
Wow ! This was a very short hot book ! It was free for my E-reader and I 'm so glad I picked it up . First it was very well written with a lot of emoitonal depth that you do n't normally fine in 1. short books and 2. erotica books.This author has launched herself onto my must read list.Warning : This book is very graphic with BDSM .	1
Roarke and Jenesta Barbenoir are a married couple hiding a secret from each other that they feel they ca n't share with their spouse . They both like kinky sex , not the vanilla sex that is more socially accepted in Victorian England . I loved the tension between the two when after indulging in the kind of sex they like , they both feel ashamed and that the other person will no longer love them.It 's a good short story that ended too soon .	1
I started reading Eve Vaughn books on Thursday . Since then I have four of books . Let me tell u they will grip you until the end . Awesome read .	1
I loved this book ... it was hot and romantic at the same time . I loved how she was willing to love him regardless of his face . I loved how he took a chance . Loved his dominance . It so hot the way he takes control ... a must read .	1
I love stories about Interracial relationship . This is the kind of world I grew up in . I recommend this book .	1
Very enjoyable read , well written , fast paced with hot sex scenes . I really enjoyed the dialogue between Hunter and Lila it was well done , smooth and believable . Sometimes it takes a level headed woman to make things right for a tortured man and this is what this sweet love story is all about !	1
This was a great book . I turned this read down about four or five times . I am glad I bought this book . Very hot hot hot . This awesome Mrs. Vaughn did real good . I will definitely read this again .	1
Lila knew if her father lost his shop he would lose his liveli hood , but fighting the ruthless development company that was trying to buy him out may be a losing battle . When attempts to get her father to sell become suspicious and underhanded Lila seeks out the head of the corporation . Bursting into Hunter Jamison 's office to demand he cease and desist , Lila was taken aback by what he demanded in exchange for her father 's shop.Disfigured in a car accident Hunter Jamison felt he lost everything that mattered when he lost his looks . He knew no woman would want to be with him if he was n't rich and powerful , and even then his money was n't enough for some when faced with having to look at his scarred features on a daily basis . When Lila stormed into his office with her fiery temper and beauty to match he wanted her like he 's never wanted any other woman before , and knew the only way she would want him was to proposition her using her father as leverage.Mistress to the Beast is a cute twist on the classic Beauty and the Beast fairy tale . I really liked Lila , she 's a straightforward tell it like it is type of woman . And even though she succumbed to Hunter 's wishes in order to help her father she never held her tongue when it came to telling Hunter what she thought of him . My feelings for Hunter waffled a bit . I loved when he showed his vulnerability , but when he wanted to be a nasty brute he did it quite well . The chemistry and hot erotic sex scenes between these two are explosive . Mistress to the Beast is a fun and very entertaining read and I enjoyed it immensely.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I enjoyed reading this book . It kept me interested from start to finish . It was hard to put down . Definitely worth purchasing this good short read .	1
I was n't going to buy this book based on the review about a white man buying a black women . Then curiosity got the best of me and I had to see if someone really wrote a book about erotic romance trying to sex up slavery . BUT that is not what happens here and I 'm glad I bought it and read it for myself . Yes an arrangement was made between two CONSENTING adults . And in this arrangement he flat out told her he wanted to have sex with her in exchange she got what she wanted . He gave her WEEKS to back out and thought she would , she did n't . Also , even up until the point where he was touching her he told she could back out . There was no holding down and raping . She was suprised ( and ashamed ) herself she WANTED to have sex with him . And even after the first time he continued to tell her she could back out of the deal . Was he a little crude ( he was crude when he made the offer , she should n't have been shocked ) yes , stern , yes . He did n't have to allow her time to get herself together to have sex . The deal was , will you sleep with me ( not in those nice words ) , and do as I wish when I wish it ? Her answer , yes , in exchange you will do x , y , z for me , which he did . What 's there to wait for ? He did n't say , `` will you stay with me , be my companion , we will get to know each other , THEN if sex happens it happens '' . She knew what was up , SHE sold herself to get what she wanted ... and it was never to late to back out .	1
I truly love this book I can not tell you how many times I have reread this book it is truly beautiful . I would have been nice to have surgery and to try to restore his face so that he felt better about himself and not others but I was glad that she was able to be friends and to teach him friendship also	1
Loved it ! ! ! They both saved each other and were good for each other , great love and sensual story . I do n't like some of this author 's novels but this one i absolutely did get into it first for the unusual male character ( being disfigured post accident ) but you quickly forget about his scars and root for him to be seen again and loved for the real handsome and generous man he is inside out not the facade of heartless business jerk he likes to portrait as a defense mechanism .	1
I enjoyed this book . I was by far too short . I liked the interaction between the characters . Lila could have been a little more bolder in the beginning to get her bluff on .	1
Having retired from the Marine Corps and with tours aboard ships , I was somewhat interested in this title by Gordan Runyan and was willing to give it a chance . I have read many techno-thrillers and it is easy to get burned out with them . Unfortunately , in most top-selling techno-novels , the technical stuff can get a bit boring and easily clog up the plot.Also , as a practicing and `` born again '' Christian , I was a little unsure how in the world an author could meld the Christian aspect with a technical thriller . Would it be `` hokey '' or would it beat the reader to death ? I should not have worried ! I must admit , this is a phenomenal story , outstanding characters , and many may find a lot in their own lives mirrored here ! The author sure `` knows '' people and their inner thoughts ! The plot is superbly scary with North Korea as the antagonist . Extremely plausible story line . It grips you from the very beginning and goes to the last page . One more thing , it is also a `` love '' story ! This , being the author 's only fiction book , has me amazed . Clancy , Weber , and other techno-writers better watch out if this guy ever decides to go full-time fiction writing ! Lastly , as a Christian , I was absolutely absorbed in the Biblical aspects and quotes . If you are not a practicing Christian , read the book anyway . You wo n't be put off , and may learn a thing or two ! If you are a practicing Christian , you will surely shed a few heart-felt tears ! I did ! Thank you Mr. Runyan for a wonderful novel !	1
I choose this book because of the title , being from Omaha . I was impressed by O'Kane 's knowledge of the area GREAT book	1
This was one very good book . It will draw you in , then it wo n't let you go until the problems have been resolved . I will read more by Kevin O'Kane . His is a refreshing style that draws you to the characters and pulls you into the situation.Many kindle books have extremely poor editing . Besides misspellings and incorrect usage , this one has many compound words written separately as two . The pictures on the 'milk cartoons ' was the last straw ; 'milk cartoons ' was referred to several times . Spellcheck is not an editor . Though I 've become much more lenient over the years , constantly rereading a sentence to decipher it is sometimes intolerable . This detracts from the flow of the unfolding events . It is sad to ruin what otherwise is a great read .	1
Interesting ! It was a different twist to a menage story . I 'm about to start the second one . What will that chick do next ? I appreciate the idea of loving like this ! I 'm sure it would be fantastic ! Now I need an actor who needs a normal every day wife . ; - )	1
i loved the story it is hot sexy and has some size to the book . i would recommend this book with no problems	1
Amazing story and characters . Robyn 's story is heartbreaking yet hopeful . The interplay between characters is believable and made this a book I could not put down . I ca n't waight to read more !	1
Originally Posted at : [ ... ] Dark , mysterious and oh so sexy .

Who would n't want to take care of a starving , visibly abused female like Robyn ? Trigg only wanted to make her evening a little easier by purchasing her a real meal , but that one meal turned into a lifetime.Your heart will immediately go out to Robyn in this story . I was a little concerned that the love story was about an eighteen year-old , because that seemed a little too young in my mind but it worked well since Robyn was forced to grow up fast due to the abuse she lived with . I also enjoyed the way her previous circumstances made her adapt to Trigg and the other Watchers ' way of life easily.Trigg , like many men in these types of novels , is your typical Alpha male . He would have to be in order to be a Watcher for his kind . Only around Robyn can he allow himself to show his softer side . So between Robyn 's need for protection , and his need to loosen up , they come together wonderfully.The plot line was phenomenal . The way everything tied in together was perfect . The story was constantly moving forward and kept me turning page after page . It 's one of those books where you say to yourself this is the last chapter I 'll read , but yet you keep going until you realize you 've read the entire book . It also sets you up perfectly for the next book in the series which I can not wait to read.This was a great love story between two well-deserving characters that you definitely do not want to miss . I highly recommend Midnight Reborn .	1
well written , endearing characters - loved it ! Try Songbird & Overheard as well ! Have been chewing through all of Maya 's work !	1
I loved this book . The characters , J.T and Nikki are great . It is definitely hot and steamy . The story keeps you going and has surprises along the way . I would definitely recommend .	1
This book was funny and interesting , it keep your attention till the very end . The people are real and hopeful for a good ending .	1
JT Summers was in trouble . He lusted after his friends little sister , and he was not happy about it at all . He was supposed to be her protector , but who would save Nikki Durant from him ? He knew that she wanted him just like she knew he was equally affected . When Nikki got herself arrested just to be near him , and JT resisted her once again , she pulled out all stops and went to her friend Jasmine for help.When JT arrived at Sweetwater Ranch to take Jasmine up on the swim she invited him for , he was horrified to find Nikki sunbathing in the nude . He knew at that moment he had been had . After a very erotic encounter , JT could n't get Nikki out of his mind . When she showed up at his office during a rainstorm , and started stripping in his office , he knew he was in deep . There was no way he could resist her , and he did n't even try . It was n't until after their first encounter that he realized he had taken her virginity , and he had all but called her an easy whore.JT did n't know if they even had a name for how badly he had screwed up . Nikki had saved herself for him , and he had treated her horribly . He had tried to see her , but Jasmine , Seth , and Zane had prevented him from getting anywhere near her . He knew he was late in figuring it out , but he was in love with her , and was going to win her back.Another winner by MB ! ! I like Nikki . She is brash , sassy , and goes after what she wants at full steam . No half way with her . JT was fighting himself . He loves Nikki , but is overwhelmed with obligation , and promises made to her brother . JT promised to protect her in her brother 's absence , but was loving her instead . Great read ! !	1
I 've seeking out Elle Kennedy books . Now that I 've stumbled upon her work I want more to read . I will keep looking .	1
This is the first book in the Out of Uniform series . I read the second one first and I think that made me not like this book as much as I would have if I had read it first . I loved the story but I hated the ending . The ending left so much up in the air and the second one advanced their relationship a huge amount . I could n't believe it . It will be interesting to see what the third book has in store for me . I also think that the second book has a better ending and you feel the relationship grow a lot more than you did in the first one . I think that it was a good book , but that it would have been better if say there was one or two more chapters . That being said , I 'm not disappointed in buying this book and reading it . I hope you enjoy it as much as I did , but I would suggest you read this series in order !	1
Enjoyed the story but extremely short for the price . Would have felt justified spending the money if it was at least 20 pages longer .	1
Ms. Kennedy I want to let you know how much I have enjoyed your series , but could it be notated in a more prominent way , so we all can start at the beginning ?	1
Simon he may be the beta of the Pride but that boy is fierce when it comes to his woman , `` if I find yout that you had a hand in helping Livia hurt my mate I will kick your a** so hard you 'll s*** out of your mouth after I have you cast out of the Pride . You understand me ? '' He 's just a big kitty where Becky is concerned , `` Simon was purring . She ran her hands soothingly up and down his back , making him purr even louder . She bit her lip to keep from giggling . '' The man has no shame when it comes to sharing a bathroom , `` he looks at her , confused . He pointed with the toothbrush . `` Toilet 's right there , baby . '' I 'm excited for Adrian 's book .	1
Book 2 of Bell 's `` Halle Pumas '' series . Preceded byThe Wallflower . Followed byCat of a Different Color.Books 1 to 3 are available as a paperback anthologyMating Games.Plot : Simon has to change Becky after her attack by the BadWerePuma , but in the midst of the Mating Glow , something 's very wrong . Becky 's sick and Simon needs to find the cause.Comments : - Contemporary paranormal ( shape shifting ) SmallTown romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 1885 kindle locations , 20,000 words ( short novella ) , but finishes around 1590 locations.- m/f - explicit , reasonably frequent , *happy*.- `` Sweet Dreams '' picks up at the end of Book 1 , just as Livia attacks Becky.- Becky 's BFF had her story told in Book 1The Wallflower . As a `` series '' , the first three books should really be seen as a trilogy where the stories support each other . You *could* read them independently , as stand alones , but would get more satisfaction from reading them in sequence.- Includes excerpts fromImmortal Illusionsby Ursula Bauer , Tyger , Tyger Burning Bryghtby Cathryn Cade , andThe Wallflowerby Dana Marie Bell.- There is a `` free read '' available on the author 's website which gives us a little epilogue of Simon and Becky , `` The Ornament Book 2 '' .Opinion : '' Sweet Dreams '' is a *nice* paranormal romance . It is an easy read with a human-puma mating including her being turned ( unexpectedly ) by Him , and plenty of explicit , happy sex to cement the relationship . It has lol one-liners , a clever , strong woman who is willing to accept the Dominant Alpha thing , while putting him in his place with snarky pet-names . It 's a good book in a nice series . Recommended . `` The Ornament Book2 '' : Simon takes Christmas lights a little too far , but when Becky sees her *real* present , we all know they 're heading for a hot'n'sweaty night.A nice little Christmas epilogue that makes me smile . Thank you Ms Bell.-CR-	1
I 've just started reading this series , I actually started with Bear Necessities , which I loved but these read better when they are in order , the problem is finding out the correct order ! This is book 2 of the Halle Pumas but Halle Shifters is the lead in the series - ok ? Now , I saw a review of 1 star for this book because it was dull , but I do n't feel that way.Why you ask ? These are short books , do n't be fooled by 4000 lines , the last third of the book is sypnosis of other books , I 've actually read 3 in one day and it was n't a stretch to do it.THe stories are engaging , the women are kick-a $ $ and the dialogue is funny ! Basically shifter sees/meets/smells or hears their mate and its on ! If the mate is human , one bite starts the conversion . The shifters are diverse and they inter-marry other species . The main rule is - do n't let the humans know who you are . Apparently that does n't work too well in Halle.There is a lot of carry-over from one book to the next so you meet new characters and revisit old characters in each book.Becky is a human , she has had a crush on Simon , who is a Puma who was made ( not born ) since high school , Simon has been dating one of the town 's snotty women since high school and never really noticed Becky but when she is attacked by a jealous puma and he comes to her rescue , he realizes that she is his mate , that does n't mean that it will be easy for him.I like this series , most of the shifter series I 've read are dark and serious , I like these !	1
I 've read the entire series now -- which is why this book has a 4 Star . I reserve 5 stars for the `` best books I 've ever read '' . While it is a 4 star review , it by no means should give the reader the idea that it was n't a really entertaining read.I love Simon and Becky . I would have liked it if the love scenes in the series were n't so very similar , though . It was a hot , steamy read for sure.As I said , I got the entire series -- after reading the first book -- which should tell you that it was a worthwhile reading experience.As with other reviews , there is no need for me to tell the story -- it 's been done elsewhere.One question : HOW does Becky always know the phone is ringing ? It was an interesting twist -- that I wish had been played out and explained -- or somehow worked into the plot . -- Part of the reason I gave this book 4 stars as well , to be honest , rather than 5 . I dislike unanswered questions !	1
M/M/F ( 2 bisexual males/1 straight female ) usually does n't work well for me for a multitude of reasons , and the love scenes usually make me roll my eyes . They tend to be purple and overdone . Not so in this book ! The sex in this book curled my toes . I had to actually catch my breath after the first scene between Cassie and Kyle . Whew . And the heat never lets up ! Every encounter in this book is a scorcher.The menage situation in this book is surprisingly believable . Cassie 's attraction to both of her best friends and her heartbreak at discovering them together is sweet and realistic . Her reasons for leaving town make perfect sense . Even Kyle and Alan 's reason for looking to each other for affection works pretty well . The story is n't perfect , but I found it much more believable than most M/M/F I 've encountered.This book was on track to be an A+ read -- and then the author pulled out the oldest menage clich & eacute ; in the book . No spoilers here , but it 's one of those `` love it or hate it '' issues and I 'm in the latter camp.If I were to ever read this again , I 'd stop after the last big love scene and skip the ending . All in all , a B- read . -9/22/08	1
4 out of 5 stars ! This is an erotic feast that spices you up with a plot keeps you wanting more . Even though this is a short story it is filled with love and passion . So much so , that I did n't want to put it down . Cassie , Kyle & Alan were a great pairing.I recommend this novella to anyone who enjoys M/M/F romances ! ! Review By : From Me to You ...

Although only novella length this story has a wonderful combination of wit and the supernatural.The main character finds himself in the middle of a Troll quest . A quest that threatens to reignite a war between a Troll clan and the undead.This does n't bother Markhat in the slightest though . He manages to navigate any rough waters no matter how many holes his boat might have.Tuttle has a way of telling the story , it just flows with such simplicity and yet at the same time has a layer of unrefutable humour that pops up and makes you grin.AVP-UK	1
First , Frank Tuttle is certifiable , but in a good way . I 've found myself saying , `` This is n't my favorite genre '' a lot lately . I discovered Frank on the Kindle Discussion boards and his posts were so hilarious that I just had to try his books . If you have n't read his blog , be warned : Do not have a beverage near your computer when you read the entry about the lawnmower.That said , I read Dead Man 's Rain first and had so many questions that I emailed Frank . What 's a Jerk ? Which war was this , where is this set , etc . Silly me , still forgetting that this is a fantasy . I missed out on a lot of the background by not reading The Mister Trophy first , so if you 're reading this and have n't read any of the other Markhat series yet , definitely start with this one . He answered me right away . But you can save yourself the embarrassment of having to be told , in the nicest possible way , `` It 's all a fantasy , I made it up '' . I would have gotten that immediately if I had read the books in order.To paraphrase one of the best lines from the book , a troll should never smile at someone he likes . I almost dropped my Kindle.The Misters are trolls . These are not your cutesy little bridge trolls ( or even the ones who hang out on discussion boards ) , that would be too easy . These are big , scary , long-fanged , gargly-voiced trolls with translation spells , definitely not adorable.Markhat is a 'finder ' , Tuttle-speak for Private Eye . He 's also a smart aleck and as entertaining as protaganists get . The book is short , but that 's okay , there are three more to read , soon to be four.The Markhat world also features vampires , aka the half-dead , ogres , Mamma Hog , a reader who mothers - and puts hexes on - the sometimes reckless Markhat.All of this sounded silly to me when I read the description , but Frank manages to take all this insanity and turn it into a wildly entertaining read.Start with this one and keep on going ... they just keep getting better ! The price is right and even if you 've never liked fantasy novels before ( I had n't ) , you 'll love these .	1
Did n't take me long to love Markhat , and to feel comfortable enough in his world to enjoy tagging along.Everyone else has said it so well !	1
This was a Finalist for the Darrell Award for Best Midsouth Novella the year it came out . See [ ... ] Markhat stories are all loads of fun to read .	1
Oh , wow . This is why I got a Kindle , to find fun new authors who write new and original stories . Dead Man 's Rain is set in a gritty world where magic happens , but it 's not common , where ogres live alongside humans and the occasional elf , where rich vampires hunt the night with the permission of the local authorities , and where finder Markhat has unwanted assistance in getting cases from his neighbor , the card reader Mama Hog . And then you get to the case itself . . . .Along with creating fascinating characters , the author gives a lot of little details that make the story come alive.One note , though : as other reviewers have mentioned , this is a short story/novella and not a novel.Would I reread this book ? I already have.Would I spend money on this book ? I would , and I did . In fact , I ended up buying all of his books , even Wistril Compleat , which is very different in tone and content.Kindle infoFormatting : Very well formatted.Length : 1452 locations ( 1453-1611 contain the About the Author and an excerpt from 7 % and Rising )	1
This book was a surprise for me . I have had it on my Kindle for awhile but the synopsis did not catch my interest . I was going to archive it without reading it but decided to give it a fast cursory run through . It caught and held my attention . I finished it in one sitting.The butler and the protagonist were the most interesting characters . During the storm the action was a little confusing but that did not detract from the over all read . Being a teacher I just had to make note of grammatical/typo errors . There were no egregious errors that detracted from the story.Is it me or do the Kindle editions of books have more errors than the paperback/hardbound books ? I have wanted to literally compare a Kindle edition to the paperback version . Guess I am too cheap and/or too busy to do this . One day I will summon up enough interest/motivation to do this experiment .	1
After moving from Santa Fe to Asheville to start a new job , Thomas Stone is not pleased to find out the club he 's supposed to be managing is n't opening yet . Broke and in need of a place to stay , Thom sets off to find a temporary job . He ends up finding a job bartending at The Happy Onion , a vegan restaurant . He celebrates by going out to a club , intending to get laid.Philip Sorrells is bored with the scene at his favorite hangout , at least until a hot young man walks in the door . He 's more than glad to pick the guy up , and the night and morning that follow are incredible . Things get weird , however , when he learns his one-night stand is working at his restaurant . Phil wants to pursue a relationship with Thom , but Thom 's reluctant to have any sort of relationship with a boss . Other issues intrude as well . Can these two very different men figure out a way to be together ? The Happy Onion has a little something for everyone . There 's humor , emotion , hot sex , and even some suspense . The characters are all very likeable , especially the hot-tempered , young-looking Thom and Phil , whose delight in annoying Thom just to get a reaction made me snicker . The conflicts between Thom and Phil struck me as realistic , especially given how different the two men were and how Phil felt about Thom 's future employers . Of course , the love scenes between them are hot and sometimes emotional as well . While The Happy Onion wo n't be replacing Eight Arms to Hold You or Willow Bend as my favorite Ally Blue book , it was certainly an enjoyable read . If you 're a fan of Ms. Blue or just gay romance in general , you 're sure to enjoy The Happy Onion just as I did.Cassiereviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

There are many things going on with this plot , but it 's great , I do n't want to say too much and spoil it for everyone . I recommend this book highly .	1
I most enjoyed reading through this three books series ! Linked characters around a caring character who has past captured me as well as the merging of lives across the stories ! Reading more than once with these three books .	1
A book that makes you think while you 're reading it and even more after . So very well written , this book held my interest until the last page.This is a compelling book by an author that I would definitely buy from again . His characters are troubled and bizarre , but you begin to understand them finally and really feel for them and their various situations.The formatting was a bit off , but nothing that made the book unreadable .	1
I loved this book , but I kinda figured out what was going on with Ethan before he hever left Will the nexy morning . Keep upi the good work ! !	1
Good action adventure featuring Hannibal and the original cast of characters , plus . I enjoy his cool and calm in the worst of circumstances - especially when he 's being beaten senseless . Light , fun and exciting . A quick `` two-day read . ''	1
I will have to say I think this one was your best . However he needs to drop the question and ask her . I think I am in love with Cindy as she is the perfect mate..Good job on this book my friend	1
Great novel . It surprised me ; it was different from the previous Hannibal Jones mysteries . There was less beating up bad guys and more vulnerability . As usual , the characters were all very interesting and very unique . Read this one !	1
This is the first Hannibal Jones book I 've read , and it is a delight on all levels . The writing is excellent to exquisite . the characters are believable ( including the hero , who can do amazing things , but is still extremely human ) . the setting is lovingly and meticulously drawn , in several locales , and the story left me absolutely breathless on more than one occasion.I especially enjoyed some of the side action , for example , the examination of hip hop music ... with which I am absolutely unacquainted , and the insight into lifestyles with which I do not have , and will never have experience . they added texture and color to this book , without detracting in the least from the story line . In fact , the author drew all the threads together in a smooth , professional manner that impressed me.Toward the end , I admit to thinking *now* what 's going to happen ? And something always did , but , surprising and delighting me , what happened was never quite predictable , so I did n't mind what seemed an extended climax . All in all , this is a wonderful read , and offers more than a little of more than a few things for any reader .	1
I enjoyed this book so much ! Loved the main hero Hannibal Jones ! What an Alpha Male Hero ! I was so busy turning the pages that my poor husband had to do all the chores ! The suspense never let 's up ! The action is well planned ! It is a taut , fast pace action thriller with just enough of romance interweaved ! I loved the fact that that the author , Mr Camacho , made Hannibal a very human hero , who wins a few and loses a few ! For fans of Action Thrillers this is a book well worth reading ! I am definitely a FAN !	1
I read this book in about five hours and I loved it just as much if not more than the first . The story continues smoothly from the first to the second . Ca n't wait for the next book in the series .	1
Loved this Dragon knight series can get pretty wet sex scenarios throughout the book and series so be prepared . Love and sex plus suspense and drama .	1
This author has became all time favyou will love this book as will you love all the others read them in order for the best understanding but still great read	1
I had high hopes for this one , and this met that level of hope ! The Hero and Heroine were actually nice . I liked the interaction between them and it turned into a hot romance !	1
Good novel easy reading and a delight to read . Helped me to relax and dream easily.Would recommend to those who like Bianca 's work .	1
CONSUMED showcases the ability of Moira McTark ( aka Mira Lyn Kelly ) to write realistic characters , VERY witty dialogue and STEAMY scenes.Amber Grayson has had a crush on Brian Matthers since high school . Although they never got together , he represents her ideal man . This story is about what happens when they meet on the train coming home from work . `` So , what ` s your stop ? '' he asked , smiling a little too platonically for her taste . `` `` She said a silent prayer , begging the LUST FAIRIES to accost him at full throttle . `` `` Taking a deep breath , he wondered how he was going to get through dinner without crawling under the table and pressing his face to her ... '' My one issue would be that the problems Amber has with Eric are resolved in a too simplistic fashion.If you enjoyed this novel , check out WAKING UP MARRIED , ONCE IS NEVER ENOUGH , and THE S BEFORE EX .	1
This was a great story and HOT . The characters seemed to get into it pretty fast which usually is a bad sign . However with this one you understand why that is pretty quickly . I understood why Amber felt the way she did as well as why Brian did . There was a pretty good twist at the end as well . It did feel like a grudge match there for a bit but the reasons are again clear . I think she reacted realisticly when put on the defensive . How do you go from having everything you ever wanted to letting it go without a fight . For Brian he had noticed her before but he had not grasped the fact that Amber had him on such a pedestal . It was a stroke of luck that they met again and while he was not happy with how things were moving along he was not going to just walk away from it no matter what it cost his sense of right and wrong . There were parts that made me want to cry as well but in the end it made for a happier ending . I am looking forward to reading more by Ms. McTark .	1
This is one of my favorite Harlequins . I 've read it several times . I thought the hero and heroine characters were very well written , and I loved how the hero worked so hard to get the heroine back and show what he felt for her . I even appreciated how the hero 's family was described ( warts and all ) . A great read . Recommended .	1
I want to start by saying this is a great cover . Sexy man in heart underwear clearly highlighting his `` attributes '' I mean what 's not to like right . So without even cracking the cover it 's off to a very promising start . The story is well paced , engaging and carries you seamlessly to the very last page . The relationship and interaction between the main charcters is natural , realistic and gets nice and steamy without dragging on too long in any one spot . I do wonder if anything will come of Suzanne and Stan seeing as there was mention of them meeting to discuss business and it stood out to me that maybe there could be more there ? ? Another book perhaps ; ) In the end Lacy 's adventurous side will balance out Gabe 's more reserved side and they 'll find their HEA . This was my first time reading Tori Scott and I 'm definitly looking forward to reading her other books , cuz if there anything like this one I wo n't be disappointed !	1
I have truly enjoyed reading the Cedar Cove Series - I feel as if I am part of Cedar Cove family ( families ) . This is a great read . I throughly enjoyed .	1
I love this series ! ! I have read the first 4 books and it 's hard to put it down . You get to know the characters , and just when you think you know what 's going to happy , things change . Money well spent , ca n't wait to finish this set , so I can start the next .	1
Fortunately I do n't have too I have them all on my Kindle . I watched the Hallmark series and was hooked ! It is so great to have faces and voices to relate to the characters in the books .	1
Loved all the books . I am officially a resident now . Love all my neighbors . Can relate to Charlotte the most .	1
Bought it on a whim , have n't read all of the stories but I can tell you the few I have read are very disturbing . The book is well put together and not at all what I expected , not sure what that was , but it was n't what I got . Do n't read this if you are an over sensitive person - must be open to the ideas of human kind and our darkness within from the authors perspectives .	1
A cat tale by an expert so to speak ... Sisyphus tells it well thru his friend Patricia..I 'm glad I . read the book..I hope you enjoy his story as . I did	1
This one will made you verrrrrrrrry angry , it will show you love , sadness loyalty , despair , and above all hope.It will make you ashamed if you do n't help stop the cruelty , it will break your heart and make you cry.Thank you Ms Halloff for giving Sisypuss a voice it is one so many of us Need to hear .	1
This bundle is all three of the Bakery sisters series by Susan Mallery . You will love all three books . It 's a good set of books that show the authors talent . Love everything I have read from her .	1
Got all three of the sister 's books in one book . I really enjoyed each of them and love the way Susan writes .	1
I have come to love Susan Mallery 's books . it seems that she is all I want to read right now ! !	1
I thought this was a good book and the writing was very good . If I have a criticism , it is that some authors like to make their main characters suffer a little too much and this author is one of them . Other than that , it is a very good read .	1
Good innovative story line that does well to introduce a series . Had a little trouble connecting the expected series plots but think it will become clear	1
As expected from the Mossy Creek ensemble , this anthology provides an entertaining insightful look at the south . The fifteen tales are well written with each focusing on relationships made better by sharing sweet tea ( no artificial ingredients allowed ) . As this reviewer read two to three tales a night , the charming stories reminded me of the trial scene in My Cousin Vinnie in which Pesci as the defense lawyer describes how to cook grits as he actually uses that as a metaphor on life . That is what the MORE SWEAT TEA and SWEET TEA gifts the audience . Fans will find the anthology quite endearing and groundbreaking as these belles of the south now include a male contributor this time , ( Mike Roberts ) amidst the iron maidens with hearts who have provided strong regional short stories with a variety of regional recipes such as Aunt Sophie 's Pennies from Heaven or Bubba 's Chili that go well with MORE SWEET TEA.Harriet Klausner	1
What a wonderful set of detective stories ! As captivating and well written as Arthur Conan Doyle 's . The attention to scientific detail was so accurate . I would recommend this compilation to all fans of detective stories - young and older alike !	1
Having grown up on a diet of Sherlock Holmes , I was keen to see how this compared . My recollection of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle 's works , it being some time since I read them , is that they are difficult to beat . The language in this book is a little archaic but with the help of the Kindle dictionary this was n't too much of a problem . Not sure I would have said the same if the dictionary had not been available . I enjoyed this enough to buy volume 2 .	1
These stories were a delight to read ... .a testament to good writing . Today 's authors should take note . Ca n't wait to read volume 2 collection.Pure entertainment . A couple of stories were short , but that 's okay . It just gives you the feeling that you 're reading a journal .	1
Dr. Thorndyke is truely a fantastic legal eagle combined with a medical doctor . All his cases are in the early 1900s when they were written and the author uses logic and science to prove his theories . I truely believe Freeman was writing about the first Forensic Scientist when he created Dr. Thorndyke .	1
Since I had n't read anything with this character previously I will address both the content and the formatting.Kindle formatting and navigation : Linked table of contents to the individual books and anthologies ( nice ) but not to the chapters within the books ( would 've been nice to have ) . Scalable font . The pictures were a bit wasted on the six inch screen but they were nice to have on the PC app . All in all formatting is a 4.5 out of 5 , the half star being deducted for the lack of chapter links.Content : I enjoyed meeting Dr. Thorndyke and Dr. Jervis but I did n't get as attached to them as to , say , Poirot or Miss Marple or Sherlock Holmes . There was much less of `` them '' present in the works ... although the fact that Dr. Thorndyke never quite figured out how inept Dr. Jervis was grated a little ... maybe I am too used to watching Poirot and Holmes watch indulgently as Hastings and Watson bumble along to believe anyone could be blind to his inadequacies . The mysteries themselves were generally pretty decent , and the detective work was quite interesting . Of the three long tales one of the three was incredibly predictable , and two of the three were moderately predictable . The short stories were far more enjoyable although they were also mostly predictable . They were fun and kept me reading more so than the novels did . If I had to guess at the goal of the author just from these four works I would have to say that he was trying to illustrate new methods of detection and problem solving in an entertaining way much more than he was trying to tell stories about interesting characters . Novels 3.5 stars . Short stories 4 stars.Decent read . Might try to find some other short story collections with these characters .	1
I did n't know that there were such books written so long ago and I 'm enjoying these stories . I hope other give them a read !	1
Another wonderful book of Dr. Thorndyke mysteries which I thoroughly enjoyed ! I love the way the author weaves the clues into the puzzle every time ! And I could never guess the answer until I read it !	1
I had never read Dr Thorndyke before , and I really like these stories . They are of the genre of Sherlock Holmes and Christie 's Perot . Great reading .	1
This is quite a bit different from Volume 1 . The first few stories were written from the perspective of the criminal committing the crime which was somewhat different . But enter Dr. Thorndyke and justice is served . The author is somewhat of a loquacios writer in that 10 or 20 words are used when 1 or none would do . But he really does set the scene . The authors of mysteries always need to create the crimes and clues to match the expertise of esoteric knowledge of the protagonist but some of the these stories are over the top . However they are still very interesting and impart facts that I was n't aware of . They are extremely fun and interesting reads and I will continue to search for more like them .	1
As with any & # 34 ; frontier & # 34 ; the American west had its share of opportunists , dreamers , hard working folks , bigger than life characters , and dangerous misfits . The book explores lesser known outlaws and lawmen and takes away the layers of myth surrounding many well known characters like Jessee James and Billy the Kid . Pat Garrett 's life was interesting and his interview about tracking and killing Billy the Kid told it like it was . For anybody with an interest in America 's frontier days this is a great read .	1
Griffin is a man on flight . His family wants him dead and he has no one and no where to go . He is young and smart but in an post apocaliptic world he is alone . And one night , in an alley , he is shot dead . Or he thinks so . But then Jarrah arrives to help him.Jarrah is a vampire . A former doctor he cherishes the human life above all . And he hates himself to be a vampire . And like Griffin , he is alone.Griffin is immediately drawn by the vampire , better by the man , although it is the first time he feels sexual desire for a man . But it is not a gay thing , it is the need of a lonely soul to share its feeling . And does n't matter if this soul is of a man . Love is above the gender.A very beautiful novel , very intimate and close : for the most part shared between the two characters , it has also very well written sex scenes .	1
Trust is a hard thing to earn but so easy to lose . This is a story of two very different beings who were both betrayed but learn to trust and love again in the arms of each other .	1
I really like to learn about how women managed just n the past and this was a good read , very positive outlook for someone with 11 children all born at home-	1
So lovely old fashion down to earth . Just perfect no other words to describe this story . A wonderful family read . No bad language , no sex just an good honest book . Loved every word could n't wait for the next chapter . Wish it could have gone on forever . No disappointments in this read .	1
What an amazing story . So glad to have read it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to know about life in America last century .	1
This is the second time I have read this book and I love it ad much as the first time . It is a story of love , loss , finding joy and love again , understanding how fragile life can be . It is written with sensitivity yet lace throughout with humor as only this author knows how to write .	1
This love story is delightful . Ryan and Mariah , a workaholic father and a genius child , are living a life devoid of real happiness . Ryan wants to secure Mariah ' s future , by making a fortune and having Mariah ' s intellect developed . Being at work and not spending time with Mariah , causes her to look for a mother . Chance brings Kelsey into the father and daughter 's lives . Bringing these three people together makes their story an enjoyable and interesting read . The author , makes each character realistic . This was quick read because I could not put the book down . I hope everyone will enjoy this much as I did . True romance will always win with me .	1
I love how Dave Emberson breaks down Kindle procedures into clear steps , just like making an omelet . Do this , then do that . If you follow his steps , you 'll serve up a tasty banquet of new ways to enjoy your new Kindle . It 's well worth the price , and his is a guide which I still consult often . Dave is also updating his book frequently , which is an additional benefit of buying it , as well as a great example of the benefits of Kindle reading versus print.I interviewed Dave by telephone for the October 31 , 2008 episode of my weekly audio podcast , The Kindle Chronicles . If you 'd like to hear how he came to write the book and his thoughtful perspectives on the Kindle , here is the link : [ ... ]	1
Sexy , passionate	1
Love this historical erotic plot . Some BDSM elements to it & happy ever after was very much my cup of tea .	1
I found it to be a great book I recommend it , from start to finish it had met , quite intriguing really . I love books written in this era and I was not disappointed .	1
H. Beam Piper is one of my favorite authors . His Terran Federation stories and books are representatives of the period of time he was writing and you can see the influence that the publishers had with references to other authors works or maybe his works influenced them ?	1
This is one awesome book . I will keep this one to use daily ... .Read it if you are wounded or broken .	1
As a lifelong Christian ( I was raised in a Christian home , was saved at 8 yrs old , never known a time in my life where I did n't know Jesus ) I 've experienced some very hurtful things in churches in the past . The church I was saved in had a business meeting in order to fire one of the pastors . My parents supported all the pastors but we were in the minority . The meeting became very heated until finally we had to run out of the sanctuary . People became ugly fast and chased us , even shooting a gun into the air in the church sanctuary . They literally ran us out of town . We moved and my parents joined the First Baptist Church but did n't attend church very much and finally not at all . They did n't lose their faith in Jesus Christ but they lost faith in the church ( and my Mom was the daughter of a minister ) . As a teenager , I began attending a small church with some friends but the older people of the congregation resented being overrun with teenagers . It disrupted their placid spiritual life so they fired the preacher and all the teens left that church . My husband and I joined a church in 1983 and attended until 2009 . We were very active . But of all the pastors that went through our church , I could probably count on one hand the ones that did n't abuse the congregation in one way or another . Finally , we had a straw-that-broke-the-camels'-back event and we left our church . Needless to say I 'm gun shy now ! We 've been visiting churches all over our town but have n't found a match yet . I think I might like one but only to get anxious that we would invest our time , money and selves into a body that has the same problems . It takes awhile before you get to know the church , policies , leadership , congregants enough to know if all is well or something is rotten in Denmark . I had almost made up my mind to be like my parents and just drop out of the church scene and worship God in my own way . Then I read this book . I think the book 's description is right on the mark so I wo n't repeat it . But , since I started reading this book , we 've started visiting more churches and praying that we find one soon .	1
This book addresses a problem most churches ignore . Many people leave organized religion because of the pain inflicted by the religious . Chris Jackson addresses the problem from both sides and offers understanding and healing for the wounded . Highly recommend this book for anyone who has been offended in church .	1
I love this story..it 's so touching , beautiful & fulfilling . Thank you Ms McCray for sharing such a beautiful love story .	1
I liked this though very short . There was some background and although I felt like Devin should have been more of a woman than to run , Erik made sure that she realised her mistake and wanted a 'do-over ' very badly . Ca n't argue with a man who knows what he wants and is not afraid to break down a few walls to get at it . Go team Erik ! And yeah , the engagement ring fiasco ... classic .	1
I felt a lot of emotions with Z and Bella . Loved this to pieces ! The series is amazing and would recommend to anyone !	1
I really loved this book . Without spoiling it , this book is so worth it . I really enjoyed reading it , it had me sad and crying on some parts . Love the relationship of Z and Bella . Was so happy of the turn out of Z with his daughter Nalla . Wish to read more of this family .	1
I think most readers will agree that Zsadist is a favorite among the Brotherhood . We love a tortured soul . And this is Zsadist trying to interact with his precious new daughter . Ward helps us understand the character 's continuing sense of isolation and feelings of inadequacy . This was a nice treat for readers	1
I love all of the Black Dagger Brotherhood books but Zsadist and Butch are my two favorite characters , so I am always happy to find a story about one of them . It was nice to get some follow up on Zsadist and Bella as the regular books jumped right past the pregnancy to the baby being there..so you did n't get any details on anything . This was a short story but it was a very good read and I am glad I discovered it .	1
This was such a touching story about my favorite BDB couple , Zsadist & Bella . I just discovered the Black Dagger Brotherhood series about a month ago , and I 've gone through all the books . I 'll be reading this one again while I wait for the latest BDB book to come out ( in about a week ) .	1
If you are a fan of the Black Dagger Brotherhood and have not yet read this story , it is an absolute Must Read . The story was previously published inThe Black Dagger Brotherhood : An Insider 's Guide , so if you do n't do e-readers it 's still available to be read . Or , if you do have the Insider 's Guide you already have this story and do n't need to repurchase.As can be told by the product description it gives more detail about Zsadist and Bella -- the main characters from the third novelLover Awakened ( Black Dagger Brotherhood , Book 3 ) If you have not yet read any of the BDB series , this is NOT the place to start , you should really start withDark Lover ( Black Dagger Brotherhood , Book 1 ) . Following the way many paranormal romance series are published , each title in the series features a main character who happens to find his/her fated love . With a lot of angst and hot/detailed nookie involved to make it interesting . That said , this series is fabulous in that aspect -- JR Ward does a great job with her world building and each story continues an overall plot arc . Each tale is also good at keeping tabs on favorites from other books . Because there is a lot of story arc going on it is pretty important to keep going in order.This novella was not integral to the story told in Lover Awakened , but clearly more Z/B was needed . This is a wonderful , prolonged , epilog in a manner of speaking . Truly a wonderful read and I hope she does more like this to keep us up to date with the other characters.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ( both this and the whole series ! ) JTG	1
This was a great little addition to the series , I love having another look into Bella & Z 's life as they deal with the struggles of becoming new parents . Given Z 's past I thought that his reaction to being a new father was very realistic and the strain it put between him and Bella was heartbreaking . But watching him deal with his feelings and again fighting to overcome his past was great . His first interactions with Nalla brought tears to my eyes . This was a great short story and I would recommend to any fan of the series !	1
How can you not want to know more about Z and Bella . Ward continues to keep me on on the edge of my seat and wanting more . One of the best books in her series of the BDB . No stone was left unturned , even though it was a novella .	1
Zsadist is my favorite brother . He won my heart in book 2 `` Lover Eternal '' . He can be stubborn but so why so many threats , Bella ? I am disappointed with Bella . She has her fears and they are true concerns , but she knew Z was not much of a talker when she mated him . Instead of talking to each other , they let their thoughts build up and neither one of them can read minds . So Bella is left with threats and ultimatums . And that just broke my heart . All ends well but it was `` much to do about nothing '' if they only talked to each other.Any Z & Bella fan , this is a must read !	1
This is a sweet book about Zhadist and what he does to put his past behind him so that he can have the future he truly wants with his mate and child.And what a mate he has . She is perfect for him . Understanding and loving and willing to do whatever is necessary to protect her child and assure the future she deserves . She is strong and determined and yet loving and accepting for Zhadist as he is as well as the horrible past that has molded him into the person he is now.And what love Zhadist has for Bella . He is willing to do whatever must be done to exorcise his demons so he can give her and his child the life they deserve . A truly touching story of love.This story is a must read for any BDB fans .	1
If you are reading the BDB series and are debating whether or not to get this book . Just go ahead and do it . It 's so worth it .	1
JR Ward please note Zadist is my favorite of all the Bothers . The next time he shows up in another novel it better be rated 5 stars	1
I downloaded this book right after I read Zsadist 's story in the series.Needless to say , I loved this book . While I did n't like the beginning because of the turmoil that was going on with Zsadist and his unacceptance of his daughter.I sped through the book because I needed to know that he overcame his obstacles and as usual the book did not disappoint.I was happy for Zsadist when he finally worked through his issues and was delighted to see the family dynamic between him , his wife and his daughter.Great read . I would love to read about Rhage and Mary as the author hinted in this book that Mary wanted to have a child . Also , and update on the King and Queen would be nice .	1
Zsadist being who he is and what has happened to him and then finding Bella and how she helps transform him into what we all know him to be ... ..loving . Their story was was of the best in the BDB books .	1
If your a BDB fan and especially a fan of Zsadist this novella is a must ! It is a touching story about Zsadist after his daughter is born . I fell in love with him all over again .	1
this was a good novella that added more information to Zsadist and Bella 's Story a must read . i enjoyed it	1
I haven ' read every one of the books , but I intend to over time ... Why ? Because as much as I love the old fashioned and complex writing style which is SO detailed ; it is quite tiring to focus on so many more words than most modern authors would use to describe a dream , a room , a road , a beloved face and so forth ... Still very worth reading and great for one 's vocabulary	1
It 's complete , what more can one ask for ? Good deal for the knowledgeable Janite or for those who possess a streak of meaness .	1
Eden LaCroix is involved in a battle to save the community center she manages . Repairs and updates are needed yes , but to completely tear down the building ? The last thing she expects is for her old flame Billy Buchanan to be brought in to evaluate and decide the fate of the community center.Billy is n't quite prepared for his reaction when he first sees Eden again . He last saw her ten years earlier when he ran from the temptation of a sexual encounter with Eden after the prom . He 's been brought in by Feather Light Consulting to evaluate the Community Center which should be a completely unbiased review but his reaction to keeping his feelings for Eden and his opinion on the state of the building separate may prove to be very difficult.Things quickly heat up between Billy and Eden but she 's not looking for a happily-ever-after . Billy has his own life in Illinois and he 'll return there once his job is done . There 's nothing wrong with indulging in a little mutual pleasuring while they 're together though , is there ? Popular drummer/singer Jon WhiteFeather , Eden 's friend and sometimes lover , has just come off the road and returned to town and the situation seems to be easy enough to handle since they do n't have any expectations of each other . Eden even tells Jon that she is seeing someone and agrees to meet up with him later and bring Billy so that the men can meet . Unexpectedly , Jon and Billy meet before the ` date ' because Jon and Billy just happened to be staying in the same condo . They form a fast friendship and the evening goes much smoother than she 'd even hoped . The only downside are the snide petty comments and racial slurs of from a couple of women whom Jon and Billy turned down.Eden 's so hurt by the comments that she wants only to leave the bar and return home to ` lick her wounds ' but Jon and Billy have different ideas . They take her to the condo - originally just to talk so they could find out what upset her so much but then once they start comforting her ... well , let 's just say Jon and Billy have no qualms about making a girl 's fantasies a reality so that she feels like she 's the most desirable woman in the world.Billy hurt Eden deeply once ; dare she hope that she wo n't get burned if she allows herself to admit to loving him ?

I love the Wardens . I really do . but Shane was such a jerk ! it was hard to like him at all . even the end ! it is a good read . keep them coming ! !	1
A different species portrayed convincingly . This series continues to be engaging . I loved the leading characters . Sexy and amusing with suspense to keep you glued to your reader .	1
Her entire series is a MUST read . The bonds run deep in this romantic , mysterious and adventerous series !	1
I liked the premise of the book and the characters but I felt like it was cut short . I think it would have been better if a little more effort put into drawing the story out since it seemed condensed . I like how the story starts and there are some great scenes the chemistry between characters is great . Still a fun read .	1
Our pasts affect us more than we know . This is a sweet loving story of a woman learning more about herself with the help of two men who love her . Wonderful story from a great author !	1
This is my second book of hers , and I have to admit I 'm still getting used to the idea of a menage , but Annmarie does them very well . The emotion was very well done . A very emotional , gripping read . The heroine was extremely realistic and the abuse aspect was handled exceptionally well . I thoroughly enjoyed this book . I 've just become a fan . Going to have to go through her backlist now .	1
This is a pretty good story , has a little of everything going on and keeps you reading . I read it in less than a day and enjoyed it ! !	1
Great story of wanting , romance , sex . I would recommend this book to anyone to read . I ca n't wait to read another one .	1
TJ and Jon are very HOT in this book . Christine finds love and pleasure she did not no exsited .	1
I decided to give McKenna another try , regardless of my disappointment with Two Sighted . Main reasons , I loved the characters of Jon and TJ from the first book , and , of course , the menage angle is pretty intriguing . I enjoyed the story for this book a lot more than the first . The characters were not as strong as I normally prefer , but the book was a good read and I 'm glad I picked it up ; although , its priced a bit high for only 100 pgs .	1
In world that is invaded by demon like creatures , humans and vampires are fighting back using a variety of methods that they can use but in the end ... This story goes deeper than that , it is about acceptance and forgiveness as well determination to know what you want and going for it . It is for believing things that you may not want to see ... The book was captivating like many of Kallysten 's books are but the descriptive about the different elements were fascinating and it was an enjoyable book to read . Overall I would rate this book a solid 4 stars.If you like paranormal elements as well as futuristic sci-fi books then this is one you may enjoy as well.I am looking forward to the next installment in the series.I received a copy of the book from the author , thank you .	1
When Earth is taken over by demons and we mere humans must ban with vampires for survival , you get Blurred Nights.Kallysten always delivers . It 's amazing to me how she writes so many series that are so different.Character development evolves naturally . The romance is believable . I 'm definitely ready to read the next installment.4.5 Stars !	1
Wonderful book . All of Kallysten 's work that I have read as of yet as been wonderful.This one took me a bit to jump in , and get the bearing and surroundings for some reason . I had a cold for a bit , so maybe it was just that.Marc and Blake are vampires . Marc being the Master and Blake being his Childe . The setting is in the future when Pacts are no longer formed or mean much of anything . ( Pacts are where vampires keep humans safe and in exchange they give vampires blood . ) ( To learn more about Pacts see Kallysten 's series titled The Pact ) Vampires used to keep humans safe from the demons that roam the earth . There seem to be more and more demons roaming , this is caused by rips in the reality . Marc and Blake are looking for the rip when they come across some human fighters who are in need of assistance . Of course humans nowadays are n't as trusting and fear that these 2 vampires might be working with the demons . so it takes some time before a little bit of trust is formed.Amongst the group of fighters is Kate , who both Marc and Blake find attractive and desire . Kate is slow to realize it , but she too has an attraction to not just one of them but both of them . Although there is ground work set for more with these 3 , there is n't much in this book . ( ca n't wait for the next one and the one after that , as it will be about these three , but back to this one first . ) They fight together and the start to trust one another , and slowly build more of a foundation.The vampires and the humans main goal becomes to find the rip and get it sealed , so they move on to a new town and start once more . Slowly making earth a safe place once again . There is hurt , and some betrayal , and enough lust to make you want more . Once the story gets going , its hard to put down , it just seems to fly by and before you know it its over and your wanting the next book so you can continue on with their journey and see what more is to come .	1
I have read a few of Kallysten 's books , and I have to say she never disappoints . Loved the storyline and the action in this book . Kallysten 's words give you the feeling as if you are right there living the story . I found this future world very intriguing , where humans and vampires are fighting together against their enemy demons . Kate , a human fighter and strong woman finds herself attracted to Marc and Blake , her vampire allies . Even though she has this strong feeling for both men she tries her best not to come between them . Marc and Blake have their own special bond as Sire and Childe and I ca n't wait to see how all three character 's relationship progresses . Kallysten is a great story teller and her descriptive details in all her stories are worth reading . She has become one of my favorite authors .	1
In a fantasy land where vampires help humans to defeat an enemy from another dimension . There 's plenty of fighting action along with romance between vampire and human . The characters were well developed so you could understand their relationships and emotions . This book is a great beginning to a series !	1
This was the first book I have read with an in depth m/m storyline , and I was pleasantly surprised . Essentially I was hesitant due to the m/m content thinking I would n't like the story because of it , but I decided to give it a try and I am happy to say this book has opened a new subgenre to me . I ca n't wait to read the rest of the trilogy .	1
I bought a Kindle 1 from my friend . It allows me to enjoy books and preiodicals again with its large print and clear e-ink . It frees me from reading large print only on the computer.I subscribe to USA Today 's e-Edition . It looks like the printed paper . I can save it as a pdf and enlarge the print . The problems are : there is more information in each daily than I can absorb , and I 'm stuck in front of a computer.I prefer the Kindle edition of USA Today . It is more concise , thankfully . It 's easy to navigate through articles and sections , and so is a quicker read.It would be nice if the publisher allowed downloading editions I might have missed . Until then , I must keep the online e-Edition subscription for past issues.I am totally happy with USA Today 's Kindle Edition . Thanks ! Arthur .	1
I appreciate reading USA Today on my iPhone4 . It 's easy to download and has no adds . I live overseas . The price is right and I can buy with one click .	1
Good one , for those looking for something easy to read . The characters are the typical `` me hot , you horny '' type . Was a nice , fast read .	1
Wine drinking vampires- start of a new series with vamps and there one true mates- a great start to a new series	1
Loved the story line . It was a great book . The only problem I have with it was it was just to short	1
I though the book was really good I liked how they got together and did n't play games like most romance novels will sometimes do I hate that now the only thing that I feel should have been done to this book is the ending needs to be changed did she move in with him did they get married what happened and when her dad said he was going to clean house I think we should have known what ever came of that since it was dealing with what happend to Cyn 's dress other than that I found the book to be really good I read it in 3.5 hours the sex between them will have you thinking you are there with them great hot love	1
Sam and Riley work around a betrayal that slices deep and realise that what they wanted was in front of them all along.This is a quick read , but you wo n't be disappointed . There is n't much character development ( as a result of length ) , but it makes up for it by being sweet and romantic .	1
Sam has lost her bar , all her money and a place to live - Sam decided life is too short so she is going to HAVE Riley Scott ex-baseball-player before she leave town . Riley and Sam have friends for the past 2 years and they have flirted but nothing more until ... Great steamy short read - Enjoy ! If you enjoy this genre I would also suggest ; The Wicked West , Slow Heat ( Berkley Sensation ) , Nauti Boy ( Berkley Sensation ) .	1
Great novella , quick read and smoking hot as usual by Elle Kennedy ! Good story . Do n't miss out on another great story ! !	1
I do n't normally worry about short stories but anything that has baseball hot bods and I 'm there ! This was a nice , easy romatic story with hot sexy bits . Good story . Highly recommended .	1
A fast pace story that keeps turning the pages . Three people coming together in lust and fantasy to proof they are the stronger of them all . But at the end it almost cost them everything to find what truly matters.Love is not easy only to be enjoyed between two people who truly care for each other .	1
Love this book , it was only 0.99 cents short story but good . I love the caracters , the story flow easy , perfect read if you are looking for something short to read in a day or two . I recoment this author .	1
When I started reading this book . I could n't stand Riccardo at all . He was a selfish , arrogant , shallow snob . It did n't make any difference that he was a rich , handsome sex god because his character was hard to take . Charlie was an innocent 18 year old who was quickly falling for him . She had lied to Riccardo and said she was 24 , so he had no problem taking her virtue . Riccardo leaves his vineyard where he and Charlie were involved for a few weeks . He never told her that he was actually the owner of the place and when he leaves on the pretense of visiting his mother Charlie follows . At this point , she does n't know she 's pregnant with his child but when she arrives at his mothers palatial home both Riccardo and his mother treat her like trash , and she leaves . 8 years later she has to show a large estate to a client and guess who ? It 's Riccardo and she takes one look and passes out . That was disappointing because for someone who 's been playing the radio loudly in the car for the last eight years of her life to block out the memories of Riccardo you would think she would have been thinking what she would do if she ever ran into him again . So she wakes up and yes she tortures the hell out of him but not nearly enough for the pain , he and his mother cost her . However , even with her having somewhat of a back bone and Riccardo being a block head the story and the book were extremely good and just to see Riccardo eat crow at the end was worth the price of the book . I recommend it highly .	1
This book was an okay read . I had to refresh my memory about what the book was about since it has been awhile since i read it . I hated the way the hero treated the heroine in the beginning and how he let his mom treat her as well . Overall the book was pretty good and the ending was of course good .	1
This is a look at an all too possible future for the US and the world in general . I 've just started the sequel which promises to be just as riveting . I love post apocalyptic stories and dystopian stories and when you add in the top level government conspiracy ... . Well , what more can you ask ?	1
I bought this cover and it is good . It is easy it protects the screen and is not at all bulky what more could you want - it is also discreet . I should have bought a more colourful girly one but this seemed to do.I may upgrade to the totally waterproof one as the Kindle is an investment and want to look after it , This cover is great for my handbag - light and simple .	1
It is perfect for the smaller Kindle . I have a silicone gel cover on my Kindle and it still fits nicely in the case . The zipper is good quality and works well . The case protects my Kindle while I am not using it . I routinely carry it around with me because I read when I 'm not busy with something else .	1
This is a great case , for a great price . It has everything I need to keep my Kindle secure . I did n't want a book jacket-type case that does n't clasp closed . I wanted something to hold it securely , something that zips , ensuring there will be no chance for it to fall out , or come loose . This is just the case for the job ! Soft material , not to too big and clunky ... a great choice that I 'm very pleased with and absolutely recommend !	1
I received this as a birthday gift from my husband and sister , along with a Kindle . It 's a great looking case and fits the Kindle perfectly . I like that it is n't too big and that it fits inside my not-too-big purse due to the fact that there 's no extra space , yet it protects the Kindle very well , just like a glove . At first I thought that the Kindle with theAmazon Kindle 2 Silicone Skin Case Gel Cover - Clearwas going to be a problem because the silicone skin makes the Kindle `` un-slippery '' so that it has a nice grip . That also means it does n't slide against the material in the inside of the case very easily . But then I realized that the case unzips on two sides so you can place the Kindle with the silicone skin case on into it easily inside.The quality and workmanship of this case is evident . It 's well made with kind of a foam lining . I would n't want to drop the Kindle , I 'm not sure it would protect against that , but for normal carrying it around and keeping it from getting scratched it does a great job . I 'm perfectly happy with it .	1
BELKIN NEOPRENE KINDLE 2 CASEI just purchased a Kindle 2 after my Kindle 1 died , perhaps partially because of the fact it slipped out of its Amazon case ( poorly designed in my opinion ) and fell a few times , hitting the floor or my desk fairly hard . The Amazon case also did not protect it completely when I was traveling and it was not in use . Since my wife already had a Kindle 2 , I was aware that Amazon had provided metal hooks to secure that model in its case , and that the thinner design made it easier to read in the case as well . However , I wanted something to protect my Kindle to the maximum extent possible possible when I was traveling , especially on the train to and from work or when on a plane , rather than just slipping it into a pocket of my briefcase or computer bag and having it fall out by accident when they were open.After reading the reviews , I decided to buy this Belkin case despite my concern that the Kindle had to be removed from the case to read it and it did not fit in the case with the Amazon cover on it . However , I am DELIGHTED with this product . It is exactly what I expected after reading the description and reviews . The Kindle easily fits in it , and because it only zippers across the top and one side the Kindle will not slip out when you open it . Both front and back are well padded , so you do n't have to worry how you insert your Kindle , the screen will be protected . and the Kindle 2 is so thin and the case so soft and flexible that it easily slips into a corner of my briefcase , there is no noticeable bulk at all . The only complaint I will echo is that the zippers could have been more heavy duty , although I have had no problems with them.I also bought the Amazon case , expecting to use it when I was reading the Kindle at home or uninterruptedly for a long period of time while traveling , but have found that the design of the Kindle 2 makes it very comfortable to simply read it without a case , especially since the back cover can not slip off as it frequently did with my Kindle 1.Finally , the neoprene smell of which some reviewers complained has been non-existent . either Belkin has modified the product in some manner or I have been very fortunate , but from the time I unwrapped it there has been no odor at at . And I am very sensitive to all strong smells , being severely allergic and sensitive to many odors and often sneezing uncontrollably when initially exposed to them.So , if you carry your Kindle when you travel and want to conveniently protect it when it is not in use whether on the road or at home , I highly recommend this case.If problems develop with this product or it is less durable than it appears , I will edit this review to indicate any problems which arise which would cause me to lower my five star rating.Tucker Andersen	1
For bargain Kindle shoppers this 2nd generation Belkin case may be your only bet as none of the cases or sleeves are cheap for the latest generation . I , for one , did n't feel like spending half of what the Kindle itself cost on a mere foam square , so I went ahead and tried my luck with this . Here 's what I found.The first thing to note is that my only real need for a case was to keep my Kindle from getting damaged . Form-fitting and trendy looks were n't really important to me as long as my Kindle was kept safe . With that state of mind , this case does a fine job . There is a clear inch or more on all sides , so it WILL move around which is a little annoying . I 'll be honest , it moves around a little more than I had hoped . Nothing will be damaged because it 's all soft n ' squishy in there , but still , when I 'm carrying it around I do n't like it sloshing back and forth . The most annoying thing though is that the Kindle 3 is much skinnier than the 2nd gen. so there 's also a goodly amount of open space in the girth of the case . What this means is that it will move around side to side , back and forth , up and down , against every wall of the case . Again , no damage will occur , and it will do an absolutely fine job at keeping the Kindle 3 safe , but it is a bit irksome . Not enough that I want to spend the 25+ on the correct case , but if I had more money to spare I probably would.~THE GOOD THING ABOUT EXTRA ROOM~As other reviewers have noted , that extra wiggle room can actually be a blessing . Form-fitting cases do n't usually allow any extra space for storing earbuds or usb memory or whatever other tiny gadget you may want to keep with your Kindle . With this 2nd generation case , there 's more than enough room to toss in an earbud or two without any problem , and doing so may actually keep your Kindle more stationary in there.~Also~I bought mine used , obviously , but fortunately my seller was offering the product brand new , which meant it came with a thin removable Kindle-sized foam shipping pad inside the case . This padding was meant to be removed after purchase , but if you are using a Kindle 3 I actually think it might be a good idea to hang on to it . The extra padding drastically reduces the amount of open space and actually makes the Kindle 3 fit almost perfectly girth-wise . Side-to-side there will still be loose room , but with the Kindle fitting more snugly it will barely move around at all.All in all , I 'm very happy . I have an AMAZING e-reader that will now avoid damage as I carry it to and fro .	1
I enjoyed this book so very much . It was almost painful when circumstances seemed impossible . Some of the characters were hard to like at times , except Julie , who was my favorite . But the writer weaved some magic and it all turned out for the best . And nobody had to die which is kind of what I was expecting .	1
Was n't sure about the whole adultery thing but can not deny how absolutely AWESOME this book was . And it was FREE ! ! !	1
Torn by Christina Brunkhorst is a wonderful romance with an interracial vibe . Ms. Brunkhorst provides the reader with a love story so real , you feel as though you are a part of the drama . The key setting is in Montana , Big Sky country in all of its majesty . I related to the small town feel after spending two summers in Missoula , Montana . Her main character , Chelesa also spent a week in Montana and hence the beginning her a romance with her husband . They make a loving and beautiful family . I loved all of the characters . Ms. Brunkhorst invents them as if she were a supreme being molding and shaping them . Her rich vocabulary and smooth writing style draws in a reader who enjoys utilizing their critical and logical thinking skills . Torn touches all five senses . The love scene may leave you breathless and it did me . Jake , Chelsea 's kind-hearted husband is almost a perfect human being . Tyler Benson is awesome in mind , body and soul . Ms. Brunkhorst 's secondary characters are as important as the main characters because of their reactions to the events as the story unfolds . These incidents captivate and shake up situations , making the rising action so meaningful . I love the manner in which Ms. Burkhorst inserts drama on top of drama but with flair and lacking confusion and many surprises that touch everyone in Torn in a powerful way . Torn 's great ending placed a smile on my face and an indelible mark on my heart . Ms. Burkhorst is a writer to watch and I am a new fan . In my honest opinion , Torn is a terrific book and worth the seven years it took Ms. Burkhorst to concoct such an entertaining , engrossing tale.Ms . Brunkhorst , thanks for making this week-end a peaceful , relaxing one with this book .	1
What can I say , it is what it is and I thoroughly enjoyed it . I consider Torn tabloid fanfiction , a what if about a well known and successful married movie star falling in love with his married co-star . Sound like anybody you know ? He is in the tabloid marriage of the century but he is also unhappy and desperately want kids that his showbiz wife want give him . Now do you know him ? His co-star got the part on a fluke , she is happily married to her husband of 10yrs , but as the story unfolds there are hidden issues that will be brought to the light that can no longer be ignored as their marriage unravels . One is the desire to have more children , she wants more he does n't . How do we get to a HEA , is it possible ? If you hate cheating or marriage infidelity you will not like this book . Ty and Chelsea are married to other people when they get together . Chelsea had a good marriage to a good man , they have 2 little girls that they both love , how can she risk it all for what many would call a pipe dream . And Ty although he is at the end of his marriage how could he let his guard down to get involved with a married woman . At times their romance was sweet but it was also extremely selfish . Chelsea 's husband Jake had his faults , how he dealt with being the cuckold husband was hilarious at times and also bittersweet . When Chelsea was trying to explain to Jake why Ty is her soul mate he was thinking ... . '' He was going to run screaming like a woman from the ambulance , and probably choke a biotch on his way out . '' The author has a talent for making the reader feel two opposing emotions at the same time . Your heart is breaking because a marriage is ending but on the flip side it had its funny moments . The supporting cast of characters helped move this story along and gave it depth . The old adage..less is more..applies to the sex scenes . The sex is hot but it does not take center stage , the emphasis is on the relationships that are formed.Relationships can be messy , this book dealt with a messy subject , you will either love or hate Chelsea and Ty , they are far from perfect . There were moments I hated both of them and pitied Jake , but in the end I really liked them all . Christina Brunkhorst wrote one heck of a page turner , you will be flipping pages like crazy to see how this story will end .	1
The Kindle version of `` The New Yorker '' looks great and is easy to navigate . No , you do n't get all of the cartoons from the print version , but you get a nice handful of them- accessed via clicking on the cartoonists ' names at the end of the Articles List . I was going to complain that the print version 's cover ( one of the most notable aspects of the magazine ) is n't included in the Kindle version , but it is . After a bit of investigation , I discovered that if you simply hit the previous page button after you 're sent to the first page of the Articles List- voila ! - you 're shown the cover . Do n't know why they 're being so cagey about it , but at least it 's there . Monthly subscription price is very good , too . For the price I 'm paying for each monthly issue of `` Ellery Queen Mystery Magazine '' on the Kindle , I 'm getting four ( and sometimes even five ) full issues of `` The New Yorker '' . This was an easy buying decision.2/17/09 postscript : I see from my new issue of `` The New Yorker '' that they somewhat corrected the cover problem . You 're still not sent to the cover when you first open your new issue , but at least they 're more clear that it 's there . On the first page of the Articles List- the place you 're still sent upon first opening your issue- there 's now an entry for `` Cover '' , which also helpfully includes the name of the artist who drew that week 's cover , along with the title of the cover art . Just click on the cover info and you 're sent to the cover . Or , as said before , you can still just hit the previous page button from the first page of the Articles List to get there , too.3/3/09 postscript ( the final one , I promise ) : Another new issue , another change . This time , when I opened my newest issue ( my first on my new Kindle 2 ) , the first thing I saw was indeed the cover , so there you have it . No selecting or clicking to see what by all rights SHOULD be the first thing one sees upon opening `` The New Yorker '' . Though ( grumble ) the cover is reproduced a little small , underneath the needless redundancy of the magazine 's title floating above the magazine cover ( redundant because the title is right there within the cover reproduction ) . Whatever . It 's petty to quibble.Anyway , chalk up this silly review , with its endless updates , to the fact that Amazon and its participating magazines continually tweak Kindle content to improve their readers ' experiences . And they mostly succeed.By the way , `` The New Yorker '' looked and worked great on the first Kindle and- with more elegance and more functionality- everything is even better on the K2 .	1
This is it , the magazine of stories that you have enjoyed for years now finally available for your KIndle.Get it now if you enjoy this magazine .	1
I was looking forward to reading a sweet Christmas story and that it was . However , it touched me more deeply than I might have imagined . It brought back memories from my own childhood a few decades ago . I was reminded that there will always be hope in this world for people of faith . If mankind could only truly learn to do unto others as we would have done done unto us , and if we were to open our hearts to the hope of tomorrow and the prospects of blessed eternity . In this increasingly secular world mankind is loosing the ability to just enjoy our world . I 'm not ashamed to wish Mr. Eldridge , his . family , and everyone who has not abandoned hope for this world , a Joyous , Blessed and very Merry Christmas !	1
Ten years before Lucas was a young high school teacher just out of college ; he was the classical teacher who liked to be more a friends than a authoritative figure for his students , but he did that without second thoughts . Problem was that one of his student was an unstable teen who probably would need a psychiatric help and instead his family did n't take with the right seriousness the problem . Riley , the student , approached Lucas and when the man refused him , all went to hell : Lucas was raped and left for dead in a burning cabin . He managed to survive and to denounce Riley , but he also lost his life and his lover , who could n't suffer his scarred body.Now Lucas has a new life in a little small town where everyone loves him , above all the local sheriff ; Nicholas is an handsome man , with plenty of choice if he wants , but he sets his eyes on Lucas . When they met five years before , Lucas was still too traumatized by his past events and he was not ready for something serious , and so Nicholas accepted the second choice to be his best friend . But now Riley is out of prison and both Lucas than Nicholas know that the man will come for Lucas , and Nicholas is not willing to let the man take the most important thing he has , Lucas ; since Nicholas has no doubt that Lucas is his own.The story is not very long and there is not mystery , since it 's clear since the beginning that Riley will try to harm Lucas once again . It 's more interesting to read and see how Nicholas will convince Lucas to accept not only his help but also his love . Truth be told , I think that Nicholas takes advantage of the situation to force Lucas to accept something than in other condition it will be years before they arrive to the same point . Probably Nicholas is tired to wait ( but not enough to renounce ) and above all he is tired to be judge by someone else actions . And this is maybe the point that I understood less : it 's true that Lucas is scarred , but only on his back ; in his everyday life , with dress on , he is a very beautiful man , and no one can notice his scars . All right , being a gay man , maybe having is back all scarred is a bit more important than a straight man ( naughty Elisa , I know ) , but is it enough of a reason to dump someone ? Lucas is clever , handsome , with a good work , is it possible that someone dumped him for some scars ? And even if it happened , is it possible that he chose 10 years of chastity upon the action of only one man ? Anyway , the story is quite tender and the sex is good , something I noticed in the previous books by the same author : she mixes well the two elements , never letting the sex take the main role in the story , always letting the tenderness and love being in first line .	1
This is a great story about a woman who is abducted by aliens and basically treated like a wild animal and eventually a sex toy for her Master . This definitly has age play aspects and harsh punishments . But boy is it a fun to read how the two main characters interact and eventually have feelings for each other other than Master/Pet .	1
Darla Phelps has another winner in this ! The dynamic between online dating and finding a trusting Daddy , plus the emotions that they go through are very well written and believable . It shows a great development to an age-play relationship .	1
I have just recently become acquainted with Joe Hill , and I am so pleased to have found him . I am a huge fan of Stephen King , and have read everything released of his . Joe Hill is both prolific and enchanting..love his stories and books . I have a big collection of his that I have n't gotten to yet , but anticipate the enjoyment to come . This story is an excellent read . Loved every minute of it .	1
This story , from & # 34 ; 20th Century ghosts & # 34 ; , is a page-turner with a very satisfying conclusion . I congratulate Joe for having separated his collection into smaller , bite-size pieces which can be consumed in a short period of time . I look forward to reading more of the stand-alone stories from this collection.I would highly recommend this 33 page read to horror readers who might enjoy a well written story told in one of the unique voices in the genre !	1
Nice little read if you 've got an hour to spare . Joe Hill carries on the horror writing tradition of his father in a stupendous way .	1
This is one of my favorite selections from the anthology 20th Century Ghosts.This story stayed with me long after I read it , my mind returning over and over again to the more startling passages within.Strongly recommended for its originality.Haunting .	1
A great short that sticks with you . It was remarkably powerful for a work of such a short length . Congrats to Joe Hill for weaving such a strange but memorable tale !	1
The second book on the Wizards trilogy continues well , as the Daughter of the boy in the first book finds her way to Kimyra to deal with troubles left over from her father 's visit years before . Using her knowledge of Earth technology , she rapidly becomes a capable user of that left by the ancients , and thus the Red Wizard by local standards . Along the way she learns important lessons involving lying and responsibility . A good series for a teen to read , and not too bad for an adult .	1
This was a really exciting story with wonderful characters to fall in love with ! I can not wait for more !	1
This review is for the Kindle edition ebook.Disclosure : I was asked to do a review of this book by the author.A good story about wizards and dragons for all ages.A 14-year-old girl is trying hard to believe what her father has told her about Kimyra . When a creature she has never seen shows up , she lies so that she can have her own adventure . This is the second book of the trilogy.The heroine is a strong-willed girl , who has decided to have her own adventure . This story is exciting , fast-paced , and might have you holding your breath while some of the action takes place . It has all the elements of the first story , but the heroine has much more self-confidence . The description of the shadow world of Kimyra was excellent . I was not ready for the story to end when it did.Rick Just writes because stories are in his head , and need to come out . Good books aimed at teens and young adults can be hard to come by . This story shows the young reader that persistence can overcome the challenges in our lives , even when those challenges seem to be overpowering.I would recommend this story to teens and young adults . It is a very well written , fun to read book . If you have not readWizard Chase ( The Wizards Trilogy Book 1 ) by this author , I would recommend reading it first , it will help you to understand the context better . This is the second book of the series . I have grabbed the next book of this series , I need to find out what happened to Kat .	1
The ending was a little more drawn out than needed , but over all it was an exciting series . The end .	1
A good read . Not only is it done in an entertaining format but it also presents the basics of logic in an understandable fashion . The fact the story is woven with the sociological and psychological threads helps the reader to see how not thinking in a logical manner can effect daily life . I think even a teenager will be enlightened by this tale.Well done .	1
I loved the connection of all the brothers and cousins and how in every story one would pop up . Books/stories 134 where excellent , while 25 where just good . Still a great quick read . Full of love laughter and pain and joy .	1
This collection overall was well written with fewer typos than some of her other stories . It presented hot and heavy love scenes and leaves the reader satisfied , with the exception of the story `` Beyond Temptation '' Brenda 's did a great job of presenting the plot and moving the story along however her poor development for Lena 's passionate side did little to eliminate Lena 's insecurities about her weight . A quick romp on the kitchen table , lack of foreplay and the failure to utilize a condom or give Lena the option of asking or expecting one left me feeling as though Brenda , not only over looked Lena 's true feminine side but lead me to believe that she has the same feelings as Morgan 's ex and her desperate cousin Jasmine . She seemed to overlook at times or dispel Lena 's feelings about her weight and perhaps even bought into the feeling that there is no way a plus size women should have the right to a man of Morgan 's calibur . You would think that after Morgan 's pursuit , trickery and lust for Lena that their joining would be earth shattering like that of the passion Brenda vividly bestows upon his brothers throughout each story . However not only did Brenda fail to fully ignite the depths of Lena 's passion for Morgan , she failed to bring out Morgan 's passion and love for Lena . If a man gets on national television and announces to the world how much he loves a woman , runs the risk of losing his life long dream of become a progressive politician , you would think that he would display that same passion , zeal and respect for the women he put it all on the line for . Brenda denied Morgan if you will ( his day , hours in bed with the love of his life ) unlike his brothers who were determined to get their leading lady , but were even more determine to make sure she was fully his inside and out of the bedroom.Brenda , may have presented Lena as a Queen Latifah look alike , but her love scenes for the character fell short of giving her the confidence and passion of Queen Latifah . And denied Lena of the earth shattering sexual experience felt by other female characters in this series.All of the men throughout this series `` Forged of Steele '' are refined , well manner , passionate outside of the bedroom , but when they get behind closed doors they become hungry almost animal like for the women they want and love . Morgan 's character however only fits this description outside of the bedroom leaving the reading feeling disappointed and cheated in the end ... ..	1
Must Read bundle . Hot and Heavy Sex scenes . , Lots of Love and Romance . Good read about strong family bonds .	1
This is my 3rd book I read by Brenda Jackson . It really was a good book to read . It took me a week & a few days to finish it . The only thing that made me not like it too much was I dont really like books with different stories in it . I liked all the stories but I enjoyed some more than the others .	1
This is an absolutely awesome buy if you 're interested in starting the Steele series . Loved all the stories in this book including the first short story of Dane and Sienna . Loved all the Steele brothers and cousin Vanessa ' stories . Chance and Kylie had a sweet and very funny coming together . Lots of mischief . Sebastian ( Bas ) and Jocelyn had a feisty and rocky road to travel . Also in that story was the very touching and loving story between Jocelyn 's sister Leah and Reese the man she loved but left behind without a word . Then you have Morgan who finally found Lena Spears , his perfect woman , even if she does n't agree with him . Ca n't not love a beautiful man that loves your family too . Last but not least Vanessa and sworn enemy , the delicious Cameron Cody , who like Morgan has wanted his woman from a far for too long and is tired of waiting . Taking matters into his own hands , he lays out a proposition she ca n't , and deep down does n't want to refuse . All the stories in the bundle are well worth the read and I found them all thoroughly hot and enjoyable . Great value on a great read .	1
Brenda Jackson is an amazing author and I sincerely love her writing . The Steele brothers are amazing and I ca n't wait for Donavan to take the fall . And Cameron Cody is EXACTLY who the soon to be Vanessa Steele-Cody needed to heal then steal her heart . Simply fabulous !	1
This is actually a compilation of CI 's How-To series . This was originally a couple of dozen small cookbooks including things like 'How to Make Cookie Jar Favorites ' and 'How to Make Stew . ' Basically each chapter in this book was an individual cookbook before . I 've known , used , and loved CI for years . All of their recipes seem to be flawless to me . They do tons of test cooking and recipe development before allowing anything make it into print . I go to this one and the actual print copies which I also own , all the time for recipes . I 've made the Molasses Spice cookies so many times I ca n't even remember how many of them I 've pulled out of ovens . In fact , around the holidays I generally make double and triple batches around christmas	1
This book has it all : time tunnel to the future , a super terrific submarine , working lasers , computer links in your minds , Mars station finding an alien artifact , , Love , and lives being prolonged . Of course there 's always the other side of the coin . Future human who wants to be `` The Ruler Of It All '' , angry scientist , murder , plots to kill , nuclear winter , changed Pacific coastline and Love lost . Great plot , good timeline between Earth before and after the time `` event '' .	1
Enjoyable writing and a good story , but too short for the plot . A longer story would have been smoother and more believable .	1
Madeline ` Maddie ' Jones may not be ` head over heels ' for her boyfriend Gabe but she 's certainly more than satisfied with their sexual relationship . Leaving him never once entered her thoughts . However when she meets Gabe 's best friend , Connor , she 's torn between the attraction she feels toward him and the already structured relationship she shares with Gabe.Connor Regan and Gabriel Carter have shared their women several times over the years . Neither of them sees any foreseeable problem with sharing Maddie - especially since her playful demeanor and body 's reactions show that she is attracted to both men.What none of them could have guessed is that the attraction between Connor and Maddie is more than just physical . She shares an emotional bond with him that she 's never felt with Gabe but that does n't change the facts that she is Gabe 's girlfriend . She does n't realize the closeness Gabe and Connor share or their commitment to the strict rules they abide by when they share a woman.Maddie gets her one night of m & eacute ; nage-a-trois sex but when it comes down to it she wants more . Connor is n't about to hurt his friend by stealing ` his girl ' and he certainly ca n't admit to his love for Maddie . When all is said and done , Maddie , Connor and Gabe will be forced to choose whether to gamble everything on their feelings . Do they walk away from what could inevitably be the love of their lives ? And if they choose to gamble what happens with their friendship ? Jess Dee delves into the complications that could occur if close personal friends engage in a m & eacute ; nage-a-trois relationship . Maddie , Connor and Gabe enter into their m & eacute ; nage with a lighthearted , fun mentality but at some point a unique connection is made and friendships and hearts could easily be shattered . I love how Ms. Dee does n't sugarcoat the situation and seems to effortlessly let it play out between the characters . Tears , anger , hurt , love and understanding all combine to create a storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out what will happen next.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1
The story follows two main characters and some good side ones . Keith is struggling to come to terms with a past he does n't like . Abigail has been forced into a world she did n't know existed while her friend Dylan trying to accept that there are better packs out there than the one he was in . You meet two Alphas that are awesome people and one that sucks . There are plenty of struggles , lust , love , and comradeship to learn to love these well written characters . The action is well described and nail biting in a few spots . The ending leaves satisfied enough but with some questions unanswered to keep you wanting more . There are plenty of paths that this story can take and it will be a great series to continue.The story was definitely well written with great characters that are believable and easy to understand . The only negative I can really say is that there were plenty of instances where the writer kept saying she ( Abigail ) just does n't understand this or that , and then offers no explanation . So , I kept reading `` She just does n't know or understand ... '' , and I kept thinking no crap - could you explain it ? ! ? Never really got that many answers though - which I suppose is why it 's a series and they need to do that so you 'll get the other books . It was a good read and I would recommend it .	1
Heath and Colt Hardin had been best friends since elementary school . Kylie Halston came to live with them freshman year of college and they had been best friends ever since . Kylie , Heath and Colt were playing a game of ` Tequila Truth . ' They had played this game since college , but on Heath 's 25th birthday things took an interesting turn - one question - ` What is your ultimate sex fantasy ? ' - And Kylie 's answer - { after hearing the guys fantasies in detail } ` In my ultimate sex fantasy , two guys are taking me the same way you both described ... at the same time. ` - makes for an interesting weekend.Six months later - Ever since Heath 's birthday they had become obsessed with fulfilling Kylie 's ultimate sexual fantasy but , she was currently seeing someone . She would n't even tell them the guy 's name . Colt , a police detective , was always running background checks and with Heath 's help ran the guy off . The guys noticed that after Heath 's birthday Kylie had been doing stupid and dangerous things , trying to explore her sexuality - so they decided that they would give her what she wants , fulfill all of her fantasies.This story was written in a very free-flowing style . This book exceeded my expectations . The story line was good and the sex scenes were phenomenal - both passionate and emotional . The scenes were not over erotic - there was a good balance of emotion and detail . The author did a great job of building a solid foundation of friendship . Then extending it into a sexual relationship built on that foundation . I have added this author to my watch list . The relationships in this book are m/f/m and m/f - no m/m.~~ An excerpt fromErotic Researchis found at the end of this Kindle book ~~	1
I enjoyed the book , it was hot sweet and interesting all at the same time . Easy reading . Glad I read it	1
Becoming Miss Becky was just as great at the first book in this series , Taming Eliza Jane . Miss Becky arrives in a small western Texas town , but she does n't quite understand what her dead Aunt willed to her ! When she finds out it 's an ill-repute business that the town folk call the `` Chicken Coop '' she is more than surprised ! While trying to run this `` business '' she is also trying to find herself . Not only does she figure out who she is as a woman , but she also discovers the Sheriff . He 's scary and willing to shoot anyone that looks at him the wrong way or calls his horse ugly , but he ca n't seem to get enough of Rebecca Hamilton.Another great book by Shannon Stacey that will make it hard to put the book down !	1
This is a great combination of humor and romance . I actually caught myself laughing out loud , and my husband kept looking at me like I was crazy ! Loved it !	1
A loving , funny , sad , `` hood '' romance . I wish there was more of it . I hope there is a part 2 to pick up where this book left off . Good read .	1
Ok this book was good but the ending ? It 's like I was missing pages or something . It 's a good read but I hate you are forced to buy part 2-10 just to get the story . Oh we 'll let me go 1 click for part 2 .	1
I ca n't give it 5 stars because I felt there was no need to make a series . There seems to no longer be stand alone books . The author could have cut out half of the other chapters so that there could have been an ending . There were typos but not to the point where it made it unbearable.I now want to know how this series end , but can we start stopping at ONE book from now on ? !	1
cute short story ... and if you love Nalini Singh 's Guild Hunter series then you will enjoy reading this novella too . Always nice to have some back story to other characters in the books we enjoy .	1
Angels ' Pawn is the fantastic introduction to Singh 's Guild Hunters series . Quite different in tone than Angels ' Blood or Angels ' Kiss , the novels that follow it , I actually enjoyed it more.The main characters in Angels ' Pawn are the Guild Hunter Ashwini , and the vampire Janvier . ( The main characters in the novels of the series are the hunter Elena , and archangel Raphael . ) As some reviewers have mentioned , I felt a bit as if I was missing some world building backstory while reading the novella . However I had no problem figuring out what was going on , and it was one of my few complaints about the story.Singh 's character development shines here , something particularly impressive given the short length of the book . Ashwini and Janvier are both interesting , well developed characters ; they are each far from perfect , but their own resilience and self-acceptance gives them strength and makes them quite likeable . A cast of interesting side characters are also found throughout the story.Although the storyline touches on many of the same dark and violent themes that Angels ' Blood and Kiss do , the overall tone is significantly lighter . This is due in large part , I think , to the main characters themselves . Their banter and sense of fun , as well as the kindness seen between them , gives a sense of perspective that the more solemn characters of Angels ' Blood lack . Singh makes no attempt to wrap up Ashwini and Janvier 's relationship in this story , although the particular `` mission '' is concluded . I think this was an intelligent choice , and far more satisfying than if she had tried to rush them into a happily ever after . Now I ca n't wait to see what adventure will bring them together next .	1
Strange Paranormal story ... .a companion novella ( short story ) to Angel 's Blood . Ashwini ( heroine ) & Janvier ( hero ) . He 's a vampire -- -she 's a Guild Hunter .	1
Loving everything about these Angels . These reality laced with the surreal.Only thing is I ca n't get enough of it and her sequels are taking so long to come out.The plots are fabulously interwoven . Better still , she 's a kiwi ! ! !	1
you do n't have to be an ex-con or a christian to relate to this book.He really opens up with his life experience and gives you an insight as to whysomeone would end up actually preferring prison life . You also begin to understandwhy people also become devoted christians . Very heartfelt and touching	1
I read this accounting in about 20 minutes . It 's a brief , concise accounting of the surgeon who attended President Lincoln during his final hours before succumbing to the mortal gunshot wound to the head . I enjoyed how the surgeon set the stage a few moments before President Lincoln was shot , the 9.5 hours that he lived after being shot , and the events that happened up to the point of the funeral . I felt the the surrealness , panic , excitement , and sadness that Dr. Leale felt . This of course is a story from the surgeon 's point of view .	1
Short precise reading of a first hand account by a Doctor of the time . It is a short read , but interesting .	1
Dr. Leale 's report is an historical jewell - Written with careful & # 34 ; Matter of Factness & # 34 ; + an abundance of sensitivity . There was no cost on my Kindle either . Thank you .	1
While I enjoyed reading this one , I found myself skipping parts that seemed `` wordy '' and drawn out . There 's an excellent story to it but one has to dig for it .	1
A quick read , but well laid out and easy to understand . Read it on my Kindle in an hour or so . There are deeper tomes , but this is a good introduction without getting too boring or esoteric .	1
As someone big on self improvement , I thought this book would be incredibly useful , particularly with its subtitle of `` quicker notes , better memory , and improved learning . '' Who does n't want that ? The idea of mind mapping is that it helps you organise ideas . So instead of taking notes line by line , the idea is to place the central theme or keyword in the middle of the page and add more keywords surrounding it , with lines drawn between them to represent their relationships.According to this book ( and now I know , it definitely makes sense ! ) , mind mapping makes you more effective because this method is more compatible with the brain . This is because it matches how the brain functions biologically . Mind mapping also engages both halves of your brain at once , making you much more efficient and effective.A key poi nt , and one very important to me personally is that mind mapping is supposed to enhance creativity . As a writer , there are few skills which are more important ! I imagine many writers would find mind mapping a very useful way of planning out their work , linking together various ideas , characters and plot points.As the book says , it 'll be difficult to break my habit of making linear notes and the mind mapping will take practice . I 've only really covered how I personally will find mind mapping useful , but the book covers a wide variety of ways in which it helps people , for example ; note taking , brainstorming , collaborative writing , problem resolution and more.So if you 're looking for a way to make your planning and note-taking go more smoothly and effectively , then this book is ideal .	1
Joseph Boyden seems incapable of telling a narrative story from start to finish ; rather he jumps around from the present to various points in the past moving his point of view from person to person . Makes for challenging reading . If you 're up for the challenge he tells a cracking good story . After working on this book for half a decade it finally clicked last night . Set in Moosonee and various points south it is filled with the usual references to alcohol abuse , residential schools , and living off the land . If you had n't guessed his subjects are Anishinabe and no attempt is made to varnish the hardships , pride , and challenges of their lives . The profanity somehow does n't seem jarring in this context but be ware that it is there .	1
an excellent read with hockey , romance and mystery , what more could a girl want . I loved Brody 's cocky confident attitude . definitely a book worth reading .	1
Body Check by Elle Kennedy is a sports themed romance . It is currently hockey season so I was looking for a good hockey themed romance and this one was exactly what I was looking for . In Body Check , good girl scholar Hayden Houston is in Chicago visiting her father . For various reasons she decides to have a one night stand and picks up hockey star Brody Croft at a bar . He is personally not looking for one night stands anymore but he has instant chemistry with Hayden and takes her up on her offer . What then follows is a great romance with a bit of hockey , a bit of drama , and some really great characters . Definitely recommend	1
From beginning to end this was a fantastic book ! It had a bit of history , family values , empathy , and lots of love in it ! I do n't think that there was n't a minute while reading this book that I did n't feel happy , frustration , a bit of anger and in the end just good old fashioned the boy got the girl ! It was quite a read !	1
This was my first Grace Livingston Hill book and it is the one that sparked my interest in GLH books to begin with ! Well written , the mean characters are truly mean and the good truly good , some of the scenarios had me laughing and cheering throughout . This is a must-read ( I did n't read the other books in the Schuyler series until afterward , so if you wanted you can start with Marcia Schuyler and then read Phoebe Dean , but each book in the Schuyler series could be read as a standalone )	1
I had forgotten how much I enjoyed reading books by Grace Livingston Hill . I read this one first and it stood alone very well . I read the first book next , and am now reading the third in the series . The reader does have to & # 34 ; self edit & # 34 ; a bit due to the fact that the book was scanned with many resulting errors in transcription.Hiram was a villain who was easy to hate , as were Phoebe 's jealous sister-in-law and niece . Phoebe was easy to love . She was incredibly strong when faced with much travail.I am giving the book 5 stars in spite of the transcription errors . It is that good . Besides , I need to get back to & # 34 ; Miranda & # 34 ; , the 3rd book in this trilogy . I highly recommend all Grace Livingston Hill books .	1
I really liked this book . The characters were well-developed and the story believable . It kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next . There 's a lot of sadness in Phoebe 's life , and it does n't look to get much better until a stranger offers his friendship . The characters are much like I would imagine they would be in the time period in which the story is set . I had to remind myself a few times that this story was written when women had few rights and were at the mercy of the men in their lives , as well as their surroundings . It was extremely rare for a woman to be able to live a self-supporting , independent life in those days , and I would imagine many had few or no close friends . This book made me want to reach into the story and clobber the bad guy , rescue the girl , and chastise the ignorant family members . I recommend it to those who like a clean romance that 's not too mushy and a story with substance .	1
Like all of Hill 's novels , this one has well developed , sympathetic characters and a plot that holds your attention . I enjoyed this very much and think you will , too .	1
This is book was just about a perfect read ! Yes there were a few editing issues with this particular copy , but the product description clearly states that the book is a reproduction of a book published before 1923 and may have occasional imperfections , such as missing or blurred pages , poor pictures , errant marks , etc . In light of this proclamation , it amazed my that so many reviewers still took the time to complain about the typos . They were present but did not in the least distract from the story , at least for me they did not . Furthermore , I could not in any way tell that this book had been scanned.Phoebe Deane is an orphan who as a child went to live with her half brother , Albert Deane . Albert is a mild mannered , kindly man who sees only the good in everyone . He is also a bit of a dolt . His wife Emmeline is the evil stepmother type from Cinderella . She works Phoebe to death and never has a kind word for the girl . She is also crass with very little education . Truthfully , she is just plain jealous of the beautiful , refined Phoebe . Hiram Green , a neighbor of the Deanes ' wants to marry Phoebe , but she despises the very sight of him ! The hero , Nathaniel , is a lawyer and the nephew of Judge Bristol , one of town 's most prominent members . Nathaniel lives and works in New York City , but often visits with his uncle who helped to raise him . The book is set in a small town in New York State some time in the 1830 's . Nathaniel meets Phoebe when he comes upon her in the woods where she is crying after having read a letter from her deceased mother . Nathaniel is immediately taken with the beautiful , soft spoken Phoebe . I loved Nate and Phoebe , but if I had to pick a favorite character it would be Miranda , Phoebe 's friend and self appointed guardian angel . Hiram is determined to marry Phoebe and refuses to accept her rejection of his proposal . He and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to accept him as a husband and he literally begins to stalk the poor girl ! Everytime Phoebe left her house , Hiram would be there with his unwelcome presence . Hiram took note of Nathaniel 's attentions towards Phoebe and between that and her constant rejection of his suit he begins to hate her and Nathaniel and starts scheming against them . All the while he is still determined to have Phoebe as his wife . If not for the enterprising Miranda , he might very well have succeeded in his evil plot . Other characters include Marcia and her husband David Spafford , the hero and heroine from the first book of the Schuyler trilogy entitled `` Marcia Schuyler . '' I have not as yet read that book , but have just been lucky enough to obtain a free copy and so intend to read that next . I am also looking forward the 3rd and final book in the triology `` Miranda '' in which the beloved Miranda finally gets her love match . This book invoked a wide range of real emotions in me . I lauged out loud at many of Miranda 's escapades , I literally felt Phobe 's pain and suffering , and I completely despised Hiram Green . One scene in particular where he and Emmeline conspire to get Phoebe to travel alone with Hiram had me clenching my teeth and wishing I was there to kick Hiram 's sorry ass ! ! ! ! He gets his in the end though and very nicely too , thanks in part to Miranda , of course ! Love that girl ! And of course , love conquers all when Nate and Phoebe get to sail off into the sunset to begin their happily ever after . I highly , highly recommend this book . Jane Austen lovers especially will love this book . It is a nice clean truly romantic story that touched me deeply .	1
I found Blind Malice to be an enjoyable read on many levels , especially for a debut . Being from NC myself , I enjoyed the setting very much and found it true to place . The visual descriptions and writing style are very , very good . The mystery falls into the cozy mystery style and is well thought out and plotted . The descriptions of flora and fauna are truly outstanding . Made this non-gardener want to go plant something.All that said , I did feel that Rachel and other characters could have been better developed . Personally , I probably would 've enjoyed the book much more if I had gotten to know Rachel better . Hopefully , in future books of the series Rachel will be more fully developed and become more personable.I also wish the book had been longer . It reads more like a novella , which is fine , as it suited my mood at the time , but I think it should probably be labelled as novella rather than a novel . For me , a little more depth and length is required to truly merit the label novel and this lack of depth is what caused any disappointment I felt in the book.I liked Blind Malice enough , though , that I will certainly read more installments in the series and can recommend this first one to anyone who loves plants , flowers and gardening . That 's where the author truly knows her stuff and shines most brightly .	1
I enjoyed reading Blind Malice , the first book in the Rachel Myers Murder Mystery series . We are introduced to Rachel at her father 's funeral and within a few pages the plot starts to build nicely . As do the characters , particularly Rachel and her old family friend Isaac . We are treated to some delightful descriptions of the Appalachian Mountain locale that this story is set in and , by the end of the book , I felt that I had entered into the life of the character for a short period of time.The book is relatively short ( 1800 locations ) and a very easy read . If I have any quibble about the book it is that perhaps the plot falls into place too nicely . There were no red herrings or detours to provide that extra element of mystery.I noticed a couple of formatting issues . The book jumped between two different font sizes in the early chapters , and in the latter chapters there were several incidences of incorrect indentation.But overall a very enjoyable murder mystery and I look forward to reading more of the series .	1
These are quick reads . The story line is simple but an enjoyable read . I would read more of these and have already ordered more the series .	1
I do n't own a Kindle but a friend does . She brought hers to the high school where we both teach because she wanted me to read a book , BLIND MALICE , that is available only on Kindle and was written by North Carolina author Annis Jackson . My friend 's family and mine share a common interest in the Appalachian Mountains , especially the area where BLIND MALICE takes place . We vacation together for a week each summer on the Blue Ridge Parkway.Jackson paints a realistic and colorful portrait of the Appalachian Mountains while the main character , Rachel Myers , after living in Arizona for many years , reaquaints herself with the area where she was born and grew up.Isaac Starling , an old family friend , self-sufficient , independent , and stoic , embodies the spirit of the pioneers who settled that area over two hundred years ago.One has to believe that it is that same tenacious pioneer spirit that causes Rachel to sink her teeth into the mystery surrounding her father 's death and hang on until she finds the truth . Myers had me cheering for her all the way because she seems such a real person.A sub-theme in BLIND MALICE is how tourism , as it continues to increase , is affecting both the culture and the physical mountains , something we can see first hand each summer.BLIND MALICE is an enjoyable murder-mystery with an exciting plot . The ending is superbly unexpected !	1
I have loved listening to Elder Ballard 's talks in General Conference for many years , so I 'm sure I 'll love this book . I have n't started reading it yet , but hope to in the fairly near future .	1
A very good review of the doctrines of the spiritual nature of the world by an LDS writer . Very well written	1
Anyone who truly wants to understand what the apostles were talking about when they mention 'the third heaven ' , etc . Filled with wonderful , eye opening and spiritually enlightening information that brings joy to the heart and mind .	1
Another delightful real estate story with a good twist and believable characters and story line . I recommend it as a light read .	1
Nice enjoyable read . The mystery was fun to unfold and the characters likable . Will definitely read another Henry Wright Mystery when I get the chance .	1
Albert Simon 's books are very good . There is not a lot of swearing in them . Only one of the had the F word in it and it was used by one of the minor characters.I also like they way there is not a lot of heavy sex written into the books . I enjoyed all the books .	1
Love love loved this one . I used to live in Palm Springs and the book brought back so many great memories . The author even mentioned the street I used to live on . A fun read , I will be looking for more titles from this author .	1
Published in 2004 , when Real Estate was booming , this book brought back memories for me . The descriptions of the area are good and the story has humor along with the murders . Good capture of the greed that results from inflated prices and supply and demand ! ! !	1
I enjoyed reading this book . Its unusual twist at the end was a surprise . It was easy reading with not too many characters to remember .	1
I stumbled across this ebook and I 'm so glad I did . I compare Henry Wright to the Robert Crais character Elvis Cole . And , I only just realized this is the 1st of 6 books so I most certainly will be downloading the others right away . Awesome book and I 'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery .	1
The first Henry Wright I read . that inspired me to order two more which I have read with the same interest	1
This is the second book in the Henry Wright series that I have read . They move along fast and do n't have a lot of gore as so many of the mystery 's do.As I see from the two books I have read , they seem to end on a nice note . I will continue to read more of his books . Arthur Decker , Bristol , Connecticut	1
After reading Mr. Simon 's first book ( For Sale in Palm Springs '' I read `` Springtime in Sonora . '' I was definitely liking Henry Wright and the other characters more and more . I was glad to see that Mr. Wright was continuing to move on in his life . Even though there was just as much minutia in this story , the writing seemed a bit more interesting than the first book . I would recommend trying Albert Simon 's mysteries .	1
I have enjoyed all the Henry Wright mysteries . The plots are good and they are well written . I would recommend it .	1
Once again faced with an impossible murder , Henry delves into this with all his capabilities . If you have n't been on the Tram , it is worth a trip to the desert to take the ride . In solving this murder , Henry and his favorite waitress , Gloria , take a ride up and again down to realize that the murder was impossible , except for one way . Read to find out what that one way was .	1
This is the third book of his that I have read and I really enjoy them . They have great plots and characters , but are n't overly complicated . My husband and I have a second home in Rancho Mirage ( which is in the Coachella Valley ) and we go to Palm Springs a lot and it 's fun to read about a place that I know so well . I love his attention to detail and descriptive way of writing that draws you into his books . I would definitely recommend his books and I already have !	1
Each one is as good as the last one . All kept my interest from the first page to the last .	1
Henry unravels a real who-done-it and how the heck did they do it mystery . Plot is a surprising mix of murder and a little romance for Henry .	1
I enjoyed this book as much as the others . I have already purchased the next one in the series , and am looking forward to reading it . Arthur Decker , Bristol , CT	1
I JUST READ ALL FOUR OF THE HENRY WRIGHT MYSTERIES . REALLY ENJOYED . LOOKING . FOWARD TO MORE FROM THIS AUTHOR . I AM FAMILIAR . WITH THE AREA WHICH ADDED TO THE STORIES	1
Very good book . I 've read all the Henry Wright Mystery books and they are all good . If the author writes any more books , I will read them all .	1
It really helps to read the `` Henry Wright '' stories in the order in which they were published . `` Drama in the Mother Lode '' really begins a new life for the character . You will love this story and it 's ending .	1
reading the series ... all a light read . Not a heavy story but more of a relaxing read yet kept your interest	1
Henry is a & # 34 ; hero & # 34 ; of the senior citizen group ! Excitement , drama and a surprising ending . Thoroughly good time reading this one .	1
I came upon this author in the list of free books for your Kindle that Amazon sends out and was so intrigued by the character and the location that I went back to Amazon.com and bought the remaining four books . If there is a # 6 I 'll buy it , too . The setting is lovely and the characters are so nice and happy to be together than it is a very pleasant mystery without the blood and guts that you get from so many mystery stories . I 'm all in favor of the blood and guts , too , but I just liked these books.Springtime in Sonora ( Henry Wright Mystery # 2 ) Coachella Valley Traffic Jam ( Henry Wright Mystery # 5 ) For Sale in Palm Springs ( Henry Wright Mystery # 1 ) Mystery on the Tramway ( Henry Wright Mystery # 3 ) Drama in the Mother Lode ( Henry Wright Mystery # 4 )	1
Albert Simon held my attention in each of his books I have read . You feel like you know the people he creates .	1
Daniel Atgard , the hero from the previous book `` Right Ascension , '' is back on earth , his space ship is parked in his back yard . Life is good . It 's been a decade since all of humanity was threatened with extinction by the energy beings called the Lucani Ibron . But this is an adventure novel so the disasters begin to strike , one after another . The pace is n't quite as intense as the first book but the intrigue builds . More characters are brought in to tell the story as the reader goes from one conflict in exotic places in space to another . It is true that David Derrico does n't develop his characters in agonizing detail , but he does give them strength and depth enough to deal with grand challenges . This is a powerful tale of righting past wrongs and attempting to pull out of a trajectory of doom .	1
I do n't remember buying this book but it was one of the best I have read . It had suspense , romance , heroism , tenderness , and thoughtfulness .	1
Book one is a good start to what will be a good series of surviving after the war . There are quite a few characters introduced and the storyline jumps from character to character but eventually it does become cohesive .	1
I really enjoyed terrible entire story . I can only hope that I would act as intelligent and resourceful as these young people , if I were ever placed in the same circumstances	1
Was a fun book to read . I liked reading about the fog , the dangers and all the survival techniques the characters used . I actually learned something . Strange part was that the purpose of the camp was to encourage teens to abstain from sex .Many times during this book references of sexual relationships pop up which probably are n't needed to catch my attention . I was already interested in the story without the sexual parts.Overall a fun book to read	1
I really liked this book . the story was well thought out and I enjoyed the characters and character development . I only wish I could have learned more about the fog ! Ca n't wait for the next book .	1
Initially I thought this was going to be more of a creature type horror story , similar to The Mist . It 's not , while they hint of something in the fog it is never explained , all you know is whatever goes in ends up screaming and me ere coming back out . Instead it 's more about how a camp full of kids set out to survive and establish a community . The best comparison I could give is a modern day Lord of the Flies meets Hatchet . These kids manage to not only to survive but thrive and do better than most of the adults you will meet along the way.I wish they would have explained the fog more . It attempts to at the very beginning but then never explAins further . It does n't detract from the story at all it 's just my own curiosity , I want to know ! That really is my only complaint . The story pulled me in and all the characters felt real.I would recommend this for older middle school age children to adult . If you enjoyed reading Hatchet by Gary Paulsen or Lord of the Flies I believe you would enjoy Surviving The Fog .	1
This book was a good one for someone looking to read an apocalypse survival story that is somewhat believable , at least from the realism of characters . It does take a little stretch to think that kids could do so much , but at the same time is a testament to what might be possible when survival is on the line . Overall , I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will definitely be suggesting it to others .	1
Suitable for adults and young adults . This is not a Lord of the Flies rehash . Mike and his friends are left to fend for themselves when the camp administrator and all but one counselor fail to return from a trip to the nearest town . The remaining counselor has a mental breakdown as they discover a dangerous fog trapping the coed camp of teenagers high atop a remote section of the Sierra Madras . As the group struggles to survive they learn the greatest danger to their safety may be the other humans trapped atop the mountain .	1
In the mountains there is a camp for boys and one for girls . Most of them are in their early teens . Something happens that results in a deadly fog that surrounds the mountain and kills anything that enters it.This is a really good story of how those kids adapt to what has happened , fix up their own government , construct buildings , gather food , and manage to meet a few other survivors . Some of them are deadly , though , and the teenagers have to defend themselves even if it means killing some very nasty adults.The story of how they manage to survive and meet others is a really good one .	1
What would happen if teenagers were left on their own ? This is the way the & # 34 ; Lord of the Flies & # 34 ; should have been written .	1
WELL WRITTEN AND A GREAT STORY LINE . IT COULD HAVE USED A LITTLE MORE INTERACTION WITH THE CREATURES OR ENTITIES FROM THE FOG , BUT OTHER THAT IT WAS VERY ENTERTAINING TO READ	1
I see this as somewhat of a young adult novel . I 'll read anything as long as the story is good.It was predictable for some aspects , but that does not make it any less enjoyable . I did not find it slow or boring .	1
I read this book and it really gave me something to think about . The way God works in ours lives and we do n't really know how much .	1
William sent me a copy of this book , my very first ever request to review , so I 'm honoured and delighted to do so ! Now I 'm an anti-Harry Potter sort of person , so when I saw an amulet was involved I was a little wary . I also come from a completely different writing culture . I need n't have worried ! William has the gift of writing , well what I 'd call young adults stories , though anyone could read this and be blessed . He has that knack which pulls you into the perspective of Brian , and tells the tale from a child of his age 's point of view . The whole text has for me that wonderful fairytale feeling that I love in the Elizabeth Goudge stories such as the Little White Horse.Brian is maybe old for his age due to the abuse he has suffered in his life but he also acts just like a teenager . His journey to find the Living water is has great narrative tension and I 'm glad that it went on long enough after the climax to make the ending balanced and it sort of ties in to the supernatural of the story.I began thinking , ok , so this is a magical story in many ways , just how would this appeal to any teenager ? Its adventure with a twist of romance , reality and excitement . Yet as a Christian , how is this tale justified . ( see my standpoint above ) . Of course William related this to the Native Americans , and has a bible verse . Then it hit me , maybe I 'm being dense , and William had this in mind but the whole book is one huge allegory or metaphor . Come to me and drink the streams of living water ( John 4 , v 13-14 ) . As Christians , we all seek and drink the living water of Christ and our lives should then reflect and bless all around them . This is what Brian and Rachel did with their lives . It gives you the gospel message that through Christ we can be all things and bless others . This book does it in a way acceptable to the teenage mind if they can see it ! Bravo !	1
This is a great story about a young man who , despite his awful lifestyle , finds God 's help and favor . There is a lot of first person narrative in this book . If that bothers you , you might not like it as much as I did . The story is told through the eyes of a fourteen year old boy . This is the first of a series and in my opinion you should read the books in order . I had a chance to Beta read the third book and parts of it were pretty confusing without reading this one first . The author , William Woodall was gracious enough to give me books one and two . I am so glad . This is a refreshing fantasy written with a Christian view . I give it 4 stars . A good read for ages Jr. High and Up .	1
Part allegory , part coming of age , part spiritual awakening , this book is about a teenage boy living with an alcoholic mother and a fragile younger brother . Even his mother is quick to tell him the truth that the solution Brian thinks he has found to his sad and sometimes terrifying life is the wrong one . Will his little brother pay the price for his short-sightedness , his simple plan to `` make everything better '' ? When his easy fixes begin to crumble to ashes Brian is forced to examine his own motives and what is really important to him . An elderly stranger and a desperate , outcast new friend push him to search for the real power to make the world a better place.What is the source of healing , of restoration , of hope ? Is it in magic and ancient legends or is it closer to home , from a different source , far from `` the center of the world '' ? The physical quest and the spiritual one are intertwined all along the way .	1
This book makes so much sense and it 's practices are easy to follow I 've read many books on this subject and this by far is the easiest to apply thank you for the helpful strategies .	1
Christopher Pinckley has written a step by step guide to becoming who you want to be . The first part of the book involves the steps required to learn or decide what or who you want to be . This is not as easy as it seems . So many of us get into the flow of our lives and never really stop to analyze what it is that we want . This in depth look at what we want is very important if we are to manifest ourselves and become what we want . The second step involves getting rid of the barriers that we all carry as baggage that prevent up from becoming what we dream of becoming and the last step involves getting to where we want to be.The author has been where most of us start . He did not know who he was or who he wanted to become . He had these ill defined goals and he had plenty of baggage preventing him from realizing even these ill defined goals . Having been there , he can better guide us through these processes.The book is broken down into easy to read chapters and I was surprised at the practical exercises that he gives to make it easy to get from one step to another . Without these concrete exercises this book might just be another `` go our and realize your dream '' books . There is much more than that here.This book is a good read for people of all ages even if you think that you have found what you want and are already there . Looking into our desires is a compelling and interesting exercise , no matter how old or successful we think that we are .	1
Doctor Jake McCoy has been in love with Dana Cochran since they were young . They 've had an on again , off again relationship that 's frustrated Jake beyond words . He does n't dare tell her . He knows her too well . Whenever it comes to deep emotion , Dana keeps everyone at arms length . Playing , however , is her forte , and one night when a storm has taken out the power on the street they live on , Jake walks across to check on her , only to find her and her boyfriend in the back yard in an intimate situation . Dana comes off the porch to stand in the rain in front of him , and her entreaty is too much to resist . Ignoring his possessive nature and his dislike of her casual boyfriend Mason , he gives in to the woman he loves and joins them.Dana knows that Mason is just a good time , that Jake is forever , but she 's just interested in playing , enjoying her sexuality now that she has two men who will share her . She plays with them both , unconcerned , until one encounter with Jake changes her life . When you know you 're going to be a mother , you start to realize either playtime is over ... or you have to start playing for keeps . And telling Jake and Mason takes that to a whole other level.What started out as a relatively simple menage a trois erotica romance novella with Walker 's classic intense romantic angst takes a turn after that and becomes a much more serious and emotionally powerful and poignant story of love and unspeakable loss . I have nothing against the first part , really , but it lacked a bit in depth and character development for my tastes . The second part was so intense , however , and the emotions so vibrant and real as Jake and Dana try to survive a tragedy that shakes them to the soul , that it utterly eclipsed the beginning and made it seem shallow.I ca n't say I enjoyed the second part - it was very dark for the genre - but it was very well written and felt very emotionally honest . I have to give Walker credit for the courage and strength to write something so personally devastating . I also have to admit I loved the end and appreciated the hope and joy and promise that was reintroduced . I may not have been expecting the breadth of the story in Playing For Keeps , but I 'm glad I read it.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another .	1
This was a great value for the first three novels in the Lady Julia Grey series.Silent in the Grave - To be honest , it took me about 2/3 of this book to really get into it . When I did though , I could not stop reading . I liked the character of Julia and I am interested to find out more about Brisbane . I think switching from UF to this book , more of a historical mystery , was a little jarring and that is why it took me a bit to get into it . The writing is well done , and while the story is a little slower paced at the beginning , it really picks up at the end and left me wanting more . Since this was the three-book bundle , I jumped right into the second book ! Silent in the Sanctuary - I liked this book more than the first . The mystery was a bit more interesting and I felt that the pace was a little quicker , which I liked . Julia and Brisbane continue to be an intriguing pairing and I ca n't wait to find out more about them . I really enjoyed the secondary characters in this novel . I loved the time we spent with Julia 's family , especially Portia , and friends . Fleur is the best . Morag and Aquinas are also great . Hopefully Aquinas will be around a little bit more in the next book . All in all , this is a series I am glad I was introduced to and that I plan to continue reading.Silent on the Moor - I enjoyed this book a little less than the second , but probably as much as the first . The mystery was a little less important this time around and the pace a little slower , but we did get to meet some interesting new characters . I really loved Rosalie and how the story of Brisbane 's early years turned out . The Allenbys were one messed up family . Julia was adorable as always and I loved to see her holding her own with Brisbane even more . The location descriptions were suitably creepy and I liked the inclusion of the egyptology subplot . All in all a solid entry into this series and I am eager to see what effect the ending of this book has on the final two novels .	1
I look for bundled series for the Kindle and was pleasantly surprised with this one . A historical fiction featuring a heroine that is coming into her own , it manages to have romance without dragging sex into it too much ( so far in the series ) and a plausible mystery . It manages to keep the heroine within character for her timeline rather than making her a modern-day woman in a corset and bustle .	1
I 've loved mysteries , ever since starting out as a girl with Nancy Drew . I eventually moved on to Agatha Christie , Arthur Conan Doyle , and Dorothy L. Sayers . I also love to read historical romance , especially Regency and Victorian.So how could I help loving the Lady Julia Grey books ? Simple . I could n't . The three books in this very nicely priced ebook bundle were much more mystery than romance , but that 's okay . They were engaging and well constructed . The underlying romance -- which in these three books take Julia and Brisbane from first meeting to marriage -- is subtle but gripping . Brisbane is such a delicious , deeply layered character .	1
I 've read almost every book Brenda Jackson has written , including all of the Westmorelands & # 8216 ; stories and their friends . Brenda is a talented author in every way !	1
As always ! ! ! Loved them ! ! Love the Westmoreland family . All five of the books were fantastic . Looking forward to the next five .	1
Let me first say that I enjoy Brenda Jackson 's character development . Each Westmoreland male is interesting and unique . The heroines are all professional , intelligent , `` virgins '' . Surprisingly each heroine is a virgin over the age of 25 with the exception of Madison who had one prior sexual experience . In my opinion it is not realistic of your average woman over 25 years of age to be a virgin ( while ideal and sweet not realistic ) . But I still say that Brenda Jackson 's characters are wonderful . In the family of the Westmoreland 's it is believed that they will all marry a person with whom they fall in love with at first sight . Love at first sight was believable with brothers Dare and Storm . Their love interests were women they had known for years . I did not buy the `` love at first sight '' theme between Delaney Westmoreland and Prince Jamal nor Stone and Madison . Again , romantic idea but unbelievable . The other three I bought it and loved it.I most enjoyed A Little Dare , it was my favorite of the first 5 books . Thorn Westmoreland is my favorite character from the series . I enjoyed his story as well . Stone Cold Surrender and Riding the Storm are the reasons I 'm giving this review 3.5 stars . I thought the heroines were a bit extreme . Madison tracking her 50 year old mom in the mountains of Montana and Jayla yet in her 20 's choosing to be artificially inseminated because she 's lonely . I thought that was extremely selfish . However each story has a satisfying end . Stone Cold Surrender has the redeeming aspect of Corey and Abby finding each other after so many years . I really enjoyed their part of the book . Their story touched my heart . I 'm looking forward to reading the stories of the additional Westmoreland family members who were introduced .	1
Gena Showalter is one of my favorite authors . This was a great story even though it is too short.You rock Gena !	1
this author is truly gifted with the pen . this book kept me riveted , and it was hard to put down .	1
I love this author and have read just about everything she has written . The characters are enduring and loveable and they love their mates to no end .	1
this was the 1st gena showalter I had ever read and I loved it . It was a freebie on my kindle and I quickly ordered the others in the series , looking forward to reading them and many others of Ms Showalters	1
THE AMAZON 'S CURSE is part of Gena Showalter 's Atlantis series and probably should be read after THE VAMPIRE 'S BRIDE . Zane , a fierce vampire warrior , and Nola , a lovely Amazon soldier , cross paths again when Zane is captured by the Amazons . Their intention is to capture , breed with these strong male warriors and free them . Most males did n't have a problem , but Zane spent too many years as a demon queen 's whore.Nola spent her entire life hating men for they brought nothing but pain . Four months ago when she met Zane , his affections frightened her . She has been cursed with invisibility and Zane is the only one who can see her . She will have to learn to trust Zane if she is to be set free.I love these little mini-sagas . Okay , maybe this one was a little too mini , but I still enjoy them . Each gives me more background information into the series and the characters .	1
This book was is a good read . I love all books written by this author . I recommend this book . Read it .	1
Loved the book . Love the author . She has a way of pulling you into the story and making you feel so involved you hats to see it end .	1
This was amazing loved it . I did n't want it to end it was that good . A must read . As is the others in this series .	1
The Amazon 's Curse by Gena ShowalterFifth in the Atlantis series3.5 starsZane is a fierce vampire warrior enslaved by the Amazons after losing the Gods games in The Vampire 's Bride . Nola is an Amazon warrior that has been cursed with invisibility after losing the same treacherous games . Now these enemies are finally coming together to break free of the curses that have befallen them . Well I wanted to read this novella immediately after finishing the Atlantis series , but I didn & # 8217 ; t have an e-reader until now . I thought this would be amazing , heart stopping , satisfying romance novella . It was satisfying , but not heart stopping or amazing . I had really high expectations for this novella because I really liked Nola and Zane in The Vampire & # 8217 ; s Bride.The main female character is Nola . Nola is a lot more likable in the novella . If you & # 8217 ; ve read The Vampire & # 8217 ; s Bride you & # 8217 ; ll know how she pretty much ruined Zane & # 8217 ; s life anyway she could get and absolutely hated and lusted after him . I like Nola , but compared to Delilah , her fellow Amazon , she wasn & # 8217 ; t as strong as a character . She didn & # 8217 ; t have a presence . She was there , but not really there ; which is really ironic to say because of the curse . I didn & # 8217 ; t even realize it until I thought about it . I & # 8217 ; m a genius.Kick-Butt Heroine Scale : 7The main male character is Zane . I really liked Zane in The Vampire & # 8217 ; s Bride . I was rooting for his happiness . I loved his attitude , but he seemed a lot more broken The Amazon & # 8217 ; s Curse . It made it really hard for me to like him . I just didn & # 8217 ; t like him as much . It was a bit of a letdown because I liked him a lot previously.Swoon Worthy Scale : 7The Villain- The Amazons are the villains . Really I didn & # 8217 ; t care whether any of them lived or died . The Amazons know how to fight and we didn & # 8217 ; t even get to experience the battle . Rip off.Villain Scale : 5Layel and Delilah made an appearance . They were just so cute together and they have a baby on the way ! YAY ! Character Scale : 7This novella was a huge letdown for me . I feel like if this was an actual novel it would & # 8217 ; ve been so much better . The characters lacked their usual umph , the Amazons were terribly developed , and the romance wasn & # 8217 ; t as heart stopping as it was last time . It also really bothered me how Nola went from loving her sisters to hating them all because of Zane . Then again she didn & # 8217 ; t really like them all that much previously , but the change was still really fast . This was good and entertaining and I liked it , but the things I mentioned bugged me.Cover Thoughts : Look at them abs ! I love the Atlantis covers and this is no exception , but it & # 8217 ; s not the best or the worst . Mediocre at best .	1
The Amazon 's Curse built on relationships and events that developed in The Vampire 's Bride by Showalter . The book can stand alone but is so much better if you know the back story . My rating would have been different if I had n't already connected with the characters while reading the previous book.The Vampire 's Bride focuses on Layel , king of the vampires , and Delilah , an Amazon warrior . However , we are introduced to many other characters , including Zane & Nola . I was happy to find out how their story ended.I would not suggest using this book alone as an introduction to Showalter 's writing . You 'll be missing out .	1
The one rule of a short story is that it be short . lol . I remember before The Wild 's Call was released on kindle it was released chapter by chapter ; week by week and I would anxiously wait for Monday to rush to my computer and log-on just to read it before work.It complements the trilogy perfectly . It gives us the idea how the world was after the collapse but before the spirits completely set in . I also loved the fast pacing and the character 's growth did n't suffer at all due to the quick story flow.If you are going to read this trilogy I recommend you read this prequel as well .	1
Was just getting into the story when bammm it ended . Did not expect this to be a short story but enjoyed it all the way .	1

I really do n't know how to judge this story - prequel for a coming trilogy . It was interesting at times , the slip to the dark ages , the savage atmosphere etc . but it was also childish at times , without much steam in the romance angle , borderline mediocre stuff . I give three & a half stars mainly because it made me somehow to want to see what will happen in the trilogy , which by my standards is a success .	1
This story is extremely well-written , but it is best appreciated by adults who look beyond the surface and who are interested in the exploration of the metaphysical . What is reality and consciousness ? Is there existence beyond the physical world ? And can the physical and metaphysical world interact ? If you can not wrap your mind around these concepts , you will not appreciate this book . There is also a lot of symbolism throughout the book as reality overlaps with `` other '' . It can be confusing , but I found it an enjoyable read . The ending is n't terribly clear cut , but I believe the author does that deliberately to leave it open to the reader 's interpretation . The characters and world-as-we-see-it storyline are riveting and keep the reader engaged .	1
This story was pretty good . Not too much paranormal , but just enough to keep you interested , along with a really well thought out plot . The main character , 16 year old Jesse is a run away who has had more than his fair share of hard knocks . He has some pretty cool abilities that help and hinder him in this story . Like other books , you can see the foreshadowing of a possible happy ending that most authors would take . I 'm glad Lowe found a more `` real life '' type scenario . A good ending that I was not expecting .	1
This book has elements of just about everything in it . It started off as realistic fiction . Girl meets boy , who somehow ends up staying with the girl 's family . But added to that is that the boy , Jesse , has flashbacks about his past , and visions of a boy he has never met , while having conversations with something that could be a computer . And , if that is n't enough , he also has fire-starting and healing powers.It is quite well-written , even with the confusion of so many genres appearing in the same book . It was also highly entertaining , mostly because you never knew what was going to happen next . I could n't stop reading it , mainly because I kept having to decipher just what was happening.As I read on , I could understand the title of this book . In some ways , Jesse was a ghost . Someone who was there , but who was n't who he thought he was . I really liked his vulnerability . He held a lot of guilt over his past and a belief that he was better off alone . He also had to live with the gifts he had been given - even if he considered some of them a curse . He 's also trying to find out who he is . What teenager does n't ask themselves at one time who they are ? I know I did . And that 's what draws me to this book - the underlying realism to it - even when it 's anything , but that.Some of the scenes written are very intense and I wonder if L. Lee Lowe wrote purely for fun or if there was some hidden meaning behind the writing . In one scene , the one with the man hanging from the tree , it felt almost spiritual to me . As if Jesse had to put something to rest before he could move on . Like letting go of his past so he could live the life he should be living and not the one he was . And , I know it may only be me reading into it , but it reminds me of Shakespeare 's 'As you like it ' - 'All the world 's a stage , and all the men and women merely players ... ' In some ways that 's how it feels . It 's like Jesse is a puppet with someone else pulling the strings , especially with Red and the others.Sarah , another character , is what held Jesse together . She 's the one who gives him hope . She goes through a similar hell to Jesse and yet at the same time different . In some ways , she 's also his downfall or at least the guys she hung around with were . There are other characters I adore as well , like Sarah 's dad , Finn . He gave Jesse support when he needed it and was there for him when no other male figure was.This whole novel was complicated , gave me hope of a happy ending for the characters , and was bittersweet . I ca n't go to much into why it 's bittersweet because it would contain spoilers . I did n't consider the book a light read , well , it was a light read at the start and evolved from there . To be honest , some of it I did n't understand at all , mainly because , as I mentioned earlier , there was more than one or two genres in it . But even so , it did n't stop me from liking it . The book is also longer than most , so it will take more time to read.I think this book is best suited to someone who prefers a challenging book , because that 's how I found it.And now , since I do n't have anything more to add , here is my rating : - four out of five stars .	1
This AC charger works well with my Kindle Fire . I needed another one for travel and this one was a good price . Love the fact that the prongs retract .	1
I like this charger . I can plug in my Kindle at any time and charge it when I do n't want my computer turned on .	1
Otherwise , it would earn a 5.I like to read while charging my Kindle . The short length makes this difficult . Another six inches would have done it.Reviews of a number of devices have complained of short cords . Why ca n't the manufacturers address something simple like that ? Fortunately , the charger charges *fairly* quickly ( not really `` rapid '' ) and it appears to be the best one out there .	1
I bought this charger for my Kindle 2 , since the plastic around the wire of the original charger just keeps shredding . It works well , although my kindle frequently resets itself when I plug it in . This may have more to do with the age and use of my kindle , rather than the charger .	1
Excellent service and the item works well . It is easy to carry and is convenient to use . It is a kindle necessity .	1
I love the fact that you get two Kindle USB cords AND a wall adaptor and car adaptor . If you have other electronic equipment ( iPod , BlackBerry , Palm device , etc . ) these will be incredibly handy . It 's really great to leave the adaptor plugged into your car and just change the USB cord to fit your device . In a perfect world , all these devices would use a universal cord but , until that happens , these adaptors and cords make life a little bit easier .	1
This was a great book . It started off quick with a bit of a twist I did n't expect and then it kept me entertained the entire time . I loved the message of salvation in it . Jonathan faith was an amazing message that I really enjoyed	1
I love all of James Somers books , this one was good as well , but I was not as wrapped in this one as his others . Of course , its like watching friday the 13th sequil number 8 . All the bad guys keep mutatiing into something more powerful and weird and Its like when do you draw the line on this mutation stuff . And the messing with the human d and a is getting to be an old number . It is not awful , but somewhere between way out there and really . Just my opinion . Like to see Mr Somers write more about Jesus being the hero and not some clone or messed up person getting away with murder . When does Jesus get to be the hero , of course He is .	1
Somers has a new twist on good vs evil . A page turner that will keep you on the edge of your chair .	1
A gripping book complete with telekinesis and what seems like magic but is really science..good over comes evil in a way most could never believe .	1
Enjoyed the story ! Loved the characters ! The story was a little choppy , but still a great story line ! Worth the money to buy it and I would recommend !	1
I love the whole two sides of the same coin conflict happening and the whole fighting for your man ..very good read give it a go	1
This was a very interesting book to read . I do n't want to say to much about what happens but this book had me laughing several times . I definitely recommend reading this book .	1
Family secrets , dirty little problems , gambling , divorce , illegitimate babies and a dash of adultery , scandal and forbidden love . Soap opera ? Not exactly . It 's Nobel Prize Winner John Galsworthy 's sprawling family epic `` The Forsyte Saga , '' a three-volume saga that spans the nouveau riche Forsyte clan , and the devastating events that threaten their ever-respectable facade . Galsworthy 's lush writing and intricate , insightful stories are excellent on their own , but the dignified handling of 19th-century laws and mores -- and how they changed -- add an extra dimension to his writing.The Forsyte family is determinedly regal and hard-nosed , almost to the point of a fault . And as the story begins , the Forsyte family has come together to celebrate June Forsyte 's engagement to a young bohemian architect , Philip Bosinney -- except for June 's father , who eloped with the governess and is now shunned by his family . Among the guests are the stuffy , domineering Soames Forsyte and his quiet , unhappy wife Irene -- though she conditionally agreed to marry him , she does n't love him . But Soames regards Irene as his most valuable piece of property , even as she begins an ill-fated affair with Bosinney . At the same time , the patriarch Jolyon starts to kick off family disapproval , and goes to see his estranged son.Soames ' determination to `` own '' Irene leads to tragedy for all three of them , and Irene and Soames separate for the next decade . But when Soames demands a divorce so he can marry a French girl , he finds himself obsessed and stalking Irene once again . And as before , Soames ' harassment drives his estranged wife into the arms of another man -- his disgraced cousin Young Jolyon . And even as Soames gains a new woman , he finds that you do n't get everything you want ... A new complication enters the works almost two decades later -- Soames ' daughter Fleur is immediately attracted to Irene 's son Jon . The two start an innocent romance , unaware of their parents ' past together , but still overshadowed by the loathing and shame Soames and Irene have for each other . An aristocratic suitor for Fleur , mysterious letters and a secret love affair all come to the surface , as Fleur and Jon discover that love is n't always enough to overcome the bitterness of the past ... The Forsyte Saga is indeed a saga -- it stretches from the stuffy Victorian era into the first bloom of the roaring twenties . Despite the early claim that Forsytes would never die , various characters age , die and weave new lives for themselves , and grapple with a rapidly changing world -- including the new rights for women as individuals , rather than `` property . `` The first part was written in a time before the world of England 's upper crust changed forever -- sort of an English `` Age of Innocence . '' And while Galsworthy 's first trilogy can be seen as the story of an obsession , it can also be seen as the portrait of the Forsytes overall -- stuffy , gilded , and eager to forget the working class roots a few generations back.Galsworthy paints this time in a flurry of lush , dignified prose , filled with slightly mocking notes about the Forsyte family , and tiny gestures and expressions that convey more than actual dialogue could ( `` Huddled in her grey fur against the sofa cushions , she had a strange resemblance to a captive owl '' ) and lushly written descriptives ( `` ... over the lush grass fell the thick shade from those fruit trees planted by her father five-and-twenty years ago '' ) .As for the main characters of this drama , Galsworthy handles their passions and involvements delicately and with dignity . No soap opera dramatics -- just a married woman in love with her best pal 's fiance , and who is raped by her angry husband . And then a realist 's version of `` Romeo and Juliet , '' if Romeo and Juliet 's parents were exes and no suicides came into it.Soames and Irene are really at the center of this book -- she remote , quiet and something of a mystery even to the readers , and he a selfish , close-minded man who wants to `` own '' people . Their children are far more endearing -- Fleur is passionate and vivacious , and Jon is sensitive and sweet . But there 's a vast cast of interesting characters in the Forsyte family , especially melancholy Young Jolyon and his artistic daughter June.Bitterness , obsession and love fill the pages of the `` Forsye Saga , '' and provide the start of a truly classic trilogy of great novels .	1
Mine are in Northern England , Nottingham ; the Macintosh clan . Galesworthy has the unique ability to take you back in time and create an understanding of the social forces that ruled and their effects upon Britain and the world . Enjoyable reading made so with great character development and tales interwoven that create a masterpiece . Enjoy !	1
Linda Evans has taken all the right elements and assembled them in a story that will please the young adolescents of all ages . The characters have depth and are very believeable . The story grabs you early and takes many twists and turns until you reach the conclusion . It leaves you wanting more .	1
Mrs . Beast had me a bit confused at the beginning . I read the first few pages and thought I might might want to put it away , until I realized I was reading satire and a self-help book all-in-one.The book follows Beauty on her quest to turn her human , but sadly lacking husband back into the Beast who had won her heart before her marriage . Along the way , she meets other women who featured prominently in the Grimm Fairy Tales and listens to their tales of what happened Happily Ever After . Just like Anita Baker sang more than 20 years ago , fairy tales do n't come true.Like many a woman who married because it was expected of her , or it was her duty , or she thought she could `` change '' him , these ladies share their stories of what went wrong , and finally , about what has made them happy.Along the way Beauty learns and grows , and like every good fairy tale , there is a moral to the story : instead of trying to change everyone around her and her circumstances to become what she wants , Beauty does the only possible thing she can do to make herself happy : she becomes what she needs instead of relying on somebody else to do it for her . It was a glorious end , and finally does credence to the line `` fairy tales can come true '' .	1
I love it . I can play it with my 2-year old grandson ( even if he does n't understand the game ... I let him win all the time ! ! )	1
It 's great having some games on your Kindle . Reading is fantastic but your eyes do need a break once in awhile .	1
After reviewing the first book in the series , I have n't stopped reading the next , and the next , etc. , books to write more reviews . I decided this was a good time to take a little break and do that , since I am both looking forward and dreading reading the last book.Thank goodness Campbell wrote another series with many of the same characters following this one ! It 's obvious that I am loving these books ! The author has a real gift for making characters and situations `` real '' , and pulling you into their lives . The battles are described in such a way , that it 's as if you are on the bridge , looking over Johns shoulder . The Times in between engagements , where the Captains and Co-President are making moral decisions , discussing tactics , and philosophy/spiritual beliefs , are thought provoking , not heavy handed or preachy.Several problems are resolved in this book , with several more looming ahead . I ca n't wait to see what happens next ! This series , IMO , is a perfect balance of Space Opera , hard Sc/Fi , and suspense . If you are a fan of those things , you 'll love this series too ! I give it a solid 4 1/2 stars !	1
As with the previous books , Geary manages to save the day . The book is faithful to the premise and ends about as I expected . It is a good read and I went through it in short order . The only reason I gave 4 stars is that the premise is a bit overdone . The characters are good , but I would have liked to have seen a bit more development of some of the lesser players.If you have enjoyed the series thus far , you will like this one .	1
Relentless is the 5th of a series of six books by Jack Campbell that collectively tell the story of Captain John Geary and his command of the space fleet which belongs to an Alliance of worlds occupied by humans . The books in series order are : 1 ) The Lost Fleet : Dauntless , 2 ) The Lost Fleet : Fearless , 3 ) The Lost Fleet : Courageous , 4 ) The Lost Fleet : Valiant , 5 ) The Lost Fleet : Restless , and 6 ) The Lost Fleet : Victorious.The Alliance has been in a state of war for 100 years with another group of human worlds called the Syndicated Worlds , or Syndics for short . John Geary was thought to have been killed in the early opening attacks of that war . In reality , he escaped certain doom in a survival pod launched from his Heavy Cruiser . He was placed in a state of hibernation , with the expectation that he would be picked up in a few weeks , but something went wrong . The emergency beacon on his pod failed , and he drifted until he was accidentally found 100 years later by another Alliance Battle Cruiser.He was revived and found himself thrust into command of the entire Alliance Fleet ( which was lost deep behind enemy lines ) and expected to miraculously get the Fleet home safely and to put and end to the war once and for all , and he was to do this against the overwhelming forces of the Syndicate Worlds.Compounding his problems is the fact that he must deal with a group of rebellious officers among his own crew , a love relationship that can not be acknowledged , politicians at home who want to arrest him when he gets there for a crime he has not committed and for which there is no evidence to suggest that he ever thought of committing it . And if that were not enough , he also has to deal with an unknown enemy with unknown technological capabilities that is known to exist just beyond the border that marks the extreme edge of Syndic space.If you like SciFi that 's filled with space battles based on reasonably thought out tactical plans and strategies , this series may be for you . It is much closer to reality than the Lensman series , though I will not say that is a better or worse story line . That is for the reader to decide .	1
I 've had Parallax by Jon Merz on my Kindle for several weeks . Finally , I found some reading time , and what a treat this mob hitman novel was . I 'll admit right now that I 'm not a big fan of hitman novels , but the character of hitman Frank Jolino was so finely drawn that I was hooked within the first few pages.I 'd love to see Jolino in other books because he was intelligent , articulate , droll , and at ease in his own skin . He also surprised me because he had a moral compass . Add all that to the fact that he was a vintage mystery reader , and you get a guy who is complex , appealing , and likable . Oh , yeah , he kills people for a living , but they 're by no means innocents undeserving of being whacked , but Merz lets the reader draw that conclusion . He does n't state the obvious and then hammer it home.Less likable is Ernst Stahl , once an idealist radical and now a jaded assassin , despite constant reminders from Stahl 's character that he was completing a job only to save his son . His moral compass is stuck on `` anything goes in the name of paternal love . `` When the two end up in some odd paranormal mutual awareness of each other , it 's interesting albeit rather unbelievable , but the compelling character of Frank Jolino keeps the reader turning the pages . You probably wo n't suspend disbelief , but you 'll be compelled to keep reading . You 'll also be rooting for Frank to figure a way out of the mess and to , somehow , end up with the babe who has some surprises of her own.WarningI downloaded the book in February , and there are numerous `` glitches '' in the book . I wo n't call them typos because , since I publish ebooks , I know that they are conversion errors that occur when punctuation marks in a Word manuscript get changed to weird symbols when the manuscript is converted to different file formats like HTML which Kindle uses for their digital publishing . Do n't let this deter you from enjoying the book.I advise you to ignore the Product Description because it 's a spoiler of what are meant to be neat plot twists . Just buy the book . Ignore the glitches , and start reading . Frank Jolino will hook you just as he did me .	1
Nicole Zoltack 's WOMAN OF HONOR weaves the tale of the first lady knight of Arnhem . Sprinkled with historical facts , bullies , and a good dose of love and honor , WOMAN OF HONOR is a coming of age novel set in the fantastical medieval world of Arnhem Kingdom . Aislinn is brave and truly grows to be a woman of honor . The characters are likeable and realistic . We feel Aislinn 's pains while she tries to prove herself . She overcomes tradition and the growing threat of Speica . This novel has history , knights , and mythological creatures and is filled with intrigue , mystery , horror , and , most important of all , love . In this first book of the Kingdom of Arnhem series , I feel like we touch upon their lives and a conflict looming in their future . By the end , I craved more from this fantastical world , and I 'm glad Ms. Zoltack supplied it in her next book .	1
Wow ! This is a fantastic young adult story that was so emotionally moving , my heart literally ached . I cried at a few places in the story . I could not believe that what was happening ! I got very involved with these characters and am totally on the hunt for the next part of the story . This story has romance , adventure , a new way of looking at Knighthood ; it has everything you could want in a fantasy adventure story.This is the first story I have read by this author , and I have to say she going on my must-buy list . She drew me into the story and kept me up way past bedtime when I should have been reading several nights in a row . Thanks so much for letting me read your book , Nicole ; you gave me a real treat in this story .	1
This is only the second fantasy book I have read in my adult years . I am surprised by how much I enjoyed it.It 's medieval days and Aislinn is seven years old but desires to be a knight and take her dead brother 's place in the king 's `` army . '' Her little seven year old self takes a coach to the kingdom and presents herself to the king . She begins training to be a knight . There is math , reading and writing , horsemanship , archery , weapons , and swimming . Aislinn overcomes every obstacle in her path from a group of bully boys to an ornery horse . She makes friends with two boys , one of them the future king . As they grow up together in this school for knights , Aislinn and Prince Caelan fall in love . But Aislinn must focus on obtaining her knighthood ( she is the first woman to attempt it in this kingdom ) and Caelan must marry another.There are a few battles between some group called the Speicans and a lot of good life lessons for Aislinn . There were a few fire breathing dragons doing a flyby or two and my eyebrow did go up when the half lion/half eagle creature `` mind talked '' to Aislinn . ( What was that about anyway ? ? Nothing came of that at all ... ) I really enjoyed it , especially reading about a young girl learning to be a knight , but there were a lot of typos for a published book and a lot of things were left unexplained ( There is a sequel tho ) . Also , Aislinn 's dead brother showing up and talking about knights in Heaven was weird.Otherwise , great book , well written , and about a strong female character .	1
I very rarely take the time to review books I have read , but this one was so funny I had to take the time to do so . I am cat slave to two felines , and it 's clear the author is a cat lover too . A real laugh out loud read . I would heartily recommend it to any other cat lovers out there .	1
I liked the story very own home but I did not like the way the book skipped a year ... or example one page she had no cell phone a chapter later she had one . All in all a solid book and would not hesitate to read another by this author .	1
This was my first book by this author and I got to say that I loved it.I liked the chemistry between jack and Alex I really did n't care for the age diffrence jack really was a sweetheart.Alex was a strong heroin with a big heart.the romance for me was good.the characters really communicated in this book . Unlike other romances where the main characters do n't really communicate and let misunderstandings stand in their way in this novel the romance is true , at least for me.I recommend for readers that like suspense , spice , and romance .	1
Want a romance that intertwines the best of drag racing and heart pounding love ? Then grab a copy of Out of Control , by Julie Miller . Your heart and adrenaline will race ! She thinks she 's an ugly duckling in a man 's world . He 's trying to catch the person who killed his partner . Their paths cross on a street in Nashville for one amazing night and never to cross again ... or so they think . Cars are n't the only thing racing out of control at the Dahlia Speedway.I liked that Alex possessed the physical features of a vixen yet she did n't know that to do with those same attributes . She shows that all women can be sexy regardless of her status in life . Grease monkeys and gear heads can be very saucy . I also liked that Jack was n't a typical cop/detective . He played by the rules - his own . His take charge attitude helped smooth over his possessiveness and made him more likable.The writing was tight and the descriptions of the speedway made you feel like you were a real part of the story . I enjoyed every minute of the journey.If you want a great summer read , filled with racing heart and racing cars , then Out of Control if the read for you . I give this novel 4.5 books. [ ... ]	1

He will find the killer of his partner.Is there a way for these two to keep each other , solve the crime ring , find Alex 's brother killer and keep the cool car at the end ? Alex Morgan in Out of Control is one of the spunkiest women I have read about in a while . She has taken a bad experience in her past and made a life , in spite of it . Then there is Jack Riley , yum is what I have to say about him . From the witty scene in Nashville to the end of the story Out of Control had my attention . You do not have to be a racing fan to love Out of Control and I Joyfully Recommend it.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
If you adore a good dragon shifter romance this is it . Edge of Craving an excellent romantic dragon shifter story . The dragon shifter is strong , alpha & so masculine .

The suspense , action & romance are well worth reading.Dragon shifter romance readers this is a great book to read .	1

How many twists and turns can a mystery take . At every door a new mystery appears it is only when all the doors have been opened and inspected that the solution can become apparent . And then the action begins , it spins you through the country roads as fast as they can be taken.This book centers on the Four Corners where Utah , Colorado , New Mexico and the Ute and Navajo Reservation meet . The descriptions of the attractions of this area had me up on the web researching the Pueblo Indians , and now I really want to visit . Thanks Cliff Black for a great narrative , a beguiling mystery and a roller coaster thriller .	1
Good story about a Call Girl who through a brain implant becomes the character she is playing . Explicit BDSM SEX with spanking , kidnap and sexual slavery	1
This is a short novella prequel to the & # 34 ; Leopard Series & # 34 ; . Brandt & Maggie 's romance . Every book in this series is excellent .	1
The name did not strike me as familiar , but I took the plunge anyway . Well worth the effort too , I might add . A classic author of Golden Age , or perhaps just post-Golden Age sci-fi . Really , Piper might be the missing link between 'high ' Golden Age space opera and post-WWII cold war fever . I feel like I knew this author before , once I had read him , even though I am fairly certain I never read any of his stuff when it was originally in print , or out of it .	1
We have enjoyed reading H. Beam Piper 's books , and then found this book of his combined works , and purchased it so we can enjoy reading ( or re-reading ) his writings !	1
great characters , good action , and fantastic science fiction . my favorites are 4 day planet , lone star planet , and little fuzzy ; all of which I can read anytime and never get tire of .	1
I really enjoyed this story . I am not a seeker of mythical type books but this is definitely a good one . The story was good and it was n't drawn out . It had humor and sex , I was completely satisfied with it . Short , sweet and to the point . Thorne was awesome and Dallas was his perfect challenge or mate I should say .	1
I just love this series and keep getting more and more ! Ca n't wait until I can get them all just love it	1
At about 7,500 words I 'm not sure that `` Planter 's Punch '' qualifies as a novella , but no worries -- at 99 cents for the download this is a steal . Funny , suspenseful , and never , ever dull , even for a second ( hey , I think I just figured out the secret of J.A . Konrath 's success ! ) , you ca n't go wrong here , even if mystery/thrillers are n't ordinarily your thing .	1
So many good stories in this collection . Konrath is the master story teller with a vivid imagination and can create a well rounded fleshed out character in just a couple of paragraphs .	1
The whole Jack Daniels series is fast paced with an edge . Not your average cop novel bit more gruesome . If you are a true crime reader this is something you will enjoy reading . The fashion passion she has adds a quirk which is enjoyable .	1
I have to agree with another reviewer that most of the other Konrath I have read has been far better than what I read in this short story anthology . However , some of the stories were great , and I especially Like Phin and Jack Daniels . All in all I had a blast , so thank you Mr. Konrath , from one of your devoted fans .	1
65 Proof is a collection of short stories written by J.A . Konrath , aka Jack Kilborn . These stories run the gambit from good to mediocre and to some that just make you wonder about the psyche of Mr. Konrath . They are all fun to read . It was enjoyable to read the short stories featuring Jack , Phinneas and Harry . If you want to read something while waiting for a doctor 's appointment or in between tv shows then this book has everything that you could want to read ; some are funny , some are intriguing , others will make you scratch your head.All I can say is it was a fun read , not great literature but definitely not boring . Enjoy	1

I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS STORY ! ! ! The author did an amazing job of laying out the legend and then incorporating it into an amazing story . I was sucked in from the first page , I could not put this story down ! Creepy and enthralling . You wo n't be disappointed in this one !	1
Short ghost story based on the Mexican legend of the weeping woman . Generic plot , but fast-paced , and the authentic language is a nice touch . Chilling bedtime story for adults .	1
Just finished this wonderful book . I can relate to the shattering loss of a beloved only child who died too soon , who was becoming an adult . I 've been there . Donating a loved ones organs is the supreme gift of love for the survivors to give . It is comforting for me to know that somewhere someone is seeing this beautiful world because my Kathi wanted her organs used . You do not ever get over the life shattering loss for you heart will always bear a scar , but hopefully , the pain will ease with passage of time , and it will get better . I would give the book six stars if I could !	1
I 've really enjoyed reading . I 'm finding such type of books interesting not very often , but this one full of hope and light . I was impressed by the story , in some way it reminded meLove Is n't Blind : A Sweet and Special Romances Collectionthat was also good.The story begins with disappointment . A lot of us know how painful is any betrayal , especially a hit from those , who we love . The main character , Paul , was hearted by his wife 's infidelity . This changed his life ; he loses the reason of his life , trying to forget his pain with different women in different ways . Suddenly he meets `` the one '' , but an accident renders him blind . Here 's his real story begins.I admire people who have some serious diseases and stay alive , strong and shining . I admire people who believe in their life , despite any dramatic accidents or problems , who stay come and optimistic . You do n't have to spare them , never , you should respect them instead . Just imagine how much they need to overcome in their routine life every day . I think a hope is a big part of their lives , a hope and love to their surroundings . This book is exactly about hope and about the strongest people in the World .	1
Rick he loves his mate and he cares for her , `` he growled at her wince as she stepped forward . `` You 're in pain . '' Belle she gives as good as she gets especially where undergarments are concerned , `` she nearly groaned as she realized he 'd be walking around commando all day . She looked down at the panties in her hand , then looked back at him . With a smirk she tossed them onto the bed , then pulled on her own jeans . His groan was music to her ears . '' Still have to say Simon and Max 's stories are still my favorite out of this series .	1
Belinda `` Belle '' Campbell is a Halle Puma who was injured protecting the life of one Sheri Giordano a wolf who is the , wife of the Halle Marshall ( see Cat of a different color ) . Belle 's injury is repaired by putting pins in her legs , while the pins are there she can not shift.Belle also has a problem with her pride the Halle pumas , because she was best friends with a puma who was outcast ( see Sweet Dreams ) the rest of the pride think she had something to do with an attack on the Beta 's mate . Belle has proved her worth to the pride leaders but she has lost her job and most of her friends because of the feelings of others . After her injury she meets the Alpha leader of the Poconos Wolf Pack , when he came down to help with the attack on Sheri . Rick Lowell the Wolf pack alpha wants to take her back to the Poconos and care for her but is persauded to leave Belle in Halle to continue her therapy and care by the shifter specialist there . When she recovers more he sends several of his wolf leaders to escort her to the wolf lodge in the Poconos.Belle is challenged and taunted by Gena the acting leader of the women in the wolf pack . Gena 's goal is to be the Luna of the pack and she definitely wo n't step down for a puma who is also crippled ! Of course she 's never met Belle ! Although there is a serious side to his story , Belle and Rick 's romance is the center of the plot and I loved it ! The female shifters have got it all and they do n't give up an ounce of the authority or power . You have to love them ! The guys are all hot and the ladies are all that !	1
I 've been waiting for this next installment in the Halle Pumas stories . Love all these characters . Lots of humor , passion , suspense , and a $ $ -kickin shifters ! This one does n't disappoint . Both Belle and Rick are strong characters and perfect for each other . Read this series if you have n't . Read them in order too . Ca n't wait for the next one . There better be one ! ! !	1
Shifter romance . My favourite so far in this series and that 's saying something . A romance between a Puma and a werewolf Alpha . Let the games begin ! Loved this story , good characters and well written . Fantastic .	1
This book was intense and I could not put this book down . This book held my attention throughout the entire book . The characters displayed their love for each other in a very unique way !	1
This is the first book I 've read by this author , but it wo n't be the last . The story was well written with plently of back story and developed characters . I love that the pace of the romance was built up nicely and the characters did n't all jump into bed together after only 3 pages . The story was also fairly long , so you do n't feel cheated : )	1
I absolutely loved this book . It was all so innocent in the beginning . Jane Porter is a fantastic character . This is one book I will read again . The 2nd and 3rd book are even better . I absolutely loved them as well . When you get hooked on this book , you will buy the whole series , including Hott for Teacher which is book 4 . I have n't found book 5 yet . It seems to have disappeared fron the book buying world , which is really sad , because I want more . A definite must-read in your collection . If anyone knows what book 5 in this series is called and where I can buy it , please comment on this review . Thankyou .	1
I almost cried when I reached the end me want more ... .so now i guess i am a fan of ms dom adair	1
I am adding Dominique Adair and her Jane Porter series on my Kindle . Her characters intrigue me and I want to see where this goes .	1
Lots of sexual advances n publicly sex n domination is great it was a good book sucks it was a tease	1
You have several different categories that erotica books can fall into . Too innocent . Too bold ( Is there such a thing , really ? ) . Too pathetic . Just too .. boring.Seducing Jane Porter is none of the above . This novel is surrounded by some interesting characters wrapped in pretty packaging filled with class . Dominique Adair created a fun world that is obtainable . Some prefer to read books that could only be fantasies . Perhaps this is one of those books to you . But , the characters , the stories , the depth .. this book is well written and left me smiling.Jane Porter is a submissive woman who is partners with her best friend . They own an RSVP business that caters to those in need of even planning.Jane spent two glorious years with *drum roll please* an a**hole that decided to say , `` Hey baby , I 'm married with kids but I 'd like to pay for your apartment and bump uglies whenever I call you . `` She dumped his sorry ass .. good for her.After a year of celibacy , she finds herself attending an event that she and her friend planned . This book is filled with tasteful BDSM content . When I use the word tasteful , it by no means there is no nitty-gritty . I just means that the author pulled moments to life that seem real.Masked and disappointed , Jane feels defeated that she will not be able to meet a man who will give her the satisfaction that she needs . Then , tada ! Antonio , the birthday boy , seduces her into shivers.This book does have a huge cliffhanger . I am usually not a cliffhanger fan , but it was inserted at the right moment . I am looking forward to reading Educating Jane Porter which happens to be the second book of the Jane Porter series.Line of the book : Being a sexual submissive was similar to Double Dutch jump roping , once you learned to navigate ropes , you never forget the rush.I recommend this book to ADULTS ONLY . This is an extremely erotic book filled with BDSM content . There is your forewarning . If you 're curious or disgusted .. you can either take the bull by its horns or buzz off	1
This case is very well made and I 'm sure it 'll last a long time . I agree with one of the other reviewers that they should have made the `` leather '' cover the entire screen of the DX , not just 3/4 of the screen . I disagree with another reviewer who said that the case is 1/2 inch too big in length and width- it fits the DX almost perfectly , and the DX does not slide around inside the case.I put the word 'leather ' in quotes above because Amazon advertises it as being made of `` high-quality leather , '' but the manufacturer 's tag says `` faux leather . '' Amazon should not be charging $ 45 for a case made with faux leather . I 'm keeping it because it protects the DX better than any other case available , but the price Amazon is charging is more than the case is worth .	1
Ok , so I cried , could not be helped . I also laughed and found great joy in how the story and characters all came together . I wish I could experience an ounce of the love the leads have . ( sniffle sniffle )	1
This was a short and sweet fairy tale romance.Fiona fell in love with Garret . After she moved in with him , he changed . He started slapping her , and hurting her . She waited for him to leave for work one day , and climbed into her old car and headed for Texas from Colorado . During her trip she swerved to miss hitting a dog , then she passed out . Aidan stopped to help her . He realized her car was about to break down . So he offered her a ride to his home , a job , and a place to stay for a little while . They thought it would be better if they pretended to be a couple . While they were pretending , they both fell in love with one another . Meanwhile her ex was still harassing her , and threatening her . The suspense of the story was Garret finding her . I was glad Aidan was there to give her support , and his love . The chemistry seemed between Fiona and Aidan seemed real , but the time line was too fast for it to happen in real life . It did make for a nice fairy tale .	1
This short book had a VERY DARK SIDE . When a woman is lonely , how far will she go to fulfill her needs ? Things seem to be going okay at first but then manbot goes crazy . Story was n't what I expected but I still liked it .	1
good selection of stories . some I had read before but good enough to read again . try it , you 'll like it ! !	1
I enjoyed these stories . They were short but had a good story . Just easy reading , and enjoyable . I would recommend these books to anyone . who likes Christian reading .	1

Wyoming rancher Quinn McKay 's been in love with his wife Libby for the past fourteen years . They 've been married for nine of those years and he could n't imagine being with anyone else . That 's why their ` trial separation ' is proving to be the most difficult thing he 's ever endured.He hopes that Libby will come to her senses and allow him to return to their home and her bed but it 's become apparent to him that something has to change or he will lose her for good . Quinn is n't one to talk about his feelings or show a lot of affection but after three months of separation he 's willing to do whatever he has to in order to save his marriage.Libby McKay has never stopped loving Quinn but all the improvements she 's made to herself and their home have gone unnoticed and she 's afraid that the love and desire they once shared is gone forever . She 'd hoped that maybe a little time apart would rectify the situation but nothing she 's doing seems to be enough to get him to fight for her . It 's a heartbreaking situation but it looks like divorce is imminent.Quinn does something completely unexpected and he reinforces the fact that he 's staked his claim and lets her know that he has every intention of seeing that she gives him the second chance he deserves . He even goes so far as to find new ways to show his feelings for her . However , one of their biggest problems could simply be their lack of communication but maybe a weekend together could bring them closer than ever - especially if they 're completely honest about everything that happened and what they desire from each other.Lorelei James ' STRONG , SILENT TYPE really captures all the emotional angst that occurs when a marriage is in trouble . What I especially enjoyed about this story is the genuine love that is evident in how Quinn and Libby respond to each other . This is a relationship that deserves a second chance and really touched me because I can personally attest to the impact family interference and heartbreaking loss can have on a family and how much work it takes to keep your marriage from falling apart . Lorelei James will touch readers ' hearts with this memorable story which is not just very emotional - but also downright hot ! We all should be so lucky as to have a STRONG , SILENT TYPE man of our very own.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1
Quinn and Libby McKay are on the brink of divorce , only if they do n't find a way to save their marriage.Quinn pulls out all the stops to make Libby happy and bring her the ultimate pleasure , and to make up for all he did wrong in their marriage.Libby finally figured out what she did wrong and she tries to make it up to Quinn.They finally just concentrate on each other and their marriage , and just enjoy it.I liked this short novella . A nice short read .	1
This was a great short story . I would recommend this to my friends for sure . Lorelei James writes great fiction love stories .	1
These books are always hot ! ! This was so loving , passionate , sizzling , sweet - everything ! A very good read . I love this series .	1
As Quinn McKay find himself in the verge of loosing his wife for his stubbornness he is forced to reevaluate his life and his relationship . But it is Libby herself who lets him know that a woman has needs other than a good house and a steady income.When Quinn and Libby go back to basics it is here where they remember why they decided to get married and spend the rest of their lives together . Because they are explosive together and each have what the other needs.I like how in this story we get shown that no matter how long you know a person there is always something new to explore even if it 's something old ...	1
I was so happy that Lorelei James did a story about a real marriage . This is obviously a couple that love each other but even that is n't always enough . Marriage like anything else requires hard work and communication . It was a great story and even though it was a novella , it did n't seem like it was too short . Of course , like with all of her stories , I would n't mind more , but I was n't left with the feeling that something was missing . Quinn and Libby McKay find out that hot sex and communication can make for a good marriage . Again more McKays to love . There are so many wonderful characters in the Rough Rider stories . I always look forward to the next one .	1
I have read almost all of Ms. James books . This is by far my favorite . Anyone that has been married for a length of time can relate . Saying what you think and feel is not always easy . Also wanting or needing it is easy to become so focused you alienate the other person . She did such a brilliant job of showing that . It is so clear that they love each other you ca n't help but root for them . It will bring a tear to your eye but in the end you smile because meant to be is sometimes enough .	1
There 's nothing more frustrating than feeling like your marriage is in a rut and nothing you do can get you out of it . For Libby that 's what she tried and poor Quinn just was n't getting it . Thankfully his brother Ben made him see things differently and once he pulled his head out damn did he do a great job of wooing back his wife . I loved that this was a couple who was in a long term committed relationship and they just needed a spark to make them take a look at what they had and what they stood to lose if they could n't communicate better and work through their issues . It was fun to watch them re-discover the heat and lust they once had and stretch the boundaries of their sexuality . Hot , hot , hot ! *I knew in this book Ben 's story was going to be something special . There was just something about him that made me sit up and take notice ! Memorable s Moments : When Quinn realizes all the pressure his Mom had been putting on Libby to have a child and tells her to butt the hell out of their relationship . When Libby jacks off Quinn outside the massage studio and then he tells her he wants their sex life to be & # 34 ; fun and raunchy and spontaneous & # 34 ; and that he does n't always want to be the one to start things in the bedroom .	1
Another in a long line of wonderful suspense , drama and romance . B.J . Daniels is one of my many favorite authors , and I highly recommend any and all of her mysteries .	1
Another B. J. Daniels hard to put down book . I love the way she weaves the lives of her characters from previous books into all her books in Whitehorse , Montana . This is a small town , but everyone has a story and a very exciting story lines . Love the cowboys and romances .	1
The story is set in Montana , and the characters are all intertwined with other books in this series . I like that . You get a feel for the people you have read about . I think each book is better than the last . Good reading .	1
This is a fantastic love series by B.J . Daniels . All of her books are great and you wo n't want to put any of them down until you have finished them .	1
I am SO relieved the Economist is now available on Kindle . I was having to go through the hassle of printing pages as pdfs and then converting them every week . I honestly have no problem with the price being the same as the print version . I pay for the quality of the reporting and analysis when I subscribe to a journal or newspaper . The fact that it is on Kindle simply adds to the convenience for me , so I feel pricing it the same is fair value as far as I am concerned . Thank you , thank you , thank you ! My life is now complete ...	1
I must say I love the Westmoreland saga . I would not spend this kind of money otherwise . Get ready to continue to buy the next couple of collection . I love them . Full of passion lustm , love and family .	1
I am hooked . Read the first fifteen of the Westmorelands . Loved all of them . Are you putting the nest set in a group . Please ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Ms. Jackson brings the `` Heat '' in all 5 of these stories ! I have read them previously in paperback but it was a joy to have them at my fingertips on my Kindle Fire HD all in one bundle ! If only those WESTMORELAND men could be seen in picture . The descriptions of each one paints an image of a helluva man !	1
I love that so many of the Westmoreland books are together in a sequence . Sometimes in a series or in a plot with families , it 's hard to read things in order . Excellent !	1
I enjoy reading the Westmorelands in chronological order so buying the books as a bundle will guarantee that you read in sequence .	1
Excellent book ! ! ! Must read ... .Very good and love the detail of everything in the book and the sences and it keeps drawing you in even the next one .	1
Well what 's there to say it takes u on that great ride into the world of BDSM cliffhangers and wondering why there 's not more to the story loved it that much	1
I re read these books I get OMG I think I 'm in love with the main male characters I may just change my name to jane	1
I gave this one 4 stars- the sex is just as good , but the outcomes are n't quite as plausible as I would have liked .	1
First , let me say that I enjoyed this book and the angle that the author took . However , due to the way that it is written , I did not develop any kind of attachment to any of the main characters . This book is basically written as a narrative of events that happened , reminding me of a fictional history book . The book also gets very technical about its development of the space drive and weapons . Liked it , did n't love it . Will buy the next one to see what happens .	1
the plot is well thought out and developed intelligently . i found it a joy to read and look forward to the other books in this series . i highly recommend this book to anyone who likes si-fi with good action .	1
Not the deepest materiaI , but think this author is really taking off . His Markhat series , while completely subsumed by Glen Cook 's Garrett series , is different enough to generate real interest . His supposedly youth-qualified & # 34 ; All the Paths of Shadow & # 34 ; is actually a tour de force ( sans sex ) . I look forward to more from Frank Tuttle .	1
This story ( s ) was so great ! Each chapter you learn something new about the characters that keep you wanting more . Each chapter gives you a great story where you find out more about the characters . Every chapter is easy to read and it leaves you wanting to know more of the happenings of Lord Winstril and Kern , not to mention Sir Knobby .	1
My little Kindle dots are getting longer and longer making me sadder and sadder . I loved this book and I am not a fan of this genre . I dare you to put this book down after reading one page . I dare you . If you need me , I 'll be in front of Frank Tuttle 's house waving signs demanding more Wistril . We shall dine in shifts !	1
How does a wizard who has taken an Oath of Magical Non-Violence protect his household and his village in dangerous times ? Wistril , cranky and reclusive , undertakes to do just that in this lighthearted collection . `` Stealth and guile may win '' , he instructs Kern , his sarcastic and dubious apprentice , `` where fury and might may not . `` Kern and major-domo goblin Sir Knobby ; with a miscellaneous staff of goblins , phantoms , and magical creatures more or less real , are responsible for carrying out the often apparently lame-brained instructions of their irascible master . Anything from nurturing orphaned sea monsters to learning the correct cutlery arrangement for an Oomish engagement party to undermining the underpinnings of a bridge may be required of them at any time.Kern 's adolescent snark is authentic and well done , and Wistril has some great lines , ( `` The Oath prohibits offensive arcane actions , not malicious carpentry '' ) ; but his character could use a bit more development - rounding out as well as rotundity . The dialogue throughout is very good , and the stories well paced.4 Stars . There were just a few editing errors that kept me from giving this book 5 stars , but more Wistril stories would be very welcome.Rated G - readers 8 to 80+ can enjoy this book .	1
I 've read several of Tuttle 's books now and have to say that I have found this one to be a great short series of stories . Kind of wish there were more with these characters !	1
This is really a book of 3 short stories about the wizard Wistril . He lives in a castle with gargoyles and a snarky apprentice . He just wants to be left alone to drink beer , eat good food and work on his research . Do n't we all ? But he seldom gets what he wants . These stories were wonderful , creative and very funny . Frank Tuttle is a relatively new author on the scene , but definitely one to watch out for . I greatly hope to see more of Wistril in the future !	1
A fun read like all of her books . A book to read straight through and not put down until finished .	1
The last year has been pure hell for Elizabeth O'Connell . First she discovers that her husband has been living a double life , with a wife and family in Idaho . To make matters worse she discovers that she is actually his second wife and that their entire life in California has been built on a lie . Just when she thought that she could n't take anymore , she is totally devastated when her husband cuts all ties with her and rushes home to Dundee determined to try and get his first wife to forgive him . Unable to believe that he could totally abandon her and their children she follows him to Dundee . With the marriage of Elizabeth 's brother Isaac to her husband 's first wife Reenie ( Big Girls Do n't Cry Harlequin Super Romance # 1296 ) the next year finds Elizabeth and Reenie forming a family with their children . Now Reenie has tried a little matchmaking , arranging a date between Elizabeth and Carter Hudson . At first Carter and Elizabeth do n't like each other , but the more time they spend with each other the more they come to care . However , Carter tragically lost the woman he loved and Elizabeth is determined that she will never be second best again.The Other Woman touches upon every woman 's feelings of rejection . Both Carter and Elizabeth must deal with their pasts before they find a future together . Although The Other Woman can stand alone , I recommend that readers first pick up Reenie 's story , Big Girl 's Do n't Cry ( Harlequin Super Romance # 1296 ) , as it is not only a great read but also will adds the background to this story . Brenda Novak has written a romance with truly complex relationships that keep the reader turning the pages and keeps them engrossed in the story until the last page.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I loved this whole series buy this book was probably my favorite . It was awesome . Highly recommend this author and this series in particular .	1
Brenda Novak never ceases to amaze me . I find myself reading til all hours of the night . I highly recommend her books .	1
Unable to believe the number of business trips his brother-in-law Keith O'Connell makes to Dundee , Idaho , Isaac Russell decides to serendipitously follow him . Isaac is stunned to find that Keith has another wife with three young daughters besides his sibling Liz.Forced to make a decision , Keith chooses his Idaho family for the sake of his offspring . When his despondent sister Liz decides to follow her `` husband '' to Idaho , Isaac does likewise to insure she does not break the law by doing something stupid or even try to do something stupider like getting her `` husband '' to come back to her . Complicating matters at least in Isaac 's mind is his attraction to Keith 's schoolteacher first wife Reenie Holbrook , who uses her maiden name.Big girls do cry when they suffer broken hearts as both women do when the truth about Keith 's bigamy surfaces . However , Reenie recovers faster perhaps because she has the kids to take care of ( no time for breakdowns ) and the interest of Isaac to help her move on while Liz feels abandoned and betrayed first by her two-timing spouse and then her brother . She and the kids provide the fresh extended look at the impact of bigamy.Harriet Klausner	1
another excellent book by Brenda Novak . Well written , engrossing , and fun to read . A romance hard to put down and worth finishing .	1
A cute and fast read about two people who are different in some ways except their attraction and eventually look for each other.A widow surprises herself what it feels like to truly love . I would , though , have enjoyed more to the story and more to some of the other characters.Adeline . : )	1
This was the prequel to the Lone Star Sisters series and if it is any reflection to how the series will be I wo n't be disappointed . Looking forward to reading the next one .	1
I am hooked so if you are hooked on the Westmoreland family like I am . You will come out better buying the collection when you can and not individual books .	1
I have read about 60 Brenda Jackson books ( I have an excel spreadsheet of books I 've read ) . This is a group of books I 've read more than once . I love the stories . All the Westmorelands are interesting , sexy and complicated . The books are tastefully done . Ca n't wait to see how their offspring turnout . Thanks Brenda for the hours and hours of enjoyment .	1
I loved the characters and story line . The romance and love that flows through each story line keeps you interested and wanting to know more about each of the characters .	1

Being a tri-omega werewolf , Leland Summers knew he was special and that his future held two special people for him . He knew werewolves had soul mates , but in his case he had two and someday he would find them , but he never expected his current photography job to lead him to the both of them.Meeting first Jake and then Luke , Leland did n't think life could get any better than what his two gorgeous mates had to offer him . When Leland finds that Jake , the alpha of the pack , was already in love with Luke , his omega , Leland starts to wonder if there was a place in their life and hearts for him.Secret Desires is a fun and enjoyable story . Leland is just adorable and he holds his own against his big , gorgeous and very overbearing lovers . Jake and Luke are the alpha and omega of a pack that chose to be with each other after being shunned by their own birth packs . The chosen pack were wolves that really cared for one another and I think Leland fit in with them nicely . Leland 's mother , who was also a tri-omega , was a crack up . She was so matter of fact and blunt it seemed like nothing fazed her . It was obvious Leland took after her and not his two fathers . Aside from Leland , Luke and Jake 's romance , I was also very interested in Ryland and Gregory and I 'm excited that the author Stormy Glenn is n't letting their story end with Secret Desires . I really liked Secret Desires and I 'm looking forward to more from Ms. Glenn regarding this series and other stories.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

The Lyall brothers are shifters , Alphas , gorgeous and identical triplets . Over two hundred years old , they are still searching for the One , the only woman who will complete them and become their permanent mate . Some Alpha shifters never find their One but Aindreas , Brodey and Cailean have faith they will find her.Hot , muggy weather is n't endearing Elain Pardue to stay once she finishes her on air descriptions of the First Annual Arcadia Highland Games for her TV station . It 's time to call it a day and head home to central air conditioning.Occasionally one of the brothers scented a female they thought was the One but found themselves wrong . Today however , when both Brodey and Cailean scent her they are sure it 's their mate . So desperate to find her , Brodey shifts to track her . Elain and her camera man are leaving when a large black ` dog ' shows up . The ` dog ' is crazy for Elain and nobody is claiming him - what 's she supposed to do ? At the same time , Aindreas and Cailean are frantically trying to find their idiot brother - where the hell is he ? Macho hotties with a heart of gold add up to Trouble Comes in Threes . A common plotline made more interesting when you have three Alphas pitted against an intelligent , seemingly demure newscaster . Trouble Comes in Threes is a predicable story yet the writing brings the characters alive and gives readers a fresh , sexy tale . Pleasing and fun , Trouble Comes in Threes is an altogether enjoyable story.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
Elain Pardie is a news reporter . On assignment covering the First Annual Arcadia Highland Games , she is concerned to find a lost black dog while leaving . Finding no one to claim him , Elain agrees to take him home with the hopes of finding his owner . She has no idea that the huge furry dog is not actually a dog but a wolf . Nor does she even think to consider that the wolf is not a canine but a man . When the dog 's owners show up to claim their lost pet , Elain is sad to see him go but returns him anyway . The next day , she receives a phone call from one of the owners inviting her to lunch . When she meets the man , she is surprised to see he is a twin and that both men are luscious . Allowing them liberties she never even could have considered , Elain 's life changes the minute they touch her.Ain , Brodey , and Cail are identical alpha triplets . As such , fate tells of only one woman for the three men to love - their soul mate . When Brodey smells an enticing scent at the Highland Games , he ca n't help but follow it . He knows that Ain , the Prime of the three will be angry , but he is willing to take that chance because if his nose is correct , then he has just found the woman nature has intended to complete his family.I found myself laughing out loud at the antics of Brodey and Cail . Ain was the oldest and the most intense . Brodey was the most playful of the three , and Cail seemed the happiest . All three were sin personified and simply dreamy . Ain 's emotions concerning Elain worried me at first - he was so stubborn in wanting Elain to love them on her own terms and by her own choice . Ain 's willingness to sacrifice a lifetime of being unmated rather than force Elain to mate with he and brothers grabbed my heart and did n't let go.TROUBLE COMES IN THREES is sexy , scorching hot , and fun to read . Tymber Dalton 's ability to weave a story keeps me coming back for more and reading everything she releases . Lovers of paranormal m & eacute ; nage romances with a hint of comedy should run and grab this enticing book . It was great ! Natalie S .	1

First there is good looking Jackson and then there is the gentle giant Shayne . Will she be able to accept the future that Jackson is offering ? And will she and her brother Pete live to be able to live out their future ? I found Dakota Ranch Crude to be an intriguing story . I enjoy Ms. Brooke 's style of writing and have found this recent Dakota Heat offering to be well written and spicy . It is interesting that she has the story progress through the stages of the men being protective and not just lusting after Samantha . I enjoyed Dakota Ranch Crude and look forward to other stories offered in the Dakota Heat Series.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
Oh , Thomas hooked me almost from the start ! I mean , seriously , gaydar and pink toenails ! ? ! Classic scene ! I adore a man who will defend against bullies and the fact that Thomas used humor to run them away was fantastic ! It just solidified for me how much I was going to enjoy this third book in the Tri-Omega Mates series.Thomas has headed away from the small Wolfrik pack for vacation on his motorcycle to see the sights of America . A stop in a small town leads him to Micah , his mate . I adored Micah from the beginning because of his sense of humor , his spitfire attitude , and his sheer emotional vulnerability .

Can Caleb and Thomas share ? Does Micah even want any part of this crazy life ? Will Caleb 's pack accept them ? This was probably my favorite story , so far , in the whole series . These three men were smoking hot together and I adored their personalities and individual attitudes . So , if you like shifters , strong and dominant men , sarcastic attitudes , and very funny humor , then this story is for you !	1
I have really enjoyed this series . This is the second book in the Rachel Myers series . I am familiar with the setting even though Ms. Jackson slightly changes the names of the towns . I like the way the author tells a story . Each book flows into the next one- so be sure to read them in order . In this book , Rachel 's lifelong friend Isaac has her investigate the death of his friend . Isaac knew his friend was afraid of heights and that he would never get that close to the edge of the overlook . So Rachel starts investigating with her logical mind she is soon able to find out what really happened . If you like mountains , cozy mysteries , horses and plants , you will not be disappointed with this series .	1
Having read the first Rachel Myers book , Blind Malice , and then skipping to Appalachian Trail Mix , the fifth book , I decided to go back and pick up with number 2 . Blue Ridge Parkway Plunge takes place while Myers is getting settled in the mountains after moving back from Arizona . Jackson does a great job of combining the the everyday , seemingly thousands of little things that have to be done during a relocation , and the investigation of the death of Isaac Starling 's best friend . I really relate to the Myers character as a real person ; she 's not perfect , just someone who likes horses , likes gardening and does n't mind getting her hands dirty doing real work . I 'm not a big fan of flashbacks ( there 's one really long one ) but Jackson handles it beautifully so the reader does not lose sight of the current story . My own love of doing research in graduate school makes me admire Myers ' determination to leave `` no stone unturned '' to find the killer . This one may cause me to buy my own Kindle .	1
A funny action thriller with Douglas Adamsesque style space opera thrown in to the mix . Lots of twists and turns , not all unexpected but all of interest .	1
This book does not try to take itself too seriously . The author does not bog us down with reams of technobabble , or try to impress us with his knowledge of theoretical physics.It is a good story , filled with well developed and interesting characters . Most importantly , it is funny . As much as I enjoy science fiction , I also enjoy having a good laugh , and I got plenty of both here.Around 80 % , there were of number of technical errors with the text , with some paragraphs repeating , and some missing entirely . It could be I got a bad download , or maybe a glitch in my device . Either way , I do not hold that against the author . However , there were a number of grammatical errors which I did find distracting . Still , the book overall was very good , and I will probably read more from this author .	1
Here is a light hearted well written Sci-Fi romp that will give you lots of laughs and reading pleasure . Characters are a hoot and well developed as is the story . Read it , you 'll be glad you did .	1
A humorous and inventive romp through multiple galaxies to unravel a complex plan of theft , power , technology , and money .	1
Take the world as we know it , overlook one or two laws of physics , then let a couple of creative characters loose and see what happens . I found what happened very entertaining .	1
If you are a fan of Brad Thor or Vince Flynn you will really like this book . The action is constant even though predictable . Still , a page turning read !	1
I loved reading both books they kept me wanting to read to see what was going to happen next . Loved Them ... .	1
The Jane porter series is the one but I actually like the supporting characters in this series a good look into the world of BDSM	1
Dominique Adair 's `` Jane Porter '' series are well-written , engaging , and uninhibited . The protagonist is taken - literally ! - with a nice blending of characters whose overall impact draws one 's interest . She is a fun writer and she raises the temperature .	1
KND is a great way for authors to connect with Kindle readers as well as finding new and creative writers who are n't easy to find anymore . Unless your last name is Patterson or Grisham NY publishers are n't spending money to promote your work , so this is a solid way to discover new talent.Besides , one of the nice features of a Kindle is the ability to sample a writers works and KND offers a deeper sampling as well.I 've found two authors I never heard of with this blog and reading a solid book for $ 2.99 is one of the great attractions to the digital world .	1
This is the first place I look now to find great books for my Kindle . Hands down Kindle Nation Daily is the leader in finding great books . I honestly ca n't give enough praise to this incredible blog . If you 're looking for great book , you really do n't have to look any further .	1
Much to short but i loved it . The book told a great story and it made perfect sense . Loved learning about the pride and all the people that make it up	1
Dana Marie Bell writes a dam good story ! I always know I 'm gon na enjoy her books so much that I do n't even bother looking at the description .	1
Adrian is such a damn goofball , `` but my mate is inside . '' He ran his hand over her bottom . `` Hmm , a thong ? I love thongs . '' He sighed happily . '' Like Max and Simon he 's a possessive one when it comes to his woman , `` mine , '' he growled , spilling inside her , his teeth clamping down on his mark once more . '' Although I liked this book I have to say I liked Max and Simon 's more .	1
Ms. Bell continues this series with another winner . Humor even at times of terror and anger . Keeping the one you loves age can be difficult at times . Sometimes you need help from you friends and maybe a wolf or two !	1
Shifter romance . Love this series . Another great book with strong characters , detailed plot and well written dialogue . Puma shifters ! An eye doctor falls for an albino with an abusive ex , who happens to be a werewolf . Good stuff . Worth reading , perhaps twice !	1
This book is very hot . It is n't your normal romance , but who wants normal when you have a sexy doctor and a willing test subject . I do n't know about anyone else ... but I want a Dream Machine and if it comes with the good doctor , I 'll take it . Jayne Rylon is an awesome author and I ca n't wait for more of her books . : )	1
The storyline was great and every character - except Nicolette - was very easy to like . I wanted to pummel Nicolette ! She is a useless , spoiled , egotistic brat ! I love him ... I hate him ... I love him ... I wanted Jarrod to dump her sorry self and find ANYONE else !	1
As a young man I had hitchhiked quite a bit . I sometimes see hitchhikers on the road and feel bad that I am unwilling to stop . I 'll never feel guilty again after reading this story . The story was good , although the rape and violence was a little gratuitous and almost silly . I think all of the people who cried about how disturbing the story was should think about the fact the FBI estimates that there are 10000 serial killers loose in the county and that they are very rarely caught . This story could be a documentary ( though Lucy was really a bit unbelievable in her modus operandi ) ... I recommend this story for anyone who is n't squeamish .	1
I feel this short , short-story could have been much more . The concept had a great deal of promise . I do n't believe it achieved its full potential . On the upside , it did hold my attention .	1
This short story about 2 serial killers is both shocking and horrific in a good way . This quick read examines why no one should hitch or pick up hitchers . Two authors contributed to this grizzly tell . Jack Kilborn 's character is Donaldson - he likes to rape , maim , kill , and then burn the evidence . Blake Crouch 's character is Lucy - she likes to drug and kill her victims . One chapter is dedicated to introducing each serial killer . Then the 2 authors shared chapter 3 & the worked together to battle of wills . Overall is a quick , disturbing tell that is well-worth the read . I have forwarded it on to several people who agreed with my recommendation .	1
This was a great little gruesome short story . I ca n't wait to read all the others . Great job authors !	1
As outlined in intro - do n't get or read if you can not handle graphic descriptive writing based in serial killing . Sociopaths have no conscience , no sympathy and no empathy . Thus , when they are describing their acts to us ( or their victims ) it is gon na be ugly . And this is ugly in many of the things done . However , I was not shocked or offended ( even though I admit it was pretty gory and graphic ) .This book tells the tales of two people - one who picks up hitchhikers and one who hitchhikes . And a couple of people they encounter along the way to meeting up.I just was put off by the feeling of contrivance related to the ending . While action packed to the last `` drive , `` it felt like it was just an ending to end . Rather than a true end from having gone through paces.So so read due to unfulfilling ( to this reader ) end . If any are THINKING about this short ( more than half the `` book '' is intro , author interviews and excerpts from other books ) I suggest downloading sample chapters ( or peek in preview ) to see if you would even want to insert the gory images in your mind . Many will be upset ( many will not ) .I prefer the voice and excerpts from J.A . Konrath . Your mileage may vary.Christine	1
This is more of a short story than a novella and a relatively quick read.Great story line , good character development , good ending . When I finished I wanted more , and could n't believe the book ended so quickly ... I picked this up for free . I am not sure I would have been happy had I paid for it , however .	1
I ca n't believe I did n't review this when I read it years ago . I enjoyed this book even though it was sort of twisted . If you do n't mind that and you enjoy reading about insane murderers for the sheer absurdity of them , this book is for you .	1
I had just received my kindle last year when I was looking through the list of free downloads and came across this short story . Being a horror fan , the title intrigued me . I clicked to read the blurb and thought I hit the jackpot . A perfect horror tale : what happens when one psycho serial killer picks up another psycho serial killer hitchhiking ? Of course , I had to know.This little story was an experiment by two authors , Blake Crouch and Jack Kilborn AKA J.A . Konrath . They decided to write this in 3 parts . Kilborn wrote part 1 , Crouch wrote part 2 and they both collaborated on part 3 via e-mail . What we are left with is an edge of your seat slasher story that seems perfect to be made into a movie ( which I now heard it has been optioned for ) .The first part sets up the story of psycho # 1 , the second sets up psycho # 2 and of course , # 3 is where they meet for a showdown . What happens is a race to see who will outsmart who and who will walk away from it alive . I only was left wishing there was much more to the story as it was just too short to have any real character developement.Now Kilborn and Crouch have expanded the story to Serial : Uncut , which is supposed to be the full length novel . But they they came out with more . Killers . Then Killers : Uncut . Then Birds of Prey , Truck Stop , Bad Girl . Each one saying it was the `` must read backstory '' or `` the complete story '' . Then came Serial Killers : uncut . This is supposed to be the REAL complete novel . I hope so . Honestly , I kinda felt like I was being set up to keep buying more downloads . Luckily , they have been offering them free on amazon off and on and I think I actually got the whole `` epic '' as they refer to it . The idea for this is a great one , but I wish they would have just made it in its entire story at once . I probably would have actually paid for it , if it was complete , but glad I did n't since I kept having to add new pieces-some of which were included in others I already had . Not that free is anything to complain about , but I know they go from free to $ 2.99 to $ .99 and back . If I had paid for some of these , I really would be mad . I waited for Serial Killers : Uncut just because from experience I knew at some point that one would be offered free as well . And it was . Just as I do not like when a cd or dvd is released and then the `` extended version '' is realeased weeks or months later , it is the same with books . Seems a bit gimicky and I think the authors had this intent all along . Now there are `` prequels '' . So where will it REALLY end ?	1
Being a short novella like Serial , it was easy to plow through it on my lunch break . Maybe not the best book to read while eating , but entertaining nevertheless.I 've read Kilborn/Konrath before and his writing style shines through , as does that of his co-author that I have not read previously . As the author explained above , the premise is simple pitting two serial killers against each other in a hitchhike to the death.The cat and mouse game between the two killers ( and the two authors ) is fantastic to watch . Both killers are clever and sick . I wo n't spoil whether Kilborn 's Donaldson or Crouch 's Lucy wins . But hey , for free , what are you really waiting for ? One click it .	1
This is a very dark and twisted tale of the dangers of hitching a ride . It puts hitching in a totally new light.I really enjoyed it and highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good read .	1
I loved this story ! It was very short , but had all the gore and suspense you need for a quick , entertaining read . Perfect !	1
I have read tons of books , and this is one of the best books I 've ever read ! Imagine the concept of a hitch-hiking serial killer being picked up by a serial killer ! It 's hilarious ! I 've read all the versions and prequels and sequels that Kilborn and Crouch wrote about these characters , and let me tell you they are all great ! They have some really twisted minds , and I love that . Kinda reminds me of myself lol . Keep it up you two , because I want to read more of your stuff ! And do n't ever hitchhike ! ! !	1
Bravo to the authors for pairing up to do this short story ... the concept was interesting ... each to their own story and winding down with mingling the two story lines into one fine story in the end . A quick read plus a good lesson there on do n't pick up hitchhikers and do n't be one either .	1
Of course I loved it - what 's not to love about murderous hitch-hiker meets demented murderer of hitch-hikers ? My only complaint - too short . Hope you two collaborate again .	1
For me I have no hesitation to give a 5 . For me the only disappointment was it was n't longer . I would have liked something like this to have been a full length novel . However that being said , I liked both characters , and situations and at no time was I able to tell who was writing what . Fluid story telling for me ! 5 out of 5 stars for this reader !	1
Let me first say , if you have a weak stomach do not read this book . Jack Kilborn has a wicked sense of evilness . The main characters are so fully developed it could easily give you nightmares . However , if you can stomach it , I loved this book . Actually , its more a short story , with long lasting effects . But with it 's evilness , there is humor . I found Jack Kilborn style of writing intense , and so thrilling . This book is horror , at it 's best .	1
I enjoyed this book because it lets us look into another time in our past history . Also I am an older reader and this takes me back to a time closer to the way we were . Far from perfect but much more genteel with manners sometimes to a fault , plus the influence of the Christian Way again far from perfect but much better than now , as far as I am concerned . Since I am closer to 80 than 70 I have lived from before WWII until now and I wish we would return back , at least to the idea that & # 34 ; using vulgar words was for vulgar people & # 34 ; that most people had no respect for and avoided whenever possible . popcorngranny	1
GLH novels are always interesting and have the added benefit of being without sordid sex or foul language . They are well written and the plots draw you in .	1
This is by far my favorite ! ! The story is so well written that one forgets the time period it depicts . I 'm loving Mrs. Hill 's style and do n't want to put it down .	1
The Tryst is a Christian Novel about a young woman and a young man who knew each other when they were younger . It is a sweet love story with strong Christian references and meaning . It is interesting how the two characters get together again . It has many twists and turns and keeps the readers attention . I highly recommend this novel .	1
I really like techno-thriller , action novels . But I would also like them to be believeable . I gave this book four stars for having non-stop action in spades - but to me the situations our heroes are thrown into seem so contrived that after the second time it happened I was just waiting to see what the author would come up with next.As for the ending , seriously ? !	1
If you want an entertaining read of almost non-stop action this one is especially for you . The Xbats fly from one troubled hot spot to another and another and another & # 8230 ; and soon you feel the fatigue of these fearless weary warriors . The back stories and explaining a bit about the team & # 8217 ; s enhanced techno equipment come as welcomed pauses provided by a talented author.The Piranhas provided a unique body deposal system . The singing nuns sang to the bad-asses and thusly the justified fate of the AC.Although fast paced might be a bit of an understatement , this recommended action adventure earns a quick five stars.Enjoy often & # 8230 ; John	1
These series is for those that enjoy non-stop action military fiction . I enjoy these book , although nobody ever dies , they just keep changing helicopters , once , twice , three times in just the first two books . But then again , these are FICTION stories . Anyway , try one of the series and you will get hooked .	1
Okay , so I ca n't spell it . But you get the idea.Jack Shane writes the kinds of books I love to read . They keep me fascinated and grab my attention for the entire duration of the story . There has yet to be a time in this , or his other two & # 34 ; X-Bat & # 34 ; books , where I had to think , & # 34 ; Why am I wasting time with this book ? & # 34 ; Truly , there have been other books for which that thought was foremost in my mind , even while reading them . I read one of Jack Shane 's books , the first X-Bat thriller , then read this one.After those two , I started reading a different author 's book but could n't get farther than the first few pages . So I located this one , & # 34 ; Anarchy 's Reign. & # 34 ; It appears to be the third in this series.I 've begun reading Jack Shane 's & # 34 ; Anarchy 's Reign , & # 34 ; but I 've not quite finished it . That 's only because I had two other , very pressing items on my agenda : work and sleep ! And the kind of work I do gives me a great head start on sleep ... So without further fondue , I hereby recommend Jack Shane 's entire series on the X-Bat SpecOps group . They 're a lively , unusual assembly of military types . If you like action and adventure , like Tom Clancy , Lee Child , and others of that genre , you will enjoy this book.If you do n't enjoy it , start looking over your shoulder ; a very silent , & # 34 ; Killer Egg may be following you ... & # 34 ;	1
I 'm still reading my way through this , but so far it 's all the typical Mark Twain we love . Smart , witty humor with good life lessons .	1
A DANCE IN THE DARK is a touching novella of the transformative and redemptive ability of love when we allow ourselves to look beyond outward appearances.I was immediately drawn in from the moment Louisa entered the cave . Like a moth to the flame Louisa and Douglas are drawn to each other despite numerous reasons against their friendship . Louisa is an extremely rich heiress who has inherited every unfortunate facial feature in her family . She believes she looks as much like a horse as is humanly possible . None of her suitors can see past the face to the person and beauty beneath ; to her honesty , fairness , intelligence , and compassion . They pursue only her fortune . It should n't still hurt but it does and keeps her separate from everything and everyone , an outcast.Douglas is voluntarily an outcast and hermit when Louisa stumbles upon him in the hidden cave . Douglas is also a vampire . Not the traditional blood sucking variety either . Really interesting and I 've only read a few like him . He can `` read '' Louisa 's thoughts and know her inner self . All her beautiful qualities are revealed to and cherished by him for their rarity . For her part Douglas is always hidden in shadow so Louisa knows nothing of his looks , only what he reveals through actions and words . Together Louisa and Douglas discover friendship that blossoms to more even as Douglas tries to shove her away.The difference between how we see ourselves and how we look to another when viewed through the eyes of love is the center of this wonderful story . Truly romantic and well worth reading.I received this story from the author in exchange for my honest opinion .	1
One person is a rich socialite who considers herself ugly and apparently everyone elsedoes too except for her grandfather ; the other is a mysterious hermit who lives in acave that she stumbles upon one day . As they continue to visit each other , they slowlyget to know about themselves . Until one day he makes her forgetr . . .will they meet again ? Interesting read !	1
I loved this story . Indeed , once I started it , I did n't want to put it down . It was a charming , romantic retelling of the Beauty and The Beast story set in Regency England . Louisa , an heiress , was an ugly duckling who wanted someone to care for her , not her fortune . Her parents had passed and she was living with her grandfather who wanted her to be married . Douglas , a vampire with a conscience , was a loner in the extreme . He was living in a cave with no interaction with others besides what he physically needed to survive . He had his own inner demons to fight as he was guilt-ridden from an incident early in his life . The day Louisa stumbled upon Douglas ' cave was a life-changing event for both of them . Karen skillfully used their interplay of words to develop their relationship . There were a few other characters and scenes interspersed in the story but most of the story took place in the cave . I enjoyed this book very much . I was very happy with the ending and actually came away from the book feeling as if I 'd learned a valuable lesson from it . Bottomline : This is a feel good book that I 'd highly recommend to anyone who loves romance and/or adult fairy tales .	1
OMG ! This has to be one of the hottest M/M books I have read in a while . This story captivated me to the point that I finished it in less than two hours . I put everything else on hold to finish it up . I love the characters , the plot and the sex scenes ! That bathroom scene ! Oh my ! I am still fanning myself ! This book has definitely made me a Lena Matthews fan ! You simply must read this book !	1
You Can Leave Your Hat On is what the title promised , a naughty little novella on a stripper and his lover . The starting point of the story is one I already see in the past , a young and handsome College TA , Harlan , who has the hots for his even more handsome , a slightly older , College professor , Sawyer . The book respects the rules of a May / December romance plus the College setting with an Office Affairs theme ... the shorten the thing , this is the classical romance by the rule , with the twist of being a gay romance . So I would say that it can appeal both to the old fan of the gay romance than to a newbie who wants to try her hand on the genre.Being Sawyer older and also Harlan 's superior , he has all the trouble of the case : he ca n't take advantage of his position , he does n't want to be involved with a younger man who can have everyone he wants , and plus there is also a little problem of appropriateness ... Harlan to make the ends meet has a side job as a stripper in the local gay club , and Sawyer saw him at his workplace . So the point if Sawyer is gay is no more a question , but now there is the biggest problem that , even if Sawyer manages to move on the fact to have a relationship with a student , the fact that said student is a stripper is a big NO for the career of a college professor.And so Sawyer did n't make a move on Harlan , stopped to go to that club , and forced himself to have a strictly professional relationship with the boy . Only that Harlan is not of the same idea , and as soon as he reaches his graduation day , he is also ready , willing and naked for the professor to take . Harlan has all the cockiness of his young age , he is really convinced that Sawyer is avoiding him only since they have a professional relationship to preserve , and he thinks that , as soon as that problem is over , Sawyer will be all his to take . In a way I like how daring and careless Harlan is , but this only proves that he is really young.Being Harlan one of his students , it 's not the only problem for Sawyer ; there is also the question of his side job , as a stripper , that is not exactly a good visiting card to prove his willingness to commit and being exclusive ; and then even if Harlan wants a real relationship , it 's not said that Sawyer wants the same thing : he is arrived at an age where or you start to think seriously to commit , or you run at the minimum hint that there is a chance to be shackled ... There is quite a controversy inside Sawyer , he is jealous of Harlan , mainly due to his job , but he is also skittish when it 's time to commit and give something real to Harlan . Where Harlan is open and maybe careless , at least he has his mind clear and he knows what he wants ... for all the years Sawyer has more than Harlan , he has not yet reached that level of maturity.Anyway this is a novella , mostly and erotic novella , with a lot of sex scenes , hot and nice , and all in all it spans only two days in the life of our characters , so there is not enough time to develop a lot , but I have the idea that the author has something more in mind , since she introduced some supporting characters ( Harlan 's brother , Rhys , and Sawyer 's friend , Macon ) that have too much deepness to be only a passing spectator .	1
Lena Matthews is fast becoming one of my favorite authors and she brings her A game and then some with 'You Can Leave Your Hat On ' . This is my first male erotica by her and I was not disappointed . This book is scorchingly intense from the word go . If your pulse is n't racing at the end of Chapter 1 , you may want to check that you actually have one . Harlan , having exhausted all avenues to get his professor , Sawyer , to see him as anything but a student , sends him a sexy home video the very night he graduates . Sawyer , having denied his feelings for years , finally admits defeat but has no interest in submitting quietly . He 's determined to show Harlan that the quiet , even keeled professor that Harlan has come to know is anything but laid back in the bedroom . Keep a cold drink closeby because you will need it . Once they give into their desires , the loving is hot and heavy . But in between the fiery sex scenes are two people overcoming societal labels ( professor/student ) and making missteps as they navigate their new relationship . Harlan 's job as an exotic dancer adds fuel to the fire and a whole different element to their relationship . This book is pretty much flawless , IMO . Be warned that there are some dom/sub elements here , but nothing too heavy . Definitely one I will read again and again and again .	1
It 's Star Wars so of course you should read it , cause its Star Wars , and only Trekkies do n't like Star Wars .	1
I love the Sith stories and the Old Republic stories . It 's cool too see another side of the Star Wars story . It 's always about the selfish Jedi . Now we get a nice entrance into the world of the Sith . How do the Sith react to different situations that they are faced with ? This short story tells us what happens . Starting # 2 now . Oh , and for free you ca n't complain . Good sci-fi/space opera story either way .	1
After reading the entire Star Wars : Legacy of the Force series I decided that I would commit to the next one , the Fate of the Jedi . In the second book in the series ( Omen ) we are introduced to a new Sith culture , one that has been accidentally seperated from the rest of the galaxy for the last 5000 years . This is very different from the `` There can only be Two '' Sith culture , which makes sense since they missed the whole rise of Darth Bane , the Sith Lord that founded the rule of two.This short story , The Lost Tribe of the Sith : Precipice , is the back story on how the Sith ended up on the planet Kesh . Set 5000 years before time of The Fate of the Jedi we are introduced to a galaxy full of Sith . If you plan of reading TFOTJ : Omen , this will give you insight into some of the most interesting and complex villians to inhabit the Star Wars expanded universe in some time . I am guessing there will be several short books in this series , each timed to gather interest in the Fate of the Jedi stories . Far from being just a publicity vehicle I found the story intriging and engaging . It adds to the legend of some of the baddest guys in the galaxy , the Sith . I look forward to the next stories in this clever series.Omen ( Star Wars : Fate of the Jedi , Book 2 )	1
A Sith ship crashes and the kindly sweet Sith emerge to teach the locals how to get along in peace and kindness . Actually , the Sith are nice at first.This `` Lost Tribe of the Sith '' episode gives a nice view of how the Sith under Naga Sadow thought and acted . It is also interesting in that it details some of the interplay between the human and Sith races . Overall , this is the tale of arrival and setting up to take control of a new planet .	1
Lily and the Sheriff . Just what is going on ? . Hard life for a woman , certainly gets you thinking - What is the temptation ?	1
`` If you are pregnant do n't read this . `` I adored Jake who has spent his entire life on Bear Creek Ranch and is now running it . Did I like Lilly ? Not so much . Jake and Lilly had had a relationship which included sex , but after a while Jake broke if off in order to protect his three daughters who lived with his ex wife . Lilly found herself pregnant and having given birth to two stillborn babies and one severely handicapped one who also died , feared this child would be born having the same problems began to turn into a depressing drama queen.Do n't get me wrong it is a wonderful book with a great message by a talented writer I just discovered , and I loved reading it . Just like I said ... if you are pregnant pick another story .	1
This was a nice read . The characters were very believable and the story line kept me turning the pages . I liked that this book not only had romance , but humour as well , and that the characters were n't afraid to question their thoughts and actions .	1
I totally enjoyed this story ! I get a little frustrated with all the comments about editing during reviews , maybe we should start critiquing the art work on the cover next . The reason I read reviews is to see if the novel will be interesting to read . We are all very fortunate these days to have the excitement of e-books and indie authors . This means that we get the freshness of new authors , some of them so determined to get their story out that they will type it out on a phone . That is just so cool to me . Big deal , there are a few typos , a few misspelled words , ( probably from auto editing , which I love to hate ) but the main thing is the STORY ! This is a good one , I would probably give this book 5 stars , except it reviewed for 3 when I read it , and the next book in this trilogy is rated a 4.5 , the third a 5 , I want to have some where to go . Times like these I wish there were 10 stars to review with.The story was fantastic , the characters were great , and the plot was very creative . This is a really enjoyable book . I do n't really get why some people rated it so low . What is not to like ? The main character is a nice likeable guy , and the rest of his crew are good people too . The bad guys , well some are truely bad , there are some not as bad , bad guys too . The plot can seem pretty simple at first , but like all good books , the plot swells & grows as time passes . I would feel that any zombie lover would be missing out if they did n't read this book , I am so excited about the next 2 that I already bought them both.Read this book , you will absolutely be glad you did !	1
At first I did n't like these super zombies and was annoyed that they could talk and stuff . The story grew on me and left me anxious to start reading the next book .	1
THIS IS AN EDGE OF YOUR SEAT JOY RIDE THROUGH zombie land ! Will be buying the rest of these books soon ! Hope the superior of Og is as interesting as it sounds .	1
To say this is a different twist on Zombies . I am a huge Zombie fan and always have been . I keep my mind open on a subject that tends to have some strict rules for some people . Some of this I liked but I am still having a hard time wrapping my ind around the concept of Zombies with different levels of power and intelligence . I did enjoy the story but am not sure that I would classify it as Zombies because it does stray to far at times outside the rules . The main characters are likeable and I found myself rooting for MAx .	1
This book was a little hard for me to get into but once I did and finished it , I immediately went on-line to the kindle store and bought the second one . The beginning is a little slow and it seems like it is going to be a normal crack the head zombie book but it is all that and more . There is a plan by the people that started the zombie outbreak and there are many twists and turns in the book . Buy this one and you will not be disappointed .	1
I was n't so sure that I would like this book at all , with the smart , talking zombies , but I 'm hooked ! What a fabulous find ! Now I ca n't wait to read the rest of the series ! A Definite Must for Any zombie lover ! ! ! !	1
The blurb for this series says ... '' The ` Zombie Chronicles ' universe , where the zombies do n't stay mindless , shambling adversaries . Instead they grow smarter , faster and stronger as they feed on the flesh of the living . `` ... and to that statement I would add , `` And where zombie-fighting humans begin to suspect that they , too , are changing as they struggle to survive in this bleak world . `` Author Mark Clodi distinguished The Zombie Chronicles by coming up with the very novel idea that Romero-type zombies could learn and grow as they feed . The human survivors in the Zombie Chronicles world therefore have to content with both types of zombies as they try to survive.The first three Zombie Chronicles books center upon Max , his best friend Bill , a cop Jane Steward , and a great supporting cast of minor characters -- both human and zombie . Interesting questions are raised : Can a thinking zombie still care about humanity ? Could zombie and human work together to overcome the common evil ? What qualifies as humanity ? There are some grammatical mistakes in the series , particularly in the first book , but for me those faded in significance as I was caught up in the unique `` smart zombies '' premise , the multidimensional characters ( it was particularly interesting to see the world through the eyes of the smart zombies ) , and the action as Max and friends try to stay alive.In book one , Outbreak , Max meets his first zombie at the office , and fights his way home to his family .	1
Good plot . Strong characters.A natural flow to the story that made it hard to put down . Read it in a day .	1
Thinking , fast moving and nearly indestructible zombies made for pretty fierce opponents and can not wait to read the second installment !	1
I would definitely recommend , it is fast paced and I love that the zombies have intelligence . This is new to me in zombie book as . I have found another author and series of books I must read .	1
I 'm an absolute fan of zombie books , this one however seemed to take me a longtime to finish , hopefully the second in the `` Max '' trilogy will be a faster read .	1
This book had my full attention wrapped around it ... i read it till the very last page ... this is a number best seller in my eyes ... kn a scale of 1 to 10 i would have to say ... it is a 1 million on the scale ...	1
I really enjoyed this story with the unique concept , twists , and turns ! I found the lack of abbreviations to make the reading a little too proper -- if that 's possible , however , it did not detract from my enjoyment of the story ! Reading the authors notes at the end explained that and I still recommend this book !	1
Very well done Zombie Fiction with a neat twist . If you like post apocalyptic or zombie novels look no further this is a keeper . I read a lot of books and this one delivers a very good read . Well written and very well edited , not something you can often say about kindle books . Enjoy , Thanks for the great read Mark I look forward to reading the others .	1
We should all be familiar with alternate worlds - most fiction movies or literary works that describe the present or the near future are worlds that deviate from our own in small , subtle ways - for example , the movie itself and the actors playing the parts do not exist there - or may be significant variations to what we think our world is supposed to be like - think Indiana Jones and his magical artifacts.I wish I could hint at the plot of the story and then state that I will not spoil it but a story this short does n't have much of a plot . There 's a war most of us heard of and a few minutes in the miserable life of one , anonymous actor , or warrior . The charming part , and this is what earns the story its stars is the easy , smooth , almost imperceptible transition from what appears in the beginning to be 'historical fiction ' to what turns out to be something completely different.I stated in my review that this is only a teaser not because I know for a fact that it is but because I ca n't see any other reason why the story would be written . `` In the Trenches '' could stands its own in the pages of Analog or , better , the `` Fantasy and Science Fiction '' magazine but , even there , the readers would be unhappy if they learned that this was n't the precursor of some large , expansive series of works mapping that strange universe for our wonderment and reading pleasure.Based on the teaser , I 'd buy the 'big book ' if and when it comes out .	1
Trench warfare , World War I , mage 's , dragons , zombies , and cruel death ; they blend together in an odd short story ; that is , oddly , engaging.Certainly , not what I expected , the story opens with incredibly well built imagery of trench warfare . Tension is well built . The impending doom of a battle is clear in the language . The author does a comendable job of creating the rules for the ensuing battle.There is an inflection point where the mages are introduced , the story goes south for a number of paragraphs . The word mage is repeated a lot . The repitition is abrupt compared to the introductory paragraphs where the author chose words very carefully with little repetition . More fantasy words are used and then it becomes clearer , this is real battle combined with a fantasy land battle . Although I hesitate to say fantasy , because this could also be viewed as how Marten copes with the horror around him ; although not real , he sees the mages , zombies , and dragons as if they are real.Fortunately the story recovers very nicely and flows into a comprehensible and vivid description of the battle . Once the author settles into the type of phrasing from the early paragraphs , the story regains its power.This is an interesting blending of styles , historical and fantasy . Aside from the transition point , a very well written , visual account that is an engaging read .	1
It was an interesting read , it was written by his sister and I really liked her impressions and feelings you can feel they were close-nit family . It is so captivating to read about the early church days and the struggles , and hardships they were able to overcome .	1
Was worth reading . Fast paced , easy to follow . Will read more of this authors works . Enjoyed the book . Cheap too .	1
THIS IS A VERY GOOD READ , GOOD PLOT , KEPT ME INTERESTED TO THE END . ONLY PROBLEM I HAD WAS THE ANT HILL PART , NOT TOO PLAUSIBLE . OTHERWISE , I WAS ENTERTAINED RATHER ECONOMICALLY .	1
Never underestimate the mind of an unrehabilitated criminal ; especially one who is planning his next violent crime , while completing his latest jail sentence . Simply put , his final lesson in life was his final crime . Thanks to Amazon , I was able to purchase this book , along with about 50 others so far , at reasonable costs , at my own convenience , and have not been without reading material since I received the Kindle .	1
I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a suspense filled mystery that keeps you interested from start to finish . My favourite books are ones that keep me so engrossed I want to know more about the characters on the last page of the book and this was certainly one of those !	1
I liked the story line but the editing was bad . In fact so many of the books I have read on my kindle lack editing good or bad . Good relationship story as well . I recommend it to everyone who likes to read .	1
This story is very sensuous , there is food , flowers and romantic obsession . She was raised to be his wife . He did n't want her , and as a result all doors closed to her . She chose perhaps the most difficult path out of her predicament , but she is never entirely free of the beginning of her story -- until she finally is forced to face it . Good sci-fi , good writing , loved the ending .	1
I have been going through another bout of Kate & Curran withdrawals lately . Really , they 're simply Ilona Andrews withdrawals because I just am ten different ways in love with the way they write a world . I know going in to expect to be amazed , delighted , and -- above all and thank the high heavens -- entertained . Whether its shapeshifters and magic waves , overlapping dimensions and backwoods feuds , or futuristic assassins and genetically enhanced mafiosi -- it is guaranteed to get my bibliophilic heart pumping and I ca n't tell you how much I look forward to each encounter . This is a good year because we get two full-length novels in two excellent worlds and , having already downedMagic Bleeds , I found myself looking ahead longingly to September and the release ofBayou Moon . And then it occurred to me that I 'd never gotten around to reading SILENT BLADE , the novella published last year from Samhain . I 'm not sure how it slipped past me , but I immediately purchased it , downloaded it to my nook , and dropped offline for the evening.Meli Galdes is ready for retirement . Having served her family for more than a decade as a lone assassin , she 's planning on hanging up her spurs and falling off the grid completely . Then her father calls in one more favor and it involves a man Meli thought she 'd never see again . Celino Carvanna is responsible for the life of danger and isolation Meli leads . Years ago their lives were intertwined and then , in the space of a heartbeat , the connection was severed and Celino went on to monumental success and power , while Meli walked away from everything and everyone she ever knew , shaping herself into an elite ( and secret ) weapon . Now , on the cusp of retirement , she 's asked to take on this one last job . For her family . One last hit to round out her career on a high and oh-so-satisfying note . Then she 'll be able to put it all behind her and see about creating another kind of life for herself . But it 's been a long time since she knew what made this ruthless businessman tick , an even longer time since she cared . Neither of them are who they once were . And so she sets about remembering every detail , pulling up every familiar quirk and distant memory , so that when she finally comes face to face with Celino once more , she will be ready . She wo n't hesitate . She 'll know just what to do . And , as is the case with all her targets , he wo n't even know what hit him.I do n't think I realized going in that this novella was science fiction . What a pleasant surprise that was ! Set in a futuristic society , in which a cadre of powerful families -- known as the Kinsmen -- rule a world built upon the basis of their particular biological enhancements , SILENT BLADE pelts out of the starting gate with gusto . Meli is established right of the bat as a woman who has honed her skills and is the best at what she does . She flies solo and completely under the radar and I loved her from page one . As her history becomes clearer , I found myself utterly on her side and very much in favor of her meting out whatever punishment necessary on the heartless Celino . What can I say ? I 'm always up for a vengeance quest , especially when the person on the hunt is so justified and awesome and , well , adept when it comes to the actual punishing . Then the point of view switched , and I was forced to walk a few paces in Celino 's shoes . And while I was still on Meli 's side , I admit it -- I was curious . Curious to see how he 'd react when all was revealed . Curious to see if Meli 's resolve went the distance . I loved the wild swirl of color and scent and taste running through this world . Meli loves each of these things and , while she 's voluntarily put them aside in the service of her family , there are hints of them here and there , even in the ascetic existence she embodies . This is romantic science fiction a la Linnea Sinclair and Ann Aguirre and , though it is a shorter work and wraps up nicely , I would happily read much larger and longer doses were they available . Meli is very much her own woman and I really think there 's plenty of fodder here for many more stories . Perhaps one day we 'll get them . In the meantime , if you 're an Andrews fan , I highly recommend SILENT BLADE . You wo n't be disappointed	1
I really enjoyed this story . I hope that the authors will continue to build this interesting world in future books .	1
After I read the kat Daniels books I decide to read all they wrote . I never got into the edge series but found what I was looking for in this book	1
I recently discovered this author because of an anthology with three other authors and really enjoyed her dark , gritty voice so before purchasing any full lengths I wanted to try out another novella . I was not disappointed ! Meli Galdes is ready to retire from her position as an assassin for her family , but they want her to do one more job : kill the man who broke her heart and ruined her life , forcing her into excise ( basically she was publicly considered a leper to her family though she did their dirty work ) . Celino Carvanna broke Meli 's heart when she was young in a callous way , but that 's not what destroyed Meli . She could forgive his youth . He took away her freedom with his actions and even though he had n't realized what he 'd done in that aspect ( ca n't say what without giving away spoilers ) she still wanted him to pay for what he 'd done , though not in the way her family wanted so she could truly be free of him.Both Meli and Celino are products of a harsh society and I like that their actions and decisions were n't glossed over . Meli was an assassin but she had a moral code and a soft side . And while Celino was a brutal businessman and an all out dangerous man , he was very tender with her . This was a very emotional story and the ending was n't immediately wrapped up with a neat bow which I liked . They had to work for their happy ending . For such a short story , this author packed an incredible emotional punch so even though the ending was a little abrupt , it whet my appetite for more from this interesting world .	1
I haven ` t read much sci-fi , but I know I want to read more after having smiled my way through this short , but very interesting story . The story was set in an intriguing world and I loved how it was told . The emotions of the hero and heroine weren ` t overdone but told in a rather dry language that fit them - and the world they live in - perfectly.I must admit that I immediately bought the second book in this series and hope it ` s as good as the first one : - )	1
I enjoyed this book so much that I read it in a single setting . The book was so hot it made you consider making that late night phone call or waking up the husband . Read this book and tell your friends too .	1
This second book in the series was just as good as the first , with great characters and interesting story.This book cleverly overlaps in time with the first book , Secret Desires , showing the same scenes but with a different perspective . This is the story of Gregory and Ryland who have known they are destined to be mates and have known since they first met years ago . Gregory has been waiting for Ryland to 'grow up ' and now that he is over eighteen , Ryland ca n't understand why Gregory wo n't claim him.When they finally get together after some initial misunderstandings , it is hot and sizzling . The relationship starts with a bang and from that time forward the two men are all over each . Ryland is totally inexperienced and has been pining over Gregory and Gregory has n't had sex for 6 years so they are very passionate ! Once again not fully understanding the implications of the tri-omega causes problems and suddenly Ryland 's life is at risk . Luckily the third mate for the relationship is discovered . Viktor immediately recognises Ryland as he mate but Gregory 's prior claiming causes a few concerns but nothing Viktor and Gregory 's attraction to each other ca n't resolve . And luckily Leyland , Lucas and Jake are able to share some more insight into the whole tri-omega workings . `` You know , it would have been really nice if someone had explained all of this to us in the very beginning . Maybe you should think about publishing a f***ing how-to manual , '' Gregory yelled before slamming the phone down.Once again , this is a fun book with great characters and lots of humour . There are some minor editing problems including the odd changing of a minor characters name , noticed but easily overlooked .	1
From the moment he met him , Gregory knew Ryland was his mate , but when they met Ryland was much to young to claim . Six years later Gregory finally makes Ryland his only to learn he may lose him . To Gregory , Ryland has always been special , but he discovers what sets Ryland apart from the other wolves in their pack may be the very same thing that kills him.Ryland did n't understand all of the ramifications of being a tri-omega , all he knew was that he loved Gregory and wanted nothing more than to have Gregory claim him . Being claimed by Gregory was everything Ryland dreamed it to be , but his dream may come to an end when he and Gregory discover that their happily ever after depends on someone they never met.Forbidden Desires was a good follow up book in the Tri-Omega Mates series . I loved Ryland from the previous book and adored him even more in Forbidden Desires . I was n't crazy about some of the secondary characters but Ryland , Gregory and Viktor , the man who completed their relationship , made Forbidden Desires a very enjoyable read.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
Well , if you like reading about erotic threesome encounters with two hunks than this is the book for you . Most of it was not practical being the ladies first encounter but it is short and sweet . I would have liked to pay less to read it but what else is there to do on a rainy afternoon . I would have liked a much longer book with more of a story line with the erotosism sprinkled throughout instead of on every page . I may look into the rest of the series to see if it all ties in . Enjoy .	1
I really enjoyed reading the first book in the Badlands Series about Logan , Derick , Miranda , Clyde & Clarissa all of them are looking forward to meeting there mail-order bride and or there new husbands . The story starts out with Logan & Derrick waiting at the train station for their mail-order bride that they specifically picked named Miranda , now this is the seventh day and she still has n't shown and neither one wants to go back to their ranch without her . Finally after about two hours of waiting the train whistle can be heard , the guys are anxiously awaiting when the train pulls up and several people get off and leave but no Miranda . So when the conductor gets off they ask him and he says , & # 34 ; I do n't know , but I 'm in a hurry to fetch the sheriff because at the last bridge a young woman jumped off the train , while we were moving very fast . According to a young woman behind the conductor it was in fact Miranda who jumped . Just great now what are we supposed to do , we do n't have a wife now ! Clarissa felt bad for these two guys they were both very good looking but very different , one was dark haired and one was light haired she hoped her intended was as good looking as these two . While she was deep in thought the lawyer Jasper who brought her out for Clyde came around the bend , and said I 'm sorry Clarissa your intended could n't wait for you and he got married a couple of days ago , & # 34 ; What am I supposed to do now & # 34 ; I have no money and I ca n't go back to New York . Logan piped up , hey we do n't have a bride either how about you spend the day with us and see if you would like to marry me . Jasper got all indignant and said & # 34 ; no you do n't want to get involved with these two they are looking for something different & # 34 ; , Derick said be quite Jasper let the lady decide . In the mean time Derick moved in close to Clarissa and said if you marry Logan you get me as your husband as well , she looked up shocked , but thought about it and said okay I 'll spend the day with you . So as they started to walk away , she said okay I 'll marry you , so they stopped at the church and Logan married Clarissa and she became Mrs. Granger . Read this book because you will laugh , cry and cum a whole lot . It takes a lot for a person to give up everything and get on a train and travel for several days or weeks to the middle of know where and marry somebody sight unseen . I 'm looking forward to reading the next two books in this series .	1
Clarissa Barnes is heading to the badlands of South Dakota to meet with the husband she was contracted to marry , while still in Boston . But , as her luck has run recently not only is the train late , her seatmate had jumped off the train and killed herself , but she is greeted with the news that her promised spouse has married another . The only thing that might save her is that the two men , yes two , that were there to meet the suicide victim might just offer her the same deal as the dead woman . If she wants it that is.Can Clarissa take on the role as the `` special '' bride or will she think what Logan and Derek are offering is too scandalous for her ? Ms . Saint James puts an interesting twist on a well known plot line , the mail order bride . I found this twist as well as the interactions with the characters to make for a fun and fast read . I am interested in seeing where this series heads , and hope to see more of Clarissa and her men in the future . I enjoyed Mail Order Bride for Two and look forward to more from Ms. Saint James.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I actually thought the character was looking for a bad guy . I was surely wrong . This was a cute miss guided love story . I would recommend to a more mature audience considering the love scenes . The characters were very well described . I could picture the scenes perfectly . This was a great book .	1
I really like reading Stephanie Bond ! There is n't a book of hers that I 've read that I have n't thoroughly enjoyed . This bookkeeper you guessing ! Enjoy .	1
As ususal James Somers does it again . All of his stories are so good and I love the characters . Just as I get to know them , there are no more books . This is saga 1 and do you think there is a saga 2 , no . I 'm waiting .	1
I 'm new to this series having read only the first two books but I have loved them enough to purchase the complete series . They are short , easy to read and very enjoyable .	1
Pros - I really love the interaction among Cullen 's family , and I adore mom . What a feisty bird she is ! Cons - In Plain Sight was really just related toRachel 's Totem . It happens to be set in the same town with characters being connected in only the smallest sense . They do n't really tie in well together until you get to the next book in the series , Foxy Lady , when we see Cullen working alongside the catamount clan .	1
I grew up with the old western stories . Had never read this and am glad I did . Told through the eyes of one of the original old timers that made the West famous . Did n't seem to have a lot of fluff . it was just written like he may have been telling to you . Really enjoyed this .	1
Most of the time when I come across a book like this , I 'm extremely wary of there being a `` cheesyness '' factor that will turn me off of the story . But this novel did n't do that for me ! Read the rest of this review here : [ ... . ]	1
It started out really good and kept my inerest but sometime during the mid to end it ended up losing its luster somewhat ... I think it had to do with the killers because it was too predictable and wouldhaveliked more of a surprise . But overall a pretty fun read and I would recommend this for anyone looking to read something fast paced for a bit of entertainment .	1
Proofreading issues aside . Bob Moats ' Classmates Murder draws you in with interesting characters who are believable and likeable . His stories are romantic and compelling without the `` lust and thrust '' and foul language so often forced on the reader by many authors . I did not intend to get caught up in this series , but by the end of Classmate 's Murders I was curious how the characters would continue to develop . I eagerly looked forward to each book in the series and watching the author ripen with each new book . I think I see a Best Selling Author in the making !	1
Enjoyed the friendship between Jim and Buck . The romance between Jim and Pennie was also nice to see . Once I started reading this book I did not want to put it down . I will read more by this author .	1
Meaning I read it from start to finish , you guessed it , in one sitting . It does n't happen very often . The storyline has to be really good . The characters have to be really engaging , or even lovable . I ca n't be able to figure everything out , at least til near the end . And almost as important as the rest , I need to get a laugh out of it once in a while . This book fit all those criteria in spades.Jim Richards , our good guy , is sarcastic and smart , about some stuff . The rest of the cast of characters range from the scruffy to to the TV personality . The narrative style speeds the story along with enough plot twists to keep you guessing . In other words , I really loved this book !	1
I really liked this book ! I found it funny and entertaining . It was hard to put down . A real mix of unique characters . Thank you for a wonderful read and looking forward to more from this Author . Making my purchase soon !	1
Nice pace , story moves well . Some unexpected twists keep it interesting . Echos of Robert B. Parker with a slightly bumbling hero .	1
IT takes moxy , gumption , and a bit of thrill for black and whites to really appreciate the characters and their nuances . Not so overly written or stuck in prose . Humor slices the book apart in witty ways that makes me wish the characters were people I knew . So well written that upon finishing it I just bought the next book ! !	1
Classmate Murders Bob Moats Kindle Edition . I was drawn to the book by the fact that it was women of the class of 67 being murdered . WHAT ? That 's my class ! I enjoyed the read .	1
I can tell this book was Bob Moats ' first book . The writing style is a little transparent . But I sincerely enjoyed the plot and the colorful characters ! I bought the next two books in this `` Murder '' series because they were affordable and I liked the first story .	1
I really enjoyed this book . It was different than most I 've read . It actually used older cha r caters which just made the book great . The humor in it made me laugh .	1

First off , I would like to point out that there are a lot of things to love about this book . Although the premise has been visited by other authors in some shape or form previously , I felt this author did a good job of twisting his own tale when he wrote this book . I liked the main character well enough and could understand early in the story where the author was going , without being able to guess the ending . I never felt during reading this book like I was lost or that the book stopped making sense . I did wish to see a little more vibrant descriptions at times , which I thought would have taken the book from ordinary to extraordinary.I found this author had a unique storytelling ability and I was curious enough to see where he was headed with this book , so I managed to finish it up quickly and I was satisfied with the ending . I was impressed that the end of this book did n't feel rushed or too abrupt , as I hate when that happens.What made me decide to leave this book a four star rather than a five , was the errors . There are a lot of them and some of them are truly egregious . These are all things that a good proofreader could have caught before this book was published . The author used the wrong form of a word for example `` The sound of footfalls scrapping across the cavern floor '' or missed a word completely making me go back and read the sentence again and again until it made sense , or used the wrong verb tense . If these issues were fixed , I think with a couple of minor rewrites , this book might deserve a full five stars . As it was , it was a unique and entertaining read that needed a bit of polishing . ****Further comments and adjustment of stars****After speaking with this very pleasant author , I have discovered that the version I downloaded a while back has since been edited again , removing the errors that were previously stated in my original review . I would like to now give this book the other star it deserves . I love when an author is concerned enough about the quality of their work that they will actively try to improve it once the book has already been published . Great book worthy of a read .	1
The author has a great imagination . He takes zombies in a whole different direction to a destination I have n't figured out yet but am anxious to find . Worth the read .	1
The best thing about this series is the fact that it could be neverending : ) There are always more stories to tell when it involves surviving the Zombie Apocalypse .	1
OMG this book was so amazing . Not much of a warewolf fan , but this one changed my mind ! Loved it so much , wish to read more of Taran and Lark . This book was so worth my time , short but amazing ! Wish if there was a series that it would be of these two love birds .	1
4 starsI really enjoyed this story . I liked Lark and Taran and was happy when they worked out their issues and got together . The story was short but it did n't feel as short as I know it was . I did n't feel like anything was missing or it was rushed , the author did a very good job with it . I 've read the series before and really enjoyed all 3 books but it 's been a while so I felt the need for a reread.Lark is a court reporter and is sweet but also has a bit of a sarcastic mouth at times . She 's also in love with her cousin , Taran . Now do n't get all freaked ... there 's no blood relation and they were n't raised together or anything . But he 's always been like a big brother to her and he also happens to be a werewolf ( which are publicly known in this & # 34 ; world & # 34 ; along with the Fae ) . Since he 's never shown any interest in her as anything more than an annoying little sister/cousin type person , she 's gone on with her life and tried to live it but she ca n't help but long for him . She never expected his true feelings were much different than what he showed her.Taran is an alpha werewolf ( but not the Alpha of the local pack , more of a lower ranked alpha within the pack ) and a police officer with a shifter task force . He 's a good guy and I liked his character . Since Lark grew to maturity , Taran 's been attracted to her more than her felt he should be and when he realized she was his destined mate 3 years before , his life went to hell . Taran is convinced that Lark sees him as nothing but an annoying older brother type and would n't welcome any advances from him . He 's also sure their family would freak even though they 're not blood relation so he 's kept his feelings secret and suffered with being so close but yet so far from his mate.Lark and Taran get thrown together in a traumatic way when Lark is almost kidnapped by some werewolves that are stealing women to sell in to sexual slavery . Taran saves her but that does n't end the issue . When she goes home , Taran stakes out her place to watch over her and is barely able to stop another attack on her . He then has to take her home with him to ensure she stays safe . Things go smoothly for a few days , with Tarn mostly avoiding Lark , but eventually things come to a head and they both recognize the attraction between them and engage in a night ( and morning ) of hot sex . Taran does n't tell Lark right away that she 's his mate though and when she finds out he held that back , she 's upset and ends up leaving and staying with a friend until she can think things out . Taran , regardless of the fact he thinks she 's rejecting him outright , makes sure she 's guarded at her friend 's house to prevent any further attacks on her.While things are no going well with Lark , Taran works on making progress on his case trying to get the person responsible for the kidnapping of the women . He makes some progress but not much . He does break down and call Lark ( leaving her a great voicemail ) which helps the situation greatly and she calls him back ( also leaving a voicemail but at least they 're talking ) . Around this time , one of his leads for the case bottoms out in a way that indicates he 's got a leak somewhere . He figures out who it most likely is but it also ends up this person is in a position to harm Lark . This leads to some stress and drama but Lark and Taran come through alright in the end ( although the main bad guy is n't caught and this case comes back in to the series in book # 3 ) . Lark and Taran end the story with some more hot sex and the start to a good HEA.I really liked this story . The characters are n't perfect but they 're pretty good and likable . I thought the story was well written , not feeling as short as it actually was . I 'm looking forward to the next book in the series . I 'd recommend this book . Thumbs up ! : )	1
A nice read , well written story . Good character development and plot . Nice combination of mystery , love and erotica ; a nicely balanced story . Would love to see a follow-up/series development , continuing on with a story on the head Alpha .	1
Book 1 of `` Serengeti Shifters '' . Followed by Book 2Serengeti Storm.Note `` Serengeti Heat '' appears inShifting Dreamsalong withThe Man of Her Dreamsby Robie Madison andKiss and Kinby Kinsey W. Holley.Plot : From the author : `` On the secluded Three Rocks Ranch somewhere in West Texas , a secretive community of lion-shifters walk the line between between animalism and humanity . Torn between instinct and logic , and constrained by the traditions of their pride , four dominant lions must claim their mates - without drawing the attention of the human world outside their borders . `` The book : Ava was the runt of the pride - always in the shadows , bullied by everyone . And she really , really needed to get laid . When new pride leader Landon finds her at a bar , he knows she 's special . Can he convince her she 's more to him than one orgasmic night ? Comments : - Contemporary paranormal ( shape shifters ) erotic romance.- 1718 kindle locations , 27,000 words ( but finishes around 1472 locations ) .- m/f - explicit , frequent , sometimes aggressive ( not gentle ) , fun.- `` Author 's Note : All of my books can be read independently , but characters from previous books make appearances in later books in each series . '' It is best to read the books in order.- Includes excerpts fromKiss and Kinby Kinsey W. Holley andThe Man of Her Dreamsby Robie Madison.- Note there is a free pdf available on the author 's website `` A Serengeti Christmas '' . It fits as Book 1.5 ( a prequel to `` Serengeti Storm '' ) .Opinion : A fun , erotic paranormal where being a shape shifting lion is an important character attribute rather than an addendum so you can fit in the genre . Lots of fun , very lusty , and a good short read . A good start to a series , but can also be comfortably stand alone . Well worth it.4.5 stars rounded down . I particularly enjoy that Ava is n't a classic Alpha female , the fact they are *lions* is important and relevant to the plot , and the sex is *fun*.-CR-	1
Ava Minor may be the runt of the pride and the consummate good girl but that is about to change . She has decided that she is no longer going to toe the line . No matter what the big brothers say , or her attraction to the new pack alpha . She knows she could never be the alphas mate as she is so small , so she has decided to find a human lover.When she walks into the bar Landon , pack alpha , is stunned to see the little lioness there . He is further stunned to realize his attraction her is stronger than he thought . But with her brothers as some of his allies he is n't going to do anything with the lust . Until she takes matters into her own hands.Ava decides that one night with Landon is better than none . So she does something completely out of character , knowing that she will be back in her place in the pride after the night . But Landon just might be into shaking more than Ava 's world up.Fantastic shifter story ! Ms. Andrews pulled me in from the first page , and kept me throughout the emotional ups and down with Ava . I hope she has other stories in this series and look forward to reading them . I love to see the runt of the litter come out on top and in Serengeti Heat this is definitely the case . I recommend that if you like shifter books you need to pick Serengeti Heat.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
This is is a near perfect book , of the sexy kind.Lioness with self esteem problems , and a lion with progressive ideals for the pride , find each other and sparks fly.It 's a wonderful sexy tale . It has hot and steamy scenes . It has 2 good looking main characters . And , It 's written in an easy manner that does n't get in the way of the story . Oh , and did I mention the hot and steamy scenes ? They were definitely worth the price of the book.Sadly , It suffers from 1 slight problem . The characters felt a tad flat . They were well rounded enough for the purposes of the story but when you actually think about it they do n't have much depth to them . Mating is all that seems to matter to them . Not to mention that the male character does n't go through any growth , character-wise , in the story . But , as I said , because this story does n't actually need to go to those lengths to make it 's point , the characters are good enough.There was actually another thing that I had a problem with , but I 'm not sure if it 's just my lack of information/knowledge that makes me think it was a mistake . I was always under the impression that lionesses ruled the pride and males were just there for mating purposes . It is n't that they 're weaker or anything . It 's just that the females do all the actual hunting . At least that was how I thought the social structure of lions worked . I could be wrong ... 4 stars . Almost 5 stars if only there was a bit more character meat to this piece .	1
How far would you dare to go & # 8230 ; to win it all ? Maverick Holms and Duke Warren share almost everything & # 8212 ; a college soccer team , an apartment and the same extremely competitive nature . Thanks to that never-back-down spirit , they & # 8217 ; re about to share more than they bargained for.The game is & # 8220 ; gay chicken & # 8221 ; .	1
I learned that gay guys do n't smoke weed.Great read if you want some pow that is really waffy .	1
Great , quick read and was exactly what the description promised ... loved the imagination behind `` extreme gay chicken . '' As said , it was a short read so there was n't a ton of character development , but that did n't seem to take away from the book . The conflict Mav felt about Duke added to the hotness factor . There were some similarities to `` Hot Head '' ( which I loved ) , but overall , read like a different story .	1
Was a good love story , although did n't feel real or that it could be real . Would n't really recommend it to others but I did enjoy it .	1
Reviewed by Francesca & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogI stumbled across this book yesterday , blurb sounded interesting and I know UTC loves Evangeline Anderson so I gave it a go while I went to get a pedicure . Well ... . I can probably sum up my review in this one sentence : I devoured this book ! It 's short but for the few hours you get to read it there 's a lot of heavy breathing and your heart will definitely be through the roof . It was kind of funny that at certain times I was checking to make sure nobody around me was looking at my tablet screen . And then I could n't put it down and had to sneak a few lines while I was driving.Duke and Maverick are roommates . They are also in the soccer team together . They are best friends and throughout the four years they 've lived together they 've become really close . Except now they are about to get a whole lot closer.This story is told only from Mav 's point of view and he 's dealing with being attracted to Duke . Duke does n't make things easier as he is always being very close and physical and then there 's the games of gay chicken ... and extremely gay chicken . When they are coming up short to pay their last month of rent they end up posing for some se xy pictures for the Str8te Boys website . And things just escalate from there.This story was fun and sexy . It 's a story of discovery and of dealing with emotions and attraction . But they both went for it and I was extremely glad for that !	1
Maud has artist 's block . Will she ever paint a decent cow again ? The small town of Round Corners , Vermont , hopes so as she 's asked to do a mural.Different enough to be refreshing and keep me turning the pages .	1
I found this book to be a very enjoyable read . After the first chapter , it really takes off and keeps you entertained until the end . I enjoyed it so much that I immediately purchased the next two books in the series .	1
Fantastic story lots of suspense and horror throughout this book . Story about young boy witnessing the death of his parents . Raised up to be a master of combat and skills in masking himself and cloaking himself in darkness . He goes after the men that killed his family . This man Belgad is a powerful king of the city . The story has lots of suspense and horror and magic throughout this book . Will be reading more of this authors books , they are fast paced and very hard to stop reading .	1
Lucius ( Kron Darkbow ) , is out for justice against the wizard who killed his parents and the man who order the hit . Belgard , is a criminal who bought his knighthood in order to stay out of the Prisonlands .

Kron wants Belgard dead because of the evil tyrant that he is , but will he succeed and will his justice be anything other than revenge . This series is full of suspense and intrigue of how the characters fits well as dealings in what is going to happen to each of them and those around them . Keeps you wondering what will happen next . Great reading , has a little violence . Jo-Ann Doyle	1
This book is a great read -- better than I expected ( I had never read anything else by this author ) and I hope to read more . This is a great book if you enjoy epic fantasy and I am looking forward to reading the others.It 's hard to discuss it without giving away the plot ( I hate spoiler reviews ) but it was an enjoyable read.FYI -- I bought this book for a dollar on Kindle -- what a bargain for great entertainment .	1
This series is an enjoyable cozy mystery . The poor Kate gets herself into more trouble than she should be in . And her romance has needed help all along . Good read .	1
Sure this was written decades before I was born but the stories are no less terrifying for their age . Lovecraft is surely a step above contemporary horror writers in so many ways . The guy does not have to use a plethora of vulgar language , nauseating scenes of sexual violence , or even hundreds of pages to scare the senses out of the reader . Not all of his stories are entertaining but I dare say ninety-nine percent are . If you like your scares in bite-size pieces give this collection of Lovecraft 's stories a try .	1
Having been a devoted fan of Lovecraft all my life ( he 's my all-time favorite writer ) , I HAD to buy this book for the Kindle I just received today . It has almost all of his stories ... for only 1.99 ! That 's less than 200 pennies ! So far I only read From Beyond , one of my favorite stories of his . I found a few small typos , but that 's okay . Editors are not perfect ! Every book on the market has a least a couple of errors in them . I 'm still giving this 5 stars . It 's H.P . Lovecraft ! HIGHLY HIGHLY recommended if you 're an H.P . fan !	1
This was great , fun to read . Just the right length for relaxing but not getting to involved . Really enjoyed it .	1
I gave this book four stars in hopes that the rest of the series gets better . The book makes a good introduction piece but ended suddenly . The plot was typical and predicable with only one delightful twist and that was that the heroine was deaf . She did not know she was a wolf and accepted the & # 34 ; unbelievable & # 34 ; stuff way to readily . The couple had no obstacles to overcome , there were no struggles . It was love at first sight followed by lots of sex . This book would be good for a quick , short , steamy read if you were just trying to get excited . However , Arend does a good job at storytelling . I just felt that were was no & # 34 ; meat & # 34 ; to the story . I am going to try the next book with high hopes !	1
Satisfying romance . Reads more like a long short story or a novella than a true novel . The plot never rises above this couple and their attraction . The reason I 'm giving it 4 stars is that it does that well , regardless of where else the book could have gone.The two characters are likeable and attractive . The heat between then rises from the page . The few supporting characters and the dialogue between them all is just good enough to keep you smiling.This is a light read- candy-bar book , as I call it- but a good one . I felt it would have been nice if we had gotten to know our heroine as her own wolf , but the book never makes it that far . I imagine we 'll get a chance to in later books in the series though . She was just as strong a character as any of the men.Nicely done- just do n't go looking for any more than a bit of furry romance and some light comedy and you 'll really enjoy this .	1
First book I 've read from Vivian Arend and oh my , did she ever draw me in and hold me there ! I had n't planned on reading the entire book in one sitting but the way she captured my attention and held onto it was wonderful . I ca n't wait to read the next one !	1
Robyn Maxwell might be deaf but that does n't stop her from setting out to do everything she wants , even if it 's to escape the city for some backwoods quiet time in the Yukon by herself . Robyn soon realizes that that she 's not as alone as she thought though when she stumble naked from the cabin 's sauna and into the arms of a large male.Keil 's quiet retreat from the mountain of responsibilities he faces is interrupted when he scents his mate . With his upcoming challenge for pack Alpha his mate could n't have come at a worse time but there is no denying the instant instinct to claim coming from his wolf . What he did n't expect though was a mate who is deaf and has no clue about wolves or even that she is one of them , and who can not come into her wolf without sex with someone of their kind.A relaxing get-away suddenly turns chaotic as Robyn and Keil ride the passion of their wolves and learn the human side as well while introducing Robyn to a whole new world and fighting for position in it.Wolf Signs is a wonderful start to the Granite Lake Wolves series that I really enjoyed . Fun , sexy and exciting with a strong hero and an even stronger heroine I only wish the story was longer . Robyn was a fantastic character , well written , who easily rolled with the punches thrown her way . Keil is an alpha all the way with a big heart who only wants the best for his pack and his mate . And he 's uber hot . lol With a little bit of action thrown in to keep you on your toes , Wolf Signs was a pleasant read and I look forward to more from the series .	1
This book was really very enjoyable , I have downloaded another and hope that it is as entertaining as this one was .	1
I am so glad I purchased this . Robyn Maxwell is deaf but does n't let it stop her from doing the things she loves . When her brother has to cancel out his back country ski trip with her , she decides she can do it by herself.When she meets wilderness guide Keil , things start heating up . Now she has to deal with wolves , mates , and Alpha challenges.Robyn and Keil are absolutely precious together . I 'm glad I ignored the three stars , and purchased it anyway . The novel was a lovely surprise , and a pleasure to read .	1
For a free kindle book I thought this story was a great deal . I laughed out loud many times and enjoyed the characters a lot . There were lots of great secondary characters that I ca n't wait to read their stories too . My only complaint is that it was too short ! ! Thank goodness there are a couple more to this series to read and hopefully more to come in the future .	1
This book rocks ! Seriously . The great thing about shifters is how they know they 've found their mate . I love that premise . This one has the added twist of Robyn 's deafness and how it affects the mating . Keil is one hot and yummy alpha , and together they are just fantastic .	1
Stumbling onto this series was serendipitous , especially after seeing the price ! I 've often wondered if the price reflects the content quality , and after reading this book , I am happy to say I am wrong ! I enjoyed this interesting and fast read immensely ! It begins with our heroine , who happens to be deaf , going to the wilds of Alaska for a little cross country skiing . Upon her arrival to her destination , she encounters some interesting ( and handsome ) gentlemen who immediately sense something about her . Unfortunately , it 's something of which she is completely unaware . Enjoy !	1
A competent thriller that succeeds on most levels . It 's economically written , authoritative about newspaper newsrooms and statehouse journalism , and its characters are skillfully drawn ( if slightly cliched ; does every newsroom in fiction have an alcoholic burnout of a onetime star reporter on his last chance ? ) .The clockspring tension and suspense is well-developed , though the moralizing about the rapacious nature of news reportage goes a bit over the top . The reveal of the killer , which offers a clever twist on real Harrisburg history ( look up R. Budd Dwyer for a look at the true horror story than inspired `` Kill The Story '' ) , leads to a delicious doozy of a climactic scene.My only real complaint , as another reviewer here aptly pointed out , is that there is no way the reader could have guessed the identity of the killer before the big reveal . That made the reveal less of a powerhouse moment then it could have and should have been , and made the ponderous exercise of piecing together the connection between the murder victims to that point into an elaborate jerk-around at the readers ' expense.Also , as another reviewer pointed out , the text contained more typos and other careless errors than should ever have come from a self-respecting journalist ( which the author obviously was at one time ) . It just goes to show that every writer needs a strong copy editor.All in all , however , `` Kill The Story '' is a reasonably well-crafted thriller that largely delivers on its intriguing premise . I 'll definitely check out more of John Luciew 's work .	1
I love everything that I have read by this author . Other than a few editing issues this was a really good short story .	1
This is a beautiful short story about a cop who has fallen in love with his victim . The story is very short , humble and very passionate . I Love it .	1
i loved reading the book but it was so short but it was great and when the cop fell in love with the victim it was a good read	1
This was an enjoyable surprise and a very entertaining read . The story unfolded revealing little clues as we began to perhaps guess what may have caused Alexi 's disappearance . Some red herrings and suspicious characters made this a satisfying mystery as well as a fantasy . I enjoyed the fact that Miranda 's character as a normal middle aged woman trying to solve a very strange mystery was very believable . In general I found the book was unput-downable ! I started reading last night and unfortunately for the huge pile of washing that needs folding ... did n't put it down this morning until I had finished . Well worth the modest Kindle purchase price .	1
If you do n't care for a lot of swearing or big sex scenes this is a book you will enjoy . It is a mystery and it is a good journey to the end . I hope you enjoy it as much as I did .	1
From beginning to end this book is a joy to read . Full of mystery , mayhem , and a bit of magic for good measure . Perfect flow with excellent writing and editing . Loved it !	1
The opening scene was rather overwritten , but as I went on I got drawn in more and more deeply . Yes , I guessed the answer to the primary question nearly immediately , but I still went on because the bigger mystery was worth the journey .	1
This was a nice read.SPOILER ALERT ! I knew from the very beginning that the cat was the husband . Would have been nice to be a little surprised by this instead of knowing right away . Completely enjoyable otherwise .	1
A story to enchant , to keep you reading with bated breath while you race through the pages to find out what happens next . An amazingly rewarding fantasy novel.I hiope the author will write more along these lines - other work so far published does n't appeal to me	1
Cat 's Paw is so very well written . Taylor just draws the reader into the story -- like magic . on one level nothing seems to be happening . On another , so much . I highly recommend this book .	1
Cat 's Paw was one of those surprisingly happy finds one makes from time to time . Ms. Taylor put together a wonderful story that keeps you glued to the pages . This is an action/adventure book written from a feminine perspective , and is very well done . It is also more than action/adventure and really defies placing it in any particular genre . I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature .	1
Tuttle does an excellent job of creating a fantasy world and tweaking the archetypes of the different types of stock fantasy characters . Seeing the world evolve and develop during the course of his various books is a pleasure . This particular book is darker than the other Markhat stories , although it does retain the element of humor that is more prominent in the other Markhat stories . If you enjoy Terry Pratchett ( think Vimes and not Rincewind ) , then you will enjoy Tuttle 's books . But read them in order , especially if you have a Kindle since the stories are only $ 0.99 apiece ( I feel guilty - I want to at least take Tuttle out and buy him a couple of beers since I bought his entire library for only $ 8 ) .

This was an interesting look at what happened to Kaylee when she was committed after her first soul song . It 's a bit sad and I 'm wondering if this plays a part of the future books or not .	1
Meet Kaylee Cavanaugh who , after a weird episode where she ca n't stop the urge to screech , is sent to a mental hospital . There she will discover that the urge only comes when people near her are about to die . But what does this mean ? And how can Lydia ( fellow patient ) can calm her screech ? Kaylee does n't know , but what she does know is that she has to get out of there and soon.I think I like this whole idea of prequels for books . It gives you enough of a taste to decide if you want to read the series in question or not . My Soul to Lose definitely convinced me to read more . Kaylee is such a fun and strong character to read . And after this short story , I know that any adventure she has will have my undivided attention .	1
I know a lot of people said to read this after My Soul to Take , but I must read things in order if at all possible , so I read it first . And I 'm glad I did ! This was a great preview of the series , and it made me even more excited to get started on the first book . It 's like an awesome movie trailer getting you pumped up for the actual movie . I enjoyed getting to know the main character , Kaylee , a bit before diving into the series . And what better way to get to know someone than following them around the psych ward of a hospital !	1
This book has been written it such a way that it has me intrigued & eager to read the next one .	1
This is an amazing hook for the series , it is an extremely short Novella that leads you into book 1 . Right now Amazon Kindle even has a special where you can get this along with the first 2 books in the series at an amazing price . : ) We start off with Kaylee going to the mall with her best friend and then having a `` panic attack '' which happens when she sees shadows and knows someone near her is going to die . The `` attacks '' cause her to scream the loudest most insane horrifying scream imaginable . This lands her in a psych ward for teens.It ends with her being sent home to live her life and go back to school which is where book 1 starts . This is probably the best Novella intro for a series I 've ever read . I knew after reading this I wanted to read the series . Really good !	1
You can download this for FREE from AUDIBLE.COM guilt-free because it is a & # 34 ; sister & # 34 ; company of AMAZON.COM . If you do n't like it -- no loss !	1
This series is quite interesting ... i 've never read anyithing like it which I thought was pretty awesome . So Kaylee knows when someone is about to die , weird right ? Well it doesnt stop there . She feels this horrible grief wash over her and this urge to scream . Then the gray fog starts to invade everything.Thats what got her locked up in the mental hospital . The horrible scream she let out at the mall in the middle of Sears . But not only that , she really tried to stop herself from screaming , but she cant ! She only managed to give herself horrible scratches on her throat.So many unawswered questions ... especially about the girl Lydia who helped her.I cant wait to start the next book ... I just need to know !	1
My Soul to Lose the prequel short story is told through teenaged Kaylee Cavanaugh 's point of view.In it Kaylee discovers her unique power and the problems she faces afterwards as a result of it.The reader of this Amanda Ronconi does a good job in providing Kaylee 's voice and as a resultI want to listen to more of her audio book readings .	1
This wound up being a much quicker read then I anticipated . I thought it a novel , but it 's more of a short story to intro her Soul Screamers series . I read it in one sitting and very much enjoyed the read . I was very sympathetic to the protagonist within the first few pages and could n't tear myself away from the book as I wanted to know what happened next , and next , and next . Great hook for the series .	1
My Soul to Lose by Rachel Vincent , narrated by Amanda RonconiPrequel to the Soul Screamers series3.5 starsKaylee Cavanaugh was supposed to just have a normal day shopping at the mall , but a panic attack took over and she couldn & # 8217 ; t stop screaming . When she wakes up , she finds herself in a psych hospital . As she tries to convince everyone she is fine , another patient seems to be curious about who she is . My first audiobook ! I would say it was a success . I didn & # 8217 ; t love My Soul to Lose but I really enjoyed it . The narrator could be annoying at times , but she could make the story interesting when it came down to whether I was able to concentrate on the story . I did have a few problems with the narrator & # 8217 ; s voice and how she portrayed the characters . Sometimes I liked the voices she made , but her Kaylee voice annoyed me greatly at times . Which is obviously not a good thing considering the fact that Kaylee is the MC . I did enjoy the storyline and I was a fan of the first Soul Screamers book . I really liked seeing how Vincent portrayed Kaylee & # 8217 ; s first experience as a banshiede . Another qualm I had was with the other patient who was revealed to have an ability at the end . I liked this ability quite a bit and she proved to be an interesting character that showed potential to be in the series in the future or even have her own . I was sad that her reveal was so rushed and it left me feeling confused and I had to rewind the audiobook a bit . I & # 8217 ; m quite pleased with my first delve into the audiobook world and I & # 8217 ; m happy it wasn & # 8217 ; t terrible like I was afraid it would be.Cover Thoughts : It & # 8217 ; s simple , but I don & # 8217 ; t like that snot color green at all .	1
Summary : Meet Kaylee Cavanaugh . She just wanted a day out at the mall , but when she starts screaming and ca n't stop she ends up in a psychiatric ward . The thing is , she sees shadows . When she sees those shadows , she has the overwhelming urge to scream . Kaylee is afraid that she 's losing her mind . But , is she really losing her mind or is it something she will have to learn to live with ? This is just the beginning of uncovering a deep family secret.My Take : It 's been so fun re-reading this book knowing what I know now ! We meet Lydia in this book , then do n't see her again until If I Die . I had forgotten she was in the early novella ! When I originally read this novella , I read it after I had started the series . This time around , I read this as my start , since after all , this is where it begins ! Even though I know the story now and know what happens next , I found myself really anxious to read the next book , My Soul to Take ! I hope you enjoy meeting Kaylee as much as I have ! [ ... ]	1
Pretty much a coming of age story in the violent west . Great good characters and bad and some twists of bad to good to keep you guessing . A little romance to stir the pot and an even pace to keep it interesting . A very good read ... shu	1
A case of two souls finding direction when they found each other.A fun story , well rounded characters . Love comes and stays .	1
I had forgotten that Blake had a little part in putting Indy and Colt together.Willow was made for Blake and I 'm happy L.J . saw fit to give him a chance to actually get the girl.I enjoyed the story .	1
Ca n't help but love those cowboys from the McKay West Families . Blake is smokin hot and sweet as pie ... .I really loved this couple ... It was a short story , but totally enjoyable .	1
Another great book by Lorelei James . I am so addicted to her books . If you are looking for good books read these .	1
I always enjoy Lorelei 's books especially when she makes the women such strong characters and so independent but does not leave you without hot romance . Was wondering if we would hear from the West boys in a series and was not disappointed by Blake .	1
If you like to walk on the wild side of Enjoyment with the others you will definitely enjoy the playfulness of the weres in her new book `` Inferno '' ... There are so many turns in this story andnew plots to encourage more stories ... I ca n't wait to see what comes next ! ! !	1
I 'm too old and it 's too much time I 'm around . Or maybe it 's only that I read too much . Z.A . Maxfiled wrote a parody about a man who wrote a parody ... I think I 'm able to recognize to whom Z.A . Maxfield identifies herself in the novel , enough to say it 's not the writer ( too simple ) , and I recognized who was the writer she is paying homage to.The story is actually a comedy of errors : Jae is a literary critic working for an LGBT Magazine , The Adversary ( quite clear reference to The Advocate ... ) ; Jae is an half Caucasian half Asian man , and his full name is Jae-sun , but he goes for Jae , and this sometime leads people to think that he is a female . Often writers who are pissed off from one of his reviews accuse him to be a woman , and so to being unable to understand a real good piece of Gay Literature . You would think that Jae would be the first to defend himself claiming that he is a man , and instead he has always let it go , finding useful to have the change to play the double role , male or female when it is necessary . Like in this case : Jae is real angry since a woman , Kelly Kendall , dared to write a parody of one of Jae 's favourite coming of age novel , Doorways . Doorways was like The Sorrows of Young Werther or some other breaking coming of age novel for Jae , and seeing a trashy novel like Windows taking and ridiculing it , it 's too much . Above all since the author who did it is a woman ! ( payback is hard to digest ... ) How does she dare ? She ca n't understand how important that book was for young Jae.Problem is that Kelly can truly understand , since he is not a `` she '' , he is Kelly Mackay , alias Kelly Kendall , alias Kieran Anders , the author of both Doorways than Windows . He wrote Windows to fulfil a bet with Will , his houseboy / dogs boy , a 20 years old former hustler who he welcomed in his home as secretary and buddy friend with benefits . Where Kelly was probably the angst teenager in Doorways , Will is probably the slut teenager in Windows ... they are two different perspective on the same story , and Kelly is also probably overgrown on the teenager he was . At this point I also recognized another gentle homage Z.A . Maxfield probably did , to the movie Finding Forrester ; not only Kelly Kendall has the same Irish/Scottish origin of the character in the movie , William Forrester , but he has also the same problem to being trapped by his first novel : people adore Doorways so much , that Kelly is scared to writing something else . To do so , he changed completely the genre and went under another pseudo . Plus Kelly suffers of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and he avoids like a plague everything that is not ordinary or stranger.Jae is bent on `` outing '' Kelly Kendall as not only a woman ( his publisher maintains the mystery around him ) but also a plagiarist . He starts to pestering Kelly with emails from a supposedly female fan , StrawberryFields , mails to which Kelly replies with gentleness but avoiding giving details . Only that , email after email , both Jae than Kelly start to realize that they have much in common , and that they like to talk with the other online ... is it possible that a so good online relationship turns in something real ? Yes , it 's , since Jae is used to have things to easily , and dating Kelly it 's not easy at all . Someone could say that Kelly is a nut case , but I think that he is only a very special man , and he needs someone to take care of him . Do n't get me wrong , Kelly is not retarded or similar , he is only a man with a lot of odd customs , but it 's what makes him a special man , and he has not to change ; he only has to find a man who can deal with him . And learning to deal with Kelly maybe will teach to Jae to see things less in Black and White , to see the shades , to be more flexible , and learning that , to be a better man . Not always being a crusader is a good thing , sometime crusade did a very poor job to humanity.When I said that being a crusader is not necessarily a good thing , I 'm not only referring to Jae 's fight to `` out '' everyone who hides his homosexuality ( which negative side we read in the fate of an actor at the beginning of the book ) ; take Kelly 's OCD ... someone like Jae , so strong and used to see only the right and the wrong , probably would try to cure himself , to force nature to submit to human 's will ... and doing so you would destroy the real Kelly . The real Kelly it 's not the `` healthy '' man , the real Kelly is the obsessed one , the troubling one , he is special since he is not normal , level him to the rest of the world , means to kill him.I like also as the author dealt with Kelly and Will 's relationship ; true , they are having a sexual relationship , but not from Kelly 's side or Will 's one there is a real emotional commitment . Both of them know that what is between them it 's not real love , problem is that Kelly does n't know if real love exist , at least not until Jae . I like that , even if at the beginning the author let us in the more intimate details between Kelly and Will , when Jae is becoming something more than an email address for Kelly , that relationship slowly but steadily turns in a real friendship , without benefits . It 's made in a way that I do n't feel bad for Will , on the contrary , I believe that he needs more Kelly as a friend rather than as a lover . Not only Kelly finds his love , but it happens at the same time when Will 's past is revealed ( a past of child molestation ) , and in a strange play of destiny , it 's actually a better thing for him that Kelly , who can be a fatherly figure for Will due to the age difference , becomes totally sexually detached .	1
F. Scott Fitzgerald : Great Collection is a marvelous compilation with a wonderful surprise to me as I read `` The Curious Case of Benjamin Buttons ! '' I had forgotten that this tale was written by Fitzgerald ! I had never read the book in my youth when I read others . Seeing the movie made from this book was actually a huge turning point in my life . How delightful now that I should be able to add to that influence by reading the original ! I highly recommend this collection , you will be very happy that you invested in it ! I was !	1

The table of contents is active , and when you use it to jump to the book of your choice , the chapters or stories in the book are also active . So , vital literature well presented for only a dollar gets 5 stars .	1
This short story , although not described properly in the formal description , held my attention throughout . In a very brief time , the author managed to develop the characters to perfection . Written in the first person , she described events without burdening the reader with too much information . A perfect short memoir from a talented writer !	1
A love affair between a Greek and a Titan . What fun ! Must say I had never gotten in to the whole prison fantasy thing before , but this story could change my mind . Cute and short .	1
I love the Lord 's of the Underworld series and this was a neat short story opening to the series . I 've re-read it three times and I like it better each time .	1
This is a very light , pleasant and humorous story about America and the digital age . A charming set of characters and how the `` Gizmo '' has affected their lives and the lives of the inhabitants of the small town that holds the Last Bookstore in America . Truly enjoyable , also ironic that I did read this book on my Kindle !	1
I loved the author 's writing style and her story-telling talent ! This is a great satire on current media and laws and the author has blended them with great characters and passion . I loved how she wove two distinct storylines into one compelling and fun read . I liked the ending and the fact that the 'Creulla de Ville ' was knocked out at the end and the good guys went on with happy and fulfilling lives . Great fun read .	1
For those of us who love to read and love our eReaders ( I have two , one of them being a Kindle the other being another brand ) , the title of this book is totally captivating . When I read the product description , I had to purchase it and the price was definitely right to take a chance on an author I was unfamiliar with.The premise of the story is that a new technological device has come along - the Gizmo - that does everything . It 's a phone , an MP3-type device and an eReader all combined into one handy gadget . The comparisons to Amazon 's own Kindle are obvious but with even more capability than just reading books . Everyone in America has one of these handy dandy devices and just what does that mean for the bookstores selling traditional , paper books ? In our narrative , that means the demise of the bookshop and they are slowing closing with only a handful remaining . Throughout the novel , they close one by one until only `` The Firebreathing Dragon '' remains . How has it managed to not only stay open but make a tidy profit along the way , providing the financial support for the owner and two employees ? We find out when the owner dies and passes along not the bookstore and his home to his long-lost nephew . The nephew and his wife come to Eureka , California to see what 's what and discover a town filled with interesting characters and a culture vastly different than the one they left behind in the big city . Should they give up the fast-paced lifestyle which has left them in debt up to their ears to continue running the quirky bookstore or should they sell and take the money ? Just how much is the bookstore making and how are they making anything in this out-of-the-way hamlet ? All these questions and more get answered . In addition , the exploration of how this situation has evolved and the implication to the reading public will get the reader thinking about this very possibility.For originality and writing style , I definitely give this novel kudos . A novel that I finished many days ago but still haunts me with the idea of an alternative world I am not too crazy about . The setting of Eureka is described very well and the town itself becomes an intricate part of the work . The number of characters is just about perfect - enough to give the story life but not enough to overwhelm the reader . The characters themselves are quirky and interesting and I wanted to know more about them . This is where the novel lost one star for me : the characters were n't developed as much as I would have hoped . I really liked them and found them fascinating , just not enough about them so felt I was left hanging just a bit . Other than that , a wonderful novel that I enjoyed from beginning to end .	1
I truly enjoyed this book and have recommended it to friends . The future without books was so carefully imagined and then told in this wonderful story . Through Part 1 I was lazily enjoying how well written the story was , although not entirely exciting . Then bham - the writer changed everything and has you laughing and feeling the sorry for the demise of one of the characters . Then bham - everything changes again . I thoroughly enjoyed the ride .	1
I live in N. California . My son went to Humboldt University..a spit away from Eureka.If you have n't been up here , you might not know that kids come up here to go to college , first time away from home , and start wearing tie dye , woven shorts and birkenstocks . Within a week , they are stumping for the legalization of Hemp.They mean cannabis , of course , but they say hemp . 4 years later , with an education they head for Silicon Valley for the big tech money..and have forgotten about Hemp.This wonderful book takes a look at the rapidly changing technology ( Gizmos ) and of course Nile.com ... and extrapolates the end of Dead Tree Books , therefore the end of bookstores.An 'out of it ' couple go to Eureka to claim a bookstore the husband 's Uncle Sy left him in a hard to find will . This couple may as well have lived on the moon..they have missed the eccentricity of San Francisco which is not far from where they were living . Protected by their condo walls and high end jobs , they have no idea of any other way of life.I wo n't give away the plot . If you do n't know that marijuana is California 's largest cash crop , and Humboldt county the largest growing area , and that getting a medical card here to buy legally grown pot takes 5 minutes , you may not 'get ' this book . Every now and then our very own state leaders try to decide if marijuana should be legalized to pay off the state debt . So far , it has n't happened.The couple learns that the falling apart bookstore is making a million plus $ a year , and give up plans to go back to their feathered nest in San Jose . Greedy ? Well who would n't be ? They begin living out of the cash register and never see what is really going on.The rest of the story is in the book.Do n't let your sensibilities decide..OMG this is about POT ! and not read it..this is one great book.It is about so much more.It is funny and semi-true and there are some delicious lines in the book that I wish I had thought of saying.I will keep this book in my Kindle ( irony again ) and re-read it.GREAT BOOK ! ! ! ! !	1
After three decades of teaching High School English , Jesse Ashworth decides to take early retirement and move back to his hometown of Bath , Maine . His longtime friend and colleague , Rhonda Shepard , had moved to Bath a year earlier and opened a gift shop . Business is good and Jesse divides his time between helping Rhonda at the shop , getting settled in to his new home , spending `` quality '' time with his pug , Argus , and becoming reacquainted with people he knew back in High School . After some initial trepidation , Jesse finds that retirement suits him just fine.Just as Jesse is settling into a comfortable routine , he makes a grizzly discovery in his back yard : the skeletal remains of a young woman who died under suspicious circumstances . The upside ? Jesse gets to work closely with the very attractive Chief of Police , Tim Mallory . The downside ? It does n't take long for Jesse to come to the conclusion that someone he knows is a murderer , and that `` someone '' may just have it in for Jesse himself.This is definitely a `` cozy '' mystery , with the mystery part of the storyline taking a backseat to the characters themselves and the domestic details . Here 's what I look for in a `` cozy '' : ( 1 ) An interesting and unique protagonist ; someone I can relate to . ( 2 ) A strong sense of place . I want to really get a feel for the setting ; I want the location to come alive for me . ( 3 ) While I 'm willing to give `` cozy '' writers a lot of leeway when it comes to the mystery itself , I expect it to be at least respectably plausible . I 'm happy to say that this story had a lot of what I enjoy reading in a `` cozy '' mystery.Jesse 's first person narrative really worked . He 's observant and witty with a little snark thrown in for good measure . I know this area of Maine quite well and I love it , so I really enjoyed the way the author worked `` real life '' details into his fictional story . In fact , I have a craving for one of Amato 's Italian sandwiches - Thanks a lot Mr. Stanley , there goes the diet ! Seriously , if you are familiar with Bath then you 'll appreciate the details and if you 're not you 'll want to go there and see it for yourself . I also really liked the way the over 50 crowd was well represented , and ( Thank You God ) not portrayed as old geezers lucky to be standing on the right side of the grass . Nope , Jesse and company are attractive , interesting and relevant.Still , I did waffle between a 3 and 4 star rating , settling on a 3.5 ( rounded up to 4 for Amazon ) . While I enjoyed this very much , there 's no getting around the fact that there were numerous `` typos '' - missing words , misspellings , etc - that required a bit of mental editing on my part as I was reading . Maybe not a big deal , but anytime you are pulled out of a story -especially a Mystery - it 's not a good thing . There were a few places where the dialog could have flowed more naturally but overall I enjoyed this and plan on reading the next installment.Bottom Line : A solid `` cozy '' mystery with good characterization and plenty of authentic atmosphere . The mystery is serviceable , but if you 're looking for plot holes , you will find them . There are editing issues . There is occasional strong language and while there is no sexual content , a same sex romance is depicted . If that bothers you then this probably is n't the book for you.Book One : A Midcoast MurderBook Two : Murder in the Choir Room ( A Jesse Ashworth Mystery ) Book Three : The Big Boys ' Detective Agency	1
If you love historical romance with plenty of steamy scenes , read this book . I liked the main couple , who went through a lot to be together . There were times when the words seemed too modern but it was n't distracting . I look forward to reading more of this series .	1
Purchased on a whim and was rewarded with well written little romance.I totally fell in love with this Tortured Hermit Miner of a mountain man ! ! The battered , scared heroine was a perfect fit for our hero . The right blend to draw his protective trait as well as a man that has not had sex in YEARS ! ! ! ! OMG ! Now throw in a cabin sans-facilities- closed roads to civilization-angry miner neighbors ( the seclusion alone adds to the sexual tension ! You will laugh and cry several times over . I only gave it the 4 stars because I wanted to spend more time with these two characters -- there were many places to get to know them and flesh out some more story ... ... ..This is a shelf keeper.Thanks Mauren !	1
A Turn of Curses is an excellent fantasy novella . The characters are well constructed and believable , allowing the reader to identify with the privileged view of a pampered `` chosen one '' as well as those who must put up with her ignorance . You care about Selina and Faldon ; you care that they each fulfill their individual quests . The ending will tug at your heart , but leave you satisfied in the way a fantasy is meant to do . Melanie Nilles is a gifted storyteller ! Well done !	1
I read this in one sitting . The book opens with a warning . A strange young man has warned Selina that she must not go to Vastorn to heal the sick king . The question , of course , is why , and it is this question that underlies her journey to Vastorn . Along the way , a group of feyquin ( similar to horses ) stop her in an effort to prevent her from going to the king.The best part of this book is that the author kept me guessing as to why she should n't go to Vastorn and who does n't want her to get there . There was another surprise that popped up that I did n't forsee , but I do n't want to ruin the surprise . Overall , the book chronicles her journey to Vastorn ( because she 's determined to get there , no matter what ) . But the question is really , should she go or not ? It was a fun read , especially the parts about the feyquin and the unexpected friendship that she develops with them . I also enjoyed the night mares who proved that not all is what it seems . I recommend reading it if you love horses , fantasy , or suspense .	1
I think this series was the first of this type of stories . I can see James Bond being based on Bulldog Drummond !	1
I listened Bull Dog Drummond on radio , when I was boy doing my homework lessons , out of the night an into the fog steps Bulldog Drummond ! Thrilling radio show ! But . The book is much much better.Michael C	1
I ordered it on Prime . I was also surprised it was a novella leading into 2 or 3 other authors but that does n't matter because this was a full story in itself . I picked this book up and did n't put it down again . I read it in 2 days because I wanted to see what happened next . Every incident kept turning into another twist and it did n't matter that this could never happen in real life . That 's what a book is for , is n't it ? After the book was finished I wrote down the other titles by these 2 authors . I would classify this book as a suspense . Not a mystery and not a horror . Good exciting read .	1
I had read `` Afraid '' and picked out this prequel to the suspenseful blood bath hoping it would be just as great . I was not disappointed . The stage is set when two psycho serial killers meet by chance at the Truck Stop and decide to have their fun with Jack , tough lady detective from Chicago . The psychos of course can not trust each other ( lots of fun watching them `` connect '' ) and the cop has n't been a survivor for nothing . There are gruesome moments in this but not near what happened in `` Afraid . '' Overall , good read , but a bit too pat and short .	1
Talk about scary and suspenseful . This short story had my attention until the very end , and I must say I would have kept reading had there been more ! Very suspenseful and scary . I love this author who also wrote Serial , and the Jack Daniel 's series . I will be wary of the next truck stop I pass through !	1
Well written short story that may come across as a teaser for other books of the author but can easily stand on its own . Gory entertainment for readers with a preference for the perverted variety of killers .	1
Truckstop , along with Konraths other masterpieces of delicious terror entertain all of yoursenses.Squeamish need not download.Serial.Uncut delivers an hour of pure unmeasuredpleasure , mixed with a healthy dose of paranoia strong enough to keep checking the doorlocks & having some kind of weapon within easy reach.I think J.K. 's books may be easilyas addictive to some , as the character 's behaviors are to them.Just comes at a differentcost . Eh ?	1
Stop on in to Murray 's truck stop & take part in this psychotic thriller . Take a whacked out trucker , a courier , a truck stop hooker & a lady cop then sit back & enjoy . The short story is a very dark tale , but good . The trucker & courier are a couple of sicko serial killers . Everyone meets by pure chance at Murray's.A satisfying read , it 's quick & to the point . No wasted dialogue.The only issues have nothing to do with the author or story . The editing in the Kindle edition is very sloppy . Additionally at 56 % the novella ends . The rest is a Q & A ; session with the author . That in itself is misleading	1
Really creepy . I loved it ! Anything Jack Daniels is good , but this short story was good even when she was n't in it . I wo n't be visiting with people in truck stops anymore . Or any less .	1
I cant believe these books keep me up all night and then I wonder why I have nightmares . I love it though , I have to say ... it gives me a real vintage King feeling and I love it . Have to say , Endurance was great though !	1
Truck Stop is a culmination of all that is evil and perverse . Perennial killers Taylor and Donaldson , two corrupt souls find solace in a demented embrace at a roadside tuck stop . The initial victim ; a prostitute whose body is seen as little more than a piece of meat ripe for dismemberment and consumption before the predators set their sights on police officer Jack Daniels . However , you could say , they bit off more than they could chew in underestimating Daniels ' survival instinct and hardened police training . Truck Stop is a brief interlude into the Jack Daniels saga and a good entry point for those unfamiliar with the character . Not a word is wasted in this thriller that touches on our deep seeded fear of experiencing a kidnapping , forced cannibalism and slow death . 4 stars .	1
I love this book . It kept my attention all the way through . Not too gory , but just right and the end is great . I have read most of his books and really like them . A great author so check out his other books .	1
Set in Regency Era England in 1806 . Caroline was the Abigail to Lady Eleanor whose deathbed wish was for her to pose as a distant relative and start a new life at the family 's country estate `` Castlegate Manor '' . Geoffrey , the groom , helps her but he has secrets of his own . I enjoyed this light and entertaining read and would have given it 4-1/2 stars if that were a rating option . The drama and suspense were mild with no graphic violence or sex scenes , only chaste kisses and embraces between the hero and heroine . A nice little romance .	1
This is a very good sexy story about two cousins Collin and Becket deSaxby who have been in competition for a servants daughter Christiana who was their friend since childhood . Beckett has her return to the castle after her father 's death as she is on the verge of starvation . He has desired her forever but never acted on it . Something happened between she and Collin years ago that bothered him it was disclosed at the end . Beckett and she finally began a sexual relationship both care for each other but never admit it . She was kidnapped and rescued by a mysterious masked man caled Blackwell who has been protecting the king from an evil nobleman . Christiana knows it is Beckett who is Blackwell by a tattoo and acts sexually to him . He refuses her and is very hurt.She goes back to the Castle knowing it is over between them.He returns bringing a wife to be and her family .Tels her she has to leave which she already knows . It all works out to a HEA he finally learns she knew who he was as Blackwell . He realizes he waas jealous of his own self . I had not read any of her books before but will look for more .	1
This book is very short , but it packs a lot of fun into few words . I 've read it several times since I got it .	1
Cute short story , it is an off-beat romance romp with some nutty ghosts and a murder that needs solved . Heat level is medium , this is n't erotica for those wondering .	1
Personally I found this to be a very good read ... I found myself laughing out loud several times ... Not quite the typical shifter read , but very enjoyable ...	1

Love the series , have bought all of them . Would like to read more . This was a great recommendation from Amazon .	1
Alex Faustin knows who is destined wife is ; now he just has to convince her she 's his one.Alex is the youngest brother in the Faustin family - an old and respected Russian vampyr line . Alex 's mother and father still adhere to the Old Ways , including the absolute belief in dream premonitions of their son 's future wives . Alex is the first Faustian to be fated with a wife . . . the only thing is she lives in Colorado and will take a little convincing ( of Alex 's love for her , their bond and the truth about vampires ) .It 's true ; there are some bad vampire love stories out there . But Evie Byrne 's first book in the ` Faustin Brothers ' trilogy is n't one of them . To be honest , ` Called by Blood ' is n't reinventing the fang - there 's a mortal love interest , a rich and powerful vampiric family and a lot of smexing going on . But Byrne 's series is oddly delightful , regardless of the well-trod territory.One of the great things about this book is Byrne 's tongue-in-cheek humour . Alex Faustin lives in modern-day New York and his ` mate ' is Helena , a modern woman . These people know about vampires - the movies , myths and romantic ridiculousness - and as a result , Byrne draws on many references and pokes fun at many a legend . I liked her vampiric brevity - it was refreshing , without denouncing all the typical vampire/mortal problems.This novel is very sexy , first and foremost . It 's from Samhain Publishing - a notoriously hot publisher . But ` Called by Blood ' has a surprisingly veering plot ; when the rich and handsome Alex is burnt by the sun and spends a portion of the book resembling Freddy Krueger . That 's right , a vampire love story in which the smoking-hot dead dude looks nasty and blistered for much of the book . It means that Alex and Helena have to connect on a personal level before a physical one . . . but when they do get physical , Byrne brings the goods ( while still keeping things light and funny ) .My one small complaint about the book was the abrupt ending - I really would have liked another 100 pages or so . Since this is the ` Faustin Brothers ' trilogy it would have been nice to meet all of the Faustin brothers and get a sense of the family dynamic ( as it is , we only meet oldest brother , Mikhail ) . And with an extra 100 pages we may have been able to read about Helena assimilating to vampirism and New York . But that 's a small and complimentary complaint about wanting more , more , more from Evie Byrne 's wonderful novel !	1
I like this story . There are are only so many different ways to tell a vampire story . I though Evie Byrne did a good job . The whole vampire going across country for his bride story is a different twist . I would recommend to buy it . The second story in this series is pretty great too .	1
Overall this was an entertaining story . I really like the way this author builds the relationship between the H and the h. She did this rather well in this story as well . I also like how strong her female characters usually are . There is one thing that annoyed me . After the h asks the H to make a bigger comittment the H pretty much freaks and bails on her , in Mexico no less . After a month she tries to reconnect with him as friends and he blows her off again . Even though this guy was not a complete jerk it really annoyed me that he strolls in on her and declares that he has changed his mind taking for granted that she would drop everything and have him back , this is after months apart and him telling her that he had gone out on a date . She of course is so happy she takes him back without a single doubt . GRRR ! ! ! I love this author but it really annoys me when writers take a strong female character and resolve the story by just having her forgive and forget so easily . Especially when the h was such a strong character . Even though the H concedes to her in the end it was still really annoying that she did not even utter any hesitation . That was why I gave it four stars instead of a five . Other than that it was a great story .	1
Private Property by Leah Braemel is the first book in the Hauberk Security series . It is also Leah 's first published work and I enjoyed it so much I knew I 'd read anything future she published . The characters are interesting , the dialog engaging , and the sex scenes are hot . What truly enamored me though was the fact that this book takes place less than a half of a mile from my home and she described it perfectly.This book centers around Mark Rodgriguez and Jodi Tyler . Mark is the owner of Celeda Security located in Texas and Jodi one of his operatives . The book opens with Jodi staking out a home she is suppose to break into to prove to the owner that his current security company is n't any good and they should hire Mark 's company . Jodi is upset that Mark chose her to head up this security breach since it 's her birthday and she 'd rather spend the evening with him . She begins to think that perhaps this is Mark 's way of breaking off their `` no strings '' relationship . What we soon find out is that Mark has set up an evening with his old college roommate and friend , Sam Watson , ( owner of Hauberk Security ) to help him fulfill some of Jodi 's fantasies as a birthday gift . The tables are turned on Mark and he soon realizes that he has been an idiot when it comes to Jodi.This is a very good book , Mark is a likeable albeit at times kind of clueless hero . He thinks he has his relationship with Jodi all figured out but in reality he does n't . It takes Sam , some restraints , and some interesting situations to make him see things differently.Jodi is capable , extremely likeable , but very insecure . She 's dated some losers in the past that have made it difficult to trust and thus she 's always waiting for Mark to dump her . She 's feeling guilty because she agreed to an unemotional affair with Mark but she 's fallen in love with him.I like both Mark and Jodi , but Sam is the one that stole the show in this book . From the minute he came on the scene I was hooked and knew that I had to know more about this complex man . Considering all the `` fun '' things he has in his home , you just know there is a great story behind him.For a first book , Private Property is very good but it left me wanting more . While the story is complete , I knew that I 'd have to read the next one as soon as it was available . I always love when I find a writer that I `` mesh '' with right away and Leah is one of those authors . I 'm very happy to give this first effort a solid 4 stars . ***NOTE*** As I was reading I felt myself wanting to know more about Mark and Jodi and was pleased when I got to the end and found there was a free read ( First Night ) detailing the beginning of Mark and Jodi 's relationship . It answered a lot of questions and helped me understand the characters so much more . You can find this at Leah 's website .	1
The first in this series Private Property sizzles off the page ! Jodi thinks Marks getting ready to drop her from his personal life . In reality it 's Jodi ` s birthday and Mark has planned a surprise that will shock her . After making a list of her sexual fantasies he 's about to try and fill them with the help of his friend Sam . When this go a little off the rails though Marks makes a few discoveries of his own . The sex scenes are burning up hot ! You get a peak at the sexy as hell Sam . You might feel the need to smoke a cigarette after this one !	1
I loved this story . Very well written , Ms. Banks makes an amazing story believable and touching . You can see the caring and love develop between the characters so sweetly . The men are strong and protective but little Kaya is strong in her own way too.Reading the prequel , Golden Eyes , first is n't necessary but it , too , is a good story . Duncan 's thoughts as he interacts with the cheetah , and at the discovery of the woman-who-is-a-cheetah are funny and delightful.I highly recommend both books .	1
Kaya is a shifter and has spent most of her entire life alone . When she sees the men at a cabin in her neck of the woods , she is curious . Daily she watches these men come and go until hurt , she goes to them for comfort the only way she knows how , as a cougar.Having seen ` their ' cougar for days without the pretty feline coming any closer , Jericho and Hunter are surprised when she finally gets close enough to them for them to touch her . Realizing she is exhausted and hurt , they bring her inside . Hours later , both men are surprised to find their cougar has vanished and a naked and beautiful but skittish woman seems to have appeared from thin air . They have no idea the woman they are seeing is the cougar they have been slipping food to for months.Kaya has never trusted another person before - not to mention two people . She has loved both men for so long that all she wants to do is be close to them . They seem to feel the same way and when they are asked to finish one mission for the government , they hesitate to leave Kaya alone but she accepts their promises to return.Amber Eyes made me cry more than once . Not only cry - I sobbed out loud . What a beautiful love story Maya Banks has released . With an innocence air , Amber Eyes is just an amazing tale of love and trust . Kaya is a victim of her surroundings almost . She ran away from kidnappers early in her life and pretty much grew up on her own . She did n't rely on anyone for anything - until Hunter and Jericho . The love these men showed Kaya more than once made me swoon and sigh at the gentleness of their touches and the love the three shared.Amber Eyes highlights what Maya Banks does best - she grabs her reader by the heart and does n't let go . Emotionally gripping with smoldering passions , Amber Eyes is a must read . I joyfully recommend it ! TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I love well written menages with strong alpha heroes and a beautifully imperfect heroine that they love and cherish and protect , i want more menage maya ! ! ! great story , great plot	1
I loved this story . I thought the Author pulled it altogether so well . I liked how comfortable these people were with themselves and how protective they were of `` Amber Eyes '' ... this she panther . Such an incredible , well thought out story .	1
Really like this book it 's a great read , I found it very heart warming that the love and understanding was what was needed .	1
I think I enjoyed Amber Eyes a little more than Golden Eyes , and I thoroughly enjoyed that novella . Kaya was enjoyable to read and watch come to get use to the human world she had long since stopped from trying to enter . Also for Hunter and Jericho to learn to love again .	1
I love Sandra ' s books ans this one is no exception . She chose a really good story line . I was unable to put it down . I love the strong characters who say what they want and are not phony . Sandra has a way of reeling you in and keeping your yarn .	1
This was a TRUE Regency style novel . It was clean and an enjoyable morning read . I will look for more by this author .	1
It continues to amaze me how Verne could write stories and novels with such brilliant forethought and logic for the future .	1
Jules Verne has been one of my favorites for years , but when I buy an old book I just have to buy a first run copy , which gets expensive.. Since buying my Kindle Fire I have read more books over the past year than the past 10 years combined ! And now I can finally afford to buy the entire collection of Jules Verne.. It is wonderful to end one story and start another without ever leaving my couch ! This Collection of Jules Verne does not disappoint this scifi fan .	1
Very nice collection of the more well known works and a few of the lesser known . A must have for the Vernies . : o )	1
This book is really well done ... The story sweet but very sexual and has a hint of rough sex and lanuage for a great balance..	1
Cute cowboy & # 10004 ; Another gorgeous cowboy & # 10004 ; Some hot sex & # 10004 ; Best dad in the world & # 10004 ; Identical twin brother & # 10004 ; Identical twin brother who is a total d***head and you just want to throttle & # 10004 ; This was short and overall sweet . I guess I just wanted Ren and Tyler to struggle more for their happiness but I still enjoyed it .	1
This book should come packaged with a thud pillow and something to bite on . If you love mm romance , and especially if you love a little bdsm , you will LOVE this story . If you 're like me and you tend to avoid cowboy stories because they seem to cliche , fear not , the story is fantastic , and the love scenes are so hot . The bondage stuff is n't heavy but there is enough to enjoy sinking your teeth into . ; )	1
Well thought out and strange but that was what I liked about it . I did n't quite get it as I read through it but it was interesting all the same ... to think that super natural stories can revolve around mostly vampires and werewolves , I love it when I find a story that is well done and deals with a different topic . Katrina Strauss is a good author and I would love to read more of her books . I would recommend this book to all fans of paranormal YAOI ... it is well done and made me think about the differences in writing styles of different writers and that sometimes you can judge a book by its cover . I picked this book because it 's cover art was beautifully done and I was n't disappointed .	1
I enjoyed this book . I liked the characters . The leads were both strong individuals and the conflict that was finally resolved kept it interesting .	1
Heat of Passion is a sweet , hot and sexy novella.The main characters , Carson and Holly , are likeable characters who are of course sexy as hell . The author describes them in enough detail and provides just enough background information , so that this novella is more than sex and heat . Elle Kennedy has has created endearing qualities to her main characters and successfully developed a relationship between them that is not only passionate but realistic . Yep , I would n't mind meeting Carson ! The plot is character focused and is centred about Holly 's insecurities and self acceptance . She was an enjoyable character to follow and easy to identify with.If you are looking for a fun , hot and definitely sexy read to fill in an hour or so , then be sure to pick up a copy of this erotic romance . Overall , I rate Heat of Passion a hot and steamy 3.5 fairies . I will definitely pick up more of Elle Kennedy 's work .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this book . She is a very good author . It was super sexy and had a good storyline . I am going to read more of her books . Read this , you 'll like it .	1
This is the first book I have read by this author and because I liked it so much , I immediately looked up her author page upon completion . The story has the perfect combination of storyline , sex , and characterization . I am a fan and plan on downloading her other books . You will not be disappointed ! !	1
Yay ! ! ! I only have 1 more book and I am caught up o n this series . OK Elle , when is the next book coming out .	1
I bore easily when reading , so I like that this book started off fast and kept me interested all the way to the end . Was short but cute , can & # 8216 ; t wait to read some of the author & # 8216 ; s other books !	1
I have not been disappointed in the series , but I have a major soft spot for military men in my life and reading .	1

Loved it ! Just came across this author and am searching for more by Ms.Jefferson story had me glued to the pages lol	1
I have never read anything by this author before , The plot was well executed and kept my interest to my surprise it was two stories in one and for that I have respect for the author Kuddos Ms Jefferson for once I didnt have to wait for the next installment.I appreciate how the author referred back to the first character in the second story and tied it up nicely again kuddos .	1

Woman meets man , man meet woman , man does not know woman ? Ahh , she thought she knew everything , boy was she in for a surprise , but not has big as finding out the father of your child is dead , but his name is not . This was so cute and the story was even better with each turn of the page . I have to admit some areas were very predictable , but overall , everything comes together nicely to provide a good read with some nice heart warming moments sprinkled throughout .	1
I enjoyed this book . It had a few twists which was nice but it was an easy read and since I read before bedtime it was perfect .	1
When I first opened this book I was n't quite sure what I was reading . The male main character seemed too ... how shall I put it ... caveman ? And his mother too insane for believability , I did n't know what to make of it . But as you read on you start to understand the PTS involved with the mother 's & # 34 ; moods & # 34 ; and the true gem of a man found in the & # 34 ; gentle giant & # 34 ; . I like a story that makes me feel something and this story does that . A touching , sweet read .	1
RG Alexander is awesome ... ... This is n't the OZ I remember ... . A wizard sends a storm to bring Kansas to OZ and once there he finds he belongs there .	1
The story is nice , maybe a little too short , only 52 pages.It 's a revisiting of The Wizard of Oz story , with Dorothy who here is named Kansas ( like the United State ) and it 's not from Kansas , but from Iowa . Kansas is a independent wealthy man who decided to live like an hermit in his family land . When he is swept away from a tornado , no one notices his absence , and so Kansas is free to enjoy is adventure.He awakes in a strange world , inhabited by half-man half-beast being ; the first two he meets are a cat like man and a bird like woman , a strange couple indeed . When the two find this strange being with bare skin and blue eyes , they think that it would be a nice gift for their king and decide to bring Kansas to him , even if the cat-like man would like to have a taste . In this world sensuality is the normal behavior and sex is almost a recreational activity ; Kansas will discover that even a simple bath in a pond has sexual consequences , and not thanks to another being , but since the waters are alive.When Kansas arrives to the king 's palace , the first human-like man he meets is Z , a wizard . He is almost `` normal '' if not for the fact that he is extremely handsome and gold colored . Z. tells Kansas that , if he wants to have the chance to go back to home , he should refuse the king ... and here maybe The Wizard of Oz mixed with One Thousand and One Nights . And here maybe is where I 'd like the story to be a bit longer : there is an acceleration that brings the reader to the end of the story when it would be interesting to have more ; the relationship between the King and Kansas is only hinted , and almost chaste in comparison to all the other sexual experiences Kansas had before `` consorting '' with the King.Naughty thought on the title : Not in Kansas means that the story is not setting in Kansas like The Wizard of Oz , or that the King is not allowed to `` enter '' Kansas ( and I do n't mean the State ... ) Anyway as I said the story is nice and enjoyable , more funny than serious ; this is not the classical fantasy tale heavy in details , but it 's more a funny escapade in a world that maybe is the dream world in Kansas ' mind .	1
Kansas Frayne is missing out on life and love when a storm takes him away from it all . He is tested when he meets the king and warned by the dark wizard that he must win no matter how hard the challenge appears . Can Kansas withstand the beautiful king 's charm in order to win ? Not in Kansas is a cute and sexy take on the Wizard of Oz . I love the twist R.G . Alexander put on her story having two men in the lead . VERY hot . The king blazes up the pages and Kansas is no slouch . I love how the king thinks he 's getting things his way , but Kansas shows him . I ca n't wait for more . I love Ms. Alexander and this story is no exception . Not in Kansas blew me away ! JambreaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
Madeline ` Maddie ' Carpenter 's life has n't changed since she won the lottery one year ago along with her best friends Brittney and Lauren . Rather than go on a spending binge she still lives in the same house , works the same job , and has n't indulged in anything life altering that most people who play the lottery dream of doing . Her life is very ordinary - at least it was until the evening of Brittney 's wedding when Maddie dares to step out of her comfort zone and accept the wedding reception singer 's not so subtle offer to visit his hotel room.Tanner Robinson is a singing superstar who just happens to occasionally agree to do private performances . He 's agreed to sing at Brittney 's reception but there 's a tinge of resentment in doing so since all his love songs were written for his ex-wife , who 'd left him for a woman . He 'd just received his final divorce papers the day before and that just adds to his discontent and frustration . Mindless sex has been a great way to alleviate his restlessness - and he goes looking for just that when he enters the hotel bar and propositions Maddie.Maddie is n't like any of the women Tanner 's been photographed with or use to for that matter . She 's not ` Hollywood , ' she 's real - no flashy clothes , rabbit food diet , and no ulterior motive for sharing time with him . He might have gone looking for a one night fling , but what he found is a woman he ca n't resist - and he honestly is n't sure how he feels about that . One thing 's certain , even once he returns to his normally busy recording schedule he ca n't stop thinking about her . Maddie carries her own insecurities but she 's willing to risk her heart for Tanner , but is she prepared for the pretentious world of a popular singer ? What about Tanner ... can he let go of his ex-wife 's betrayal and find a happily-ever-after with a woman who 's paralyzed with fear of changing anything in her life ? Who has n't dreamed of the changes they 'd make in their lives if they could just pick those lucky numbers ? Now imagine if you actually did win but making any of those changes is just too overwhelming . Karen Erickson 's FORTUNE 'S PROMISE provides readers with just such a scenario and throws in a newly divorced popular singer just to complicate matters - the results are decidedly entertaining and highly memorable . As a reader I found it very easy to relate to Maddie and her discomfort with change but loved that she steps out of her comfort zone with Tanner for an undeniably naughty night . FORTUNE 'S PROMISE is a beautiful story of two people moving past their fears , letting go of their pasts and embracing the possibilities of a future together . It 's definitely a story that just makes you feel good about life in general - even if you do n't win the lottery.I confess I have n't read the other titles in the FORTUNE 's series so obviously the books can be read as stand alones but I 'm definitely curious enough about Brittney and Lauren that I 'll be picking up copies of the other stories soon . Here are the titles in the FORTUNE series in order : FORTUNE 'S DECEPTIONFORTUNE 'S PROMISEFORTUNE 'S CHANCEOr if you prefer your books in print format pick up a copy of LUCK OF THE DRAW which contains all three of the FORTUNE stories.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1

This was my first Anya Bast book and I really liked it . I have looked at some of her other reads but her books seems a little too far fetched for me but to each his own . What makes this book so different from other menage stories is that the author took the time to really develop her characters . The men got to know their woman . They did not claim her and wisk her off and screw like bunnies 24/7 . They took the time to woo her , they loved her , respected her , and they honored her . I also loved the fact that it was quite ways into the book before they actually had sex . This was a great read and one I would highly recommend ! I would have loved more action and intrigue but for the most part I loved it . I hope this books becomes a series . Great job Ms. Bast .	1
Love the author . Unique in that combine science fiction with erotica . Recommed for anyone that like science fiction paranormal and erotica .	1
Oh wow ... I just read most of this straight through and I do n't even know what to say . I need to take a minute to collect my thoughts . It was so beautiful and so well done . And in such an original way too . Of course I guessed a few things before they happened , but Part 1 was so different than Part 2 of the book , and I did not expect it to go in that direction at all . I love how it went beyond the original premise to the recovery and all . Part 2 of the book is where it became most original . I also loved the half and half viewpoints , I loved the two leads ( and I loved the layout of the book , how you learn each character truly in turn , and then can think back and know more of their emotions from earlier scenes ) . And the story became harsh , it had me tearing up there for a while ... but this book really had everything . From the sex and action and denial , to the romance and passion , pain and change , love and hope , growth and future . It was a brilliant work like all I 've read by Josh Lanyon . Now I 'll check out Laura Baumbach too . But I know this story will stay with me . I loved it completely . Eventually I 'll reread it knowing all that I do now and I think that will only make it better.P.S . See ? This review is still all scattered because this book just kind of out my brain on another level . So wonderful .	1
Mexican Heat is my favourite of Josh Lanyon ( right after the Adrien English mysteries which are first place ! ) .Here , Josh 's collaboration with Laura Baumbach is a novel that packs quite the emotional punch . It has adventure , dashing hot men , the sex scenes are unbearably erotic , and the emotions swirling between the two main characters will leave you breathless.Wow ! Highly recommended !	1
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH `` LADY RAVEN '' EACH REVIEWER IS ENTITLED TO HIS OR HER OWN OPINION AN EACH OPINION SHOUKLD BE RESPECED AS SUCH I.E . AN INDIVIDUAL 'S PERSONAL O P I N I O N ! ! Now back to the review : In this instance this is a novella , and this one is a short erotic vampire romance , I RECEIVED PRETTY MUCH WHAT I EXPECTED FROM A SHORT . THIS NOVELLA IS A SEXY , SUFFICENTLY STEAMY , FUN VAMPIRE RUMP ! However , it was atually longer than many of the `` novellas '' I 've purchaed via amazon 's kindle for your PC , brilliant idea by the way guys , i.e . making kindle ebooks available for other electronic devices.The author provides just enough character development given the expected limitations of any novella . Given the aforementioned constraint , I recommend this as a fun read at a fairly appropriate price . I plan to read the rest of this series despite the poor reviews the 1st book in the series received . I truly appreciate the reviews but ultimately I make my own decision regarding whether I purchase a particular book & so should everyone . Besides , AMAZON 'S CSR IS SO FAITHFUL TO IT READERS THAT UNDER MOST CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WILL AT LEAST GIVE ONE A CREDIT TOWARD ANOTHER PURCHASE IF A CUSTOMER IS TRULY UNHAPPY WITH AN EBOOK PURCHASE . THANKS AMAZON , THAT ONE OF THE REASON I ONLY PURCHASE KINDLE E BOOKS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! GOOD CSR ! ! ! RECOMMED THAT YOU GIVE THIS ONE A TRY ! GLAD I DID !	1

I had read and much liked two other novels by T. A . Chase , but this is a complex novel of romance and action ( and no little sex ) . Well written , great plot and fine character development . Did I mention no little sex ? I guarantee that if you read this , you will read more of Chase 's work . Buy it ! You 'll like it !	1
Sizzling hot sex . And somewhat unorthodox settings . Makes you turn over the pages fast and look for more at the end . A very strong fairy-tale element with a happy ending .	1
Warning : This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating : 7/10PROS : - This author excels at historical works . The settings are rich and detailed , and the language is elegant and ( at least to my eyes ) contains few or no historical inaccuracies.- I loved the play back and forth between the two men : the fight for dominance as well as the easing of tension when they & # 8217 ; re alone , especially considering how properly they both behave in public.CONS : - There are scenes from both characters & # 8217 ; perspectives in the story , but I wanted to see a bit *more* from Arsen & # 8217 ; s point of view . I was more interested in seeing inside of the arrogant wastrel & # 8217 ; s head than the lovesick puppy & # 8217 ; s.- We don & # 8217 ; t get to see any of the men & # 8217 ; s past interactions ; we & # 8217 ; re simply told about them briefly . As a result , the love Arsen feels for Henry wasn & # 8217 ; t very believable for me.Overall comments : I enjoyed this , but the deficiencies in character development prevented me from loving it . It & # 8217 ; s a pretty short story ( 1170 Kindle locations ) , and it & # 8217 ; s at least 50 % sex . The romantic element of it felt a bit lopsided to me in that one man is obviously crazy in love and the other has a tinge of indifference about him .	1
wow ! did this singe the eyebrows . really good price and service . did not take long to get it . my friends are taking turns borrowing it .	1
I love it this story is sexy and hot . great characters and a wonderful story makes me wish I had 2 men loving on me	1
A really good story , which surprised me . Usually , this subject matter is n't something I 'd enjoy ; two people usually do just fine . But the reasoning behind the whys and wherefores were believable , all the way through . Even the ending would work , I guess .	1

Add to that the snow that has suddenly appeared and she should n't be surprised when her car slides off the highway into an icy creek . She figures at this point it is all over.She did n't count on Cale and Bobby seeing her car in the creek or that they are determined to save her life . When she wakes up naked in their bed ( they were trying to save her and her rescuer from hypothermia ) she is surprised but not shocked . The more she thinks about things , and her cheating fianc & eacute ; , they could be the prefect bookends to satisfy her revenge .

They have the smoldering hormones , and attractions . What will happen when the storm is over though ? Saddled is a super spicy m & eacute ; nage a trois story that will keep your blood pumping while you read it . Ms. Devlin knows how to write a seriously erotic scene . I enjoyed the premise of Saddled and though it was a fun and fast paced read.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
What a fabulous erotic book . Wow ! This was one awesome story ! After a devastating discovery about her fiance , Kate crashes her car into an icy river . Luckily Bobby & Cale were behind her on the desolated highway and saw her crash so that they could pull her out of the river . Fighting hypothermia for both Bobby and Kate , Cale does the only thing he can ... undresses all of them and snuggles them into bed together so that they can share body heat as the blizzard closes in.Yup , this is one hot book . Bobby & Cale have started their ranch together , but it 's a very isolated , desolated place and the winters get awfully lonely with just the two of them . Thus they feel like they have been given an incredible gift when Kate falls into their laps . As for Kate , well she is overwhelmed when she wakes up to these 2 sexy naked cowboys , but with her fiance 's treachery fresh on her mind , she is okay with a long weekend of passion and forgetting the real world.This book is hot and sexy . I really enjoyed reading it and getting to know Cale , Bobby , & Kate . I enjoyed their story and the unconventionality of their relationship . I loved Bobby 's irreverence , Cale 's sweet , tender caring , and Kate 's up-front honesty . The passion was intense and the romance/love story beautiful . A great little erotic novella !	1
Bobby Blackhawk and Cale Yancey own and run a property outside Wellesley , Colorado that they bought together after leaving the service.Katherine Duvall or Kate as she is better known is devastated , she has been betrayed and has taken off in her rental car.When Bobby and Cale come up behind a women driving without chains on her tyres in the snow they know she is a disaster waiting to happen . Kate soon loses control of the car skidding off the road and Bobby and Cade instantly head to her rescue . What follows will surprise Kate and delight them all but will it be enough for these lone star cowboys to convince Kate to stay with them or will their winter tryst be just that.I really enjoyed Saddled , and if you love your cowboys you will too .	1
Another example of how family can really stick it to you . Dear Kerri has had family issues for ev er . Her only salvations are her yoga studio and her best friend Mitch.Now she wants to get married . That biological clock is ticking , so she asks Mitch to fix her up with a few dates . He is not really into marrying off his best friend , and what follows is funny/ pathetic/ strange.How everything ties up at the end is ingenious . A good read .	1
I was originally going to give this book only 4 stars becausegetting through the first few chapters was painfully difficult ... I felt the whole Kerri begging Mitch to find her a husband was alittle stupid BUT ... ..Then everything changed ... .What a wonderfully fun , super sexy , emotionally packed story ! ! ! ! I just might start doing Yoga again : )	1
My Review : Again , my favorite trope ... friends to lovers , but OMG , this one was done so well . I really , really LOVED this book ! ! ! The book description above is really well-done so I am not going to add anything about the setup of the story and get right to the review part of this review.I love the way that these two characters were written so realistically . Yes , they are absolutely best friends , but when things heat up between them sexually , everything becomes REALLY awkward and tense for Mitch & Kerri . All of a sudden , they are fighting constantly and sniping at each other about everything . That 's one of those things that only works with really good friends ... they may be there for each other , but OMG , they know how to push each others buttons too.Kelly wrote this really well ... you can see that the sexual chemistry between the two is sizzling , but they are using aggression to fight it . But when that aggression becomes too much and they do give into the sexual tension ... OMG , it is so incredibly HOT . I think that I can honestly say that the sexual scenes in this book are absolutely the hottest and most erotic that I have ever read . There is so much emotion written into and woven throughout them ... OMG , really amazing writing ! ! ! The real issue with this relationship long-term is that Mitch truly does not believe in marriage . He had a horrible home-life growing up and now he 's a divorce attorney . All he has ever seen is the destruction wrought by the institution of marriage . But for Kerri , she is 30 years old . She wants a family with all that it entails ... a husband and kids . As these two realize that they are in love , they do n't know how to get past that huge difference in ideals , without giving up their love . There is a fabulous character arc for both of them that is so sweet and truly beautiful . It 's amazing writing . I loved both of these characters and watching them connect ... LOVED IT ! ! Really just a fabulous book . You will definitely be seeing more of Kelly Jamieson 's books in my coming TBR piles ! !	1

When I was 13 and haunting the public library one summer , I discovered Zane Grey western novels . The very first one I read was East of the Pecos , and it thrilled me . It had action and adventure , horses which I loved , and told of an Old West where men were men and women were glad of it . The novels had a strong romance subplot -- at least strong according to my newly-minted teen-hood.That one book had me scouring the section where his books were shelved . I ca n't remember how many I read . Each thrilled me as much as that first one.When I bought my Kindle a couple of years ago , I spent days scrolling through the lists of free books and low-priced ebooks . Imagine my delight when I came across this little gem -- a collection of 26 of Zane Grey 's most popular novels and with a Linked Table of Contents . I grabbed it , and started reading.I have to admit that I was totally surprised that the stories still captivated me . I 'd thought I might find them as stale as an episode of Gunsmoke on TV Land . Not at all . The stories are still compelling plus I love the American West history in each.After I 'd read the first book in this collection , I visited the Texas Ranger Museum in Waco , Texas . Walking through the museum , I realized how accurate were Grey 's portrayals of the men who brought law to Texas and to the history of nineteenth century America.This collection is wonderful , and it 's worth far more than the modest price . The books are delightful in every way and make one understand why the western was so popular in television and movies for so long .	1
I have n't finished them all yet but I will . Worth the money if you just want to escape from all the high tech gadgets and be closer to man 's instinct to survive .	1
I admit I was looking for a bargain on my Kindle and decided to try this book . Overall I was impressed ! It had an interesting plot line , I did n't know exactly what was happening for quite a bit of the book and I really enjoyed it . The premise is a bit strange but having worked in psychiatry for quite some time it actually seems feasible . For 99 cents it was definitely a bargain !	1
There is not much more that I can say about `` Crack Up '' that has not been said in previous reviews but I did want to give it a rating since that is what helps me select books . I rate it 4.5 stars in all aspects.The size is about 7000 locations . Total downloaded location size with other excerpts is 7596.It is finding books like this that make me so happy to be a Kindle owner . I consider a book to be a thriller if I do n't want to put it down . `` Crack Up '' is definitely a thriller . Eric Christopherson has a wonderful way with words and the ability to successfully combine just the right amount of humor and wit while sustaining the suspense . I look forward to reading more by him .	1
I was completely absorbed by this well-written thriller . Crack-Up tells the story of Argus Ward , the schizophrenic owner of a successful security firm . Argus manages to hide his disease from his colleagues until the voice of Darth Vader tells him to murder the billionaire he was hired to protect . The story moves along at a great pace and I finished it in two sittings . Definitely recommended !	1
H.G . Wells is one of my favorite writers . If you want some good reading this is an awesome collection . Many of his most famous writings are in this collection . You wo n't be disappointed , I know I was n't .	1
Life on the Old Plantation in Ante-Bellum Days is well written and well researched . It is an accurate historical account , and I recommend it .	1
`` How to Write a Great Query Letter '' by Noah Lukeman is an excellent reference guide for how to write an effective query letter . Lukeman is a long-time literary agent , so he knows what agents want to see in a query letter . He is very detailed about how to properly construct a query letter and he covers all the bases.In the book , Lukeman talks about the importance of preparation by thoroughly researching agents . He discusses the best and worst query letter formatting techniques . Then he breaks apart the query letter paragraph by paragraph and explains key features to include and mistakes to avoid - for both fiction and nonfiction . Lastly , he goes over final issues , including common mistakes writers make with their query letters . The end of the book includes a checklist for writers for when they craft their query letter.Even though I 'm a self-published author , I can see how this book is a great resource for new writers interested in seeking an agent or publisher . It is evident , that by following the suggestions in the book , the writer will develop a highly effective query letter that is clear , concise , direct , full of the important traits that agents are looking for , and free of nonessential information . I highly recommend this book to writers to read before they query any agents or publishers .	1
Has some very interesting information on how to write a good query letter . I have n't finished reading it but I am sure everything with help me in my writing process .	1
I loved this story . It was short and in typical LL fashion , a little empty on the plot , but man o man , I loved the characters in this one . The female lead was a ballbuster without being a total nasty witch about it . She seemed like a normal woman , someone you would enjoy having as a friend . I enjoyed the way she and Tarek talked and dealt with each other . I actually LIKED her , which is sort of hard for me with LL books . Her men are really alpha , and tortured and so awesome , but the females tend to be the same , witchy , argumentative , and stubborn . Not so with Lyra . Very sassy , and very fun . A very fitting mate for Tarek . And him ... sigh . I loved him . The things he said to her , the way he was with her . A+ for me . I thought that no one could beat Dash from 'Elizabeth 's wolf ' , but Tarek is definitely up there for me . The only reason I gave it a four instead of a five was because of the haphazard way the plot was tacked on at the end.I mean , I 'd totally forgotten about the danger Lyra was in until the very end . LOL , and then it was rushed . But it works in this case 'cause it 's a short story . Other than that , the steamy scenes were extra hot , the dialogue was fun , and the characters were very lovable . Great job LL !	1
I loved the back and forth of Tarek and Lyra - their dialogue was hilarious ! I found this short all the more intriguing for the fact that Tarek was trying to live a somewhat normal life - and something about that was endearing . In spite of what the book implies , that he has no clue about many things from yardwork to cooking , I think there are some men like that out there ( I ought to know..I married one ! LOL ) so it was n't as strong a premise for me.The sex was great , as always , erotic , steamy , and gritty . Do n't read these if you ca n't take it . No `` throbbing loins '' or `` flower petal '' type stuff here . Lots of graphic language and acts . HOT ! The reason for the 4 stars when I actually enjoyed this as much as some of her full length novels ? A nitpick to be sure but it seemed like there was at least a `` , though '' at the end of many sentences . When they could have just ended . It , literally , pulled me out of the story enough for me to reduce the rating . I 'm not normally picky about grammar and typo 's - but this had me clenching my teeth ( when I OUGHT to have been clenching other body parts - BUMMER ! ) !	1
While a very short set it was a good read . It introduces characters I was unfamiliar with . I enjoy this series so it was a bonus to find it . Am actively looking for more .	1
A very good story of the Breeds & the battles they must fight to keep the freedom they want & need .	1
I have all of this series and can not wait for the next release . So HOT and sexy . A must read .	1
Horror anthologies have been scant this year and I bought this last years ' collection not knowing what to expect . Well , what a pleasant surprise . The stories are B+ to A , fresh and interesting . The best for me , `` The Wild Hunt , '' where the veil between the living and dead is ripped open on the winter solstice . Tried to find another Spinetinglers on the Kindle , but unfortunately none . Highly recommended .	1
A mixed bag of stories in here , but still worth the purchase.I would purchase future editions of this anthology .	1
picked this on a whim because it was cheap , glad I did , and excellent array of stories and ideas , ca n't wait until my next splurge when I can pick up the rest	1
As other reviewer have done a great job of summarizing the book , I wo n't repeat the summary here . I was nervous about purchasing the book based on the idea that it was 3 short stories . It 's not that price was an issue - the author set a very low price which more than compensated for the length of the book . I was just a little leery because of the basic limitation in shorter works . In a short story , the author has very little time & space to set up the characters . In a fantasy setting , where the author has to set up a world for the characters and then set up the characters , short fiction is even harder and it takes a lot of talent for an author to overcome this . I thought Ms. Schneider did a great job . The world-building was a little sketchy but the characters and the story content more than compensated.My only complaint is that I 'd really like to see more stories , or better yet a novel , set in this world . While there were n't any loose ends in the stories themselves , there are endless possibilities .	1
Why do people read fantasy ? Why do they want to believe in magic ? Is it something to do with religion ? Who knows ? Some academic somewhere has probably written a paper on the subject . My hunch is that it 's related deep down to a desire for happy endings , common in we humans . As a skeptical guy who has a handle on reality ( I like to think so ) I 've never read much fantasy - although I do like the Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter movies , which is something of a contradiction I suppose ( like the man who reads Playboy for the articles I watch fantasy movies for the special effects ) . If you 're like me and you 're searching for an introduction to a genre that you might have previously avoided , you could do a lot worse than read these stories . The secret is to suspend disbelief and go with the flow . Do n't allow logic or reason to interfere . These fantasies do what they need to do : ensure that good triumphs over evil , that magic wins out in the end , that friends and family are important , and that endings are always happy ( well , happy-ish anyway ) . Along the way , you might even learn a thing or two about herbs .	1
It was an unexpected pleasure to find a different kind of 'hero ' in an interesting story . After 44 years of voracious reading of science fiction and fantasy , it takes something both new and well written to get my interest . Maria E. Schneider succeeded on both counts . Try it ; I bet you 'll like it too !	1
Pete Toleffson is in Konigsburg , Texas because his brother Cal has finally convinced his fiance Docia to have a wedding ceremony . He 's Cal 's best man , but he has no idea what a best man is supposed to do , exactly . He 's pretty sure he 's not supposed to punch his brother , but the impulse is there every time he catches sight of Calthorpe 's ever-present and perpetually satisfied grin . It 's not that Pete begrudges his brother 's happiness , but Pete 's in a strange town full of stranger people and ragged from his job as a county attorney - a job that he tends to obsess over ... to the point that he ca n't remember the last time he took a vacation . Staying away from his email and voicemail while he 's in Konigsburg takes conscious intensive effort , and he could buy stock in the antacid company that keeps his acid reflux in check . Supporting his brother through The Wedding from hell might just be his undoing.If sheer force of will and hard work can make The Wedding go as planned , Janie Dupree 's life would be a lot less complicated . Unfortunately , everything about The Wedding seems destined to a calamitous end despite all her efforts and the best man is absolutely no help . Not to mention , he 's rude . Cute though . But Janie 's seeing someone ... sort of ... even if he is boring and self-involved . And then there 's The Wedding , which is taking every single ounce of self control and mental fortitude to deal with.Just when Pete is starting to relax , and starting to more than notice Janie and even step up a little in his best man role , Toleffsons start to pour into Konigsburg and it becomes painfully clear that the town is definitely not big enough for all of them . Neither Pete nor Janie would put money on surviving The Wedding intact.Since stumbling acrossVenus in Blue Jeans : Konigsburg , Texas Book 1when it was offered as a free Kindle download on Amazon.com , I 've become totally addicted to the town and inhabitants of Konigsburg , Texas , and thoroughly pleased with Meg Benjamin as an author . With a smooth , crisp writing style that highlights the strength of the series - the quirky characters that populate Konigsburg - and makes the narrative flow surprisingly well with whatever crazy situations those characters find themselves , Benjamin has a gem of a series on her hands . As I was withVenus in Blue Jeans , I was surprised and impressed with just how quick and fun a read Wedding Bell Blues is , and credit the author for both the fluidity of the narrative and the charm of the characters and setting.I liked Pete and Janie - perhaps not quite as much as Cal and Docia , but still they were a pleasure to read about . I do n't think Pete 's character was quite as well developed in the beginning of this book as Cal 's had been in his , so the evolution of Pete 's character from sourpuss jerk to nice guy was a bit subtle , but I enjoyed the results all the same . The Wedding is a good foil for the book , though the insular nature of wedding preparations did slightly diminish the role of the town and townspeople as the forces of nature they were in the first book . What it provided , however , was a surprisingly realistic and occasionally tragic conflict with the Toleffson and Dupree families ' dynamic.There was little smooth about that dynamic . With one brother whose wife is a vapid trollop with the maternal instinct most cobras would envy , a mother who disapproves of everything and anything , and an eldest brother with far too much bad history to forgive , Pete 's family was pretty much nightmarish . I did n't much care for the mother or the sister-in-law , but thought it was great storytelling . Janie 's got some conflict with her mother over the guy she 's seeing and she allows herself to be a bit of a doormat in a couple of places when being nice did n't serve her very well , but I actually know people just like her so there was definitely a sense of realism to her character.As much as I wish a couple of the less than pleasant people in the book got more of a comeuppance , I appreciated the story as a whole and was thrilled to see the direction it 's taking . I had a bit of an issue in the previous book with the speed with which Cal and Docia got together , and for my personal preferences , the relationship between Pete and Janie developed in a far more pleasing time frame , right up until the end . There was a massive leap in development towards the end that seemed abrupt and precipitous , but overall I enjoyed the entirety of their relationship.I thinkVenus in Blue Jeanswas a bit more quirky in both character and story , and just a touch more charming because of it , but Wedding Bell Blues was a more complex tale that provided more depth with the familial issues and in my personal opinion , was more realistic with an overall better plot . I 've become a huge fan of Benjamin and this series and am looking forward to continuing withBe My Baby : Konigsburg , Texas , Book 3 . I 've enjoyed the Toleffsons and love the town and people of Konigsburg . I ca n't wait to return . 4.5 Stars.Originally reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another .	1
Tidal Wave by Vivian Arend*I won this book from a contest by the author*Tidal Wave is set in the small seaside town of Jaffrey 's Cove where the majority of the residents are merfolk . Alexia 's grandmother is the leader of the pod but she 's tired and ready to pass the task on to Alexia . She gives her a beautiful necklace but does n't reveal the medallion 's secrets to Alexia.Alexia has spent her summers in Jaffrey 's cove for years and has always felt connected to it . Now she is back to help her grandmother get settled into a new home . She is drawn to the sea but does n't understand its call . She has been having dreams for years of a young boy she met her first summer there , Joshua but now he 's all grown up.Joshua has been in love with Alexia since she agreed to let him kiss her . After that summer , he was sent away when she would come to visit . Now he is grown up and determined to make Alexia his.One night during a storm , Alexia is drawn to the ocean and a chain of events is set off that ca n't be stopped.Alexia is confused and hurt when she finds out the secret of the necklace and what her role in the future of Jaffrey 's Cove will be . She ca n't believe her gram has kept this secret from her all these years . She is shocked by her behavior with Joshua and Anthony . She is drawn to them and ca n't walk away from either one.Joshua knows what he wants and intends to go after it . Everyone discounted him because he kept to himself but what they did n't realize was he was biding his time until Alexia returned . Anthony is the quite one , the peace maker . He had no plans of helping rule the pod , until he met Alexia and all plans changed.I love the interaction between the main characters . I am proud of Alexia for handling Michael when he forced himself on her . Gram is one of my favorite characters . She has a lot of spunk and does n't take no for an answer . She is proud of Alexia and does n't want her to feel embarrassed or ashamed for the way she is feeling.Tidal Wave pulled me in from the moment I picked it up . The story flowed effortlessly with a great plot and smoking hot sex scenes . I read it in one sitting and ca n't wait for Whirlpool to come out . I give Tidal Wave 4 flaming hearts .	1
ok so the reason I gave this book 4.5 stars , was because it was too short ... Otherwise this story was FREAKING HOT ! ! but , BEWARE if you are not into menage , or guy on guy then this book might just not be the one you want to read . Its super steamy and sexy and blew me away with the sex scenes . I think this author really did a great job on writing this story . It was extremely creative , and who would have thought a game like that would bring them together . This book was super cute , In the beginning Charlie did n't realize how she felt about the men who have been in her life for many years , they scared away the men she brought home , interrogated them whenever she brought dates to dinner , and it just never occurred to her that they might all have feelings for her . one of the guys she has a strong connection to his name is Simon and he seems like he has always been in love with her . Her and Simon have the strongest connection compared to the other two men . Then there is Rafael and Eric , and they both have liked each other ( the men ) and they just never hooked up because they did n't want to ruin what they had with Charlie . Until this cruise happened , they never tried anything with each other , and when it finally happens and they take chances and risks , Charlie gets scared and runs away . But will she realize that she has wanted them all along ? Will they realize that she was the connection to all of them being able to love each other ? READ this book and find out , i promise you wont regret it , it will make you HOTT ! ! make sure you have a fan handy ! LOL	1

Charli 's perfectly comfortable with the simple fact that she 's the only female in her small group of friends . She 's a tomboy who loves Couch Potato Thursdays and watching sports with them .

' What will happen when the fantasy is over and the wedding party returns to reality ? R . G. Alexander 's THREE FOR ME ? is a very hot romance between several longtime friends that takes place in an exotic location . The friendship between Charli , Simon , Eric and Rafael is extremely strong and it 's obvious that none of them want to risk losing that bond , but the love they feel goes beyond friendship . The Race Erotic starts off as a challenge to all of them ; however , by the end of the ` game , ' it 's taken on a more significant role in their lives . Ms. Alexander allows readers to live out their naughty fantasies through these characters erotic encounters in paradise but she also satisfies that need plenty of emotional impact as well as a ` happily-ever-after .

The second Orion series bookCaptain Steve Craig does n't mix business with pleasure , his romances happen off the ship so as to not cause a conflict of interest later . Tessa Alligon is a cadet with Serpentian Guard aboard the Orion.Tessa and Steve have chemistry and being partnered for hand to hand combat training only enhances that.When Tessa and Captain Steve have a hot and steamy night of no holds barred sex and then Steve tells Tessa it can never happen again things get tense.As with the first Orion book we have a sub-plot involving other characters that provides for more action and suspense . Once again we have a fantastic mixture of sci-fi , romance , action and suspense.The universe created for these novels is amazingly complex without being so involved that you need a map and a users guide to keep up.This second book in the series is as good as the first , without a doubt another panty wringer to enjoy .	1
NO SPOILERS or plot summaries . Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL : Book 1 of an erotic , paranormal romance series that boasts a wide variety of fae creatures from Sidhe to vampires to leprechauns and dragons . Stories are fun and light , while also full of magic and heavily lusty sex . There is some lighter bondage and toy play . This is a short book , quick read , not quite completely satisfying , but definitely an intriguing start to a series that could be a TON of fun . ( I 've read book 2 and it 's even better ! ) PLOT : Nice pacing with plenty of tension , but abruptly resolved . The plot managed to encompass not only the central couple , but also their family and introduced us to the greater politics of the magical world . I notice other reviewers thought there was too much plot for this to be erotica- I ca n't agree . I ca n't enjoy something that does n't offer stakes greater than the central romance . This book offers both nicely . It was resolved too fast , though . It also suffered BIG TIME from First Book Syndrome where it spends too many of its short pages setting future books.CHARACTERS & ROMANCE : Leo and Ruby were both good characters and it was a sweet romance . Ruby was definitely the stronger of the two- it was nice to have a girl who was a more natural shape . I loved her smart mouth . Leo was n't really developed enough , but still sexy . Their attraction was a little too fast , but still satisfying . The scene using the toys was a bit surprising though- not as well done as I 've seen in other books . It kinda came out of left field , so I can see why other reviewers were n't thrilled with it . That kind of thing can be highly erotic when done properly , but it was a bit clumsy here . Aside from that , though , this was a strong romance- I really wanted these two to stay together . The plot worked nicely around them.BOTTOM LINE : Strong opening to a series . It gives a little bit of everything- sweet romance , funny characters , rich magical world , lusty sex , and plenty of action . It might have been better as a longer story , but overall I really enjoyed it.RECOMMENDATIONS:1 . R.G . Alexander 's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series : Regina in the Sun ( Children of the Goddess ) 2 . Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave : Forces of Nature , Book 1- a light , lusty read with frolicking dolphins3 . Anya Bast'sWitch Fire ( Elemental Witches , Book 1 ) - sweet , sexy para-romance with witches , demons and more4 . Kresley Cole 's adventurous and intricate magical romance series ( never mind the ridiculous title ) : A Hunger Like No Other ( Immortals After Dark , Book 1 ) 5 . Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob ( The Nightwalkers , Book 1 ) - demons , were , vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy6 . Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound ( Demonica , Book 1 ) - demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city . Not as well written as the others.7 . Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters , vamps and Greek gods . The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.8 . Renee Michaels ' sexually adventurous , but basic werewolf romanceHer Chosen Wolf : The Were Chronicles , Book 19 . J.R. Ward'sDark Lover ( Black Dagger Brotherhood , Book 1 ) - darker , more violent and incredibly intense vampire romance series . Vampires protect the world from evil . Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.10 . Lara Adrian'sKiss of Midnight ( The Midnight Breed , Book 1 ) - also darker , more violent , but incredibly intense . Vampires protect the world from their evil brethren .	1
Thank my LUCKY CHARMS I finished this book . I was very skeptical about a book that had `` magic '' in it , however I found myself able to follow the storyline very well . I could easily see this book as a movie . As I read the book I found that I could picture every scene as the writer laid it out . I could even picture each character and their demeanor . I really enjoyed this book the story line . The ending was not what I expected and left me with a smile on my face as I finished the last page . Definetely a good read for any first time mythical , magical , other rhelm readers like myself .	1
A real winner by Dana Marie Bell . A Sidhe lord with a twist of leprechaun and you get Leo , a sidhe lord you will love and his quirky little mate Ruby , will give you a read you wo n't soon forget . Well worth the price . Looking forward to book two in this series .	1
My first book from this genre and I was hooked . Leo the stud muffin salivates when near one of the office girls whom he has only seen from the rear . After careful planning he makes it his mission with the help of another to get to meet her and hopefully win her around . The story evolves with twists about the man that I did n't expect as I did n't read any reviews and bought this purely because it was a cheap read and needed something to read one evening . I 'm glad that I took the chance because if I had read the details I probably would have passed . I 'm reading the second book in this saga and fully intend to read the third next . I have bonded with the characters as the writer makes them interesting and personable.I will definitely read more from this author as I like her style but find the graphic sex not warranted as the characters stand alone and win your interest purely on their own merit . A rewarding tale that keeps your interest as you are introduced to other family members each with a story of their own to tell .	1
I 'm not to big on the whole fantasy thing , but I loved this book . It does have some good hot scenes but it also has a good plot and story to go along with it . Interesting .	1
I really enjoyed this book , a wonderful start to a new series . From the way the characters are introduced , how they meet each other , how their journey begins to how their journey ends , it is a wonderful story.I liked the fact that this story had a wide range of supernatural in it as well , not simply a vampire or shape-shifter . I have to say that this is the first time that I have had a Hob be , what appears to be , a central character in a series . Another fun change that I am sure will expand in the books to come.I love how these two met , and no I wo n't give away details & thus ruin the story , and I loved the extended family aspect as well ; all of which will play a role in future stories I imagine . The antagonist was a lovely , wicked **tch whom could n't stand that she could not have what her demented mind demanded . The other antagonist had a very meaningful , albeit very brief , and gruesome ending as well . It was another first for a characters ending ! I have enjoyed this Authors books thus far , she writes easy to follow , believable stories that leave you rooting for the characters . It is not very often that I give a book a 5-star rating , mostly going as high as 4-stars , so that should speak of my enjoyment of this book . I have already purchased the others in the series , 3 more , and look forward to starting the next immediately . Enjoy ! : )	1
What a page turner . It is sexy and exciting . The ending left me wanting to find out what happened next . I will definitely be looking for the next book .	1
It 's an interesting and exciting book . I would recommend any adult to read this book . It has an exciting twist that very unexpected .	1
Nice , hot and short read ! ! A few editing errors but was still a good read . Loved Cory , a true Alpha male .	1
Stephanie Lewis is the new housekeeper for Cory Booker and his father . On the run from an abusive ex , she does n't trust easily nor does she let down her guard . She ca n't afford to - she has someone innocent to protect.Cory Booker is an ex rodeo cowboy turned rancher . Never one to want a woman for more than one night at a time , he is somewhat taken aback by his feelings for his new housekeeper . The fact that he senses she is hiding something keeps him on his toes and ever watchful . He knows without a doubt that she is in trouble and vows to himself that she will be safe - in his arms.Stephanie was a classic case of abuse . Made to feel worthless for years , she was striving to become more independent even while trying her best to stay hidden . Her trust in men was non-existent , and I loved watching Cory change her mind and begin to make her believe in forever.Slow paced at times , Cory 's Salvation was a good read . I found myself often getting so immersed in the story that I forgot where I was . Cory and Stephanie 's story is timeless , and while at first I did n't think Cory was hero material , my mind quickly changed . Cory 's Salvation tugged at my heart strings with its romance and sensuality . I will definitely read another book by this author.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
Briony Swift is a college math professor . Her life is ordered and calculated and well , boring . She flies the straight and narrow and ca n't remember the last time she did anything fun or risqu & eacute ; . Not the type of person to draw attention to herself , Briony knows that the hidden attraction she feels for two of her students is totally wrong and refuses to explore her feelings . When the two men in question , Nic Potter and Leo Phelps , come to her office to get her to sign a form , all bets are off because once her name is on their drop/add slips , these two men are no longer her students . And that scares Briony most of all.Two Plus One is a risqu & eacute ; and rambunctious romp of erotic goodness . Leo and Nic are naughty but nice and they are exactly what Briony needed in her life . Briony needed them in her life and they were good for her as well as good to her . The sex is hot , the love scenes emotional and the storyline engaging . I really liked Two Plus One - other readers will as well.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I 've been reading through several of this author 's books , and I have yet to be disappointed . This is a good , sweet read and the sex scenes are steamy . Icicle anyone ? However , like some of her other works and like other reviewers have mentioned , this story is really short . Just when we start to like these characters the book is over . Still worth reading , but it would be nice if she paired a couple of these shorter stories together .	1
This reads like a piece of literature . It is wordy , but it lends to the flavor of the times . It was interesting how fossils were worked into this . It made me want to some research on the history of fossil quarries .	1
this one is better than the previous one . the hero and the heroine are better . they are strong and they had high moral values . i loved both of them .	1
This is the 3rd book in the Rachel Myers Murder Mystery series . I am enjoying this series very much . If you like cozy mysteries , mountains , horses , chamber music , or plants you can not go wrong with these books . The series is set in the mountains of North Carolina near the Virginia line and the Blue Ridge Parkway . In this book Rachel 's friend and gardener , disappears . Rachel follows her logic and stumbles into danger . Fast paced page turner , this book will not disappoint !	1
Never a dull moment . I got caught up from the first few pages in Rachel 's friend Danny going missing . But the cold case of a similar disappearance really wraps you up tight . Throw in a little environmental criminal activity and you 've got yourself a great book to settle in with for a few evenings .	1
I really enjoyed this book . Very smooth writing . It kept me hooked from the beginning until the end . It did end a little abruptly though . I was really hoping for more . Still good though .	1
A must-read for anyone that has ever or will ever deal with the problems of caring for an elder with cognitive impairment . I did n't find the story sad due to the courage , support and love all the family members showed in times of crisis . Each of them might have been flawed but they still were able to pull together and find a way to cope.Even with a disease that can rob an elder of dignity the author gave the grandfather his own special brand of value and charm without down playing the very difficult of job of caring for someone that is n't able to see to his own needs anymore . It was n't grim , it was n't sappy ... . it was magnificent and inspiring . If I could have given this book ten stars I would have .	1
This was a nice story to read once you got past all the comparisons to everything . This would be appropriate for any reader . I gave this 4 stars for a couple of reasons . For example ... One , some of the descriptions were annoying . I know what the color of grass is and do n't have to be told every time the grass is mentioned . Two , the author would describe something and compare it to what was just written to make us see fully I suppose . If you enjoy that type of thing , that 's great and I enjoy it in some instances to get a clearer picture of what is being described but some things do n't need anything further . Three , the story ended abruptly . I did n't see it coming as quickly as it did.Even after saying all that , I really enjoyed reading this and would like to read more of the story . The characters were awesome and I could picture the story in my mind while reading.CST	1
When I downloaded this book I was expecting the usual Young Adult fantasy story . And in fact it started off that way . But I realized that the relatively slow pace of time through the book meant that the author was planning quite a long epic story . And I love epic fantasy books . So I enjoyed that this first book just barely started the story . We lived through the childhood years in which Jahrra behaves rather like a typical child with all the immature decision making that goes along with it . However we begin to see the bigger picture little by little through the stories she 's told . And we see signs of the person she 's going to grow up to be . So many books these days try to cram far too much into a single book . I really like the fact that it 's going to take a few of them to tell the whole story . It 's true that there is n't a whole lot of action in this book but there was plenty for me . I immediately bought book 2 and read it upon finishing this one .	1
After spending most of my time reading zombie books , I decided to read this after it suggested to me by a friend . At first it was very slow going but many books are . I did suffer from some confusion about what happened at the beginning causing the downfall of so much . The survival and the aiding of victims really got me going though . I love hearing about people getting together to help those not only survive but to live . So many people are victims but this story showed how they were given a chance to live and defend themselves . Having 3 different groups finally meeting up at the end was another aspect I loved . I am now looking forward to reading more of the Peacekeepers .	1
Pretty neat book ! I enjoyed the manner in which all the loose ends were tied up . Knowing there are more books to follow in this series , it is not as though you are the edge of a cliff ! The solar powered car is incredible . Talk about an arsenal at your fingertips ! Also , a lot of information on staying alive after a disaster.Highly recommended !	1
I have only read the first book in the Peacekeepers series , so my impressions are not colored by whatever happens subsequently . When I read The Birth a while back , I was not able to figure out where the author wanted to go . He spent a lot of time talking about survival tips , which presumes that one is fortunate enough to survive a natural ( or is it unnatural ? ) disaster . For example , you can have a building collapse on an individual , and all the survivalist knowledge in that person 's head is useless if he or she ca n't get free of the rubble.That being said , the book picks up steam once the main character starts moving across the post-apocalyptic America . The author offers an interesting view of what happens when law and order breaks down in society.The Birth of the Peacekeepers offer a ton of action , and some introspection . And at a bargain price of 99 cents for the Kindle version , this book is worth every penny .	1
This was an amazing story , you are really drawn in . The character development is well done . I highly recommend this series . As of this writing there are nine books in the series . It will be well worth the price . Once you start you will not want to stop , the plot is addictive . Do n't say you were not warned . Enjoy .	1
I was positive that I 'd already reviewed this . But since I ca n't find it , let 's see what I can do.I loved this book , especially knowing that at the time there were six more coming , now seven . Once I find an author I like , it 's nice to know that he 's written enough books to keep me busy for a while ; ) Yes , there are some errors , but if the story is good enough , I can overlook them . This one is good enough , and it gets better as the series continues.Keep reading this series ; if you made it through the first one , you 'll love what 's coming up .	1
I will admit to being a little wary before starting this fourth book in the Tri-Omega Mates series . I had read the blurb and , frankly , I was n't very impressed by Saul and his willingness to cheat on his mate . I did n't even know the characters yet and I was angry . I 'm sure you can understand how I felt.Poor Ryce has been dealing with Saul going out every Friday night to get himself a little `` young thing '' leaving Ryce feeling betrayed and devastated . Ryce truly feels that he needs Saul far more than Saul needs him so he makes the decision to go find his own Friday night hook-up . What he finds is way more than a casual hook-up . He finds Cary , a gorgeous Tri-omega , and Ryce 's other mate . Ryce claims him and takes him to wait for Saul to return and claim Cary also . Well , Saul comes home and finds Ryce in bed , asleep , with Cary and Saul freaks out . He says horrible , mean things to Cary resulting in Cary taking off , Ryce finds out , and he and Saul come to blows . Wow - it was pretty drama queen there for a bit.Interestingly enough , Saul has some major baggage and secrets that he 's never shared with Ryce in the five years they 've been mated . Yeah , I know , it sounded pretty darn selfish to me , too , but it 's a pretty big secret and Saul is convinced he 'll lose Ryce over it . Of course , silly man that he is , it does n't seem to occur to him that he 'll lose Ryce anyway over the Friday night `` playthings '' ! I ended up really liking this story and , in fact , I almost think they 're getting progressively better . If you like shifters , hot men , hotter sex , and intrigue then this is the book for you !

I 've read many books from Stormy Glenn . While hardly literary masterpieces , I hold them to an admittedly lower standard than I do other novels . They 're fun and sexy and are very light , but entertaining , reads . While I normally rate her books between three and four stars , I gave this one a five star review because it did evoke some heartfelt emotions.Ryce and Saul are mated werewolves . They 're deeply in love with each other . The only blemish on their relationship is that Saul heads into town every Friday night to seemingly `` sow his oats '' . This slowly eats away at Ryce , and their relationship is gradually going down the tubes , even though Ryce is still hopelessly in love with Saul.When Ryce 's frustration reaches epic proportions , he decides to head into town too to see if he can have some fun . There , he runs into Cary and recognizes Cary as his mate . Cary is a tri-omega , a werewolf assigned two mates to help keep them grounded . Once claimed by one mate though , a tri-omega must be claimed by the other in the near future , or die . Even after claimed by both , they must be continually claimed every few days or they whither away . Ryce knows a bit about tri-omegas . He knows that fate does n't assign a tri-omega two mates without those two mates being assigned to each other . Since he and Saul are mates , Saul must also be Cary 's mate , so Ryce goes and claims Cary . When Saul comes home though and finds Cary and Ryce asleep together , he 's heartbroken and feels betrayed , even though he knows he 's been putting Ryce through the same thing . Cary leaves Ryce asleep in the bed and comes downstairs to meet Saul , but the drunken heartbroken Saul is so jealous and angry , he sends Cary away.The is one of the better stories of the series . There 's a lot of emotional angst . We have Cary feeling the elation of discovering his two mates and finally being mated , only to be thrown out by Saul and knowing that he 'll die soon without them . We have Ryce who can not abide by Saul 's cheating excursions into town anymore , but still is madly in love with him . We have Saul feeling great self-shame over what he does every week and the fact that it hurts Ryce so much . And then we have the growing realization that whatever it is that Saul does every week , it 's not cheating , it 's forced upon him , and he must keep his mouth shut and let everyone think he 's a scumbag for their own protection.There 's some nicely heartfelt scenes in the story that surprise . Such as an argument between Saul and Ryce that turns into lovemaking , but during the lovemaking , it becomes apparent to Ryce that this is Saul 's goodbye . Another piece of dialog that tugs the heart is a conversation with Micah , another tri-omega that can sense emotions . While everyone is sure Saul is cheating , Micah informs them that whatever Saul is doing , he 's not cheating . Micah can feel Saul 's love for Ryce , and it almost fully consumes every other emotion and is the driving force behind Saul . These touches at heartfelt romance to the story , elevating it above just normal erotica.It 's a pretty complex tale that is sexy , romantic , exciting , and intriguing . It 's one of Ms. Glenn 's better stories in the series . I normally would n't give a five-star review to light tales like this , but since it does rise above the others , I passed on an extra star to it .	1
I found it quite enjoyable to read . I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Sasha and Vadim . I hope to see them in some future work . Look forward to reading more move l s by Stormy Glenn .	1
Werewolf Vadim Miroslav is surprised when a man runs into his father 's study , terrified and needing a place to hide . He 's even more astonished when the man 's scent reveals that he 's Vadim 's mate . As soon as he gets rid of the men searching for their omega , he sets about claiming his mate.Sashenka , otherwise known as Sasha , has spent years being tormented and mistreated by his pack Alpha . When he stumbles upon Vadim , he 's more than ready to be claimed and protected from the cruel Valeriya . After years of bad treatment , however , he 's afraid to trust . And Alpha Valeriya does n't seem to want to let him go ... My Lupine Lover is a fast-paced werewolf tale . Protective Vadim makes an excellent match for Sasha , who 's alternately fearful , playful , and tough . There are a lot of secondary characters , mostly other pack members , friends , and the eminently hate-able villains . The revelations of Sasha 's past are interesting . My problem with My Lupine Lover is that everything happens with lightning speed . Vadim claims Sasha within a few minutes of meeting him . Sascha seems to get over his mistreatment a lot more quickly than I found believable . Vadim was a bit too perfect . My Lupine Lover was a fun read , and I enjoyed it , but I could n't help feeling that the book could have been great , had there been a bit more emotional conflict to go along with the external ones . That said , fans of m/m and werewolves who are in the mood for a quick read will most likely find My Lupine Lover fits the bill.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
This second book of the Peacekeeper series builds on the first book . It is actually sort of 3 acts , so it provides some good variety.Act I - an old nemesis ; Act II - Circus Animals ( and who does n't like a circus ? ) andAct III - a set-peace battle against the Marauders , only this time much bigger and badder than before ! We even get an upgrade to the Peacekeeper itself , learn a hidden new feature and have a primary new scientist join the adventure.If you liked the first book , this is a good read , as it continues the saga without just repeating the story from Book 1 .	1
Dessa is a dryad who lives in one of the last existing forests in Afghanistan . With war tearing through her country , the forests are disappearing at an alarming rate , and most of the dryads have disappeared to live among mortal people . Dessa aches with loneliness , and her greatest desire is to have a daughter of her own to love and to help her protect the forest . When she meets the American Marine Second Lieutenant Nick Leandros , he warns her to leave the area , but she refuses , believing that she will be able to protect both her forest and the people who reside close by . The airstrike that follows kills the people who refused to leave , decimates her forest , and sends Dessa running ... to the mortal world.Nick is wracked with guilt over the death of the shepherd family , especially the children . The resulting post traumatic stress disorder causes him to not only go AWOL from the military , it also changes his very being from man to chimera . Now instead of one , he is three , wandering the world broken and without conscience . It 's not until he encounters Dessa five years later that he comes to understand the monster he has become.When she encounters Nick by chance in the Australian casino where she works , something within him calls to Dessa . He resounds of her lost forest . The years she has spent in the mortal world have not diluted her yearning for a daughter , and even though he is unwilling , she knows that Nick is her mate destined to give her a child . If she has to tether him , bind him to her with her dryad magic in order to get what she needs , so be it . They are both broken by war ; can they possibly make each other whole again ? Maybe instead of the bindings of magic , what they need is the healing power of the human heart . ********In her novella Wild , Tethered , Bound , Stephanie Draven gives us an intriguing and emotional tale of pain , guilt , and the healing powers of love . This story mixes the brutal realism of war with creatures of mythos , giving us a reading experience that is both pleasurable and absolutely unique . This is no simple throw-away romance . While this novella is quite short , Ms. Draven packs a lot into its pages , and I found myself dwelling on it well after I had read the final page.Ms . Draven gives us strong and complicated characters in Dessa and Nick . Neither is what you would typically expect to find residing within the pages of a romance novel . Not only is Dessa a magical being surrounded with the mystique of an immortal , but she is strong and determined and hell-bent on obtaining that which she desires the most . She is also vulnerable enough to catch our sympathy , especially when she sees how her actions affect Nick.Nick is fascinating . He is a chimera , equal parts dragon , lion , and goat , but he is human as well and a very damaged and fragmented soul . This presents something of a puzzle to the reader . Is he really a chimera of myth ? Is the split within him physical or simply psychological ? I found myself repeatedly posing this question to myself as I read this story . Ms. Draven does an excellent job presenting Nick as three separate beings who are in actuality one person , and when this spills over into the story 's love scene , the results are surprisingly sensual.In all , I found Wild , Tethered , Bound to be readable , entertaining , and quite thought-provoking . The blend of fantasy and reality that this story offers us is exceptional , and the conflict and characters ensnared me . Ms. Draven is a writer to watch , I believe , and I am extremely interested to see what she comes out with next .	1
Do you like steam ? Who does n't ? ! My face was red as firecracker in the midst of reading this novel ! The chimera mythology tied to PTSD and the soldier created an unique experience . Normally , one would expect that the chimeran-man would transform into a beast instead of becoming three separate beings . Adding in a wood nymph , a VERY sensual one I might add , was a remarkable choice . Initially , I thought why a nymph and a chimera ? But as the story unfolded , it made sense and the steam rose in the room.The descriptions were eloquent . I laughed at quite a number of places , which I wo n't spoil for others , but the comedic timing was dead on . Ms. Draven 's choice to use gambling metaphors and terms while in the casino and continuing to use that theme for certain characters enriched the flavor of language . The ending has to be another favorite . Spot on . I giggle aloud at the choice .	1
So far I 've read the first seven books in this series , and I 'm hooked . I 'm ready to start book 8 ; all I can say is , Ricky Sides , keep writing ! I 've come to really like most of the characters . They 're consistent from book to book . The farther I go into the series , the more sci-fi it feels to me , but I like sci-fi , so I 'm not complaining . I like the idea of this type of fighting machine and wish the US really had one -- or thousands.In some series , after the third or fourth book they start to repeat themselves . Not these . They keep surprising.I 'm going to copy and paste this review for the next five books . It 'll give me more time for reading ; ) I look forward to many more books from Ricky Sides.Note : This is the darkest of the series so far . The enemy is truly demented and frightening .	1
Max Carrados is a blind detective , but he is also a seer like Tieriseas from Greek tragedy , embodying the paradox that `` none are so blind as those who can see . `` This is high quality pulp fiction -- if that 's not an oxymoron -- but I 'm not kidding : these are fine detective stories in the tradition of Philo Vance , Ellery Queen , and other more famous names . All we are saying is `` Give Max a Chance . ''	1
What a lovely look at the journey some might take to love . This is a wonderful treatment of & # 34 ; gay for you & # 34 ; . Cooper Davis has done a wonderful job of character development , realistic emotions and engrossing dialogue . It is nice to see the author take the time to have the readers understand how someone & # 34 ; straight & # 34 ; can fall so hard for someone of the same sex . especially they consider a best friend . While the story is told from Hunter 's POV , you get to know Maxwell as well . Hunter 's journey to Max is very well done . Highly recommended .	1
I agree with other reviewer that it is a very smartly done book . I mean I could not put it down because I was so eager to find out what happened next in the fantasy plot , but I was also pleasantly suprised how well characters were done and how many subtle layers the major characters ' personalities have , especially Drake's.Loved it , will get a paperback too .	1
One of the better options in the series written by this author . The primary focus is the sex scenes , so any meaningful plot is appreciated and this did not disappoint . Decently written characters engaging in pretty hot sex . A good read .	1
This is the third book in the Out of Uniform series . I really enjoyed this story a lot . I was worried that it would n't be as good as the second one because that 's how the first one was . It was better , but I was wrong . I still think that the second book is going to be my favorite one , but this one is right up there . I do suggest that you read this series in order because then you do n't get disappointed or confused . I know that you do n't have to read them in order , it 's just a good idea . I loved how the character Holly from the second book came up with the idea of playing his girlfriend to show that he did have other options instead of waiting for Mackenzie to realize that he was n't like all the other guys she 's dated . I had high expectations for this book after reading the second one and I have to say that I was n't disappointed at all ! I hope the author writes about the two remaining SEAL members because I 'm really enjoying this series so far !	1
Oh , Jodi Redford , you always know how to give a girl what she wants . And by that , of course , I mean that her characters are put into both sexy and harrowing situations and they respond with snark and shenanigans . As it turns out , I like ALL THOSE THINGS ! Mara and Dash are combustible . In a big way . He 's got the sex fae thing going for him , she has wide-eyed naivete coupled with a bouncy hair and a knockout body that distracts Dash at every turn . Quite frankly , the two of them together works for me . The snark ! The quips ! The HAWT kisses ! *swoon*Beside the sexy times , Dash 's thievery skills have landed him in some hot water . Not because he 's bad but because his reputation is JUST THAT GOOD . Mara 's quick mind is able to keep up with him ( he finds that sex-ay , btw ) and she 's driven to succeed in the quest that 's been set before them.Quite frankly , all of Jodi Redford 's books leave me giddy with delight and this one was no different . The sex fae have a certain something that makes them FUN to read . The humans might be considered lower class citizens in this world , but they can hold their own against those they 're pitted against ! ROCK ON , HUMANS ! -Kelly @ Reading the Paranormal	1
Her tales have haunted me since the late fifties . You can place and picture yourself in her stories . The discoveries and mysteries keep you reading until the last page . I highly recommend the majority of her stories .	1
I found my first Andre Norton book in a junior high library many , many moons ago ... and still enjoy reading them just as much now as I did 'back then ' ! The author 's unique writing 'perspective ' let 's me & # 34 ; see & # 34 ; through the eyes of the characters as if I were there ! Highly recommend perusing and reading these books !	1
To start with I have already read the majority of Andre Norton 's stories and enjoyed them . For years , since I was 'forced ' and I do me 'forced ' to discover how exciting a book can be by a knowledgeable step-father , I have been reading , on and off , that is , as I could find them , books by this scribe . They are interesting and imaginable for young and old alike , but then again I have never grown up , so you ca n't count on my objectivity even after my sixty-eight or so plus years .	1
I have read so many books by this Author and loved them all . Enjoyed the softer side . I have reread every one of them I own .	1
Now that I am old , I still enjoy Andre Norton . I can not seem to tell you why but I just do .	1
I looked at one review and had to start to agree with the person . I happen to be completely familiar with Doc 's works . Then I stepped back for a moment and asked my self why was I getting these copies on Kindle to start with.For one I had lost my complete collection of all my SY~FI collections . I had well over ten thousand volumes Some of them I had read two or three times.I wished to see if I could replace some of it with the Kindle editions . I do hope so . Still is it worth the attempt ? For me it is . This is my small attempt to recoup my losses.I not only hope to be able to Get a new start . I also hope that by my purchase of these few titles . I will help to make it worthwhile to the folks interested in creating kindle books . They will say hey some folks are buying lets put out more editions and get more folks buying . So I am trying to get them to make more and you folks to buy more.It kind of reminds me of the old cartoon . The coyote falls in the snow and starts rolling . Or one small snow ball he throws starts to roll down hill Towards him . Away he goes all the time the snowball is growing and growing . Then whummp it hits the take off ramp . sending it towards the sky.We all know what is going to happen we see the small dot on the ground and it is getting bigger and bigger . The one of two things . Wham the coyote get dumped on be ten tons of snowball.The other thing is it is worn away by air friction and back down it comes as only one little flake due to the heat of air friction . Ya just never know do you ? ? Rots of Ruck kindledray	1
E.E . Doc Smith was the first sci fi to range beyond not just earth but to infinity and beyond ... a little dated now , and the stereotypes are a victim of the times he grew up in , it is nevertheless worth reading .	1
I 've read all his series , Skylark , Lensman and Family D'Alembart Series multiple times . this one had some stand alone stories , I presume that preceded the above , that I had n't read . I always enjoy E. E. Doc Smith .	1

Wow ! This is Book 2 of The Realm Shift Trilogy ( Book 1 is The REALM SHIFT ) and picked up seamlessly where book one left off . Another fast-paced , wonderfully depicted story of the continuing battle between good and evil , as well as personal and spiritual growth . The action never stopped ! If you like stories with ships , cannons , swords and castles , ... read this series.I felt like I was on a rollercoaster ... the ending leaving you hovering at the top of the ride , waiting for the next book to take you over the top . Ca n't wait until book 3 is published ! Great read !	1
This was a good read which kept my attention to know what was going to happen to the heroes next . I think if one likes swords and sorcery you need to read this trilogy . The read is a little dark but not overly so , or maybe that this the author 's focus .	1
I loved this part of this series . I just wish it had been longer and I hope there will be more someday . The only problem I had with this book is that words were missing in some sentences and it was very obvious . I 'll miss the characters in this series if no more are ever written in it . They were all very well rounded and real to me . I wo n't bore you with a plot summary as I know other reviewers are fond of doing that . I am also pleased to say that this book had chapter demarcations . It makes it so much easier to know how close you are to the end of a chapter or find a stopping place if you need to do so . If you liked the previous books in this short series , I think you should definitely read this one . Have at it ! Give it a shot because I do n't think you 'll be disappointed .	1
I enjoyed read books by Maya Banks , they have good storylines and characters are very loveable . In this story we see how Emily cope with lost of her husband and love for Donovan brothers . A good read and would tell my friends .	1
This story is so heartfelt , that you just want to cry . A woman , who has her husband killed right in front of her , and because she thinks its her fault , she swears not to sing again . But , her brother-in-laws , who she loved with the same type of love as her dead husband , decide thats not going to happen . Slowly , they make her feel at home and then , they show her their love . There 's some action after that , and that will shock you . It is two men and a women , so some might fight that wrong . This was a well written story , wonderful characters and I loved this book . You GO , Maya Banks.If you read this review and find it lacking something or if I should do something differently , please leave a comment , so I can do better next time .	1
Emily Donovan barely had the strength to live . She had been hanging on by a thread since her husband Sean 's violent abrupt death a year ago because she felt as if she died along with him . It just hurt too much to live . She was shocked when Taggert and Greer showed up to take her back to Montana and the Mountain Pass Ranch she had missed so much . Sean had accepted her love , and did n't try to change her . He accepted that she was in love with he and his brothers , but they could n't . When she declared her love for them all , Taggert and Greer turned her away . Sean was her rock . He picked up the shattered pieces of her soul , and encouraged her to share her gift of song with the world . They had been happy until Sean gave the ultimate gift . He sacrificed his life for hers.When Greer and Taggert finally found Emmy , she was just a shell of her former self . They were desperate to get her home because they felt being home would help her recover from the loss they all felt . The brothers could tell when they got home that she was on the verge of not being able to get over the loss of Sean . They were going to have to live with the guilt of turning Emmy away when in fact they loved her to distraction . That bad judgment set in motion events that could n't be changed . Taggert and Greer only hoped it was n't too late ; they would be able to show Emmy how much they loved her.MB has done it again ! ! I enjoy her stories because she does not tell just another m & eacute ; nage story . She adds other elements that have n't widely been incorporated into stories . Loss , whether you have personally felt it or not , you are drawn into this story from the beginning . This is a very emotional and compelling story . It is so well written that we can feel Emily 's pain , and the torment she is going through . I would have liked for the villains motivations to be more clearly defined , but overall another winner ! !	1
This is the second book in a series.Reining In ( The Network ) is the first book . The two do not stand alone , but that 's what I like about series . You really should read the first one first . I loved how the author revealed her characters in more depth in Phantom Rising and managed to make bad guys good guys in a believable manner . The story moved along very fast and kept me wanting more . I love books that when you have to put them down you just ca n't wait to get back to it . This is one of those books for me . I will say I really enjoyed Reining In but I LOVED Phantom Rising . I 'm so glad I took the time to read this one . This is a quick , fun and enjoyable read that left me wanting more . I definitely recommend it .	1
I really enjoyed this one and thought it ended to soon . The book was really funny , sexy , and well-written . Look forward to reading more of this author 's work . Ca n't beat the price , either .	1
i have n't read a book by this author yet that i did n't like . they are filled with everything that i look for in reading material	1
I already had read all of these books but just had to have the series on my kindle ! These are wonderful reads and as you read each book you are definately pulled right into the next book and even though I have read them all several times I am still pulled right into the next book willingly great job by Gena Showalter and what a wonderful adventure full of imagination and action and of course steamy love scenes . A Must read	1
This buy was great . Got five stories for what would have been the price for one . And I love this author . If you are interested in this genre of books , which has a great spin on Atlantis with vampires , immortals and other creatures , get it . You will not be disappointed .	1
What a fun series . I loved Lord 's of the Underworld and wanted to read more by Showalter so I decided to buy this bundle . I had read one of the books a long time ago and remembered that I did n't like it , so I honestly was n't expecting to really like the books , but the price was just too good to pass up . I 'm so glad I bought them . It took me a while to get into the series ... the dragon story while good was a bit slow at first ... but I am so hooked.A killer dragon falls in love with a human he is supposed to kill , a human hunting for a jewel that gives unmeasurable power finds love while rescuing the 'jewel , ' a nymph who is addicted to sex and does n't ever want to settle down finds his mate in a woman who wants nothing to do with a relationship , ( my personal favorite ) a vampire who had violently lost his mate hundreds of years ago is given another chance at love with a kick-ass amazonian woman , and finally ( my least favorite but it was the shortest so not that bad ) another vampire with a haunted past falls for a cold amazonian woman with an even more haunted past . All but the last story are really good . I stayed up most of the night reading Layel 's story ( the vampire ) and had a blast doing it . It 's definitely a slow start . But once you get into the world its hard to come out . This bundle is definitely worth the price !	1
I rated this book five star because it was a great read , fast short and very good . Tina is a very good writer , I 've almost read everyBook she has written .	1
Definitely worth your time ! I loved everything about it ! The characters are fun and I finished in about 30 minutes .	1
Honestly , I thought about giving this one a 4.5 but then I thought about my reasoning . The only reason I 'd do that is because it was short and sweet . Ok , only because it was short ? I ca n't take off points for it being exactly what it 's meant to be . Although , I really would have loved to learn more about Olivia and her lifestyle . It seemed so fun.There was definitely a fun twist at the end that had my gears spinning but it was fun and lighthearted . Poor Olivia always protesting even up to the last scene . I really loved Olivia . She was so exciting and as I said before I would have loved to learn more about her.While I wanted more , I was definitely happy with what I got . I loved the armband myth and legend it , plus the secret message Olivia had with her cousin Ray . It was all in fun and I enjoyed it . I would have loved more of the same but for a short story it was great !	1

Back in the mid-Eighties , I was working in a used bookstore , and I used to see copies of a book called .357 VIGILANTE , by an author I 'd never heard of named Ian Ludlow . I could tell it was a men 's adventure novel , a genre that was n't nearly as robust then as it had been ten years earlier . I read a lot of those books , but for some reason I do n't think I ever even picked up a copy of .357 VIGILANTE and flipped through it , let alone read it.This is a classic case of not knowing what I was missing.Now , of course , we know that `` Ian Ludlow '' was actually a college student named Lee Goldberg , who went on to become a top-notch novelist , screenwriter , and producer . The .357 VIGILANTE series ran for three books , all published by Pinnacle ( in its original incarnation , not the Pinnacle line that 's now published by Kensington ) . There was a fourth book in the series that was never published at the time . However , Goldberg has brought back all four novels as e-books , which can be fought separately or all together under the title THE JURY SERIES . I just read the first one , now titled JUDGMENT , and it 's a fine novel.You know right away that this is a little different from the usual men 's adventure novel because of the protagonist , Brett Macklin . Most of the men 's adventure heroes had military or law enforcement backgrounds . Brett is an aeronautical engineer who has become a pilot and owns a flying service that does a lot of work with movie companies , providing helicopters for aerial filming . Brett 's father is a beat cop in Los Angeles , though , and it 's his brutal murder in an apparently senseless thrill killing that starts Brett on the road to becoming a vigilante . The killers , members of a gang called the Bounty Hunters , escape justice in the courts , so Brett sets out to deliver some justice of his own , calling himself Mr. Jury.Again , though , Brett is no superhuman men 's adventure hero . He screws up , he gets hurt , he 's lucky not to get killed several times , but eventually he uncovers an even bigger plot that puts a lot of people in danger.This is a really entertaining thrill ride of a story with plenty of sex , violence , humor , social commentary , and great action scenes . When I think about what I was writing when I was in college . . . well , there 's really no comparison . JUDGMENT is the work of someone who was a solid pro , right from the first page . Highly recommended .	1
I love Michelle Sagara 's Elantra series . I have read these books several times . I just ca n't get enough of these amazing characters & their worlds . Brilliant .	1
Great tails that i can see being told before a king at a feast . I enjoyed the book and wish there was more to it .	1
Author Aaron Shepard did a wonderful job of bringing these Celtic tales to modern day telling.These tales give a glimpse of the kind of stories told around the campfires and at gatherings centuries ago.Adult readers may think of these stories as children stories , these also capture the imagination of adults as well .	1
A FABULOUS BOOK , YOU NEVER HEAR ANYTHING OF WALES EXCEPT IN CONJUNCTION WITH PRINCE CHARLES , AND THAT IS NEVER . GOOD . I WAS TOLD BY MY MOTHER THAT MY HERITAGE ON HER SIDE OF OUR FAMILY WAS ENGLISH , IRISH , AND WELSH . I LOVE HISTORY , YET I KNOW ALMOST NOTHING OF WALES . I HAD N'T EVEN KNOWN THAT WALES WAS PART OF THE CELTIC RACE . I 'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO NOW STUDYING WELSH HISTORY . THANK YOU VERY MUCH AARON SHEPARD .	1
I enjoyed the short story , the characters and their acceptance of magic as a part of life . Recommended as a bedtime story .	1
I must say-I got way more than my money 's worth here ! Jareth De Machadle Duke of Catheda Very Handsome & Noble Englishman ( You will fall in love with this Hero-I dare you not too ! ) Resides on the Scottish Border ( the English side of Course ) This is the 1500 's and it 's Scots -vs- `` bloody '' English ! Flash to 2007-Seattle , WA- Briana Connally ( Young & Single ) wakes up in the Morgue . - she is really dead and it 's her spirit we are introduced to . When her guide to the afterlife Carol drags her along through time ( backwards ) Briana realizes she has many things she has never experienced in her short time on earth and her sadness makes her request a second chance . When Carol tells her it can not be-she sees an opportunity during a young woman 's ( Alexandra-Jareth 's wife from the 1500 's ) run to escape her life during childbirth ! ! ! Yes , Briana drops into the historical castle during Alexandra 's child labor ! HahahaWell , ... ..She was hellbent on experiencing more in life and she is in for a doozy ! Alexandra 's life we find out is a hellish mess ! She is a cheating , Lying Bitch of a Duchess who is having an affair with Jareth 's 1/2 brother-trumble- and in the process of giving birth to his bastard love child.When Briana lays eyes on her husband , Jareth , he is the man of her dreams and ca n't believe her luck . She has a beautiful son and gorgeous husband-a snit of a mother-in-law . However , there is trouble in paradise . Her husband loathes her -she was a prisoner to her bedchamber because Jareth feared she would commit suicide . ( he does n't know the 1/2 of it ) Briana makes an attempt to convince him she is from the future . This is when we get a small glimpse into the character of our hero-after all that his wife put him through-he still cares and loves her -- ahhh `` sigh '' a hopeless romantic hero ! She insists he call her Lady Briana ! ! ! She is not That traitor Alexandra ! ! While he wars with himself -and his traiterous brother -- QUOTE to step-mom -- `` His share of the bickering , mother-lies squalling in my nursery upstairs '' ... THEN TO TRUMBLE : '' ..feel free to take your son with you when you go ! ... `` He questions his wife 's strange new behavior -- He ca n't understand how she does n't remember any of the horrible things of their marriage-she treats him with tenderness and acts like she cares about him-She wants to spend time with their son . ( something Alexandra never wanted before ) She remembers nothing of their 4 year old son Caleb who died not long ago ... ... ..SHE CA N'T SPEAK A WORD OF FRENCH-he learned the language so he could understand her..hmmmmmm ... ..And ... . When things start getting dangerous along the border . He begins spending a lot of his time fighting with his step-mother about Lady Briana-she wants her committed to Bedlam ( for crazy 's ) , his 1/2 brother Trumble-who lives under his roof -with whom he still believes his wife is having an affair with ! He is driven to heavy drinking and brooding thoughts about his life and happiness-or lack thereof.Jareth trains boys , young men into military for England . Catheda is a very successful and sought after prestigous military prep schoolish Estate-He and Kendall are very accomplished swordsmen and keep a large number of young men scattered around the property-along with specific training areas ... When Briana visits the merchant area a fire breaks out ( very funny part ) and wanders onto the archery training-narrowly being missed by arrows-Jareth is not sure what to think-he forbids her to wander thru again though ... ... .Why is it every time he lets her out of her room she gets into trouble ? ? ? ? ? Meanwhile : Briana is slowly winning over her ladies maid and his man servant Kendall ( you will love him too ) Who is more a friend and great moral support for both Jareth and Briana . She stands up to her mother in law Katherine-and because she loathes anything to do with Alexandra she gives away all her gowns-she wears only nightdresses ! ! ! All the while insisting everyone call her Lady Briana -- she is instantly dubbed the CRAZY DUCHESS ! ! ! ( she gives herself the name of course ! haha ) -- oh ya , love the jogging ... heheJareth 's torturous mind , he feels is playing tricks with his heart . He wants to believe she is a 20th century dead girl inhabiting his beautiful wife 's body . He ca n't keep his hands off her-he never could-but as Briana 's personality chips away at his icy hatred for Alexandra we are treated to some wonderful romantic love scenes as well as good fights ( as only a 20th century emancipated American woman can give ! ) Reiver raids along the border start to cause more trouble than Jareth and his not fully trained recruits can really handle-He inlists the help of a Scot clan to help with night surveilance missions . When Briana is out riding with some of the young trainees , she accidently happens upon these reivers ( Trumbles men we find out ) about to hang one of the Scot clans young boys-she hilariously rescues him . ( This proves to be very fortunate in the emotional climax of this story for Jareth ! ) This story has sooooo much more-I do n't have room to put it all in ! The characters in Love of a Lifetime are written well and become so real-you actually believe you 've been transported to 1587 Scotland/England along with Briana . When Kendall addresses her as Lady Briana-you 'll cry-when Jareth calls her Lady Briana you will celebrate ... I enjoyed this story very much ( can you tell ) and I would highly reccommend it to all true romance readers ... ..Keep up the good work Maren ! ! !	1

bernicemcfaddenAt the very beginning of KEEPER OF KEYS , we are hit with the disease that Kai must live with for the rest of her life . What the doctor tells Kai shakes her world like an earthquake . Kai leaves the doctor 's office and hurries home . She huddles close to her fireplace trying to make peace with the doctor 's diagnosis . Her mind runs to and fro . She remembers her mother , Alice , who died of bone cancer . She remembers her mother 's love of life . Unfortunately , it 's not as easy to remember all of the men who have loved her in the past . There are names and features she remembers , but she ca n't remember all of her lovers . She ca n't remember who might not have worn a condom during the intimacy of love making . She realizes one of those times of loving and being loved was now as she says `` costing me my life . `` Kai fears that she will never experience the love of another man in her life ever . `` Would this be the only type of affection I could safely allow myself ? I would never be loved by another man , ever . '' While reading the story I realized how swiftly our lives can turn in another direction . I also realized there is always hope and love in every situation . For Kai , there are the memories of her mother , Alice . There is her much loved daughter , Alice , who is staying in Georgia far from her Northern home . There is a man named Journey . Each person in KEEPER OF KEYS will become a part of Kai 's new beginning , new Genesis.As always Bernice L. McFadden 's story is richly descriptive . She writes about the bells of St. Patrick 's cathedral , the black sand , white sand , cocoanuts and pineapples of the islands and the volcanic eruption in the 1800 's . She mentions the Masaii tribesmen . I loved the mention of a favorite poem The Negro Speaks of Rivers by Langston Hughes . The author also mentions three Artists , all new to me : Charles Bibb theworldart , Paul Nzalambagemsofafricagallery , and Leroy Campbell , leroycampbelloriginals . The mention of these artists fit so well in the story because Kai 's mother , Alice , loved to paint . Alice , her namesake , chooses to one day `` cover her daughter 's nursery walls with Banyan trees , smiling tigers and juggling bears ... . '' This hope and love springs forth throughout the novel . I thought about it . Death does not have the power to destroy because life is stronger than death . All of us are living legacies of those who have gone on before us to the Great Beyond . When death comes , our deepest concern is how to explain it to our children and ourselves . I think one answer lies in this novel KEEPER OF KEYS . `` Eternity is not something you lay on a child suddenly . It 's a concept that finds its way into their minds with maturity . `` It makes me happy to end this review with Langston Hughes poem .	1
T.A . Chase hits a sure point with this novel with me , since the show business theme is one of my favorite , probably due to the fact that I love to see an happily ever after where usually I do n't find them , and since I know that , despite some good changings happening in the movie industry , it 's still not easy to be out and proud , and the stars who decide to be have not easy life.So basically this is a cinderfella type of story , with the big Hollywood , Ryan , star who falls in love for the poor bartender , Josh , who has to work three jobs and has no time to be starstruck by the pretty actor . And here is maybe the most original point of the novel , T.A . Chase turns the table , and the cinderfella became the knight in shining armor , or better the big bear who will take good care of his lover . Josh can be the one with the less lucrative job , but he is not for sure the on a lower level than Ryan , on the contrary what draws Ryan to him is the feeling of being safe and sheltered in Josh 's arm . This is a common point that I have already found in T.A . Chase 's story : he is a favorite of mine since he often has characters living in the glittering world of the show business , or at least in an `` in the spotlight '' position , but those men are not unreachable or aloof , they are most of the time the boy next door who finds himself living in something bigger than him , and who still needs the comfort embrace of a lover . I like the mix of cuteness and coquetteness that is Ryan , and how he is ready to loosen up in the arms of the right lover.Not only in this case Ryan needs the safe shelter of his lover 's arms , he is also a submissive for nature , and he would n't have been happy with a lover who looked upon to him like the leader in the relationship . Being Josh a self-assured man , he is perfect for Ryan : the inner strength of Josh well balances the difference in social status of the two men , and then , the difference is still fresh , since it 's not long ago that Ryan was still a struggling actor came to Hollywood from a little province town . Again this is another common element in T.A . Chase 's stories , the origins of his characters are simple and down to earth , and they have solid basis that allow them to remain with the head on their shoulders and not being corrupted by the big bad world . There is always an homey feeling in those books , even if we are dealing with movie stars or professional sports players.As I said , what probably I like most is that the story is a good and strong romance which leads steadily and fast towards a romantic happily ever after ; the two heroes have to face some pretty bad moments , but they are never so bad to distract the reader from what is the main event , the love story . There was never one doubt that in a way or the other , the two men would have found a way to be together , and what started like a one single night of hot sex has good basis to become a last long relationship . Probably yes , what bonds Ryan and Josh in a good and strong knot is their perfect agreement in bed , and the fact to be the top in bed allows Josh to not feel like an addendum to Ryan ; never once I felt him doubt his position ( pun very much intended ) with Ryan , if there were trouble for them , it was not due to their personal and sexual relationship , and the reader has plenty of proves in the good and numerous sex scenes , that , as usual , are detailed without being an exercise in style . Those are sex scenes you can read and enjoy without having to hurry up to seeing what happens next .	1
Josh enjoys his job as a bartender at a West Hollywood club , especially because he is able to pick up as many guys as he can handle . When sexy Ryan comes up to his bar , they have an instant attraction that leads to a smoking hot encounter in an alley and an even hotter night at his place . He has no idea who Ryan is.Ryan Kellar is the up-and-coming star of a new film who seems to have the world at his feet . Unfortunately , being famous is n't all it 's cracked up to be , especially for a gay man in Hollywood . Ryan is more than just attracted to Josh , but he knows they ca n't have a real relationship , or anything more than a one night stand . When word gets out about Ryan 's secret , will it end any chance he and Josh may have had ? Tabloid Star is a quick , hot tale of love in the age of the paparazzi . Dominant yet caring Josh is a great character . I also could n't help but like conflicted Ryan , who is tired of hiding for the sake of his career . There are a number of interesting secondary characters as well . The plot is fairly straightforward , with a few twists , but nothing too melodramatic . While Ryan and Josh 's relationship starts off fast and shallow , it soon deepens . What began as a sneaky one night stand becomes something worth fighting for , and the journey is a lot of fun to read . Everything 's a bit too perfect , but in a Hollywood kind of way rather than an annoying one . Tabloid Star is sure to appeal to fans of celebrity magazines as well as to people like myself who do n't follow Hollywood at all.CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I enjoyed this book , it had steamy m/m sex , romance , humor and a little bit of mystery , everything you need in a story to keep you warm on these long winter nights . I liked how the main characters seemed to have completely different personalities and backgrounds yet fit together perfectly . I also like how the author wrote in Ryan 's best friend to add some comedic relief so that the story does n't take itself too seriously . The story draws attention to a couple of very real issues in today 's world Autism and the issue of how much is too much when it comes to the media digging into people 's personal lives and deals with them well , but not too deeply . I only had a minor problem with the story and that was that at times the characters seemed too perfect so that the story did n't always seem believable . I would recommend this book to any one who likes m/m romance stories , but be warned there is a lot of hot , steamy sex in this book and some of it is explicit , so if you do n't like that kind of stuff this not the book for you . This is another good book by T.A . Chase . - Ana	1
langley manages some surprises and engages a part of me that secretly loves the fluffy genre of romance . the happy endings ( pun intended ) may be too perfect but is that so bad ? we live in a world of rape and murder and injustices many of us can not , and should not , comfortably digest so why not escape from that in a book ? langley , in an often overly disconnected genre you pull it off and are often my morphine . i may be able to devour your books almost quicker than it takes to download them but you touch my heart that is two sizes too small . thank you .	1
Loved this book . Everything about it . J. L. Langley writes some of the best M/M stories . Ca n't wait to read more .	1
I confess that the title is what caught my eye first and then the blurb drew me in . It just sounded like an intriguing take on an unrequited love story . And I was not destined for disappointment . I found it a really special story with a few surprise twists.Micah is helping to run a ranch for the Delaney family who took him in when he was a small child . They treat him like family , but he knows he is not and the patriarch 's oldest son , Duncan , wo n't let him forget it . Things have gotten real tough since the head of the family fell ill and his oldest , Duncan has began threatening to come and take the ranch . Bills are heaping up and it all seems so bleak . Micah 's uncle , Juan , who brought him to the ranch after the death of his parent is the foreman there and he advices Micah to keep digging for a solution.And Micah does indeed find something , but he 's not sure it is a solution . He 's down to asking help of one man , Tucker Delaney . Tucker was the man who Micah loved and Tucker left him never to return to the ranch after the one beautiful night they spent together . Tucker is the only one left who has a chance at saving the ranch . And he makes a startling decision after seeing his granddad 's will . The will states that the ranch will go to the first Delaney with the exception of Duncan who marries.Tucker is taken aback by Micah 's sudden arrival in Dallas and it all comes back to him including his feelings for Micah . This older Micah is a bigger temptation than ever because this one is bowed down by care and is still visibly hurt by Tucker 's decision to leave him . He takes matters in hand and talks Micah into a marriage of convenience which secretly allows Tucker to kill two birds with one stone- thwarting his uncle 's claim on the ranch and the ability to care for Micah . Is this a second chance for the two men or is it the final act that will drive them apart for good.The plot was well developed and I loved how the author conveyed a feeling of desperation when it came to saving the ranch . There was a foreshadowing that there were secrets from the past that awaited discovery and the character descriptions were in-depth . I really got behind Micah 's cause and his feelings about the family and Tucker . I was prepared to hate Tucker for hurting Micah until the perspective was turned around and I was able to understand Tucker 's motives . Then it became a matter of tension to see if Tucker would figure out and go after what he really wanted before he lost it.Wonderful read and I recommend who enjoy M/M romance with the modern western backdrop .	1
Tucker and Micah grew up together on the Bar D ranch . They grew up like brothers . They made love the night before Tucker left the ranch for good . Of course , Tucker returned and they were able to have an adult relationship . I thought this was a terrific story about two independent , hard headed men . Where they were determined to take care of each other . The family relationships that they have was also critical to this story . This was well thought out and magnificently written . I highly recommend this book ! !	1
Everything about this story is enjoyable , from the beginning to the end . There are enough little twists to keep readers guessing until the details are revealed , each at exactly the right moment in the story . The ending is completely satisfying and perfect for the story . This is a story I would gladly recommend to anyone who enjoys a good romance , especially one with a touch of the paranormal thrown in . - Karin	1
With a length that skirts the boundaries between what I would consider a short story and novella , If You Believe introduces us to Aubrey Mathison , owner of the coffee shop Bean There , Done That , and Chief of Police Price Delacroix . Aubrey is still damaged from the betrayal of her now ex-husband , and since their divorce she does n't have relationships with men . She dates and has sex . That 's been working out well for her until her life takes a bit of a turn . Suddenly the homeless man across the street is spouting predictions that come true , her coffee shop goes up in flames , and Price Delacroix meets her , wants her , and refuses to be just one of her other men.There 's no doubt that the heat between them is incendiary and the sex scenes smoking hot . The story is tightly compact , but due to the length , we get a much better idea of Aubrey as a character than we do Price , who never seems to develop much beyond superficial eye candy . I 've read other novellas of this length that focused more on both character 's definition , and realize that my preference lies in that area . I 'm not criticizing this story , do n't get me wrong . I think it was comprehensive , given length-constraints , in detailing Aubrey 's character enough to lend her believability , and I enjoyed seeing her interact with her friend the hairdresser and the guardian angel . In fact , had Price 's character been given just a bit more definition , I would have really liked this story . As it stands , I think it 's better than okay , but just lacked a bit for me to make it truly enjoyable . The sex , though , was stellar . 3.5 Stars .	1
Lila Dubois has some kind of wicked imagination when it comes to ice in the bedroom ! I liked this book better than then second one in the series . I thought the characters of Runako and Margo were well drawn . Getting a sense for Runako 's pain at his sister 's tortured death at a research facility and the internal dialogue for how he feels about Margo when he has all reason to hate humans makes it a book well worth reading . Margo 's sassiness really comes across , but her finally getting over her self esteem issues made me cheer.What made this book much better for me is that it takes place in the monsters ' home in the mountains , and more than just the three main men in the books , you meet others and get to witness how they live , how they mourn , and even how they love . Hot and fun , it brought me in better than the second book did , and while the first may remain my favorite , I really want to read Henry 's story next and hope the author is working on it right now !	1
Loved it loved it . I was not sure where this book was going at first but when Mikhail went to claim Alya and she took off running and jumped down those flights of stairs barefoot I was hooked.This book was an energetic , humorous romance with powerful vampires and one bad ass chick that was so awesome . I loved it loved it , especially the end . ( Note to writer : Find a way to offer an update . Maybe you can pick up a year later and the family has to fight some other vamps for the New York territory . I need a fourth book )	1
I really enjoyed this book . The characters are vivid , the mythology of the paranormal universe it is set in is interesting and compelling , the romance is fulfilling and the sex is great . But there were hints of so much more that just did n't get to be fully explored.I 'm giving this book 4 stars because I really had fun reading it- DESPITE the fact that there seemed to be a hell of a lot more to the story than what I got . The book is definitely a romance- and I always enjoy a good paranormal romance , but there was just so much ELSE going on that it was almost a shame to spend so much time focused on the attraction between our two characters.I ca n't wait to read the second book , but I find myself drawn into the greater context of the world and hope to get more from the next books than just the romance . Lots of questions are left unanswered and the author makes interesting interpretations of standard paranormal mythos . I 'd love to know more ... Bottom line- good book . The story itself is fun . The characters are likeable and strong . The universe is interesting . I just wish it was maybe a little longer so that I did n't have to settle for all the HINTING Ms. Somers did at the larger context . It would be great to actually sink my proverbial teeth into more than just the romance ... I 'd love to see this series follow Tristan and Kennedy on their adventures , but something tells me later books will feature a different romance each time . That wo n't stop me from eagerly awaiting each one though !	1
Who would think a Gargoyle could be hot ? Really , really hot . Apparently Sydney Somers knew , because Primal Hunger , the first book in her Pendragon Gargoyles series introduces us to her really , really hot gargoyles . Kennedy works at Pendragon & # 8217 ; s , a bar owned by Tristan & # 8217 ; s family and the man drives her to distraction , there is just something about him and the way he looks at her . A night of car trouble was all it took to send Kennedy spiraling into Tristan & # 8217 ; s secret world and his bed . What has fate done to them ? Why has she become the target of an assassin from a world she thought existed only in fairy tales ? If learning about Tristan & # 8217 ; s immortal secrets wasn & # 8217 ; t enough for one girl , she is told she is his soulmate , for all eternity , but how can that be ? Kennedy is a mere human ? Grab the fan , and maybe a fire extinguisher , because this sensual paranormal tale gets hot , very hot ! Sydney Somers blends a great fantasy with great characters , dialogue , tension and , um & # 8230 ; action in this great start to a series that answers the question : Can Gargoyles be HOT ? The answer is a breathless , OH , YES !	1
loved this read kept me questioning who next , where is so and so at , and arent they gon na get together , i liked very much , cant wait to read the second part .	1
Primal Hunger may be a novella but it packs quite the punch ! Sydney Somers manages to build a rather complex world that readers only get a tiny glimpse of . On top of that , I got to meet shifters , gargoyles , fae and wraiths . A massive amount of content is jammed in to only one hundred pages yet I somehow was n't overwhelmed or lost . If anything , I feel a little sad that it all had to end so soon.I immediately liked Kennedy . We 're first introduced to her at work , bartending . She 's having a stand-off with one of her patrons armed with a beer tap hose . Kennedy is radiating a playful , don't-mess-with-me vibe . My kind of heroine ! Tristan , her sexy , feral boss is the second lead character . The tension between the two is obvious and gives us a glimpse of what 's to come.One of the funniest parts of this novella for me was Kennedy fleeing enemies while driving on top of Tristan 's unconscious body . At this point in the tale , these two are still in a platonic boss / employee relationship . Which made the situation all the more hilarious , not to mention awkward for poor Kennedy ! Things can only heat up from here ! In the midst of all the action , Tristan and Kennedy still find lots of time to get in on . I feel like a good chunk of this book was r-rated . The sex was drool worthy and each encounter managed to be hotter than the one that came before . If you 're looking for a short read that 'll get your rocks off , Primal Hunger is for you ! Sydney Somers ' first installment in her Pendragon Gargoyles series is amazing ! The large variety of supernaturals paired with an imaginative story make this novella a good read but throw in the steamy goodness and it becomes stunning ! The only problem I have with Primal Hunger is that it 's a novella instead of a full-length book ! Now I just have to figure out how to get my hands on book 2 : Primal Attraction .	1
She writes mystery and romance so well and always adds a good sense of guidance to the outcome . I enjoyed the book .	1
Very well-written mystery/suspense and romance . Dinah Westlake was just a child when she witnessed something dealing with the murder of her cousin . For years , she supresses those memories , but with careful prodding of Marc , her cousin 's husband who was the chief suspect in her death , Dinah finally allows her mind to open and what she discovers nearly costs her life . I love the way the story unfolds a layer at a time without revealing the `` who done it . '' Wonderful cozy mystery and sweet romance that will surely please . Enjoy !

There is a large cast of great characters yet the heroes manage to stand out with heart , intelligence and carnal encounters . No big surprises in Full Moon Mating but that does n't take away from the enjoyment factor ! You can always count on Ms. Glenn for a good story and Full Moon Mating is total entertainment.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
This was such an enjoyable read and I respect the author . The characters interacted so intelligently and thoughtfully , and the background world fit together well . This is on my top ten list for this genre . And this genre is at the top of my list , though I have read all the classics of literature . This book is just pure pleasure to read . Books like this make life worth living . ; ) Oh , and Nate and Joe were just extra special . \ ( ^-^ ) / ( I know it 's annoying in books when the french toast suddenly turns into waffles , or there are typos , but the reader gets the meaning of the thing and if you want a professional editor , expect to pay about five dollars more per book . Editors live pretty high , I imagine . )	1
This author writes well and have not had a problem reading anything she writes . Really look forward to any other books .	1
This was a very well written short story . The anti- hero approach was very interesting , but you ca n't help but respect his decision in the end . I would read more from this author .	1
I 'm unfamiliar with this author , and I was really surprised at the depth she put into this short story . Right from the beginning , I could see how well-put together this story is , lots of descriptive detail , dynamic character and easy dialogue . I love short stories , and it 's not that easy to take short fiction and pack it with substance and intrigue . This story is short but layered ; there 's some darkness to it , some magic and fantasy , and some seduction and scheming.The story is told in first-person from the POV of Sir Dardanus , but what makes that unique for me is that he 's really an anti-hero , `` a bastard and ne'er-do-well , a murderer and a seducer of women . '' Just what wo n't this man do in order to get what he desires ? Even at the end , I was still a bit uncertain about what he 'd actually do , and with the way the author left the final page , I have to wonder how or if this romance will continue . I choose to see hope and promise there , mixed with the darkness.This is n't a sweet , happy romance , Dardanus and his intentions a little too dark and moody for that . Also , I would n't say that this story is overly erotic ( and I do think it needed to be more erotic in that detail ) , but certain aspects of the story do hold some sex appeal for me : the domination and surrender , the dark and complex hero , even the slightly rough sex scene and the tension behind it . Combined with the author 's skill , all of those things produce an engaging short read and a hero who knows how to leave his mark . I want more of him.The Knife 's Edge ends at location 366 ; the rest of the download is excerpts fromThe Fever and the FuryandPoisoned Kisses : Poisoned Kisses\Midnight Medusa ( Harlequin Nocturne ) .	1
The Knife 's Edge is the perfect short story to wet your appetite . It leaves you wanting more . Be prepared to fill you kindle with more of Stephanie Drays books . She 'll leave you with a craving only she can meet .	1
All sorts of content - not limited to only one thing like free books or how to do things . You never know exactly what 's coming up next and that 's pretty enjoyable . Some of the posts are more applicable to me and my life than others but overall for the price this blog is excellent ! Clearly a passion for Kindle is key and so those of us who are Kindle obsessed will really enjoy this one !	1
I have subscribed to this blog since day one when I bought my Kindle 2 almost two years ago . For 99 cents a month , it has been extremely helpful especially the free books listed . People will always say negative things and I feel that Mr. Calvin takes many of those comments with a grain of salt . He does an excellent job keeping us informed in the eReader world .	1
The author of this blog puts in a lot of effort vs. a few lines here and there . I especially like the tips , answering of questions , and thoughts on the eBook market . I read in one of his posts he tries to write 1,000 words a night - he does , and it is usually full of quality . he s well-known on the discussion board sof being helpful , and I see that flowing through on his blog . I would give it a 5-star , but took one away as sometimes there are `` rants '' in the postings that continue over time ; however , I do recognize that is the nature of blogs ! : } Bottom line here is the 99 cents for this blog is money well-spent , probably in the top three of the approximate ten I subscribe to for Kindle content ! Keep up the good work !	1
Reviewed by Regan Windsor for Reader Views ( 10/06 ) A sign of a good mystery novel is one that keeps the reader guessing until the end . A brilliant author is able to successfully `` go where no ( wo ) man dare go . '' Michael W. Sherer has managed to accomplish both in his novel `` Death is No Bargain . `` Emerson Ward , former stock broker , spends his days as a freelancer . For the most part he picks up freelance writing at a tolerable pace and spends the rest of his days in a relaxed and laid back pace having made enough as a stock broker to keep him comfortable between jobs . It 's his other freelance work , however , that seems to keep him living close to the edge . By doing more favors for friends than actual jobs , Emerson has a knack for attracting himself to danger.A year before Emerson had run into a disoriented young girl and brought her back to recoup and recover at his place before convincing her to find her way back home . Now her father has showed up on his doorstep ready to kill him for seducing and harboring his daughter who has once again run away . After escaping the near-death experience he finds himself unable to deny his help to the saner ex-wife . In the twists and turns of the ensuing events , Emerson soon finds himself dedicated to solving the mystery of her disappearance.Michael W. Sherer tackles the complexities of pregnancy , abortions , adoptions , and shady connections to a Catholic convent . Although these events are at the forefront of the novel they are presented in a brilliantly uncontroversial way - simply as details for the reader to ponder and digest while diligently trying to determine `` whodunit . `` `` Death is No Bargain '' brings more to the reader than the thrill of a good mystery . It is brimming with controversial subject matter successful in transporting the reader to a higher level of intellectual stimulation . As the battles in Emerson 's world ensue - so too do the battles within the reader.Received book free of charge .	1
What does one do when something is just not right ? You are not the law . How does offering help to a runaway person change one 's life ? ? Great story ! ! ! !	1
When I first came across Jonny Tangerine 's Toe Popper I hesitated reading it because of the cover . I just kept visualizing this lady on the cover getting blown up . I think if the cover had just shown the water and sand etc . with no people on the cover I may have felt different and bought it . JMO . My family and friends and I had a discussion on covers and if any of us had not bought a book because of the cover and some of us said `` A picture is worth a thousand words '' and it is the first thing we see when seeing a book is it 's cover and it gives an impression of what the book is about . I 've come across 3 Kindle story covers that I had n't bought until I asked my family and friends if any of them have read the story's.I read this story week 's ago and am just getting time to write the review . This mystery was gifted to me by a friend who thought I would like it and I am glad that he did because I thoroughly got hooked with the many twists and turns and holding my breath at certain times in this mystery.Characters FBI agent Catherine ( I was thrilled to see a strong female FBI lead character ) and to know the background and turmoil that Major Joel Lane was going through . These two characters were striving to find out who the culprit was and to put a stop to this madness.I am looking forward to reading more from Jonny Tangerine and I hope there will be a book # 2 to this novel.I recommendToe Popperto mystery/thriller readers .	1
Loved this story ! I was hesitant about buying this book because neither the cover picture nor the title were appealing to me . I saw it recommended on the Kindle boards over and over again so I finally purchased it . I 'm glad I did because I found it to be a real page turner and could n't put it down . Recommended read !	1
This is very different from what I typically read , but I found it really interesting and very well written . The writing really grabbed me . This is not a pick me up , feel good story . It 's dark all the time and violence is scattered throughout , but the story line flows and the writing is so good I read it in one sitting . I 'd recommend It .	1
Bought this book a while ago , stayed up all night to read it . It drew me in immediately . I connected to the characters . It was steamy and passionate while still being a really well-fleshed out story . It 's a collection of 3 related erotic historic romance novellas . The first two stories are my favorite , since I 've gotten the book I 've reread them many times , the emotions are just so powerful . The third one is good but seems to be tied up too quickly . Anyway I love this book and I heartily recommend it .	1
Unpretentious , but refined . This is truly the kind of book you want to curl up with , especially in bed . Though I will warn you , do n't begin reading if you have somewhere to be early the next day ; you wo n't be able to put it down . `` Oh , it 's just a novella . I can get through it before bed , '' you 'll say to yourself ... ha ! Not if you 're savoring each and every word.I really enjoyed the strong women in this book ; these are not your average Victorian maidens playing rabbit for the wolf . These rabbits have rabies and are not to be trifled with ! Bianca in `` Wager of Sin '' really spoke to me as a woman who does what she wants , when she wants and with whom . It takes a strong man to earn the company of a strong woman and Mr. Hawkins was certainly worthy.Loved . It .	1
Three super steamy novellas wrapped up in one lovely package . I admit I am normally not a fan of the novella , but I loved that fact that all three stories were interlinked through the characters . All three stories are very hot . It was easy for me to become wrapped up in the emotions of these characters and wish for them the happiness they deserved . I highly recommend this wonderful erotic read ! First we meet Bianca and Hawk in Wager of Sin . Afraid that her father will declare her unfit to care for herself , Bianca needs to reclaim her gambling losses from Hawk so that she may keep her independence . Bianca decides to make a wager with Hawk , she will spend the next month in is bed and if at the end of the month he is begging for more , she will win her money back . Hawk agrees but adds to the wager if Bianca is the one begging she will remain is mistress . Both have loved each other from afar for years , can there truly be a winner in this Wager of Sin ? Next we learn more about the history of Hawk 's prudish brother Landon in The Sweetest Sin . Shocked to find out the upstanding Landon has n't always been so perfect . Five years ago he was secretly married to the lovely Juliana . When the couple is found together , for reasons unknown to Landon , Juliana claims she was forced to marry and receives an annulment to marry another . Landon has never gotten over this betrayal and now , five years later when Juliana comes to him for assistance in locating her sister . Landon takes his revenge in a most pleasurable way.Finally in Sin 's Mistress we meet Evelyn ( Juliana 's sister ) and Raphael Sinclair , better known as Sin . Sin is out for revenge against Evelyn 's father , Lord Trevington and because he ca n't get Evelyn out of his mind decides to use her in his plot for revenge . He takes Evelyn as payment for Lord Trevington 's gambling debts , for the next 10 days Sin will own her and educate her in his decadent lifestyle . Will Sin get the revenge he so lusted after or will he find a sweeter reward ?	1
Love readings about the family . Dealing and interactionsGood book trust issues faithfulness people of good characters just loved the book	1
Another wonderful book by Elizabeth . I just loved it . What a wonderful romantic story and what a way to fall in love with who you are betrothed to . Love it !	1
I 'm having lots of fun reading Elizabeth 's books . She has a way of transporting me into another world . I find myself getting lost in these stories and ca n't wait until I can finish my chores and return to my make believe world of romance .	1
They both actually cheated on their fiance . Even though they were not thrilled of the arranged marriage.Ana and Eric both enjoyed being with their lover..not wanting the lover to know they were engaged.I enjoyed the book , the travel and tourism ... .a little adventure before the big wedding .	1
another great book love my tycoons so much excitement when reading them my mind just floats away i get lost	1
I have spent two and a half days reading this trilogy and I loved it ! Ok so it 's a fairy tale I do n't care ! I loved the characters and the twist in the plots and I will be sad that there is n't more in the series !	1
This is the first book I have read by this author , and I found it delightful.It is a short novella that is fun and a little improbable maybe with the Heros ' quick exceptence of the alien but still a very good read . I enjoyed it very much .	1
Right from the start I was hooked . I know the country , and was intrigued by the characters . Quick read , and for once I loved the ending .	1
What a delightful novel ! The characters were well-rounded and extremely likeable . I also appreciated the effort that was put into Povre 's native language . In addition , the plot was intriguing and I did n't want to stop reading . I 'm looking forward to more from this author !	1
I really enjoyed how this story developed . Its a well-written Sci-fi depicting what happens when an alien race quietly tries to study earth and one of the members of the scientific team gets away from the group and is discovered by a human . The world-building of the alien race was easy to follow since explanations came steadily throughout the story instead of one long monologue at the beginning.The characters ' personalities and situations were established for some time before they actually come in contact with each other and then their relationship developed at a believable rate as they first had the culture/language barrier and then that period of just exploring their differences and similarities before it grew into something of a romantic nature.Not to say physical attraction was n't there pretty soon after they met though Kent is a bear about it because he 's recently sworn off women and here at his campsite remote from civilization he is joined by a female.Kent is a biology professor and scientist who was very athletic and rugged liking to bike and camp out far off the beaten path . He is startled by Povre 's differences when he first sees them , but soon adjusts to appreciating her exotic beauty and her sweet curious spirit . Povre is of a race that has some psychic ability and she senses many things in Kent 's emotions . At first his anger frightens her , but then he becomes protective and kind.After getting over their mutual surprise , the rest of the story 's action is about dogging all the government and non-government groups interested in capturing Povre for their own obvious reasons . And at the same time , they grow closer knowing that Povre 's people will probably come for her and they will be separated and there is always the fear that she 'll be discovered and captured.From time to time , the story shifts to a third character , Povre 's mission leader and father who was forced to leave her behind when she wandered away from their exploration group . He follows protocol and gets the others back to their ship and safety even while despairing over his daughter 's absence . He knows that if she is captured , she will not be treated well.The plot held no surprises for me and it was simplistic , but that was fine with me because it allowed me to focus on the developing romance between Kent and Povre . They really were good together . He was trustworthy and strong for her while at the same time he was tender and understanding of what she was going through . Povre helped heal Kent 's bruised heart , gave him someone to protect and love as well as showed him the delights of discovering something for the first time when he watched Povre enjoy nature . What I really thought was interesting is that though both are humanoid and share enough characteristics to be compatible , this truly is an alien romance . They really saw each other 's souls under all the surface differences.It was a nice read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to read a light Sci-Fi Romance .	1
I received a free copy of this book for review.There is something for every reader in this book . It was filled with action and adventure and the supernatural . At times , the novel reminded me of a mix of Indiana Jones and Stargate and , at other times , like supernatural stories of demons and ghosts.The characters were each distinct and there were many characters from different groups . At first , I did n't think I could keep track of them all , but each character developed his own persona as the book progressed and after a while it was n't necessary to be told who was talking , from the natural-born leader , the Colonel , to the practical and knowledgeable policeman Murphy to the inexperienced novice Kate . This was true of the main group . Then , there were the baddies and the FBI . Some characters also had other names or variations on their names . Some sections were a little confusing and had to be re-read.The quest of finding a piece of the staff of Solomon was similar to finding clues in a good mystery novel . After reaching each one , the reader was anxious to read more . I found myself thinking about the story each time I laid the book down until I picked it up again , mostly trying to keep the characters and timeline straight.Different stories were weaved throughout the book from different times and different people as the story unfolded . Some sections of the story took place in a castle in the 16th century and others in the wild west with Frank and Jesse James while others were in modern times with a storyline of ritual killings . This presented no problem because the first paragraph provided enough clues that the reader knew who it was and what was going on , with the headings of the segment of the story being prefaced by the date . This was used as a mechanism to mete out all the information in spurts throughout the book , a way of showing how everything within the novel developed through time to the present day . It was a good technique and kept the reader from being overloaded with information.I prefer novels to have a definite conclusion , but this book is intended to be the first in a series and left the reader at a point where he or she wants to read the next book and the next or however many more there are until the story ends . As I said , if you like action and adventure , magic , ghosts , demons , quests and serials , you will enjoy this book .	1
From the title , I visualized a quasi-medieval fantasy of four brothers , like knights , riding forth to engage the enemy . The Order , instead , is an organization of many men and women of various talents and expertise whose teams , aided by the gods , fight to contain The Thing that brought evil to the world.Some readers do n't like prologues , but I was immediately caught up and found the book hard to put down . The prologue tells how evil appeared and gave rise to the Starry Wisdom , worshippers of this evil . Priests founded the Order of the Four Sons to fight the Starry Wisdom.The adventure begins in a shroud of mystery that grips the reader , like a Dan Brown religious thriller . Someone cries out for help.In the softness of time we see the evil 's effects , down to the present . Children disappear and so do teams of the Order of the Four Sons . As the crisis grows , we get a lot of names thrown at us , but most of these resolve into unique characters with memorable personalities -- a retired marine , a burnt out ex detective , an old man , two technology geeks , and a trainee of unknown but surprising talents . Garnette , Murphy , Doug , Cecil , Bill , and Kate comprise the last team to be formed , incomplete and ill prepared . And we love them , for the writers manage them like a master . Without delving into character backgrounds , we quickly sense that they are solidly human . And we delight in their witty exchanges , a gallows humor that helps them maintain a mental balance throughout the demonic warfare.They battle Lady Bathory , more monster than lady , and her cohorts , who seek a magic wand that will stabilize a gate between worlds so she can expand her territory . The team of the Order must find the wand first . The quest becomes a spiritual treasure hunt as one clue leads to another.Much of the writing is impeccable , but questions arise , not all of which are answered to the reader 's satisfaction . Sure , I can figure out some . But I suspect that some answers wo n't be forthcoming in Book Two . For example , a federal organization called MJ-12 gets involved , and I 'm wondering , Who are these guys ? Why are they attacking the team ? Also , more names than necessary are mentioned . The characters have more than one name ; some have several . Ordinarily this caused the reader no problem , but I suffered some confusion , particularly over who the Blood Lady is and belatedly realized she is imprisoned in a bubble.The story ends in a cliff hanger . Questions dangle . We can expect answers to most in Book Two of the series . But not all -- and that 's what bothers me . In essence the Oracle tells us to stay tuned for the further adventures of our team . The read is entertaining , so grab your next copy .	1
I already know most the melodies and you 're normally singing in a groups , so not having the music is not a major problem . This is a great help for being able to sing along in meetings . Since we 're constantly traveling , this will be useful for us . Of course , music would be a help , but then I would n't be able to enlarge the words as easily and as an old person , larger text is more useful than seeing ( and not being able to read without reading glasses ) itsy-bitsy notes . It would be helpful for the next update if they added the hymn/song number to each page like they have on the Table of Contents -- just 71 - With Songs of Praise . That way if you want to just page to the next song , you can do so easily .	1
Really excellent for Family Home Evenings , Seminary classes , etc . or just to listen to . Since they have music and words they are nice to sing along with . Often children are self conscious about singing without accompaniment .	1
I am happy I have these Church Hymns on my Kindle . I can go to [ ... ] listen to the Hymns and follow along using my Kindle . Makes me one happy camper ! .	1
It is very handy to have the words of a hymn when there is no hymnbook available . However , I wish they would make the table of contents a little more user friendly . You must click repeatedly if the hymn is near the end of the hymnbook . Why not make a tabulated list so the hymns are not on so many pages ? Otherwise , it is an excellent utensil for hymn singing . Perhaps there could also be a hymnbook with music .	1
I love reading this proclamation from a true prophet of God . I know his words came from Heavenly Father and are given to help mankind have a more meaningful family life .	1
This product is a must for all families who want something more for their eternity . It is plainly written - no mumbo jumbo words that people can not grasp the meaning - and it gives all men and woman cause for in-depth reflection . The doctrinal assertions listed in the description of this product fulill the Church 's assertion that they can provide the truth seeker more knowledge if they are seeking it . Even if you are not a member of the Church , there is new hope for you in this document . This is the best dollar you could ever spend .	1
To remember these words , to hold them sacred in our hearts , and to live by the precept as . Always good to re-read .	1
Love this series and only wish this book had been longer . P.C . Cast is quickly becoming my favorite author of all time .	1
What a great read . These books always give me what I am expecting and much more . Thanks for all the adventures I get to take in your books	1
I am a huge PC Cast fan and this series is what got me hooked to her . I loved this story and can not wait to read more of her books .	1
Go ahead and buy all her books now . This series is amazing . I read them all and it still left me wanting more ! A great mythical journey . And it still is relatable to any viewer . Descriptions were vivid enough to paint a clear mental image . There is no down side to this book/author .	1
GREAT SERISE BROWED IT FROM MY NEICE AND HAD TO GET THE BOOKS FOR MYSELF NEEDED TO GET STRTED READING AND NOT STOP .	1
I read the Divine Series years ago and loved it ! Divine Beginnings has been sitting on my e-read for over a year , honestly I totally forgot it was a novella . This novella is the prequel to the Cast 's Partholon series and it explains how the war started . I really enjoyed Aine and Tegan 's story ! I know this is a novella but I was sad that it was over so quick , I wanted to know more about their lives together ! If you have read anything else by P.C . Cast , you know how good she is at making a very vivid world . I was once again transported to the magical Kingdom of Partholon . Even though it time it was n't nearly as vivacious as in the series , I had no problem seeing the world Tegan and Aine loved so much that they were willing to risk their relationship to save it.I had almost forgotten that this was series was where I remember The Goddess from . Just like in the House of Night series , The Goddess is such a power being in Partholon . I love how she manifest herself when she is most needed and how Aine puts her full trust in her and follows that down a path that is completely against everything she has come to know.I might have to go back and read The Partholon series again ! Just so I can tell you guys exactly what I loved about it !	1
Keller the hit man has gone straight . When a rare stamp comes up on the auction block , Keller needs some cash . So what 's a family man supposed to do ? Who cares what others do ? Keller does what he does best . In this novella , the hit man combines business with pleasure in his usual droll style . A fun read for Keller fans .	1
A good old fashioned style of who done it . The character development is reminiscent of a classic Agatha Christy NOVEL .	1
A fairly predictable plot but fun to read . I would recommend this book to people who like a quick fun read .	1
Read this book in one lazy day and thoroughly enjoyed the entire book . The characters were interesting and entertaining and the mystery was Fun .	1
I started and could n't put the book down . It was a fast and easy read and the characters were believable.will look for other of her books .	1
I enjoyed the characters in this book . They were believable . Aggie gets involved in a murder investigation , much to the chagrin of her friend Tom ( a policeman ) . It was a fun summer read . I will look for others by this author .	1
liked the characters in it	1
I totally love Aggie Underhill . She is definitely one of the best characters I 've run across in my reading . I so loved the book plus the other two in the series I 've read so far , I 'm planning on reading them again - except in order this time ! : )	1
Aggie proves once again that an observant eye and brains can overcome an aging body and a criminal mind.A little more editing for improper word usage , spelling errors and grammar , however , is in order .	1
This is a story with Aggie Underhill , One would described as an Agatha Christie character , an elder Brit woman with her off colour humor and her passion to solved mysteries , introducing Mrs. Aggie Underhill who ca n't keep herself from not getting involved with a mystery where ever she goes and she becomes so entrenched in it she puts herself in to dangerous and witty dilemmas.It opens with a young couple celebrating their first year anniversary of adultery in the scenic hills of California . On a date of a romantic dinner , the female character has to tell her lover a secret not sure how he will respond to it . Her secret did not go well , and now she is suffering the scary consequences.Chapter two opens with the main character , Aggie Underhill she is a widower and has a discipline in her manners , except on a spur of a moment dare from a dear friend she purchases a sports car and enjoys the freedom it give her . She relocated from Britain to be near her daughter and family . She lives in Palm Springs and her close friend of twenty years Betty lives next door.She is reminiscing about her deceased husband and his note and necklace he left behind , leaving her , her own mystery to solve but she is not ready to face the tumult of going through his personal items . Meanwhile she is late for a coffee engagement , not a date with the handsome police officer and is being followed and trying to compete for a parking space with a blue hair lady who looks like Marge Simpson.As the plot continues the mystery girlfriend is back in the story . Mixing in dysfunctional family dynamics and the book club fiasco , this reader wants to thank the author for writing hilarious scenarios ; this book will definitely lift one 's spirits . And wait there is still the other mystery to solve of the young greedy married man who is cheating on his rich wife and the mysterious girlfriend and the threat of sabotage and murder lurking around every corner . Of course the characters will all crossed paths which give Mrs. Underhill the advantage to unravel the clues of the suspicion events.In the midst the author adds family gatherings and antics which delights the reader for each character has their own colorful personality , especially Mrs. Underhill , entertaining this reader with her brazen confrontations with others.There is karma floating throughout the plot , it is good to see the bad guys get their dues when they commit acts of spite against another , a good hot coffee spilling in the lap , yeah karma.Betty , Aggie 's best friend too gets involved not by her own will just being in the Wrong place , at the wrong time , put all the characters together and you have a comedic and suspenseful story in the makings . The competition between the mature ladies over the handsome police officer is a riot . Reading along and bang an event and this reader 's pulse went racing not expecting that twist.The suspects are leaving clues , two dead bodies , was it intentional or accidental , what about a ransacked home , missing jewelry and cherished jewelry all lead to an adventure with so many twists it hard to keep track but entertaining too . So many occurrences and this reader 's mind was racing wondering who are the suspects ? And what is one 's motive to invaded someone boundaries , the question , what were they looking for ? In the author 's words : '' My word , '' Betty said . `` It has Alexander Dominsky 's name scribbled on it . `` Aggie nodded . `` That 's Lionel 's handwriting . '' `` It does n't make sense . Why would Lionel have Alexander Dominsky 's name written down ? Unless ... maybe it 's just a fluke.Maybe he liked his books . `` `` Maybe , '' Aggie muttered . `` But I doubt it . Someone ransacked my home the same day Dominsky was found dead . There 's something more going on here . `` `` I do n't know , Aggie . '' Betty shook her head . `` I think you might be looking too deep . `` `` Aggie held up the key dangling from her necklace . `` This means something , Betty . You said so yourself . I say we go over to the Sinclair 's . At the book club , Esmerelda Sinclair announced that Alexander Dominsky was staying in her guesthouse and that he was a good friend . What are the odds that she died the same day , too ? `` As this reader read the plot it turned out to be an intriguing investigator 's mystery with the ring of an British Agatha Christine flowing through the pages and continues with excitement and humor all the way to the conclusion with some very strange and complex events ; plus there is a hint of conspiracy mixed in too . I highly recommend readers who like little daring middle age ladies who view everything with a Brit 's perspective about life , that in itself is entertainment , If so , you will enjoy this and the other mysteries in this series written by this author . Plus there is a You Tube video to give you a glimpse of this talented author 's style , just goggle book title and author 's name and be amazed . . .. [ ... ] [ ... ]	1
This was a good and easy read at first you hate the H but then you start to soften towards him not a lot if heavy steamy parts but slot of romance	1
First , I downloaded it because I liked the idea behind the story . Then , I started to read and loved the character development and the way the author approached the story.Alex is an absolutely amazing character , I really hope we get more of her . I loved her independant streak , the way she stood up to everything that crumbled around her , and never gave up . Joshua was a true leader and made the perfect match to her.I just bought the next in the series , so I am hoping for more of the same ! Not sure if the author is going to continue on with centering stories around the Stryker brothers , but it would be an interesting way to unfold the other families in the pack . I hope for more soon !	1
Please do n't let the reviewers who enjoy picking apart books sway you . Often times what one person hates another loves . Quite possibly you 'll find you like this book.I did n't read the description of the book , nor the reviews before downloading it . Sometimes I like going into a story blind because life is like that . You never know where the road will lead.For my part , I only found a few things that threw me for loop . The first one was when Alex , who 'd been raised by her father her whole life , discovers her dad is a werewolf . This is after we discover she believed there was no such thing as paranormal beings in the world . One would think Alex would have struggled a tad more with the shocking news that werewolf 's were real and guess what honey . You 're a half-breed . Is n't that great ? I would have gasped , stuttered and probably fainted , but within seconds of discovering this fact , Alex more or less shrugs her shoulders and goes on as though her belief had n't just taken a turn into the bizarre.The second thing I struggled with was the fact that since Alex was ` in heat ' -- as she was now maturing as a female werewolf -- every time she looked at Joshua Striker , the hero , moisture was pooling you know where . They had to watch out for werewolf 's finding them because they , the mutts , could ` smell her ' . I have to be honest and say , as often as Alex was having moisture pooling , I 'd of smelt her too and I 'm not a werewolf . At least , I do n't think I am . ) Now that the negative is out of the way , and that 's only my opinion , once I got past the above I found this book to be an enjoyable read . It is an action packed adventure that had me turning the pages as quickly as I could . N. J. Walters does n't waste time going on and on with four or more pages of description . The story moves along quickly.The bottom line , in my opinion : If you like werewolf romance , do n't mind some erotica and want a quick read , this book is for you . The things I did n't like about the book are n't going to stop me from reading more from N. J. Walters , and will definitely be reading the second story in the series , `` Isaiah 's Haven '' !	1
I enjoyed reading this book . It has the most important elements I look for , good characters , hot romance , and little danger.I need to care about the characters and the author delivers them here . I loved Alex . She is a strong female with a tender , nurturing side . Joshua is a hot alpha male who respects women . The secondary characters are interesting and I see a lot of potential for subsequent books.Hot romance , who am I kidding , hot sex ! It was well done and not just gratuitous . Well , the scene in the club may have been gratuitous but I still liked it.There has to be a little danger in every romance book or it 's just erotica . Here Alex and Joshua are being chased by a couple of groups of bad guys . This is the weakest part of the book but it 's still interesting enough to keep the plot moving.I plan to read more from this author .	1
Going by the reviews which seem to be 50/50 , I was n't sure what to expect . For a first in series , I generally reign in my critique because obviously there are more books to follow , allowing for the plot to be stretched out . With that said , I really enjoyed this book . The world building was n't complex - the story takes place in a shabby neighborhood of Chicago where people try to make a living in relative peace while surrounded by occasional drug dealers and hookers . From there , the story takes us to the woods of North Carolina . Nothing outlandish there.Alex ( andra ) Riley works with her father , James Riley as a mechanic . The father/daughter team run a mechanic shop of good reputation , and their clientele span all wage classes . They both have the friendship and the respect of their small community . Life as Alex knows it is comfortable , but all that is about to change . She has n't been feeling comfortable in her own skin lately , reminding her of her loner existence and that she has always felt like a freak . Then her father tells her that he needs to talk to her about her heritage , but not before they 're interrupted by a stranger.She finds out the truth about her father and that she 's a half-breed . To make matters worse , the wolf in her is going into heat ; her scent drawing danger closer every passing minute.Joshua Striker is in a race against time to find James LeVeau Riley and his daughter . Ever since the rumors about the former alpha having a daughter have proven accurate , every unmated wolf has been on the hunt to find and claim her . Doing so would boost their status among their ranks and mating with her would help their dwindling numbers . A Striker has always been head of security . They are judge , jury and executioner . Above all else , their duty is to protect the pack from violence , both from the outside as well as the inside . The current alpha and James ' brother has sent Joshua to protect Alex from either being kidnapped or killed by the wolves , who would see her as tainted and wo n't accept a `` watering down '' of the lines . When he finally finds her , he 's unprepared to find that his target is also his mate.Before she can get all the answers to her questions , they come under attack . James realizes that the only chance his daughter has is to let her go to her destiny and he trusts Joshua to get her to safety . What ensues is a cat and mouse chase through the streets of Chicago to find a way out of there and get to North Carolina and the safety of the Wolf Creek pack . Along the way they have to dodge other wolves who have teamed up with bounty hunters , whose specialize in destroying any paranormal species regardless of gender or age . The more time Joshua and Alex spend together , the closer they become . He knows she 's his mate , but he wo n't claim her until she 's had a chance to meet the other wolves and make her own choice . His honor demands it of him.The chemistry between Joshua and Alex is smoking hot ! Ms Walters did a great job making the hero and heroine not only instantly likeable , but tough as nails . When she fleshed out Alex , she could have made her a weak female who is completely overwhelmed by the newest developments in her life . While Alex tries to cope with what she will become , she wo n't take crap from anyone . Her early training with her father - how to fight and how to shoot makes her a petite warrior female - a character I always love as the counterpart to the overprotective alpha male . Instead of trying to bend her to his will , Joshua loves her fighting spirit and her smart mouth . He says often enough that no one has ever made him laugh or smile , nor has anyone ever dared to speak to him , a Striker , the way she does . The author also did n't shy away from having Alex see her fair share of fights , blood , injuries and death - all things that strike a chord with the ( otherwise ) non-confrontational and gentle heroine.A majority of reviewers seemed find this book had to much sex and not enough plot/action . I disagree . I did n't get the feeling that the sex was injected just for heck of it . The wolf in Alex is in heat , and if you 've ever had a cat in heat , then I 'm sure you 've seen her act ... like a cat in heat . Mine could n't get enough of the feather duster . My point is , Alex would get sudden urges and Joshua met them the best way he knew how without `` compromising '' her virtue . I did n't find anything wrong with that . Then again we 're talking about Joshua here , and he was very talented.If you 're looking for a paranormal romance with lots of steam , strong characters , some action and suspense then this is a good book to keep you occupied .	1
I found the book quite interesting . I have read several werewolf and vampire books and I thought that this one was well written and I recommend . I especially enjoyed the honor that was portrayed by the hero . the heroine was very sassy and strong ( yeah ) . I ca n't wait for book 2 .	1
I really liked it . I almost did n't get it because of the other reviews , but I took a chance and I 'm glad I did . I hope I do n't have to wait long for the next book in the series !	1
Good read , just enough werewolf . Good story line . Would recommend if you like the vampires werewolf type books . Will look for more by Walters .	1
Wow ... ..That was a great book . It had action , werewolves , strong main characters & lots of sexual scenes . I do n't read to many of these ROMANCE books but the story line was really good . It tells of acceptance & loyalty . Woman will be able to relate to Alexandra . She is : strong , beautiful , confident , & a fighter . Yet she is also a little scared , uncertain of what lays ahead , & if she will be accepted by this new family she has yet to meet . There are 3 in this series so far , I will be downloading the next book today . : - )	1
I loved Greta and Rip ! I look forward to seeing what 's coming in the next book in the series ! Thanks !	1
As I found with many of Shiloh Walker 's kindle books they are short . If you see a low price on one of her books it 's probably because it is n't a full length novel . Candy Houses is the 1st in the Grimm Circle series . As with ALL of Shiloh Walker 's books you wo n't be diappointed .	1
4 1/2 stars . `` Candy Houses '' by Shiloh Walker is the first novella in her Grimm series , a very different take on familiar fairy tales and fables . Forget everything you remember about the story of Hansel and Gretel and allow yourself to be drawn into this mesmerizing tale of Greta , a woman who survived the torture inflicted upon her by her evil stepmother and stepbrother and became a Grimm . Those who become Grimm have their work cut out for them , to protect the mortals on earth from the monsters who seek to destroy them . As each joins the hunt , they are granted increased fighting and survival skills but they are also given individual special gifts that are unique to them as well as a silver medallion that has wings and letters engraved upon it . Traditionally , they tend to hunt alone but also have resources they can call upon when needed and they all have interacted with the mysterious Will who has guided them on their journey and who interferes as he deems necessary . Greta discovers a new potential victim who inexplicably has access to a demon tome which is full of invocations for summoning all sorts of demons . Unfortunately , destruction of the book is not going to solve the problems that have arisen and Greta inadvertently requires the assistance of her Grimm colleague , Rip , whether either is happy with the arrangement or not . The two must learn to work together and deal with their past and present attraction to one another while they each fulfill the task before them or each will fail.A imaginative twist on a traditional tale that reimagines familiar characters with a sensual and intriguing flair . The contrast between the action-packed fight scenes and the flowering relationships plus the mystique behind the Grimm make this an enthralling read . The gradual introduction of tidbits about the various characters and the reinterpretation of traditional tales makes this an intriguing start to the series and whets one 's appetite for more .

Shiloh Walker is here to give the Brothers Grimm some competition . In her new series , Grimm 's Circle , Walker creates a cool new world in which guardian angels are more human than ever before , and we get to see the truth behind the fairy tales.The first book in the series , `` Candy Houses '' , tells the story of Greta and Rip . You 've read about them before- Gretel of Hansel and Gretel fame , and Rip Van Winkle of the long , long nap- but never like this . They have both become Grimms , sort of combination paranormal-superhero-guardian angels . Their role is to protect people from monsters and demons . As Rip explains it , there must be balance ; if there 's evil there 's also good , and visa versa . `` Candy Houses '' is a novella , approximately 100 pages in .pdf form . I am the first to admit that I 'm normally not a fan of short stories when it comes to romance or mysteries . Those are two genres that need time to develop in order to gain the realism or depth that makes them interesting . However , Shiloh Walker has converted me . The romance did n't feel rushed or fake ; it was actually sweeter and more believable than many I 've read . The writing was , as always , excellent , the plot engaging , and the characters well developed.There are thousands of fairy tales out there , and I do n't doubt that fans will be clamoring to see Walker put her unique spin on their favorites .	1
Overall , Candy Houses is an amazing story , and while it is an ebook , it is totally worth the effort of getting and reading it . There are not very many books that make me instantly want to get a sequel enough to preorder it , but as soon as I heard No Prince Charming was going to be released , that 's exactly what I did . In fact , I can tell you exactly how many novels I 've preordered in the past two years , because I 've only done it twice . Seriously , Candy Houses is a fabulous and everyone should be reading it at some point.To read my full review , please check out Literary Escapism .	1
Reviewed by FRANCESCA & posted at Under the Covers Book BlogI 'm not sure what I was expecting from this series but my definite first attraction was the fact that this series is based on fairytales . There are n't enough erotic books out there that play on this , so I was super excited . I should 've known that this being a Shiloh Walker book , I was n't going to get flowery fairytales . And I could n't be more pleased . The Grimm 's Circle series is not your everyday fairytale , it 's better.CANDY HOUSES was dark and a bit gritty . Definitely not your everyday fairy tale but it incorporated those elements beautifully . I do n't think I 've read it done better . Because see , the Grimm brothers got it all wrong . Oh their stories have a base on the truth , but they got a few things incorrectly . This story features Greta ( Hansel & Gretel ) , who does n't go by Gretel anymore because of her past and her psycho brother ( yep Hans ) . But see Greta is a grimm , sort of an angel warrior against evil demons.Hundreds of years ago there was something between Greta and Rip ( Van Winkle ) and now they have to work together when a human has a demon book and has planned and attempted a summoning . Things just get more complicated when they figure out she might be a grimm as well.I think this book did a pretty good job at explaining the world of the grimms , although I think I needed just a bit more but I understand the limits of a novella . I loved the grimms aspect of each having special powers , and their silver medallions , and that they have wings . I also enjoyed that we go back in time to see Gretel 's story . But I really enjoyed the connection between Rip and Greta . This book was heavy on the romance for what it lacked on the world explanations and I appreciate that.I am really looking forward to reading the rest of the series and to discover more about the grimms as I continue to read . I am definitely intrigued by their boss Will and ca n't wait to see what Ms. Walker will do with another fairytale because this one ... was a job well done ! *Review copy provided by author	1
This was the first book that I read by Lissa Matthews and overall I enjoyed it.The scenes between Aidn and Bailey were hot and as a `` curvy '' woman , I was able to relate to Bailey throughout the story.Like other reviewers have mentioned , the story ended too soon ( which is why only 4 stars ) . It would have been great to have seen more development of the relationship of Aidn and Bailey both in and out of bed . Who am I kidding , I would have enjoyed seeing Aidn dominate Bailey and Bailey surrender to Aidn .	1
Though Aidn and Bailey have crossed paths at a fetish club they both belong to , the first real meeting opens the story . The conversation is a bit stilted and awkward but totally fits the situation and shows how human both characters are . Neither of them is willing to end the encounter , though , because they can both feel the electricity and desire that arcs between them . The heat between them explodes when they 're alone and they ca n't keep their hands off of each other . Though the sex is great , the intense emotion it contains scares Aidn . His fear and uncertainty make him an extremely endearing character . Likewise , Bailey 's determination about Aidn being the one for her proves her strength of character . Watching the two of them dance around the relationship they could have if they let themselves makes this story fun to read.Lissa Matthews has written a really enjoyable story with an ending that wo n't disappoint . The final scene is a totally fitting way to end this book . - Karin	1
I absolutely LOVE Misty Evans books ! ! ! I have such a hard time putting them down when I start . I even wake up in the middle of the night to read more ... Makes for a long day at work the following day - lol .	1
Loved the sex , there is a good story not great but pretty good . SEX is amazing enjoy it and so will your partner	1
I got both this and the first two stories in this series at the same time and I have to say I devoured them all in much less than two days . I loved the world Moira Rogers 's created and I could n't help wanting more and more of it ! The modern world and society are hell on werewolf traditions and the packs living in big cities have been corrupted into something more akin to a dictatorship.Red Rock is home of one of the few packs in the world where the old laws and traditions are still appreciated and is also considered sanctuary to those who need to escape the cruel life among the distorted packs.In Sanctuary 's Price we get to se the love story between the werewolf Dylan and the witch Sasha . A Romeo & Juliet sort of story , since werewolves and witches have been at war for centuries and the prejudice against each other runs quite deep.I love me some Alpha males , that is no secret , but what I really loved about this story was that Dylan was n't really an Alpha male , he is more on the fringe of the pack 's dynamic and even considered a weaker wolf . It was great to see that just because he is n't an Alpha , is does n't mean he is n't strong and able to defend those he love and care about.Sasha is terrified , all the time , ever since her mentor was killed and she has had to hide amongst the werewolves , most of which hate her for being a witch . Just like Dylan , I loved seeing her prove to be much more than what people 's perception of her.Dylan and Sasha are so perfect for each other and it 's impossible not to pull for them from page one . I also love that even though the romance was definitely at the forefront of the novel , there was so much more going on plot wise , that you could n't help but getting engaged in the action and the stakes in play.Ever since I read Moira Rogers 's South Arcana series I 've been a fan , The Red Rock Pass series just cements my love for this great duo of authors . Rogers is an automatic buy for me now ! If you love PNR just as much as I do , check out this series ! Originally Posted at Welcome to Larissa 's Bookish Life { larissaslife DOT com }	1
Sanctuary 's Price is the third book in Moira Rogers ' Red Rock Pass Series . I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books in this series and this book did not disappointDylan Gennaro is a werewolf who 's been alone for most of the last 10 years . He knows from previous experience that getting involved with anyone only leads to them getting hurt , literally . After a desperate escape from Alan Matthews , his former ruthless pack Alpha , Dylan just wants to fix up a house and live peacefully in Red Rock.Sasha Wallace is a witch . Her mentor was killed by Matthews because Matthews wanted Sasha for himself . Before she was rescued however , Matthews inflicted scars both physical and mental , and those take a long time to heal . Sasha knows things could have been much worse and feels she owes a debt to the Red Rock Pack for rescuing her.When a werewolf comes back into town showing evidence of a vampire attack , the Red Rock Alpha decides to send Dylan and Sasha to Maine to call in a debt from a friend - a vampire friend . While Dylan and Sasha meet with the vampire , their pack-mates , Joe and Brynn , are tasked with checking out the local werewolf pack , as there have been hints of trouble . Little do they know what kind of trouble is waiting for them . I liked the fact that we get to see how Brynn is progressing since the end of Sanctuary Lost . Her situation was fascinating and heartbreaking at the same time.Dylan and Sasha ' story was sweet and sexy . They both had issues to work through as a result of being under Alan Matthew 's `` rule '' and I like that Moira Rogers did n't sugarcoat their issues and go straight to a HEA . Their insecurities were realistic and the potential conflicts resulting from their issues made for believable characters . Dylan is not Alpha but his werewolf instincts were very , very sexy . When Dylan tells Sasha , `` I 'm not like the alphas . I do n't want your submission . I just want your pleasure . `` , I almost melted . The sexual tension between these two left burn marks on my kindle ! In this story we also meet a certain flannel-wearing lumberjack vampire who 's apparently got an interesting history ; I believe we 'll see more of him in the next book , Sanctuary Unbound . I give Sanctuary 's Price 4/5 stars !	1
If what you want is hot steamy vampire guys and juicy menage and M/M sex , this is the perfect short read . I was ready to shove the heroine out of the way and take her place.There 's also some great description of the old theatre in London where the vampire sex club is located.Weaknesses - not much of a story . Nissa is conveniently orphaned and does n't have a job or any ties to the mortal world she 'd regret abandoning , so there 's little conflict for her , nor , so it seems , for the vampire Hex she bonds with . Set in London 2069 , we really do n't get to look around the place much ; most of the action takes place in very luxurious beds . Or showers.This was not an issue for me . I was looking for a chocolate truffle kind of read , not a full meal , so I savored every bite . If you are looking for something longer/deeper/with an intricate plot , you may be disappointed .	1
Wow , this was a great start to a new vampire series . The romance scenes were well written and hot . The futurist world that the author creates is both interesting and detailed . The story was the perfect length- not too short , and it did n't drag on and on . I would gladly read other books by this author . The kindle edition was a good value .	1
I love Eden 's vampires ! It is always interesting g to see what twists each author has In the vampire worlds they have created , and I have to say that these are some of my favorites . I love the connection between the 3 main characters , both physical and emotional . Beautiful ending . This book was a great intro to a new world . Ca n't wait to read more of this series ! !	1
This is Vivian Arend 's second visit to Granite Lake and the wolves that live there . Having read the first book , I was intrigued to see where she would take me with this visit . This is first and foremost a love story more than anything . That the main characters just happen to be wolves at times takes nothing away from that . I love Granite Lake , the richly detailed scenic areas that these stories are set in . Ms. Arend 's character development is nothing short of superb . I love the gentle strength and determination that Missy displays when she is faced with trouble . She does n't run away , she just works toward her goals . I giggled a bit when Tad was called to the Granite Lake pack and told there was someone willing to Firstmate with him and he was sure it was an older , blue haired woman he had seen at gatherings . The pleasant surprise he felt when he learned Missy was the one offering was genuinely portrayed , as was his relief . And the misunderstanding that arose when Tad tried to be noble and not force a bond on Missy , thinking she had a chance to meet her true mate was humorous , although quite painful for Tad in the end . When the confrontation with the nasty alpha comes , it is an interesting situation . Do Tad and Missy have their happily ever after ? Yes , but it is hard won in the end . I would recommend this book for anyone who loves action , romance and a side order of humor along the way .	1
It is very rarely that I find a book that makes me not want to take care of my customers because I want to stay with the book . I understood a great deal of the book and even though I am not into `` God '' stories , this one was able to hold up on its own when I skipped past those parts . As a woman who has escaped an abusive relationship I was able to see the conflicts in Ruth when she was looking for ways to escape without more people getting hurt . I liked the ways the author showed the conflicts she had with killing or not killing Rewis , with helping or not helping Bobby and the disappointment experienced every time she thought she escaped just to be caught again by Rewis . The flashbacks were a little heavy but they did put some context into what she had been through and what she was feeling . Her final self reflection and decision to start over was a good way to end the story , I felt completed and not wanting to know what was going to happen next .	1
I enjoyed the book , and it held my attention well . There were a few times when I thought `` Oh my God , do n't do that ! '' but , trying to put yourself in that position is impossible . The title says it , Ruth had to make sacrifices to keep others safe , and to survive herself . I did have a little trouble with the timeline , and there were parts that seemed a little repetitive , but I thoroughly enjoyed it and will be checking out some of the author 's other titles !	1
The opening sentence of Janice Daugharty 's `` The Sacrifice '' is , `` At first sight of the house , Ruth felt she heard the shock gong of a horror movie . '' Never did Ruth 's thoughts serve her better . She and her friend Mandy were on a long walk , and from the east bank of the Alapaha River in southeast Georgia Ruth had spotted a house she had never seen before . Right in the midst of her own and her Grandpoppee 's territory , someone had built a nice house on the river and it was hard to spot , difficult to see unless you walked right up on it . Ruth just had to take a peek inside , but Mandy stayed back , not so brave as Ruth was in going up and looking in the windows of the assumed vacant house . Ruth was wrong . There was someone inside and he fit the thoughts of `` the shock gong of a horror movie . `` Rewis was an escaped inmate from the prison , along with another man , and Rewis was a serial killer . There was no way that he would allow Ruth to run away now that she had seen him . Mandy was terrified once she saw what was happening . Rewis grabbed Ruth and eventually stabbed Mandy and kept Ruth as his hostage in a harrowing and suspenseful trip in a stolen boat down the Alapaha River on his way to Florida . Using Ruth 's life as insurance that he would get there , Rewis takes off on his trip with nothing but cruelty and murder and a loaded gun in mind as he makes his way down the river.As is characteristic of Janice Daugharty 's writing , the scenery is described in detail so that the reader has no question about where the characters are and what they are seeing . Each tupelo branch that was grabbed to pull the boat up on a sandbar to moccasins hanging overhead , I visualized each minute of their frightening and water-soaked boat ride moments as well as Rewis 's murderous rampages and Ruth 's moments of trying to escape . I appreciate the flashbacks into the lives of the characters because these give the background of their lives before the kidnapping happened , otherwise the reader would n't know much about them.Ruth has faith in God and uses her faith to give her strength . Although some readers prefer not to read religious references in novels , I 'm sure it is not by coincidence that the kidnapped character is named Ruth . When staying with the other escapee who had found her and thinking she was safe at last , Bobby , Rewis 's escape partner , tells her the story of Ruth in the Bible and makes Ruth laugh at the humor he puts into it , but that earlier Ruth had made sacrifices , too . The religious references are not overdone , but embolden the character and the strength of the 17-year-old hostage.This is a very suspenseful novel . I read it in two evenings because I could n't put it down . I needed to know what was going to happen to Ruth . She had several attempts at escape and several opportunities to put Rewis out of commission , but her reasons for not carrying out any of these were for Ruth 's own personal beliefs and fears . She took the high road when she could have saved herself by sacrificing the lives of others.The twist at the end I never saw coming . Other reviewers saw hints of it , apparently , but I 'm glad I did n't because it made the end just that much better for me . This book speaks of many different kinds of sacrifices , and from both of these characters we see the meaning of the word and of greater sacrifice.This is a highly recommended book for its character-driven plot , its richness of place and depth of character development and its place in literary fiction . Characters and locations from other of Ms. Daugharty 's books appear , also , which lends continuity to the settings of her wonderful stories of life in southeast Georgia .	1
This is a great book . I really enjoyed how the characters were developed . Brian Moore is a youngin , at 18 yrs old . ( hence the title ) who has n't quite learned what he wants to do in life .

Both of these women are on his back tough , baby mama # 1 wants him to spend , spend and spend until he ca n't no more . Sonia wants him to quit the street life and do right by her and the soon to be born baby . With so many decisions , Brian does n't know which way to go.He ends up doing one last stick up that can set him and his kids and Sonia for life ... however , when something goes wrong and people are n't who they are portraying to be , Brian gets caught slippin ... and now he must stop being a youngin and become a man ... Ca n't wait until pt . 2	1
This was a pretty good read ... .It was rather quick also ! I read it in a few hours ... This coming of age tale was very realistic and captured a teens life in the hood . The book showed how the choices you make eventually catch up to you . Great read and I cant wait to read book 2 !	1
I got this book free . And I must say , this is a very good book ! It 'll show you that you have no friends when you 're in a tough situation.This is a MUST read ! ! ! I have no expectations while reading in , but I soon found out what a great book this is ... .You should really one click cause you wo n't be disappointed .	1

Not soon after the po-po arrest him for the murder , he goes to jail and Devon leaves all the money with their childhood friend Quana so she can help Brian get out and Devon takes the drugs and disappears . Very good story .	1
I started reading and did n't want to put this book down , it kept me on edge to the very end and just when I thought everything was working out for Brian , I was in for a rude awakening . What a great read !	1
This book gave a lot of twist and turns . Real good story looking forward to part 2 . Is Brian really going to have to do all that time . What a pity . I hope it is just as good as the first . What oh what will Brian do ? : - ) Do I trust Sonia I hope so .	1
In the rather corpulent and bloated market of supernatural romances , this book stands out with its more creative setting and characters . Like a dark Alice in Wonderland , poor Two falls down the rabbit hole of vice and is mysteriously rescued by Theroen . Theroen , as anybody can guess , is a vampire and he introduces her into a dark world of violence and suspense . Readers are kept on the edge , by not knowing how characters would react and whether there would be indeed a happy ending for the characters . The ending is rather open ended , which I suppose gives a good platform for a sequel , but is not as satisfying .	1
This story was beautiful . I was saddened by Twos life and her lost love . In some ways I was surprised by the ending and others not .	1
Christopher Buecheler 's writing is crisp and the darkness he weaves with his words is very entrancing . This is not a typical romance , there is heart ache , but Buecheler makes the main character a strong figure you can really look up to . Every time it seems like she should give up , she brushes herself off and keeps going . Overall , a good read that I accidentally downloaded when I was going to try a sample . : )	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this book , it pulls together the first book nicely . The characters were developed in the first book and thought the second in the Triology was really good and can not wait for the third in the Trilogy . The fact the author really made it sound like a present day happening , was great . I would recommend both the books . These are just nice easy reading with thought put behind the characters which I appreciated rather than the usual romantic vampire books with too much sex and not enough story line .	1
I was leery of this book due to the `` teenage '' appearance of the cover . Thought it 'd be a cheesy vamp/romance . Totally untrue ! From the first page I was HOOKED . Great read . NOT for teens . Do n't let the R.L Stine- ish cover fool you ... it 's pretty intense in places . Also , for those of us `` less discerning '' readers , lol , it 's a book that took me into the world far enough that the inconsistencies did n't negatively affect the book in the least . I do however hope that the next one has an even better flow .	1
Really enjoyable book . I read it for the story not to edit the typos , I do n't notice little things like that if I like the book . I could have used less of the intimate sections and more of the conflict between creator and fledgling . I was teary reading the reunion of family members . It gets an A from me .	1
FYI . I got this book Free in the Kindle Store and read it all within 1 week on my Kindle Fire.Im a Sci-Fi addict and this book had all the 'right stuff ' , like Mystry , Love , Heartbreak , Drama and Characters you wan na root for . Yes this is a Vampire story , but with a twist.If you are a Sci-Fi addict like myself then you must at least give this a read . So , after swearing I would not be buying any books from Amazon ( I buy enough Movies , Games & MP3 ) I 'm stuck with the delima of paying $ 2.99 for part two of the trilogy . Curse you Amazon : )	1
I really enjoyed this book . I love vampire stories . I 'm not crazy about the `` good vampires '' but this one was different . I will definately read the other two in this series . Mr. Buecheler tells a good story , and he makes you care about his charachters , in a good or bad way . I will read this one again . Try it , you 'll like it !	1
An atypical Vampire heroine and other characters make this highly detailed view from a transition between mortal , immortal , depraved humanity and vampirism and all flavors in emotion . This goes for many of the characters . The treatment of human characters other than that of the heroine is somewhat shallow . Treatments of the vampire characters are deep and detailed . Thus the humans seem shallow , and the vampires have more character . This is diametric to the normal vampire genre , and quite refreshing . There is steamy sex , butchery , finesse , exhilaration , drug dependence , love , hate , jealousy , revenge , depression , murder , salvation . I found the book to be a little wordy , but who cares if it 's fun to read anyway ? Makes the experience last longer.I would recommend it to others and wait impatiently for more .	1
I was very pleasantly surprised by this book . I picked it up because it was a free read , expecting it to be at most OK , but I really enjoyed the story . The main character is a down and out heroin addicted prostitute who falls in love with the vampire that turns her . For me , the ending was not even close to what I thought it would be . In some ways a bit of a let down because it did n't really end with all the good guys living happily ever after BUUUT the fact that it did n't really follow the whole `` and the two vampire lovers lived happily ever after '' format was a really nice change.As another poster mentioned , yes it could use a good editor and there 's probably a few story line items in the book that could use some work . It 's not a real thought provoking work of art , but overall it was a really nice , easy read . The author should have a second follow-up book either already out or in the works and I 'll definitely look into that .	1
The first half of the book , imo , lacks cohesion . The characters are not very developed . I never understood going from not knowing each other to joking like they had been doing it for years . The story line jumps around and it can be really confusing . And somewhat boring . As is the debating about morality and vampires.But about half way through , it all changes . I still do n't see WHY the character 's came together , but the story from now on makes sense.I am looking forward to the next books in this series .	1
I thought Sleepwalker : the Last Sandman was very well written and incredibly entertaining . This indie author is bursting with talent . I understand this is a YA book but it is tremendously enjoyable for adults as well.The story itself was interesting and fun . It was a sort of story in a story , but did not get unnecessarily complicated or confusing . The book takes place in two different worlds and again , it was not confusing . Also , it was easy to envision the dream world from all the descriptions . The characters were all fully developed and not flat or two dimensional at all . I liked everything about this book - story , characters and their development , vivid descriptions , and great imagination.My favorite parts of the book were when Jake would tell a story . They were captivating tales and they fit right into the story.Well done , Brad Marlowe . I sincerely hope that there is another book in the works .	1
`` I fell through the hole in the sky '' I loved this line ! ! Enjoyed this book very much . I look forward to reading it to my grandchildren when they get a bit older . I would compare it to the Never Ending Story , Alice in Wonderland , and a Twilight Zone episode All wrapped up in one . This would really make a great movie.I will keep an eye out for more from this Author . I do not have much to critique and will leave that to the `` professionals '' but if you want an entertaining book to keep you guessing , then click the buy now button .	1
Although I only read the first part of her story , it is hard to imagine that a little girl had to endure what she did . This is something that should not be real and only happens in horror stories .	1
This is a good little mystery with quite a few not-so-subtle digs at the stereotypical new money California crowd from a few years ago when real estate boomed . I was concerned that the humor would get old and ruin the read , but it really does n't . It 's more like you 'll be reading these situations and get all into it and then stop and say'what ? ! ' And you can laugh because it 's really just a few degrees of exaggeration . This is no blockbuster but if you 're looking for a quick , light read it 'll do !	1
a thinly disguised romp thru san franciscos high end real estate market with a who done it and who is doing who pot boiler theme ... ... ... a laugh out loud funny well crafted murder mystery with recognisable names and land marks of real san francisco ... ... a thouroly enjoyable escape short enough to be read in one marathon night of giggles howls and baited breath .	1
Book 1 is set on Earth after years of subtle take over by an alien race . It delivers the back story while developing the characters of the two main protagonists Nick Tanner and CJ Montgomery , building them so that you can easily step into their point of view . Mrs. Delaney has accomplished a remarkable move here in balancing between the two and the story is quite enjoyable . I look forward to the next installment	1
Delaney scores with Book One of the Phoenix Rebellion , `` Revolution . '' Set in the near future , Delaney puts together an ensemble cast of characters and pits them against the Areth for the survival of the human race.The Areth come from outer space and appear human . They 've come to Earth and shared medical technology with us , but little else . A group of humans , `` The Phoenix Rebellion , '' believe the Areth do not have peaceful intentions toward the human race . Covertly , a member of the Rebellion , Dr. Caitlin Montgomery , infiltrates the Areth 's medical complex in New Mexico . Caitlin learns that an Areth scientist , Kathleen , gave birth to a half-human , half-Areth child , Michael . Michael 's father is a human , Col. Nick Tanner . Caitlin finds Nick in Maine and shares the information with him . He 's stunned . He thought his wife and son had died in childbirth . Without a second thought , Tanner joins the Rebellion , despite the fact that his feelings for Caitlin are complicated due to their previous affair which ended badly.Nick finds General Castleton in Colorado and meets other members of the Rebellion - a married couple , Lilly , who is a doctor and her pilot husband , Jace . There 's also an empath , Dr. Beverly Surimoto . After a carefully coordinated plan , the Rebellion attack the Areth 's complex in New Mexico , hoping to free the Areth 's subjects - including Michael . An Areth scientist , Victor , has befriended Michael and helps the Rebellion . All is not well with Victor though , as he begins having a mental breakdown . The escape from the Areth 's complex in New Mexico is a thrill ride , but one of the Rebellion loses his life and the fate of the human race hangs precariously in the balance.Delaney 's writing is sharp . After a quick introduction to the Areth , Delaney jumps into the story . The plot flows well , never lingering . Delaney uses a good economy of words to paint descriptions . It 's easy for the reader to visualize her futuristic world.Delaney 's characters are what makes this science fiction story shine . Col. Nick Tanner is a passionate man who has been hurt deeply in the past . Learning to trust Caitlin again is a struggle . Caitlin , for her part , realizes the folly of her youth , and tries to make up for it . The couple 's chemistry is on a slow , smoldering burn that threatens to consume both when ignited . Victor 's plight is heartbreaking , especially since he 's an alien who shows Michael compassion . Michael 's condition is intriguing . It 's never fully explored in this book , leaving the reader wanting to discover more about him.The story is `` sophisticated '' for romance readers . Delaney 's love scenes are intense , yet tasteful . Book One : Revolution is a story packed with adventure , excitement , and love , making it a thrilling start to `` The Phoenix Rebellion '' series .	1
I found the information very helpful , I am actually looking forward to becoming a non smoker ! ! I feel sure I can do it with the tips provided in this book . Ready to take control of my life back ! !	1
Pretty incredible . One only needs to find the motivation . Will power has nothing to do with it.Every day I still get these small moments of bliss , which I previously thought were cravings . They 're not . They are enjoyable moments of pure happiness over finally having kicked the habit .	1
This book is well written switching from past to present . It tells the life story of a woman who was abused and molested from the age of 8 by the pedophile next door . She became pregnant at 13 years old an had to give up the baby and do it all alone emotionally . I do n't want to spoil the ending so I will stop here .	1
very heartbreaking story and It kept my interest all the way through . I do n't have any thing else to say	1
As I read this book it became clear to me that this kind of thing happens in real life but it does n't make it right . And two the author thank you for sharing part of your life with us . As I turned the pages of this book I felt your sorrow . I was happy to read that your husband was good to you , you sure deserve it ! May your life be blessed with many grandchildren and may Sonia find it in her heart to include you in her life	1
There are some books that once you start reading you Don '' t want to stop I read the first 30 chapters the first evening and finished the book in two days . Well written .	1
I can not imagine someone growing up under the circumstances that Marianne did without becoming so embittered that normal life was n't possible . I finished this book in two days , I could n't put it down . I would love to see a toned down version of this book in 5th grade reading classes . How do you teach young children the warning signs other than if it does n't feel right tell someone . I felt her loneliness and despair .	1
really loved the ending and I hope she is now able to have regular visits from her daughters.I hope both the daughters relize it was not her fault.It does break my heart that The Man next door got away with what he done .	1
This book brought tears to my eyes more than once . I gave this book a five star because it takes one Hellova women to overcome a child hood like that trust me I know . This book reads fast and smooth with one hell of a story that will break your heart .	1
This was a fantastic read . I enjoyed immensely the suspenseful writing on love , relationships , mystery and intriguing suspense as to what was going to happen next . Great read !	1
Although I enjoyed reading this it would not be on the top of my list to recommend unless you were just looking for a light story to take your mind off every day life for a short time . The main character went from being a strong business woman trying to make partner in her company , to insecure family business owner back in her old hometown . While her cousin constantly went from duress to having a conscience to ruthless . Of course there 's also the possibility that I 'm the one getting jaded from reading too many of these types of stories !	1
This is a very intriguing story . Many characters to follow but the author describes each one so explicit that you feel that you can describe and personally know each one . Good book , hard to put down . I highly recommend this story if your interests are in fashion , glamour and mystery . Surprises all the way through .	1
Everything I wrote about The Mysterious Island belongs here -- have n't read that one yet , but it is on my list ... soon ! I like to read a variety of literature types , and prefer to switch around .	1
[ ... ] I have read several translations of Journey to the Centre ( center ) of the Earth , but I find this the most readable of those generally available . I give it a five-star rating .	1
It 's an oldie but a goodie . That 's what I like to say about books that are written so long ago and yet they still remain relevant and entertaining . A Journey to the Centre of the Earth is no exception . While the original publication goes back to 1864 , it is a fun romp nonetheless . It should be noted that , over the years , different translations of the book have been made . This version from Amazon comes at the low , low cost of free . One notable difference between this translation and the original is that the name of one of the main characters is changed . But these things are trivial , as the story of a professor , his nephew , and a loyal guide is entertaining the whole way through.The Good : There were a few things I really liked about this book . First , the adventure . The excursion into the unknown was fascinating . Nevermind that what happens in the book could never actually be real ; when you are reading the story you imagine that it is . You feel the danger and suspense as the three explorers go deeper into the earth and discover many fascinating things . Also , I found it interesting that the story is written as if it is an actual , educational account . Throughout the entirety of the book , the narrative explains the meaning of certain scientific terms and past discoveries that are relatable to what the explorers see and experience . It certainly is a fun journey to follow them as they make their way to the center of the earth ! The Bad : One problem with a book that is so old is the terminology and phrasing . There are many words and phrases used that we just do n't use today . At times , I had some trouble understanding exactly what was being described or talked about . For instance , on more than one occasion it mentions how the explorers stopped to have `` repast '' . This is n't a term most would use today , and it simply means they stopped to eat or have a meal . Also , the pacing in the beginning is a little slow , and the real fun of the adventure does not begin until about a third of the way through the book.The Ugly : This one is not really a fault of the book , after all , I have to take the time period it was written in into account . This book has seen a few adaptations in the film industry . The result is that I was expecting some of the things I have seen in the movies . Despite all the wonderful things seen on their journey , all of what they see is plausible for the time period written . Instead of finding areas with lack of gravity or floating rocks , the explorers happen upon a world stuck in the far past , thousands of years before their journey . All of it , in a sense , was real at one point . Many of the movies today depict things that have never happened in the earth 's history , and fantastical things that it will probably never see either . If you are expecting an account following what has been shown in film , you may be disappointed.Overall , I really liked A Journey to the Centre of the Earth . It was fun to see into the past in more way than one and appreciate the perspective of a science fiction writer from a century and a half ago . I highly recommend you read this , if you have n't already . This is classic science fiction . Like I said at the beginning , it 's an oldie but a goodie .	1
An outstanding adventure awaits anyone that reads this book . Verne is one of the most versed writers I 've ever accounted . I checked the definition of a lot of words with my kindle and was surprised at the appropriateness and context of the archaic terms . A five star story .	1
I am enjoying my books on Kindle . This book is a great classic and especially enjoyable as a carry along when traveling .	1
Professor Hardwigg finds a note written by Arne Saknussem inside of a scientific text that says he journeyed to the center of the Earth . Determined to do the same and become famous for it , Hardwigg and his nephew pack up and go to Iceland to follow in Saknussem 's footsteps.Although the science is rather dated , the book is still a good read and held my attention throughout . It was interesting to see how far science has come and to realize that some of the things we think of as truths now may be proven wrong in the future . This was a good old adventure story and I would recommend it .	1
This is one of my favorite classic Jules Verne novels . I read this over and over again . Much better than the movies , although with the movies you have a visual component .	1
The science is old and outdated . The book is still Verne 's greatest ( although I have yet to read many ) . This book is the ancestor to modern SF , and it is not encouraging to see many disregard it and consider it junk . It is old and hard to follow , but it is still one of the best .	1
This is my all time favorite Jules Verne story . Classic Sci-Fi . This is also one of the stories I enjoy sharing with son , while he prefers the Tom Swift series , curiousity about the center of the earth kept him interested.If you enjoyed Journey to the Center of the Earth , you may also enjoy these stories ( also free ) : Edgar Rice Burroughs `` At the Earth 's Core '' ( 1914 ) Roy Rockwood `` Five Thousand Miles Underground '' ( 1907 )	1
some of it is pretty dry but the is a lot of new information in it that I had never heard before . Indians believe in telling the truth because it is cowardace to lie . Fear of what the other persons reaction will be .	1
Do i really need to review it ? Its EDGAR ALLEN POE . if you need an introduction to Poe , ask your kindergarten teacher to read it to you , the words may cause you trouble .	1
I enjoyed this book of quotes from various sources . It us a good reference book and the index is very helpful . It was easy to look up various people and their quotes , some included the year .	1
Reading this book makes me happy , sometimes the author does get a bit too wordy , but the story is so intense and the characters so well written that you do n't really care .	1
This was a great classic story that I have not read since I was a child . An amazing journey and still a great read for all ages .	1
A mesmerizing story . Thinking back to the movie with Kirk Douglas , Peter Lorre , and other great actors , which I saw on the big screen ... ... this book actually took you through the 20,000 leagues . Such detail that could not have been even considered on the cinematic presentation . Great job .	1
I am so glad I found this book on my Kindle . It 's hard to believe it took me so many years to read it . I enjoyed it so much . I ca n't explain how I felt reading this , it was so up-to-date . I would recommend this to anyone with eclectic taste in reading . Thank you .	1
This story features a slow simmering burn that starts in Tess and Joe 's hearts until it eventually consumes their entire being . This is not the type of love story that would traditionally interest me but the notion of an Englishman falling in love with his housesitter piqued my interest . I 'm very thankful that it did . While this type of story may not be something I would normally read , Secrets is definitely a book that I would read again.Tess and Joe seem to have much similarity , yet many differences as well . Both seem to have a stubborn streak in them , and a quick wit that makes their banter truly entertaining . They both harbor secrets they are not willing to relinquish while still seeking to learn what the other is hiding . Tess has a stronger inner strength within this story than Joe does . She is willing to throw caution to the wind and see where it takes her . It is one of the reasons she took the housesitting job in the beginning . Joe however , seems to be a little more reluctant to change , and clearly has demons in his past that continue to taunt him.The love story between Tess and Joe is not the immediate mind numbing attraction that many love stories have . I actually appreciated this different type of growth and it made this story stand out from many others I have read . I like that Tess and Joe start off as acquaintances who eventually grows into a friends that graduate to becominging lovers . While this may sound like it may be a little too slow or drawn out it actually read very well and keep me interested and wanting to find out more . Even after I completed the book , I remembered the characters ' names , which with the amount of books I read is a feat within itself.This is a story that I would recommend to anyone who loves a good love story whether it be a traditional romance or a more contemporary one . I think that all fans of romance could really curl up on the couch or in the bed and loose themselves for hours while learning Tess and Joe 's secrets.Originally posted at the Long and Short Romance Reviews .	1
I love the book and I think the formatting looks pretty close to the real thing , excluding the columns . I like how it 's searchable by book of scripture , book and chapter , I just wish it was searchable by verse as well .	1
very nice story about a girl making it big and not letting it get to her head . a little preachy though	1
The book had very believable , very likable characters , I would more than have happily paid for this story and will download more of her books . She is a very good author . Is more an erotic than a shorty story but it 's one of the better ones .	1
Although I skimmed through some difficult toread overly discriptive and obtuse passages , overall the story was a fun read . As others have pointed out the dialogue could have been a little less wooden and stereotypical . However I really want to see what happens next and I am certainly ready to buy the next book in a series ...	1
I liked this book , wish it was longer or had more volumes to it .	1
I really enjoyed this book . It is fast paced and fun to read . The story is quite clever and contains enough technical detail to make it interesting but not slow the story down . I 'm ready for the next book .	1
Do n't get me wrong , this was a good book . Fans of sci-fi will enjoy this book . In fact , I am sure that they will love it ! For me , it was a little to much & # 34 ; Aliens 4 & # 34 ; than & # 34 ; Aliens 1 , & # 34 ; if you get my drift.The author crafts a well-written story . The characters are good . The uniqueness of the novel , a new idea , not the same old sci-fi book , was fantastic . I enjoyed reading it . I ca n't really say anything bad about it . It is a good book .	1
This as usual is another one of Connie Shelton 's great writing endeavors . It gets you in the mood for Christmas and is a good read . The characters , the mood it sets are perfect !	1
I LOVE THAT WE GOT TO MEET DRAKES MOM IN THIS BOOK . THE WHOLE SERIES HAS BEEN EXCELLENT AND I LOOK FORWARD TO READING EVERYTHING IN THIS SERIES .	1
For anyone LDS , this is a terrific addition to their library . Adds great details to the story of what his life was like .	1
The author does a good job of building a self-contained and mythical world that interacts with the non-magical world around it -- in much the same way that Harry Potter 's contemporary world of magic is hidden while co-existing with the muggles ' reality.I had a little bit of trouble keeping the seven Byrne daughters clear at first , flipping back to the early description . Eventually , their characters sorted themselves out.The girls are self-reliant , thrown on their own devices with a new infant sister after their mother dies in childbirth . These are not the kick-butt women of adult urban fantasy , but gentler young women who rely on wisdom and cunning rather than on tough talk and gun or sword play . At one point , some of the sisters sacrifice their long hair to help nearby villagers in the non-magical reality . In other words , the Byrne sisters set good examples as females with inner strength , intelligence , resourcefulness , and compassion.In the tradition of classic fairy tales , their aunt turns out to be a black magic evil-doer . But they also have protective adults in their lives -- a close friend of their mother who becomes a mentor in magic and a mysterious gentleman from the Far East who comes bearing gifts and wisdom.As a series , this work has a lot of potential . There are , after all , the lives of seven protagonists to explore.I enjoyed this book , a free Kindle download , even though I am a senior citizen . I doubt that I will continue to read additional installments . But this is just the sort of book that delighted me as a young adult . I can imagine anxiously awaiting each new chapter in the lives of the magical Byrne daughters as I once waited for my Young Adult book-of-the-month club selections that my mother regularly renewed for me .	1
The book was easy to read and keep everyone where they belonged . The girls had such a tragedy but found a closeness and deep love for each other . Finding their own magic and how to use it for the good of themselves and others showed them how teamwork could accomplish much . The ending was just right ,	1
The herione gives a narrative of her sexual history while she bemoans the fact that she has extremely large breasts . Although she admits loving to have them stimulated she still feels that they are more trouble than they 're worth . She chronicles her story in an amusing way interspersed with phrases mentioning pain and scars . You begin to wonder maybe this is about more than sex.Carl is an important part of her sexual history and a standup friend of more than 15 years . He is the one rejected and now a treasured what if as she concludes her story . She begins to tell of loss and suddenly there is an explaination for direction of this story . Then I cried . There is a reason for the pain and the scars but most of all you understand how the metamorphosized butterfly is her symbol of life with hope.This is 22 pages of possibly the best short story I have ever read . It possitively amazed me . Kudos Ms. Brio . To you dear reader I hope this gift enriches your reading experience as it did mine . Highly recommend .	1
It 's a nice short story that literally made me cry . It 's a journal of how she got cancer and what happened . It 's beautiful = )	1
I liked this story and felt it was really a good read for the holiday season.. did n't want to put it down	1
both stories keep you wondering if they can overcome their past to forge a future together . love is hard to find and easy to mistake for lust or lust for love ... these authors keep the story moving at a steady pace and exciting ...	1
I was hooked from the start ... read all her books ... waiting for any new ones that she can get done	1
Terri Reed , has become one of my favorite authors by far ! Her stories always draw you in and captivate you . This story , taking place in a home for the elderly hit home with me . Things unfortunately go on inside those places that should never happen . I also found her references to religion and the characters unshakable faith more believable .Reading this story helped me know that I had made the right decisions in the case of my own loved one . There are lessons in this book that everyone should learn and once again she added just enough romance , and mystery to the story to keep you turning the page ... I loved this book	1
I really enjoyed this ... .. typical Mills & Boon medical romance but it was very easy to read , well written and the characters grow on you from the beginning .	1
This kept me so interested and enjoyed reading it . The plot of the story was good to the end of it .	1
Doctor and emergency room consultant James Morrell immediately recognizes the emergency room patient as his ex-wife , Dr. Lorna McClelland . She hated the situation but it brought back memories of their marriage .	1
Another one that I picked up as a Kindle freebie.James is one of the chief doctors in the emergency room at a London hospital , with a strict rule of never mixing his personal life with his work one . Until late one night a massive car accident brings an unexpected but familiar patient , his ex-wife Lorna , into the E.R . Lorna , also a doctor , but a small town GP looking for a change , was in London applying for a hospital position . With no close friends or family in the city , and in no shape to make a long journey back to Scotland James takes Lorna into his home and personally takes over her care.Soon James and Lorna find themselves questioning the painful reasons that their brief marriage ended ten years prior . Will bringing up the old tragedy and hurt that strained their relationship to it 's breaking point allow them to finally have closure , or will it bring them even closer ? I really enjoyed this book . It was very sweet and thoughtful . I really liked all of the characters and felt that the author presented them in a way in which the read could commiserate with both parties.This book is very emotional , but for Lorna , the heroine , it was mostly internal meaning she refused to talk to the hero about issues that were essentially keeping them apart . This is really the only problem I had with the story , because it prolonged the outcome of the book , making it longer than necessary .	1
Well-written and fast-paced . This is a second chance romance set in the UK and the author did a good job inserting scenes from the past into the present . I like both leads . I can understand how the pregnancy loss broke up their young marriage . The past misunderstanding is also handled fairly well.I would have preferred more angst in their renewed relationship though . Their reason for having sex is not very believable . It would have been better for them to just get carried away with each other.Some reviews here complain about the lingo but I did not find the medical bits distracting at all . The professional lives of these characters define them and give the story a strong sense of place . This book was a freebie but I definitely would have paid for it .	1
Interesting story filled with sorrow , hope , love faith . Held my attention hoping this couple in faith could work through their past .	1
CAROL DID AN AMAZING JOB WRITING THIS WONDERFUL LOVE STORY . IT WAS DRAMA FREE AND ROMANTIC . I WOULD DEFINITELY PURCHASE FUTURE BOOKS .	1
I try to avoid those romance novels with shirtless guys on the cover , or some sort of embracing , with titles that make you cringe , so I was hesitant to download this book . The plot and characters are much more enjoyable and with more depth than the title suggests . I liked the hospital setting .	1
This book is based out of London so it takes a few chapters to grasp the British terms but it is a heart filled romance that is a great read .	1
Emergency : Wife Lost and FoundWhat a wonderful way to get away from the daily grind and refresh for another day ! No matter your age , occupation , marital status or whatever , there always comes a time when you need to just `` get away '' for a bit , to put your mind in suspension , or TAKE A BREAK ! Happens to all of us . Well , this is the perfect way to do it . This is a very interesting and sweet story that will engage your thoughts and emotions , but not require you to do a great deal of thinking or involvement . But , you will smile , relax , and take away the BEST feeling ! The plot is interesting and the characters are well-drawn and could be someone you know . I loved it and I am sure that you will too !	1
I was genuinely surprised at how good , realistic and simple this story was . No one was pining to death over the simplest glance or touch . I especially liked how the heroine was n't a drama queen over his new love interest especially as this had been apart more years than they had been together.Even his difficulty in being her boss and letting her take the brunt of the flack for her overly investigative style from his staff was spot on - made me love them both more . LolWill be looking forward with less trepidation at other medical romances and books by this author ...	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this . It was so like life . I ca n't thank you enough for adding this title to the Kindle Fire list . As an eclectic reader , this book is high up on my romance list .	1
I found this to be a sweet story with two loveable characters , James and Lorna . The author did a great job of depicting their walk from the past and into the future . I liked the medical detail she included ; it made the story feel more real . The plot was predictable , but because of the relationship between the couple , it worked . I simply liked them too much to care . There were some sentences that could have been reworded to avoid using `` had been '' so much , especially at the very beginning . The story does have sex scenes , but they are tastefully done . Overall , a pleasant read .	1
Lorna and James are both doctors and also exs . James has tried to find her after 10 yrs . of separation . An emergency has the hospital in rushing mode . A multiple vehile accident has them in high gear.There is one last transport to the hospital by ambulance , that was a distance from the scene of the accident . Right away James is shocked by the patients `` Toe Nails - ( pink ) '' . This is Lorna - his ex.Lorna happened to be driving to a job interview , when she was caught up in the vehicle pile-up . She is in poor shape when she is brought in , but of course pulls through.As the hospital is so short staffed at the time she ends up filling in an application and being on staff at Jame 's hospital . She also is staying at his apt . to recoupurate . Happy ending as usual .	1
A lot of juiciness within 24 hours ! ! ! ! ! ! I very much like ! I held my breath hoping the character of the leading man would not be a disappointment .	1
The only reason this got four stars instead of five is that it should have been longer . I liked it as much as all of her other books , which is to say quite a lot . I 'd recommend it to anyone .	1
Great series and a great . She really keeps you wanting to read more and more . I have a hard time putting the books down once I start them .	1
I like her books because it is just like being there ( and I do n't have to look at a gory mess ) . Competition Can Be Murder is not her best work , but it is good . I do miss Rusty .	1
Drake and Charlie helping a friend and exploring another country and tradition . Seems a simple enough job.Until you find that someone does not like the idea of helicopter transporting workers . It gets really dicey when Charlie ends up without her helicopter flying and she is all wet and cold . Then the kidnapping and ransom demand.Not only competition , but a mystery.As always a good read.Shirley Ann	1
Charlie gets involved at the Albuquerque Balloon Festival and has a raring good time to show for it ! Her husband Drake is all but absent , but then he comes through in the end . Hot stuff , and another good read .	1
If you want to read a good book , just pick up this one and I guarantee , you will not be able to put it down !	1
I did not want to put my Kindle down . Connie Shelton knows how to create believable character which hold the reader 's interest !	1
Part 5 of 6 ! ! ! This book while having the Lennox Touch ! ! Was very unique because of the character Alana hurt by the illusion of love damaged by infidelity and hiding by pain-mets someone who sees beyond the ice queen reserve and wont take no for an answer . Gus shows enormous patience which is more important than his shoulder width ! Underneath the fairy tale of this story is a very important lesson it is hard to mend a broken heart but trust can work miracles	1
I love the Attracelli family . Gus did n't catch my eye in any of the previous books , but Alana certainly did and I thought it was great to get more of her back story as well as her love story ! Gus is just as sexy and alpha as the other Attracelli men , but Alana 's determined to fight her attraction every step of the way . With good reason , since she 's been burned pretty badly by marriage before . I love her do-gooder activities , her time with the kids , and her horror that people are more interested in whether or not she and Gus kissed last night than in giving some orphaned kids the opportunity to make it in life.Elizabeth Lennox has fast become one of my favorite romance authors , but the Attracelli family as a whole are my favorite characters of hers that I 've found so far .	1
I love Antonia 's misadventures and daring behavior and I 'm looking forward for her brother 's series especially Sal and Michael , its sad that Sophia have to die early in the story as well as their parents	1
I enjoyed this book a lot .. As well as I did the 1st one.. I like all three stories and all of the MC 's as well ... I loved how each story has the characters of the precious stories so all stories really flowed together.. The world the authors built was awesome as well .. Definitely recommend ! !	1
As in the first book , the world building is riveting and all the stories were interesting and well written . I noticed though a few mistakes that should have been caught by a proofreader and it 's a bit unexpected by this publisher . Here we go : Trust Me by Astrid AmaraBrian is now a hell cop . He is more or less a rookie . His osmotic abilities - he can draw energy from other living creatures and discharge it to heal or maim - are getting out of control , causing unwanted damage to those around him . At first it seems he does n't want to handle them and he 's unwillingness causes trouble with his boyfriend Jay , the hell cop detective who ca n't stop burning . The problems get worse when Brian is accused of killing a suspect in custody , since the death came through the draining of the suspect 's energy.In the previous book Brian was a sunny , naive character , but this time he shows a darker side that I think does n't depend solely on his uncontrollable abilities . The whole story takes a darker turn , because the mystery under investigation is about a terrible act that makes you feel sorry for the criminals.I liked reading about Jay 's feelings toward his family , how he feels isolated because he ca n't be included either to comfort or be comforted by them . It was also interesting to read how torn he felt for having to be separated from Brian and making him suffer because he risked of being hurt by him . They fear they wo n't manage to patch up their problems , especially because their abilities keep them apart from anyone else and without each other they face isolation and loneliness.In this story the world building is at its best.Dark Waters by Nicole KimberlingThis time this is my favorite couple , the half-demon professor Michael and hell cop Argent . I loved reading how they tried to reconcile their differences or how they decided to avoid or embark on arguments.Invited by one of his students , Michael goes to a sort of trailer park to research a faun ceremony , and Argent goes with him on vacation . There 's a feud going on between the fauns and the mermaids and murder happens . In order to allow Michael to interact with the fauns more freely , Argent does n't reveal he is a cop and he does a bit of investigation on his own , also because the ceremony seems to hide a shady and dangerous ritual.Since Michael is a demon himself and works in an organization devoted to bring peace between humans and demons , he often disagrees with the hell cops ' methods . He would also like for Argent to drop his shields when they 're together , to allow Michael 's telepathy to know his lover better . Even if they often fight , it 's clear that what they feel for each other is deep and humor often defuses the tenser arguments.It was really a pleasure to read.Such Heights by Ginn HaleThis was for me the best case of the three . James is a young human photographer and Moran is his hell cop lover . When we meet them , they 're relationship seems rocky . Moran is afraid that James will get seriously hurt while working one of his cases , because his natural curiosity puts him in a lot of danger . James knows that Moran is protective because in his past he lost someone he loved , but he wants the older man to understand that they both have dangerous professions and James just wants to do his job.After one of their fights and after being given a sort of ultimatum , James reaches a suspended palace where phoenixes live in order to film a documentary , but he does n't tell Moran . James witnesses the fall of a guest from the palace , a fall denied by the palace owner and his security guards , but the man falls to the ground and Moran is the designated detective . While James stirs all kind of trouble trying to find out what 's going on , Moran reaches the palace undercover and when the estranged lovers meet , they have to investigate together one more time.There are a few misunderstandings between James and Moran , but it takes a while for them to realize that they 're expressing the same concern for each other . I liked reading how they reached their compromises and how both their disagreements and their reconciliation were expressions of the deep love they feel . The age gap theme so prominent in the previous book was not explored here , even if James has the enthusiasm of a young man trying to pursue his career of choice , unheeding the perils of it , and Moran has the maturity of the older man who knows how to retreat and how to advance and what the priorities in life are.Very good collection . I recommend reading the previousHell Copfirst in order to enjoy both the world building and the different stories better .	1
I really enjoyed this book ... so much so that I purchased the next in the series . I loved the characters ( some really were `` chartacters '' too ! ) .	1
Two people could n't seem more opposite . Where Mike is mild-mannered , easy-going and slow to speak , Leah is a tiny tornado of words , action and gusto . Reunited by a 10 year class reunion , they share a mutual interest in photography and agree to help each other out by swapping projects . But Mike 's project is more than either expected . On a mission trip in Florida , people go missing , secret passages lead to despair and mystery surrounds the venture . Through it all Leah and Mike learn about themselves , each other , and the ever present workings of an almighty God.This novella is a quick and exciting read . The characters , adventure and mystery just kept the pages turning . Carter delivers a tight , well-written adventure that I devoured it in one sitting . The romance hinges on Biblical truths , and God 's perfect plan and closeness to his children is shown in a way that is touching while still being believable and natural . I give this story 5 stars and recommend it as a great `` mini-vacation '' .Fiction with Flair Christian Book Reviews	1
Interesting premise with 3 authors creating connected characters in a series . There was definitely a different 'voice ' or style to each author 's writing , but I found I liked them all.The stories each had a touch of fantasy , sci-fi , steampunk , fbi-agent , and paranormal tied together to keep it fun.This book was more enjoyable as I realized there was continuation book with Hell-Cop 2 , and I had to go out and purchase to see how it continues with the same three authors .	1
Good Book - easy to read . Ms. Lennox writes good stories . If you need a love story on a rainy or beach day this is it .	1
Yet another great story by Elizabeth . I get lost in the way that she writes her books . I have read them all and can find no fault with any of her books .	1
I think I have a new favorite series ! ! I loved the blending of cops with paranormal , a very unique storyline . Vic was quirky and charming . And Jacob was just H-O-T . Probably a 4-star read for me , but I loved the ending so much I threw in the other star . Ca n't wait to read more !	1
I enjoyed this blend of police and paranormal . I found the concept of a physic police force with different talents quite unique . The characters were quirky and fun and the murder case interesting . Victor and Jacob were very appealing and not your typical cop characters.I have seen many excellent reviews for this series and many five star ratings given . I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series and seeing if it grows on me more .	1
**4.5 stars**I am very very excited about this series . I love the character of Vic and the psycop world that Jordan Castillo Price created . This review wo n't be very long because I only have generalized gushy , lovey stuff to say about this series thus far . My main complaint is that I wish the book was longer . I could have used another 100 pages . I 'm going to keep reading each book in the series because this first book just left me wanting more !	1
Among the Living is the first novella in the Psycop series , the beginning of everything , the starting point of an amazing saga that compresses several genres , including erotic romance , sci-fi , thriller , paranormal and suspense . Wow . Not an easy task and so wonderfully done . Here we meet Victor Baynes & # 8220 ; Vic & # 8221 ; the half of a paranormal investigation unit otherwise known as a & # 8220 ; Spook Squad & # 8221 ; . He is able to talk to dead people and even see them sometimes which is particularly useful as he investigates homicides . He & # 8217 ; s a quirky character . Besides and because of his PRN habilities , Vic is quite neurotic and snarky , addicted to pharmaceuticals that allows him to escape the haunted ones when he & # 8217 ; s overwhelmed , and not very successful in the dating department . Also , he has not sense of style whatsoever and is forever soiling his clothes and buying replacements in cheap stores . Not a clotheshorse our boy . But oh so lovable.At his non psychic partner & # 8217 ; s retirement party and while under the influence of one too many pills , he meets another & # 8220 ; stiff & # 8221 ; , Jacob Marks and they engage in a little tryst in a bathroom . Jacob is his opposite , non psychic , super hottie , very built and dressed to the tenths . Shortly after , Vic is called to a crime scene where he & # 8217 ; s nonplussed he can & # 8217 ; t catch any & # 8220 ; vibes & # 8221 ; from the victim . From then on we get to know other important people in the Psycop & # 8217 ; s universe , like Gutierrez , who was supposed to be his new partner and also Jacob & # 8217 ; s spook partner . All of them come together , one way or another in the investigation of an apparent serial killer preying on gay men.The book is written from Vic & # 8217 ; s POV in a very straightforward prose , no & # 8220 ; purplerism & # 8221 ; , no overuse of adjectives/adverbs . There are not & # 8220 ; astonishingly aquamarine orbs & # 8221 ; in Ms. Castillo Price writing . Thanks all the Gods and Goddesses in Valhalla for that . The focus is both in the characters and the plot , which is extremely original , innovative , humorous , uber sexy and absolutely captivating . The suspense is tightly wowen and the story is fast paced.It took me about two years to start reading JCP & # 8217 ; s books in spite of them being highly recommended all over . Sci-Fi was never my thing neither PRN so I was quite skeptic and couldn & # 8217 ; t be bother to try it . Finally , I gave up and read this one . Let me tell you , it was lurve at first page . Hi , I & # 8217 ; m a JPCholic and I don & # 8217 ; t want to be cured . Ever . I & # 8217 ; ve read almost everything she has published and of course I started with this cool , awesome series.Up to now , there are seven books ( the first three are novella length ) and several more free short stories than you can download for free , including one of Vic & Jacob before they actually met each other . This fantastic , amazing universe starts here and slowly grows and develops . Book after book we get to know more about them , their backround , their life stories as we witness the development of V & J ; & # 8216 ; s romance while they fight their way solving the most befuddling and weird of cases . And it only gets better.Jordan Castillo Price is in my not so humble opinion , the Queen and Supreme Goddess of m/m suspense romance , up there in the fiction authors & # 8217 ; Olympus . Her books are a must for any smart reader who appreciates gay fiction but not exclusively . It & # 8217 ; s just great fiction , among the best at the risk of sounding hyperbolic.If you wonder why I gave 4 starts instead of 5 , just only because this is the first one in a long series , a little taste of what it & # 8217 ; s to come . Psycop is a 5+ read . Say no more .	1
Vic Bayne is a PsyCop . A Level 5 medium , he can easily hear the dead , and often see them . Psychics are now licensed , and some have gone through training to join police departments where they 're teamed up with a non-psychic to solve crimes . Vic 's partner ( Maurice ) for the last 12 years has just retired , his new partner and friend , Lisa , was discovered to have psychic talents she never reported and was subsequently put on suspension , fellow cop Jacob Marks initiated a romantic relationship with Vic , and a string of perplexing murders is beginning to unfold . It 's no wonder Vic downs anti-psychic drugs like they were tic-tacs . With all of this going on , he really does n't need to hear the dead incessantly babbling to him about how they died.The story is told from first-person perspective and maintains a comfortable conversational tone . Vic is a fairly complex character filled with flaws . He abuses the drugs that deaden his ability ( the fact they give a good buzz is icing on his cake ) , he 's rather jaded ( seeing dead people all the time will do that to you ) and pessimistic , but surprisingly flexible and accepting . Small changes are evident in Vic through the course of the story as he grows romantically involved with Jacob ( there are a few detailed and erotic scenes in the book , but they 're not excessive in quantity ) . Most good novels have the characters go through a change within the pages . In serial novels ( there 's a series of PsyCop stories ) , these changes are slower since there will be many more stories following . It 's subtle , but noticeable , that Vic is moved by his relationship with Jacob , and there 's an impression that this is one of the first times Vic is opening himself up to committing to someone else . Vic is examined deeply in the book , but secondary characters are also given care and come off as unique individuals . While the motivation of some individuals is n't apparent in this book ( like why Jacob aggressively flirts with Vic ) , it 's only the first book in the series . Questions raised in this book are answered later in the series , which adds a great deal of depth to the characters and stories . After all , in real life , we do n't always know people 's motivations until later.This story is VERY enjoyable . It goes a bit beyond mere psychic abilities and enters into much deeper supernatural realms , covering the possibilities of evil entities and other creatures of the night . A serial killer has killed twice , but left no marks on the victims other than a placing a broken piece of mirror underneath the victims ' eyelids . To make matters worse , eyewitness descriptions of the person accompanying the victim all vary , as if it were a different person each time.The ending is incredibly touching even when you see it coming . All in all , it 's a very interesting and entertaining sexy thriller that is easily enjoyed .	1
Just a fantastic story with characters that are unforgettable and very relatable ( despite the fact that I have nothing , but nothing , in common with their stories ) . I have read the entire series as it is published thus far and would encourage anyone to read them all .	1
Same as with the 1st book in this series , i could n't put it down . I found it just as intriguing , and i really enjoy getting to know better the main characters . Vic is going thru some tough times in this book , his relationship with Jacob deepens , and we learn more about the psychic stuff.Check the author 's website for cool extras ! On to book 3 ... : - )	1
This second book in the series brings back Victor , the Psycop , who is also adjusting to a new PsyCop partner , a mild-mannered guy named Roger.Also back is Victors boyfriend Jacob and Crash , Jacob 's ex-boyfriend and empathic healer . Crash is a small but important character , both annoying and funny . As usual Jordans writing keeps the plot moving and you ca n't be sure who the good ( or bad ) guys will turn out to be . Jordan has written another winner with the continuing budding romance between Vic & Jacob , more psychic mysteries , and the paranormal .	1
Our favorite gay medium , Vic Bayne , returns in the 2nd installment of the Psycop series . Unwilling to go back to his apartment where the incubus almost killed him and was turned into a mass of protoplasm ( `` Among the Living '' , the first novel ) , Jacob has moved in with Vic and both are testing the waters of cohabitation . In each character 's mind , they realize this may or may not be temporary as neither has broached the subject of actually living together . Vic 's friend Lisa is now in training at PsyTrain , and he has been assigned a new partner , Roger Burke , a rather affable eager-to-please who accepts Vic and his sexuality all in stride . This all seems well enough , and things should be going well for Vic , except that his psychic ability has gone into hyperactive mode . The dead are now clearly visible everywhere , and they seek him out when he 's around . Constantly reaching for him , he can actually physically feel them and starts to lose control and break down.It 's a very enjoyable story . Vic is a wonderfully complex character , and his sarcastic wit gives the story a lighter edge when needed . As with any good story , Vic undergoes some growth , which adds to the empathy one can feel for him . Too many serial stories do n't let their characters grow , trying to keep them the same as they were in the first book , so it 's pleasant when you can see and chart the growth Vic is gradually going through . Other characters are n't quite as fleshed out as Vic is , but they 're still interesting and enjoyable . The story stumbles a little at times by stretching plausibility ( like the introduction of a device that lets Vic tune in or tune out spirits , which raises more questions as to the nature of the spirits than it answers ) , but overall , it 's an immensely interesting and enjoyable novel .	1
When I finished this book I went back and read the first one again so I could read this again . I always want to know more about Vic and Jacob . I like the paranormal twist and the mystery . I love a book where I do n't see the ending coming .	1
I love this book that I have read it a third time would like to see if a second book is coming out	1
This book was a really great read . I was truly impressed ! I have paid a lot more for books that were n't even half as good as this book . Thoroughly enjoyed this book , must read !	1
I do n't know why but all the books I 've been reading from you have been missing epilogues and they really need them . It finishes the book for the fans . Congrats anyway . Gina	1
Awesome ! The book captured my attention at the beginning and held it completely . I got lost in the storyline of the Prince brother and fianc & eacute ; e. Especially after she was in the palace . Jalla just seem to appear out of nowhere helping her with the wedding . But overall the book was great . I will buy others from this author .	1
I enjoyed it . I love light reads and love stories and a little added adventure made it fun . Nice writing style .	1
**4.5 fantastic stars ! **I ca n't help myself , I just adore this series.I find it a perfect mix of funny , sexy , and quirky . I think Vic is adorable ( and if he looks like the guy on the cover of `` Criss Cross '' - DAYM ) and his relationship with Jacob is just yummy . I 'm just gushing and not saying anything specific about this book so here I go ... I think `` Body and Soul '' embodies what I have come to expect from this series . There is some romance ( never gushy ) , a mystery to solve , and some interesting paranormal action . What I love about this book is that it is lighthearted and fun , even amidst all of Vic 's emotional baggage . There are n't silly misunderstandings and other garbage in his relationship with Jacob , and I was happy to see their relationship moving forward . And the way Jacob talks in bad ... HOT.Moving up Jordan Castillo Price to auto-buy status !	1
I really liked this PsyCop story . Victor Bayne is one of my all time favorite characters . He is neurotic and courageous at the same time . My only complaint about this series is that there are not enough stories . I have found that anything written by Jordan Castillo-Price are worth reading . I do wish she would do audio books ,	1
All of Connie Shelton 's books are wonderful . Real page turners . I 've read them all . Once again , Charlie Parker has solved the mystery and in a way that is professional and down to earth .	1
I LOVE THE WAY THE CHARACTERS ARE DEVELOPED AND I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE IS MORE THAN ONE MYSTERY IN MOST OF THESE BOOKS..	1
I was n't sure I was going g to enjoy this book from the description given . However , I really did like it .	1
Another great story by Elizabeth Lennox . It was sad how the guy just jumps to conclusions without asking or talking directly to the girl involved . Very Sad..	1
I really enjoyed the book , in fact once I started reading could not put the book down . I like all of her books	1
Here we go again . I ca n't say enough about Elizabeth 's books . I especially love her Sheik books and the adventure and romance . Once I start one of her books I ca n't put them down and ca n't wait to start another one .	1
I really enjoyed the book , in fact once I started reading could not put the book down at times you wanted to say to the sheik stop being so dense , but the ending was great .	1
I loved everything about this book . I especially loved Demitri . He was everything any woman could want in a man . He and Helen were the perfect couple . Please read this book or you will be missing out on something great . It 's been a very long time since I 've read a book this good .	1
This book was very enjoyable ! ! I could hardly put it down , it 's kinda like a Cinderella story but with more drama and very real day to day issues . Very romantic , elizabeth lennox does a terrific job in writing . I will definitely be re reading this book again and again . Ranked it 7 stars .	1
I loved this story their are a lot of surprises in the plot which makes you laugh at the end .	1
Very good reading , characters kept you on the edge , waiting for the shoe to drop ( so to speak ) . Elizabeth Lennox is a very good writer , books are well written , with interesting & charismatic characters . The way the lands/cities are described makes you realize you are there . Definitely a book to read over again-I recommend most of her books .	1
Part of me cringes at this very idea . I told it to shut up . Lennox delivers here what I 've come to depend on her for , fast fiction , well written , exquititely romantic .	1
Here again is another book by Elizabeth that I loved and ca n't wait to read more of her books . Her stories are always exciting and keep me wanting more .	1
Such a good story . It was passionate but clean . I wanted to turn the next page and want afraid of what was coming..Lol . Very easy to relate too .	1
I really enjoyed this book . Lots of twists and turns . So many , & # 34 ; I did n't see that coming & # 34 ; moments . It has a great Christian theme to it . Its about everyday people making their way through relationships , romance and faith issues . I look forward to the next book in the series so I can check up on my couples . Enjoy !	1
Once I started reading this book , I could not put it Down . It is definitely a recommended Christian fiction that will keep you turning pages .	1
This book was really good . I enjoyed it at best . The characters were based on a series of people as well as beliefs . This was definately a page turner . I just purchased book 2 . This is my first book by this author and wont be the last .	1
This was a great story . It just goes to show you that blood is thicker than mud and family should always come first .	1
This is a horror like no other I have read . I am used to the blood and guts ( and I love it ) but this book surrounds you in a mystery that makes you want to turn the page . I can only imagine the dark place the author had to go to in her mind to be able to write such a book , but I am so glad she did	1
This was my first Robert W. Walker book , and I must say that thank goodness I stumbled upon it ! Ever since I was a teenager I was always intrigued with the witch trials in Salem and this book had everything that I could have asked for . The characters were so very well written due to the tremendous attention to details by the author that I honestly could n't help but feel the joy , heartbreak , pain , frustration and fear that they were going through.I truly enjoyed this book ! Would I recommend this book , ABSOLUTELY YES ! ! ! ! Will I read more Robert W. Walker books , ABSOLUTELY YES ! ! ! !	1
I loved this book and this series keeps getting better and better . Moses and Johari had a seious uphil struggle and they managed to come back together never forgetting the love they once had for each other . The Ramsey Family is totally JACKED UP and I love it . Well done .	1
I absolutely loved Nile and Taurus 's story . He truly found love and the both really really deserved it . The families both have demons and demons but they got around it and happiness soon follow . I also loved the new romance of Niles best friend and Taurus 's friend	1
This is the story of Taurus Ramsey and Nile Becquois . It is an awesome story , I could not put it down . AlTonya Washington Is an amazing writer . The storyline just sucks you in . I wish I had a family like the Ramsey 's .	1
I really loved this book ! It kept me on the edge of my seat , deeply engrossed and completely in love with the charaters from the beginning till the end.I can not recommend this book enough.Enjoy !	1
A.M. Riley is probably one of the two authors who can write of Vampires and Cops , putting together two themes I 'm not overtly fond , and make me like the book as I would like the sweetest romance . Not only , she made me love a full angst novel with cheating man ( o apparently so ) , cops toying with BDSM , even a foursome ... it 's almost like she decides to pick up what a romance reader does n't like and gives you the tongue , `` see ? how I write them , you like it '' . And yes , I have to say that she is right . I read almost all she wrote and was never disappointed.Adam and Peter are not new to her readers , she wrote a short story , a quite twisted Christmas tale , in where newbie vampire Adam , former cop , was still trying to acclimate with his new life , and his old buddy friend , Peter , former and present lover , had to decide what was the best gift for a vampire who has everything . The main interesting aspect of that short story was the `` odd '' nature of Adam : not the vampire thing , that is no more odd in gay romance , but his apparently bad boy reputation . It was not clear if Adam was a bad or good cop , he could have been even a corrupted one . But since Peter , the perfect good cop , loved him , something good in Adam he should have seen , and the reader had to trust Peter 's judgment.Anyway this is a prequel , the story of how Adam became a vampire . He is quite the lonely hero in it , Peter is more the good wife waiting at home , they do n't have many scenes together , and when they have , they are almost always in bed ( or even on the rug in front of the door ) . That this the strange thing of Adam : he knows that he is not at the same level with Peter , he was not at the Academy nor at work , but Adam seems to believe that Peter is his own property , that he will always be there for him . No matter that he has sex with a man on the way to meet Peter ( first scene together ) , and continuously with two other men for all the rest of the book : that is something different , something he does almost in auto-pilot ; with Peter instead is an act of bonding , and for this reason , everytime Adam feels at risk his exclusivity with Peter and on Peter 's body , he claims him all over again , with sex that can be without problem compared to a club on the head of a caveman who claims his woman.It 's strange , but Adam 's change in nature does n't change anything in his relationship with Peter : all of above it was happening before Adam 's death , and it 's happening even now , with Adam as undead . Actually , Adam being a vampire does n't enter in their routine , not even during sex : true , Adam 's senses are higher , and he can desire something , but his particularly bond with Peter was strange even before . Adam was always the one in danger , and Peter was always the one who rescued him . For this reason , even if this is a paranormal romance , the love story between Adam and Peter has instead the feeling of a quite ordinary romance : two men , both cops , with different expectations in life who arrive to compromise to be together ; maybe the one who renounces to more things is Peter , but he is clever enough to know that he will be never happy without Adam , so it 's better something than nothing . Another thing I loved was how they were both sure , in their way , of their feelings : Adam was commitment 's shy , but when Peter gives him a token of his love , he accepts that like a natural , like it is something of less importance ; but I know that in his mind , he has scanned all the implications , and he has decided to accept it to not hurt Peter , since hurting Peter is the last thing he wants ... in his way Adam loves Peter , as much if not more than how much Peter loves Adam.I think this is a novel that could appeal to the paranormal romance readers , for the intake in the vampire world , a mix of old legends and `` new '' technology , but also to who usually is reluctant to read a vampire novel , since , as I said , the vampire nature of the characters is important but it 's not all the meaning of the book .	1
I stumbled across this book and thought I would give it a try . I 'm glad I did . Some parts kind of dragged on but I 'm glad I stuck with it . It was nice to see Adam changing his ways throughout the book . You knew he was really in love with Peter and could tell when he started realizing it in the story . Though he never says it , you just know . Anyway , great book . I enjoyed it . Now onto No Rest for the Wicked .	1
A.M. Riley takes the somewhat tired vampire legend and turns it on its head with this cunning , scary , and fast-paced tale . She infuses vampire lore with ( you should pardon the pun ) new blood , combining urban street gangs , homo eroticism , and a rich sense of character and place . Riley knows how to make you care about her characters and carries you along on an almost breathless ride that brings refreshing new light to a genre one might wonder if there was anything new that could be said . Riley is a writer to watch and I look forward to her next literary outing .	1
Immortality is the Suck by A.M. Riley was a seriously cool read . I did not pick it up initially as I was feeling a little over the whole vamp genre , but I really like the author so eventually gave in and brought it . Despite there being a very obvious romantic relationship between Adam and Peter , most of the book is seen through Adam 's POV and is about him dealing with waking up a bit dead and wanting to snack on people . I liked that Adam is a total mess and needs a boot in his behind , but it 's his underlying goodness that peeked through every now and then that kept me totally wrapped up in this book . Loads of drama and fast paced action that does not miss a beat . That and some seriously awesome smex .	1
These books have a great story line . Definitely something different and interesting . I like the characters and the pictures of small town living ... everyone knows all your business !	1
This was a good read , just kept getting into a tighter not because people would not talk , Everyone put their own impressions on what each person was doing or thinking . Everyone had a grudge against someone and made another person the target of the punishment . It was an emotional read , I had fear , anger , laughter , and just disappointment along with wishing they would just talk to one another.Things would have been easier for everyone . It Ends great and the struggles show us that we all have things we keep hidden . I think this is a good emotional relief book makes you feel better about what ever is going on in your life could be worse . Good read .	1
I do n't know what the other reviewers are complaining about ? I think you must have to read the series to understand this book more easily but since I have read them all I loved it .	1
Rita Hestand wrote a great series , each book was enjoyable to read.. would love to ready more from her . thanks	1
I downloaded the book because we are planning an Alaskan trip starting in Fairbanks . In addition to the flavor of the area , this book has many laughs , a load of sex , lots of relationships , and an entertaining plot .	1
Great read with humor , sex and mystery . Loved Abbey , the main character with her clairvoyant ways and Italian rules to live by . Lots of fun .	1
I enjoyed reading this cute novel . I know some of the places mentioned in the book and people who could be the a few of the characters in the book . I would recommend this for a light , entertaining read .	1
Declan Mayo is an eighteen year old man at a low point in his life . He is homeless , hungry , broke and scared . He 's desperate and this leads him to a decision he never thought he 'd have to make , to become a rent boy at the local all-male brothel , the Chicken Ranch . Killian Hamilton is a 30 year old accountant . He is good looking and successful at his profession but social awkwardness keeps him lonely . He avoids dating so a drive out to the rural brothel that he just heard about seems like an easy way to satisfy his sexual needs . His visit happens to occur on Declan 's first night of work and he is the one who takes Dec 's virginity , although Killian does n't know this at the time . This was a one-time occurrence . Months pass and Declan becomes good at his job but he never means to make this a career . He begins taking a few courses at the local community college . Miller returns to his lonely existence . Then the two happen to run into each other at a grocery store and they decide to meet outside the ranch in hopes of fostering a friendship that both need in their lives . An attraction is there and soon they are dating . Declan works hard to pull his life together and build a future away from prostitution . Killian steadfastly stands by his man being patient , understanding and loving -- - all difficult to do in the face of his reality . I do find it a little hard to believe how little an impact on his life is the fact that Declan is a male prostitute . I mean of course it affected his relationship with Killian . Killian , who had little self-confidence to be begin with , struggled with the fact that Declan was constantly having sex with men who might be better than him in any and all departments . Jealousy is a real bitch to tame ! But outside of this personal relationship , Declan went to work , went to school , went on with his life with no apparent repercussions from his type of employment . It just seems a little bizarre to me . Still , this is a fast , interesting read with flawed but oh-so-likeable characters who get their happy ending in a believable way . That 's not an easy thing to say when discussing a male prostitute working at a place called the Chicken Ranch ! Considering where Declan was in his life at the beginning of the story , the end is that much sweeter . This is a good book and I can not wait to read the next installment in this new series ! Roux 's 4 sweet pea review appears mrsconditreadsbooks.com/index.php/ ? p=12151	1
Declan Mayo is the newest rent boy at The Chicken Ranch . Although nervous and inexperienced , Declan is desperate for money . Killian Hamilton is quiet and keeps to himself . Loneliness sends him to The Chicken Ranch looking for temporary company . Declan and Killian 's time together at The Ranch is explosive . A few months later , a chance meeting reunites Killian and Declan and they decide to take the next step . Will Declan 's career get in the way of what could be the best thing that ever happened to him ? I really like the dynamics between Declan and Killian in Hunger . They are genuinely sweet guys and they take their relationship slow . Because of their unconventional meeting , it seems impossible that they could have a relationship , but it works . It was hard for me to accept that Declan is a prostitute , and that he continues to ` work ' while he and Killian are dating , but Killian is surprisingly okay with it . Killian 's nervous stuttering is endearing and Declan 's painful past is sad , Overall , Hunger is a good story starring two charming men.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

I have read about 90 or so golden oldies . They age so cheap on the kindle . .99 cents for 25 novels . It is cheaper than going to the library and besides the library would not have these classics .	1
As previous reviews have commented - you do n't have to be baseball fan or know the history behind it to appreciate this book . I love the combination of history with science fiction . The history is well researched and you get a real flavour of the baseball scene of the time .	1
I recently read Turning Back the Clock . I was attracted to this book as a history buff who loves historical fiction . I had some concerns since I 'm not much of a baseball fan , but I very quickly realized that I did n't have to be . This story pulled me in from page 1 and kept drawing me in until the very last page . I was also able to learn about a few events in the history of major league baseball that I was totally unaware of . From a different angle , who has n't dreamed of going back in time to meet your favorite sports or historical figure ? This is a great mix of science fiction , history , and of course America 's favorite past-time . Well done , John Fitch V ! Thank you for a great read .	1
`` Bound by Deception '' and the sequel `` Bound to him , '' are so good and so hot due to the BDSM . Both novellas compliment the story between Oliver and Vincent who are both unforgetable characters . The first book leaves you wanting more and so the sequel helps in giving the reader and overall satisfactory read . I cant put into words how much i loved thier entire story and seeing them develop . Very well written and as i said before extremely HOT ! I was also pleasantly surprised that Oliver decided to do something with his life , which had been my one of my minor complains from one of her characters in her other book `` Convincing Arthur . `` And i read that a 3rd and final bound book is out in March ( `` Bound Forever '' ) and I cant wait to read it.Overall , this is one arthur who 's books I will keep reading .	1
This book is the sequel toBound by Deception , a book I loved very much . We meet Vincent and Oliver six months after the end of the previous book.Oliver has been loving Vincent for years and he finally has him , but he 's not satisfied with their relationship . He wants something more than sex , he wants his love to be acknowledged by Vincent , he wants Vincent to reciprocate his feelings . He therefore stands up against Vincent and voices his emotion . It 's something I would have never expected from Oliver or at least not from the Oliver of the previous book.Vincent is clearly surprised by Oliver and he has to face his own feelings . In this book , Vincent is not as cold as he was before , we get a better insight of his soul . There 's an interesting parallel between Oliver 's desire to please Vincent and Vincent 's desire to please his father . Vincent 's aloofness pushes Oliver away , Oliver that would do anything to please him . Vincent would do anything to please his father and he 's constantly refused , his father intends to use him and discard him , with no recognition of his feelings.The strain in their relationship is an incentive for both to take their fate in their hands and face their responsibilities , but while the emotional but poor Oliver has to abandon his lazyness to make a more decent living , the rich but cold Vincent has to embrace his passion to become a better man.It 's a great book , maybe it 's just too short . I really liked the ending , it seemed very honest .	1
For the past six months Lord Vincent Prescot 's life has been exactly where he wanted it . He had prestige , wealth , respect , and lived the high life of the London society . Most important , he had the devotion of Lord Oliver Marsden , his best friend and lover whose sexually submission to Vincent leaves him craving for more.Oliver has loved Vincent for years , and through a bold move he was finally able show Vincent just how much . Six months later , Oliver wants more from Vincent . Sexually things are perfect between them , but emotionally Vincent treats Oliver as his dirty little secret . Oliver 's belief that Vincent does care for him , but is afraid to show it , is what keeps him waiting for Vincent to come around . However , when Vincent announces he plans to marry , Oliver knows he has to find the strength to move on.When faced with losing Oliver , will Vincent finally tell him how much he truly means to him ? Bound to Him is a fantastic follow-up to Bound by Deception . It was the morning after and then some that I was hoping for after reading the prequel . Oliver was such a sweet guy in the prequel , and it was Oliver again who made me love Bound to Him . I was n't too crazy about Vincent in this book . He came across a lot more self absorbed and very oblivious to Oliver 's feelings , but every now and then glimpses of the man Oliver loved did shine through . There was quite a bit of angst in this follow-up and I loved it . Readers who enjoyed Bound by Deceptions will also enjoy Bound to Him.LeyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

The world as humans knew it was no more . An unknown virus took most of the population before anyone realized there was a problem . Of those left , some were carriers who survived , genetically altered and the rest were immune . The immune who lived try to eke out some semblance of a normal existence where the strong protect the weak - where the weak exist as pets to their masters.Forced to live with a cruel stepfather in order to survive , Jiri can still remember days long gone when the world was sane , his mother alive , and caring whether or not he lived or died.Jiri 's world changes once again when he is sold to pay off a debt to Zane , leader of the Death Dealers . One glance and Zane knows that he wants the blonde innocent as his personal pet . Problems arise immediately since neither Zane nor Jiri know exactly what they 're doing together . Communication is the key to working things out before too many mistakes can never be forgiven or forgotten and someone better get talking soon.Author Stormy Glenn pens another unique and sensual tale in The Master 's Pet . Honorable , sweet Jiri is an enigma in this new corrupted world . Zane on the other hand has to be strong , only someone willing to kill can be the leader of the Death Dealers . Although Zane does kill , he never really comes across as having a murderous personality . The Master 's Pet is strong on characterization , yet the plot only skims the surface of this new , dangerous world . I would have loved more detail about this altered Earth too . All in all , The Master 's Pet has some hot sex and a fascinating character driven story with two engaging men.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

This book is a must have for anyone who is considering doing business with the government .

I have to say that this book came to my attention by sheer luck , but I am really glad that it did . With deft skill and an aim to provide solid information and advice , Ed Benjamin puts focus on the Obama spending plan and just how to cash in on this lucrative opportunity . The author provides a solid base of informative on the plan , it 's benefits to the public ( from individuals to businesses ) and then proceeds to outline the ways in which to get government contracts with an eye for detail and an easy to understand action plan.This is a smart , practical and highly informative guide that makes it possible to not only bulk up your business ' profit margins , but to also make smart choices that can improve the longevity of your business and life goals . Mr. Benjamin really goes the distance in ensuring that the reader learns all they need to know about how to get ahead with the help of the Obama spending plan . This was well worth the read and left me with a wealth of knowledge about how to & # 34 ; cash in & # 34 ; on this lucrative opportunity .	1
1 . Like it or not , our government is the biggest employer and biggest & # 34 ; company & # 34 ; in the world ! 2 . Government red tape is a time honored horror to the uninitiated.3 . Economic times are tough and getting tougher.You and I ca n't change those points but we can adapt and do the smart thing to make them work for us rather than against us.This book takes the fear out of the govt regs and massive departments with a clear concise language and understanding that comes from a person who has very successfully & # 34 ; been there and done that & # 34 ; .As explained and shown in this book the steps are not daunting , nor is success . But , you do have to follow the steps in all the right sequences and do your due diligence . That is where this book should be your ally , keep it in arms reach as you develop your proposals and it will serve you well as a easy to follow guide through the previously scary and often seemingly unfriendly bureaucracy .	1
Some of the book was a little much storyline wise . It 's definitely a steamy read which was its main appeal . I prefer steamy and believable and some was just too mushy for me but overall good quick read .	1
i like the fact the main character was bisexual and not full on gay ... cause i dont care for woman turning a gay man out plot . the one thing that i did n't care for was how one minute he was dead set on not having a menage with her and another man but yet the next minute he had no problem doing it with an unknown guy . i think there was enough scenes in the book to make you believe those two as a couple	1
Playing with fire ... .if Austin is the fire ... let me burn ! Such a hottie ! I loved that he was described as wearing eyeliner and jewelry..it 's not your `` normal '' hottie . When I was younger , I loved guys in eyeliner ... so it made it fun to read.The book was a very sexy hot read . Needed a tall cold glass of water with this one . If you like a sexy eyeliner wearing guy , some crazy kinky sex club fun , a little m/m action go one click this book now ! You wo n't regret it ! ! Go ... enjoy !	1
I loved this story , in a way it reminded me of heidi , ok you can laugh but I will explain . In Heidi , the uncle was so determined to have his only precious daughter walk again , that he did everything he could to make that become a reality and with Heidi 's help , his daughter did find the strength to walk again . In No Matter What , same thing , a father 's love , compassion , determination to have his only daughter walk again . I loved No Matter What because although this father wanted everything to go back to what he perceived to be normal again , something was missing out of his life , to love someone and have someone love him , so as much as he tried to be this person who takes care of everyone , it is he that needed someone to take care of him and show him love . Enter feisty Dr. Jaden Monroe to rock Adam Steele 's world and change it forever ! Their connection was fire from the very beginning , and it only took a match to ignite it between them . It 's a short chapter book where the author completes it but as a reader , I def wanted to read more .	1
Another entertaining read by a wonderful author . Erin Nicholas has a talent for roping her audience in and getting attached to the characters . Another excellent read ... you wo n't be sorry !	1
I love this series , but I ca n't say I really `` enjoyed '' this story . However , it is absolutely the finest portrayal of the dense male I 've read in a long time . This guy does n't get the concept of `` Actions speak louder than words , '' or that maybe if your mate and all of your loyal friends tell you you 're making a few mistakes you should listen to them . But nope , not our hero . He just does n't comprehend why everyone does n't just accept how absolutely right he is about everything . For someone chosen to be a member of an elite shifter version of Special Forces , this lack of judgment seems like a major liability.I did enjoy rolling my eyes at this guy 's stupidity , as well as the appearances of the characters from previous books . On the down side , his `` little friend '' in this book ( who pretty much derails his relationship , ) also figures into the new series , Halle Shifters . I cringe to think that she will be an important character there , as she is selfish , immature and not at all likable . Unfortunately , she was given a `` special connection '' to a really great secondary character . What 's with her and these `` special connections '' to the male characters ? Maybe we 'll get lucky and she 'll mature some . Otherwise , I doubt the new series will be as enjoyable as the previous books . I do highly recommend Bear Necessities , ( the first book in the new series , ) and luckily she 's unconscious throughout most of it !	1
Well the final book of the series did n't disappoint . Although the laughter was less obvious , it was still present.Proving she need n't rely on just one element of her many skills.Thank you , Ms Bell , for bringing fun , back into an old lady 's reading time . I will thank my daughter , too , for being willing to try new authors , and share the good ones with me . Enjoy this series as much as I did , and remain willing to read the new and unexpected . Bye Jonnie .	1
EXCELLENT STORY LINE AND CHARACTERS , YOU CA N'T HELP BUT LOVE THEM ALL.PLEASE KEEP WRITING THEM , I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE .	1
Only In My Dreams is the fifth book in Dana Marie Bell 's Halle Puma series . Though this is the first book in the series that I 've read , I was able to follow most of the characters and relationships without too much difficulty , with the few secondary plot situations that remained a mystery to me detracting very little from Gabe and Sarah 's story.Ms . Bell does an excellent job of building sexual tension . I was enraptured by Gabe , who is clearly the dominate in his erotic dreams with Sarah . But Sarah manages to hold her own . Her submissiveness to him has its limits , even in his dreams , which surprises but does n't disappoint him . He is disappointed , however , by her continued mistrust in him , though he is sensitive enough to recognize he is the one mostly at fault.I really enjoyed Only In My Dreams and look forward to adding many of Ms. Bell 's books to my TBR pile . - Kathryn	1

I bought and read this on release at the end of last year , but have only just realised I never reviewed it . Not sure why , because it 's a cracking short novella , tightly paced and plotted , with the genuine creepiness and suspense that all good detective stories should have . Nothing can be taken on face value , especially when your new client - or rather client 's spokesperson - Granny Knot is consciously deceiving the general public with a show of craziness , hiding a sharp brain . That she claims to be acting on behalf of a dead man , is something Markhat has to prove for himself - along with every other story told to him in this yarn.Tuttle uses Mama Hog again to good effect , and Granny Knot is a great new character . Once again , the many minor characters are vivid , even if their roles are somewhat fleeting . The cast is rather less confusing than say , in the latest Markhat book , The Banshee 's Walk : A Markhat Novel , and the editing is much better than in the later book . I had no complaints at all about the writing , which is uniformly excellent.I guess my lack of enthusiasm came entirely from the total omission of Darla , who was central toHold The Dark : A Markhat story , and when we left Markhat at the end of that book , it was very clear that Darla was to take a prominent part in his life from that point onwards . It was thus a shock to read this book and find she 's not even mentioned , let alone a participant in the story . It 's as if Darla never existed at all , and I 'm not at all fond of stories which erase important female characters , especially ones I 'm damn fond of.I do n't know know whether Tuttle planned and wrote this story before Hold the Dark , but some brief explanation , some nod to Markhat 's girlfriend 's existence , was all that was needed for the reader to be comfortable here , and not to feel that our emotional investment in Darla - which the author had been at pains to create - was being discarded so Markhat could live as a curmudgeonly old bachelor once more.This is the only flaw in an otherwise very enjoyable story , and the only thing that stops me giving it top marks . As Darla reappears in the follow up book , on re-reading `` The Cadaver Client '' , I was inclined to feel more kindly towards it . But on first reading , I felt horribly cheated , and it 's that initial reaction which makes this one drop a few points for me . If you love the Markhat stories , you 'll enjoy this one , but if you do n't read it , you wo n't lose any continuity with the latest novel . The Cadaver Client sits in its own leg of the Trousers of Time ( as Terry Pratchett would call it ) and while not essential to the Markhat canon , is well worth the effort . An amuse bouche , perhaps , rather than a proper main course .	1
Frank Tuttle is one of those authors I turn to when I need a book I can count on . The twists and turns of his plots always delight and The Cadaver Client was no exception . Even the title intrigued me . With a title like that , you know this is not going to be an ordinary walk down pulp fiction lane.Even though The Cadaver Client is labeled book four in some places , Frank Tuttle 's author page advises starting with it . I 'd already read `` Dead Man 's Rain '' ( a short novel ) and enjoyed it , so even though I was reading out of order , I happily forged ahead.Good stuff , five star all the way . Tuttle builds atmosphere , plot and characters in layers -- you do n't know what will be in the middle : a gotcha , humor or a twist . Markhat , the detective , needs work like any PI , but he tends to get his cases from Mama Hog ; a witch down the way . This is n't always the healthiest place to pick up jobs.The Markhat books are pulp fiction with a lot of humor , a touch of noir and a lot of adventure . The pacing is quick . The setting is somewhere between medieval and urban fantasy ; it 's a world not that far from our own with magic and not a lot of modern . The Cadaver Client starts out as a sad tale ; a ghost wanting to leave his wife some money , money he never bothered to give her while alive . So why not when he was alive ? Well , Markhat has a devil of a time figuring it out -- he gets beaten up , chased and even ends up in a casket over this one . He has the ever-strange Mama-Hog to help get him into trouble and a woman who speaks to the dead to make matters even more complicated.It 's a fun ride ; a great afternoon read . Highly recommended for fantasy or urban fantasy readers . If you like ghost stories , spooks and odd characters , you 'll love Markhat and his friends .	1
Warning : This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating : 9/10PROS : - The more I read , the more I liked the tone of the narration . James is honest and intelligent , and there 's something rather charming about his resigned attitude toward life . Lanyon also captures the obsession of a scholar very well : when James starts looking at an antique book or manuscript , he completely loses touch with the outside world.- Sedgwick intrigued me almost immediately . He 's so frigid and remote at the beginning that I at once began anticipating seeing his cold demeanor melt away when he fell in love.- Some of the things that happen in the story are so unusual and so unexpected that I found them uproariously funny . And the characters ' reactions are priceless . James says this at one point : `` I wondered if I 'd gotten in a car accident on my way to the Hotel Del Monte and was , in fact , happily hallucinating in a coma somewhere . `` - I thought the little details here and there about Charles Dickens and antique books and such were really interesting . They seem well researched , and there are n't so many details that the story seems overloaded or bogged down by them.CON : - Okay , so the romance maybe developed a little quickly for me to find it utterly believable . But it was so sweet and lighthearted and fun , I did n't really care.Overall comments : This is a pleasant little read : not very long , but certainly worth a couple hours ' worth of time . There 's some intrigue , some sex , some light angst , and a healthy dose of heartwarming romance . What 's not to like ?	1
I downloaded this book in early December because it was a free Christmas Novella and I was just to busy to read it till yesterday . I read it in one afternoon and it was fantastic . I loved the storyline , it was festive , witty and at times very funny . I particularly enjoyed Sedgwick Crisparkle 's character but the relationship between him and James was well written , smooth and erotic . This is my first gay romance and to be perfectly honest I was unsure if I would like it . Josh Lanyon is a very good writer , he had me captured in the first chapter and I did not want to stop reading until I was done . It was a sweet love story and I will be reading lots more of his books .	1
The book involved , along with the book you read , are both priceless.Of course , 'The Dickens ' is n't real , but it 's believable.The love story between the two main characters , is well developed.You are taken through so many emotions to the climax at the endthat was , no doubt , inevitiable , considering the story.This was the first book that I have read by this author but itmost certainly wo n't be the last ! And the title , is a little gift all it 's own and is brilliant ! I really ca n't say enough good things about this book.Get it ! Read it ! Tell your friends about it !	1
I really liked the MC narrator James . He was a man who had made mistakes - and continued to make them - but was fairly self aware . I have loved Dickens since high school , so the story about the & # 34 ; missing & # 34 ; Christmas story was fascinating and Josh Lanyon did a wonderful job of weaving portions/excerpts from that ( fictitious ) book into his own . I never realized what a market there is for rare books . As usual , Lanyon 's writing is flawless . I always enjoy his style . James ' neighbor was an endearing ( although sometimes annoying character ) and watching James take to her , despite himself , was a sweet touch . And the glow-in-the-dark , flavored condoms were awesome . I do wish the story had n't ended so abruptly ; I did not have enough interaction between James and Sedgewick to fully believe in their love/HEA .	1
I really enjoyed this book . It was an easy read yet engrossing in nature . The characters were believeable and kept my attention . If it were n't for the abrupt and unconvincing ending , I would have rated this 5 stars	1
Here I am again , reviewing another of Lanyon 's novella-length stories and once again , I ca n't express strongly enough my appreciation for his technical skill , his intelligence and wit with a plot and characters , and his ability to draw me into the world with strong , believable happenstance . And in The Dickens With Love , Lanyon shines especially bright for adding a surprising amount of depth and backstory to the lead character , James Winter . Novella 's are often hampered by their very nature , but in this , Lanyon rose above those limitations to provide an exceptionally well rounded character . His romantic lead , a Mr. Sedgwick Crisparkle , was perhaps NOT so fully defined and fleshed out , but was still superior to many two dimensional characters in novella-length stories.Add in a sweet holiday melancholy and yearnings for respectability once had and now lost and a measure of growth for James ' character , and this lovely tale just shines like one of those starburst or starlight drinks Sedge favors so much . Which sounded delicious by the way ... if a bit monsterously strong . The `` excerpts '' from the `` Christmas Cake '' were charming little surprises that lent an air of reality to the story as well . As I 've said in a previous review of a novella-length Lanyon story , the only critique I truly have is that the romantic aspects of this m/m holiday romance do n't quite touch me on as deep an emotional level as I 'd hoped , but I still believe that 's more due to the limiting nature of the length of the story than any failure on Lanyon 's part . I admit ... I 'm cynical and do n't believe in love developing within days or hours , so when the story spans such a time , it 's hard for me to buy into a love-at-first-Dickens whirlwind romance.But top-notch storytelling , as always , for Lanyon .	1
I was hoping it was a longer story ... . ! Eden Bradley really reaches into the characters souls to bring out fears and wishes . Her males are sexy and strong . Terrific Irishman here ! Good read , Enjoy .	1

Character Witness is not part of the other 'Witness Series ' books by the same author , but just as engaging . The characters all come to life and the twists and turns to the storyline will keep you up late trying to figure it out.Buzzbar : You must have gotten an unedited early release on this , it appears to have been reposted without the errors . Try it again , you 'll enjoy it .	1
I have read almost all of Rebecca Forster books . I really like them all especially the Witness series with Josie Bates	1
Great characters and interesting plot . Enjoyed this book a lot . Would love to read more novels based on Kathleen character .	1
I expected that the story wouldnt be as wonderful as others in the genre but based on some of the other reviews i read i decided to buy the book . Though i wont say that it was a complete waste of my time or money , the book didnt live up to the hype , the author brought up problems in the book that she didnt solve and when when a problem came up between the main characters it would be resolved by them having sex and then wouldnt be discussed again .	1
This was my first with this author . I thoroughly enjoyed it.I have to say the concept of dragon , elves and djinn being at war is new to me . Theres usually a truce in place . That elves and djinn team up to eliminate dragon mates , in an attempt to wipe out the dragon race was refreshing to read . Story wise I mean.Scarlet is a pop star . She has been in hiding for 7 years.Janos is a dragon . He is also an elder.Scarlet is his mate . Janos must protect her till he can impregnate her . Once that is accomplished he can change her thus giving her a way to protect herself.The story was too short . Only 90 pages . Still a lot was told in such a short space . Looking forward to continuing the saga in the next book .	1
I got this app when it was free and I wish I 'd found it sooner . I check it 3 times a day and usually find one book each day that interests me . He has really saved me money an d time with this fantastic app .	1
I like receiving this daily blog . I 've tried several blogs , but this is the only one I 've kept over a few days . Why ? I like that he posts several free books every day ( at least he has n't missed a day since I 've been receiving it ) . And , he gives the Amazon description . He includes many types of books rather than sticking to one or two types . I will keep purchasing this blog because of the reliability of posting , the varied types of books featured , and the helpful Kindle info .	1

This was a fast and really fun read ; it put a silly smile on my face almost throughout the book.Mariah and Tucker are both very interesting and lovable characters and the sex scenes are smoking hot.The ending caught my interest about the wishes of Mariah & # 8217 ; s ' friends and how they will come true , so I will definitely be buying the next book in the series.A Girl & # 8217 ; s erotic fantasy turned into a & # 8221 ; happy ever after & # 8221 ; romance . Great read !	1
loved it ! another masterpiece by brynn . very sweet and sexy love story ... with whips and chains .	1
I have no idea why I enjoyed this book so much . It was filled with a lot of detail about a complicated world and half the time I had no idea what was going on . Also , the characters are `` deir '' not men , which is a very important distinction . Still lassen was just such a sweetie pie , it was filled with intrigue and good 1980s-1990s romance drama and tension and it was just great fun I did not want to put it it down even though right now it 's midnight and I 'm like wtf did I just read ? !	1
KZ Snow writes beautifully . So much so that more than 2 years later I still remember this story vividly . The almost dream like atmosphere , the setting , the homes by the lake , the woods when these two guys meet , her descriptions makes me wish I was there . The romance is almost suspenseful as the guys pasts intrude into their fragile relationship . And I like both guys especially Charlie who struggle the most . No I did not find the plot dull at all . Just great writing , which is rare in the genre .	1
Charlie bought a cottage on the lake and discovers Booker his next door neighbor . Although Charlie sort of has a boyfriend ( who admitted cheating on him ) he and Booker hook up . Seems Booker has some secrets , he was in prison for pot possession and some shrink got fixated on him and wo n't take a hint . Charlie offers to help Booker get evidence to get the guy to back off and they get to know each other better with Booker helping Charlie get over his water phobia . I really liked how the two guys interacted . It was n't a case of one of them being more dominant and leading the relationship or Charlie riding in to rescue Booker . The power kind of moved back and forth to who was in control which I liked . And both characters were amusing and it made me smile how they had to `` test '' the video equipment before they used it .	1
Love this series currently reading book 3 and i love this one . Give this series a try you wont be disappointed .	1

I always enjoy every book I read by Cheryl St. John this was no exception . I could n't put it down . I ca n't wait to read another one of Cheryl 's books .	1
This was a good read . The hero in the book was such a great man you ca n't help but fall in love with him within the first few chapters . There is also a lot that goes on with her family and the struggles and challenges they face being part of a large family running a business . This is a great sensual book that will keep you turning the pages until the end . I think readers who read the `` love inspired '' books and are not to offended by some light sex scenes will enjoy this book .	1
Emily and Stephen 's love story is just a mere glimpse of romance and passion in Michelle Willingham 's novella . I ca n't wait to read the continuing tale .	1
Great story . I could n't put it down . I can not wait to see what happens in the next book . A good love story .	1
The hero and heroine are n't that great , but the plot is excellent with a mystery to solve and a marriage to save . Emily is one of my least favorite character types - afraid of everything . Afraid to love her husband because he might break her heart again , afraid to attend any `` ton '' events because people will not accept her , etc ... And worse , instead of telling her husband about her fears , she resorts to manipulation to solve her problems . On the plus side , she has a good heart and ALWAYS has the best interests of her loved ones in mind . Lord Whitmore is another of my least favorite characters types - selfish . He does warm up and evolves into a good husband and father to Emily 's niece and nephew . And once he gets his priorities straight , he puts in the effort to be a mind reader to figure out what will make Emily happy.Overall the book was an enjoyable read because the plot is very interesting . The H/h are both flawed but balanced with other good qualities and as the story develops they become more likable . The writing is excellent and well edited . There are multiple explicit scenes which can be skipped if that 's an issue for you . I 'd recommend this book if you 're in the mood for a good mystery/romance .	1
Imagine waking up and not know your spouse , or how , or why you got a tattoo ! This is a captivating murder mystery and a love story between Emily and Stephen .	1
I have just read CLAIMED BY THE HIGLAND WARRIOR AND SEDUCED BY HER HIGHLAND WARRIOR.Ms . Willingham had three others in her `` Accidental '' series on sale , so I snapped them up.This one , THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS , did n't have the things that bothered me in the others . The repetition was minimal and there were issues outside of the couple instead of things that could have been fixed with one or two sentences.Which made THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS a very nice read.Stephen has been gone , with no word , for months . He set off to find Emily 's brother . Daniel has been returned to Emily , dead . As you can imagine , this has been very hard on Emily.Now Stephen is back , with no memory of marrying Emily and no clue where he 's been , beside the tattoo , in Chinese , on his neck . While on the on the one hand Emily wants to fling her arms around her husband , on the other she really wants to smack him hard , or poison his tea . She knows that he was at his mistresses home just before he disappeared . HOW she knows that was never explained.That happens a couple of times in this book . Something is mentioned , but not explained . Lots of red herrings that do n't go anywhere , and do n't really fit with the story.To top things off for him , she tells him that they are the guardians of her niece and nephew . He really does n't think that he signed on to be a father , much less a husband.Still , this was an enjoyable read . Who does n't like seeing a man holding a baby , right ?	1
This book was an endearing love story wrapped up in a mystery . The two plots intertwine and create a very interesting story overall of a woman trapped in a bad situation that inevitably risks her life and the life of her new husband . The ending was far from predictable , which is a rarity for me , but the book leaves you wanting more of the wonderful characters and their stories in the end . The story has a prequel and a companion novel that continue some of the same style . I highly recommend all three .	1
I love a bratty bottom , and I really love a swishy , bratty bottom . Seeing as how I really adored the first two books in this series and I 'm becoming a big fan of Lynn Lorenz , once I read the description of this third installment I could n't wait to read it . Within minutes of beginning , I was in love with Edward . & # 34 ; The idea of being on a farm gave him the heebie-jeebies . He was so not a Country Living kind of guy . More like Metropolitan Design . Sleek leather , minimalistic window treatments , grass-mat flooring . No livestock in the house . Not lace curtains , tacky , multicolored chintz , and those god-awful oval rugs from the fifties. & # 34 ; When I discovered that the Jack mentioned in the description was none other than the chief of police whom I met in book two , I was over the moon happy ! Edward Beauregard has been sent to Spring Lake by his mother to check on his grandmother and , even though he 's thirty-five , he dare not say no . At least , not if he values his trust fund , and he definitely does . His dear , departed father made the ruling that Edward can not inherit his trust fund until he 's forty . As if he would have stopped being gay before that ! Ridiculous ! The timing is excellent , though , since he just had another embarrassing and public breakup in Atlanta and it 's time to go somewhere to lick his wounds . So , Edward and his best friend , Winston , his bulldog , head to Spring Lake , Texas . All I 'm going to say about Edward 's first meeting with Jack , is that I laughed so hard I snorted.Chief of Police Jack Whittaker is n't having a good couple of weeks . He 's not been feeling well and the constant headaches and blurry vision are starting to worry him . Typical man , he does n't go to the doctor , he just keeps on keeping on . *eye roll* When he pulls Edward over for speeding and the guy gets out of his car to walk his dog even when Jack ordered him not to , Jack is flabbergasted . The fact that the dog and the man are wearing matching bandanas causes a moment of severe snickering . As I said , I ca n't tell you details about their first meeting but , needless to say , Jack ends up having to care for Winston for a few days . This does not go over well for anyone but Winston ! The next time that Edward and Jack meet & # 8230 ; well , Edward saves Jack 's life . I kind of ca n't tell you how , though , because it 's part of Edward 's powers and that would be a spoiler . Trust me when I say it 's very , very interesting . Jack , of course , does n't want to believe but since he saw it all firsthand he sort of has to . Jack has bigger problems , though . Edward is making him feel and it 's been a long time since Jack allowed anyone to affect him . Too terrified of giving up his control , Jack does n't let anyone close for fear of ending up back where he grew up , poor , white , trailer park trash . A place where Jack was ridiculed and made fun of and where Jack ran away from when he was sixteen . Jack has worked hard to make a good life for himself and he ca n't risk losing people 's respect for a fling with Edward.Surprisingly enough , at least to Edward , is how close he feels to his grandmother after just a few days . She 's always loved him but his father was the one who kept them apart and now Edward is finding peace at the old homestead where his grandparents lived until his grandpa died and grandma moved into town . Edward is finally feeling close to a member of his family and he 's loving it.When Jack finally gives in to his need for Edward , it is hot , hot , hot and I mean incendiary ! Unfortunately , all of Jack 's fears are still there and while Edward wants to be loved , Jack is n't sure he can handle what life would be like if he came out and was with Edward . It tore me up to watch Edward go through another rejection , and to watch Jack struggle so hard with his fears . To say there was some drama going on before the happy ever after is mild . There was pain , anger , sorrow , hope , joy , tears , and finally love . It was hard to watch these men go through what they did for love.I 've adored every book in this series , but , hands down , 'Edward Unconditionally ' is my favorite . Edward just resonated for me with his deep desire to be loved , to be wanted for more than his money or his body , and to be needed . He really tore at my heartstrings more than once . Jack did , too , though , with his insecurities and vulnerabilities from his childhood forcing him to be in control of everything , always . Read this story , read the whole series . You wo n't want to miss out on these books and the men in them . In fact , I 'm adding Edward and Jack to my favorite couples list . Thank you , Lynn , for giving me these guys to love !

Check out my review at Escape by Fiction - [ ... ] My rating : 4 of 5 starsI really liked it.Growing up , Bethany had been abused and raped by her psychotic step-father . She testified and had him put in jail after he tried to kill her . Afterwards , her mother blamed her for what happened and booted her out , as a teenager.Jacob , a Hugh Heifner type guys ( owns same kind of magazine , has mansion , has lots of young girls around him all the time ) , likes to help out young ladies whenever he sees one he knows needs it . He spies Beth working at a strip club and sees a lonely , desperate teenagers in need of dire help . Jacob invites Bethany to stay with him and his `` family '' hoping to be a positive father figure in her life.Jump ahead 5 years , I think , and Bethany has not only gone to college and been a model for the magazine , but works as a top photographer for it . Bethany has heard about what Derrick ( Jacob 's reluctant son ) and Nathan like to do with women in their spare time . Even though they 've flirted with her over the years , she always thought they were kidding - even though she hoped they weren't.Derrick and Nathan have been drooling over Beth for a long time now , and now they think she 's ready for what they have to offer her . Except when one of them gets 'extra ' close to her first , the jealousy bug starts to burrow it 's way into the situation . The guys argue , tension is high but Beth ca n't decide between the two of them - she loves them both.Meanwhile , Beth 's crazy step-father has been released form prison early and is out to get his revenge on her . He kills her mother , whom she is estranged from and plots an evil plan to show Bethany who she really belongs to and to take out the men he thinks has touched what belongs to him.Attempts are made on lives , there are parties abound and lots of hot lovin ' going on . The trio concoct a plan to trap the evil-stepfather and low and behold HEA.I liked this one quite a bit . I enjoyed the action/danger element a lot . Although there was a lot of hot , hot lovin ' going on - it was n't PWOP and I liked that . I liked the contrast between the men : Nathan was happy go lucky and tender while Derrick was serious and intense . I think if there had been tears , it totally would have been a 5 - as it is it 's a very high 4 .	1
This was a sweet little romance that kept me engaged - both in my mind and in my heart . I wish it was a bit more developed , but for the length , it 's was n't lacking anything major . The characters were all relatable and extremely likeable , and the plot was sweet and a little heart wrenching . It all culminated into a beautiful journey.This was my first Annmarie McKenna book , and I 'll definitely be checking out more .	1
This story will grip you and not let go ! You want to cheer the gargoyle on , and the next moment smash him with a mallet ! Yet and the same time the story makes you fall in love with him yourself !	1
Oh man this was so darn good ! I zipped right through it . This was fast paced and so dang sexy its not even funny . I cant wait to read the next one . Im hooked on this series .	1
This is a short story , but a complete story ( which is n't always true ) . There was enough history of the characters and society to make it all understandable . Would recommend .	1
Woohoo , just added another series to my library list . This is exactly the kind of books I like : dominant alpha male possessive over his mate . Tienan is a trained killer , but he feels a protectiveness towards Silence from the moment they meet . And of course , the meeting was perfect . Silence was tracking him to give information to the leader of the Resistance ( her adopted brother ) , but the hunted became the hunter . And the game is on ! ! This was a very good read . Anyone who likes dark cold mysterious guys who finds that one woman to soften them , will love this story . Now I 'm moving on to the second story in this series .	1
Conrad is a very powerful vampire who leads a life full of parties in San Francisco 1969 . When one night a dark haired beauty walks into one of his parties uninvited . Conrad takes one look at her and knows he must have her .

Conrad has kept them secret for many years , their secret that ca n't get out . To many things hing on this secret.Find out what happens with Desert Rose and Conrad , who are these young vampires , what happens to Armand , what is this big secret , and who is Damian.This was a great book , I could n't put it down . I love how PG Forte gets into the story . She jumps from past to present to be sure you do n't miss anything . Her characters are strong , you will form quick opinions of them and then she goes and does something to make you change that opinion . I have become a fan of this series and ca n't wait to dive into the next book , Old Sins , Long Shadows .	1
Rated 4.5/5Summary : Conrad is the apex around whom the characters in this book revolve . He is one of the most powerful vampires in the world , and he leads his San Francisco based nest with generosity , affection , fear and cruelty . The opposing facets of his power allow him to maintain control of his community without challenge.Seemingly impossible , Conrad is missing and foul play seems to be involved . The only person who is aware of Conrad 's missing person status is his former lover Damian . Although the relationship between the two men ended over 100 years prior , Damian is fiercely devoted to his sire . As a result , Damian refuses to stir up the vampire nest by revealing Conrad 's disappearance . Instead , he acquires assistance from the only two vampires he can trust - Conrad 's twin children , Marc and Julie.In this world , vampires are never born . They are only made . Conrad defied the norm after falling deeply in love in the '60s with a young human woman named Desert Rose . Their relationship was passionate and tumultuous , and resulted in the birth of the twins against all odds . Desert Rose did not survive after the birth , so it was up to Conrad to raise the children in secret , away from those who would want to destroy the anomaly , and with only Damian to help him.Now it is the up to the twins to save their father . For the first time in their lives , they have stopped hiding in the human world and are taking their place in their father 's nest . Will they be able to find Conrad in time to save his life ? Review : This book was one of the best surprises I 've read all year . Every good book has ( what I call ) an incision point . It is the point in the book when the cut has been made and I 'm 100 % in for the duration . Even in a really good book , it can still take several chapters before I hit that point of no return . In this book , I hit it in chapter one.Based on the book summary and the introduction of the twins ' history in the first chapter , I assumed immediately that they were going to be in their late teens or early twenties when Damian calls them to the nest for the first time . I expected a coming-of-age vampire story . Then all of a sudden - POW - the author casually divulges that the twins are actually in their forties . How awesome is that ? ? They are n't adolescents ... they are older than me ! That was the point I was hooked , because I knew this story would be unique . They might be children in the vampire community , but to us human readers , they are adults . What a fantastic dynamic to work with.The second major surprise was the complete lack of boundaries within the vampire community with regards to sexual orientation . The vampires love who they love . Male or female , it makes no difference . They are not human , and they do n't fall prey to human prejudices or labels . They simply fall in love with the one who is worthy . What an amazingly unique feature to be a natural part of this world . In all the vampire books I 've read , I 've never read anything like this.For those of you who are sensitive to POV changes , this is a story that changes POVs with each chapter . It is also a book that changes timelines . There is a lot of jumping back and forth between the 60s ( Conrad 's relationship with Desert Flower ) and current day ( the search for Conrad . Once in a while I did get frustrated with the timeline changes because it would cut off a part of the story I was really engrossed in . But other than that , I enjoyed the format , the pacing , and the characters immensely . The book is really well written and very emotional.I highly recommend this book to adult fans of paranormal and vamp romance novels . Expect the unexpected .	1
Vampire family drama . Vampires are made , not born -- except for twins Julie and Marc Fischer . One plotline was set in 1968 and dealt with the twins ' mother 's relationship with master vamp Conrad , while the second plotline concerned a search for the missing Conrad in the present . I found this book highly addictive and will definitely be picking up book two in the series .	1
I ordered the entire book `` Cowboy Fever '' that had 3 stories . Loved them all ! ! ! This one was kind of unexpected , but once I got into it , I enjoyed it !	1
A Happy Ever After if there ever was one ... .This is a good read for a short story . I am loving this series and worth the money .	1
As a first in a series , this book was just enough to whet my appetite for more . Steamy hot , with nice setting , strong characters and passion.The little Dom thing in a menage relationship was definitely arousing . I liked how the heroine had to come around and decide if she was a one-man-womanor she could love both equally . And the MEN , my sweet jesus , where they hot ! And surprisingly emotional . All this combined with good erotica and not stallingthe plot makes this a perfect weekend read . Make sure you have your partner around after you read it ; )	1
... the harder they fall . Is there anything hotter than a dominant bad boy with a big heart who needs to be taught how to love ? This M/M/F story was scorching hot ( even if there were a few times I wanted to smack Jackson ) .	1
Um ... thought I 'd read hot m & eacute ; nage before , but excuse me for being mistaken . This really needed to be longer ... ... Much much longer . Yummy cowboys !	1
4 starsThis was a very good story . I liked Julia , Hunter and Jay and how they came together . A hot read but with good emotional content as well . : ) Julia is a pharmaceutical rep in Sidney . She 's smart and well balanced and seems to have it all together . Julia was raised a good girl and her family expects her to get married and have kids . Julia has no idea what she 's supposed to do when realizes that she 's fallen in love with 2 men and she ca n't figure out which one she loves more.Jay is also a pharmaceutical rep in Sidney . He and Julia have known each other for about a year but Jay was involved with someone at the time . By the time he was free , Hunter had come in to the picture and Jay did n't make a move because of him.Hunter is a product manager from another pharmaceutical company and part the poker club that Jay invites Julia to join . He also wants Julia but does n't move in because of Jay . I liked both Hunter and Jay , they 're good guys and both like Julia a lot.The ice breaks on the careful detente that the trio has going a couple of weeks before Christmas when they 're the only one 's left at the poker game . Julia end up sharing a few kisses with both men but leaves after that and is unsure of herself , avoiding both men for the next week . She talks about her issues with her sister but it still comes back to the fact that she could never bring 2 men home to her family . When she gets to poker night the week before Christmas , she finds that it was cancelled ( although she did n't get a message ) and she ends up alone with Jay and Hunter . Jay and Hunter take the chance to get her in their arms again and once there , Julia ca n't think of getting out . After that night , the trio spends every night together and when Julia spends Christmas day with her family , she 's torn because she ca n't stand the idea of losing Hunter and/or Jay but she does n't know if she could get her family to accept it . Her sister does find out though and wants to meet Jay and Hunter , seeming willing to give them a chance so it does n't seem impossible.As Julia begins to realize she seriously wants something long-term including all 3 of them , she wonders how the men are feeling . They prove to be just as interesting in making their trio long term as she 's thinking but they all take some time to explore things and do n't share with the families yet . This ends up being a good thing as there are more relationship landmines to navigate , including the unexpected attraction that comes out between Hunter and Jay , and Hunter 's subsequent freak out about it . Julia manages to talk Hunter down and with Jay and Julia 's help , Hunter starts to come to terms with some things . They start bonding even closer as a trio and spend New Years eve together and have some explosive sex and some emotional bonding . In the end , Hunter , Jay and Julia agree to tell their families and work their relationship in to something permanent and they start their HEA.This was very good . I really liked the characters and the story was really well done . It did n't seem as short as it was and I felt the sexual content was well balanced with the emotions as the trio came together . I 'd recommend this story . Thumbs up ! : D	1
I 'm sorry i 'm late with the review . I thought i sent one . i'ts a good book.thank you very much .	1
Going All In was a quick and enjoyable story . I was cautious about the story as it was very short but I applaud Ms. Dee on an impressively well written and fully developed story despite the brevity . The characters were realistic , flawed and very inventive . The sex was intense and graphic . The reader should be aware that there are scenes of m & eacute ; nage in which the male characters do not interact sexually and others where they do . There are issues that the characters have to overcome which were very unique and interesting . I enjoyed that Ms. Dees included a plot twist which allowed the characters to change and adapt in that suppressed amount of time . Nonetheless , the story is quickly paced with an excellent story line and well developed characters . I thoroughly enjoyed reading this story and will have to try out another of Ms. Dee 's novels . - Shalanda	1
Lost and found love . WOW . I really enjoyed this book , even though it is short . I loved the idea that they both harbored feelings for each other in High School and now they can act on them . It was wonderful to see that they wanted to be a family and that it was n't about just sex and living a unique lifestyle . I would read more of her work . The samples at the end have me intrigued to see if other works are as entertaining .	1
Mary Hughes ' Biting Love series is incredible . I highly recommend this entire series to anyone who craves a great dominate alpha male vampire story . Her vampires are all sexy yummy hot . Her female characters are all sassy , independent , and smart . When the two get together it 's dynamite . When you add in that the stories all connect Meier 's Corners and interrelate characters and storyline you 've got a winner.Get them all .	1
Twyla is taking a vacation from her job as an admin assistant to the mayor of Meier 's Corner . When she boards her flight to New York , she notices that Nikos is on the same flight as she is . She had already dubbed him 'Spartacus in a suit ' , a yummy colossal package of goodness she ca n't wait to get into , but he is having none of it . But when another man hits on her while in flight , Nikos puts his foot down , much to her surprise.When Twyla learns that her cousin Aylmer has designed something to reveal the vampires on New Year 's eve , she contacts her friend Nixie . Nixie in turn tells her to contact Nikos as soon as possible , and tell him what 's going on.The race to stop the reveal is close . Get on board for a roller coaster ride to keep the vampires a secret.This novel is compact and has a lot going on . There are references to other characters that may be confusing if you have n't read the preceding novels . If you are offended by very explicit sex scenes , this book is not for you . I noticed there were several bad reviews because of this . So reader be warned beforehand . I enjoyed the novel regardless , and I thought the great big Greek vampire was perfect for petite and busty Twyla . Highly recommended .	1
If you 're unfamiliar with Mary Hughes ' Biting Love series ... well ... rectify that as soon as possible , but do n't start here . The series starts withBite My Fire : A Biting Love storyand continues with the stronger second installment , Biting Nixie : A Biting Love Novel , and they 're fun , relatively light , but definitely sexy/steamy/erotic vamp romance novels that blend humor and danger together quite nicely . The Bite of Silence is third in the series , but a short story instead of a full length novel like it 's predecessors . Hughes has managed to condense the best parts of her books and deliver a powerful , funny , sexual , and surprisingly complete tale in a much smaller package . I believe , however , that this story would definitely feel lacking to anyone unfamiliar with the series , so start from the beginning.In The Bite of Silence , Nixie 's best friend Twyla , Admin . Assistant for the mayor of Meier 's Corners , is off to the Big Apple for a little New Year 's Eve partying . When she boards the plane , however , she finds the object of her most delicious fantasies seated in first class . Niko is tall , dark , and destructively gorgeous ... and Twyla 's also pretty sure he 's a vampire ... but he 's stubbornly refused to give her the time of day since he moved to town , so a two hour flight with the vamp is JUST what the vacation gods ordered . But Niko 's not as unaffected by the delectable and funny Twyla as she thought ... and her `` vacation '' surely is n't going to go as smooth as she 'd hoped when she realizes that someone 's trying to turn all the vampires in NYC into slavering , bloodthirsty beasts as the ball drops on the New Year and Twyla and Niko are the only two who can stop a madman from destroying them all.Points to Hughes for delivering a very well-rounded story in such a short format . There 's even a bit more character development than I 'd anticipated - and something that 's so often lacking in stories of this length . Admittedly , I 've read the first two books , so I 'm already familiar with Hughes ' world and vampire mythos , and I DO N'T think that the book would read nearly as well for someone who is n't , so I rate it four stars for lacking any real world building at all . Other than that - very well told .	1
This is a difficult subject for a novel as it includes euthanasia and disabilities . However the subjects are treated sympathetically . It starts with a journalist , whose grandmother is dying , wishing to write a story about the clinic where she has spent her last days . It is soon apparent that all may not be as it seems and the reader is left in doubt as to whether the clinic is trying to help people end their days peacefully or there is an ulterior motive and the story changes to more of a medical mystery with the central character trying to get to the bottom of what is going on . The story is fast paced and you get a real feel for the characters particularly with the journalist 's disabled girlfriend . At the end a decision needs to be made and the reader is left to think which way the story is going to go . I think the story ends with this moral dilemma but there are enough strings left hanging for there to be as sequel , if there is , I will read it .	1
This little 65 page novella is the first of two novellas by this Author . Readers of a sensitive nature need to be aware that this short story deals with the topic of assisted suicide and contains profanity and some sex.This novella is a very well researched and altogether thought-provoking commentary on end of life issues , euthanasia , and the uncertainties inherent in research on the brain and death . It touches on issues that many readers , may or may not have had personal experience of particularly in this day and age where people are able to be kept alive long after they should 've been let go , by medical research and already in situ practices.The characters are developed extremely well , with the male lead adding heavily to the overall success of this little read . If the energies the Author had put into developing the characters been directed elsewhere , not only would they have become two-dimensional and uninteresting it would have affected the plot as a whole . The characters different points of view and thoughts on the topic covered are well researched and make this short story seem as if it is a full length book.There were two things that bothered me though about this novella ; one was the relationships formed between the male lead and the two diametrically opposite females , but then again who can fully explains the laws of attraction and there is the old saying ` there are two types of women , those you take home to Mum , and those you do n't ' , which put to rest any damage these relationships may have done to my enjoyment of this read . Another niggle were the proofreading errors , which normally really spoil a read for me ; in this case that was not to be . Yes , there were typos , but they were so easily discerned and non-intrusive that it did nothing to detract from the overall enjoyment of the short.The book finishes with a lot of loose ends , rather like life actually and , although I was initially surprised by the very abrupt ending , I decided that not only did it work well but suited the book , and what there is of the book has stayed with me for a long time after I finished reading.I would recommend this to book to anyone who would like a good quick read that will make them think . However , because of its subject matter I would probably aim for the YA reader upwards.Originally reviewed on : [ ... ]	1
Very few of the free or low cost items on my Kindle end up being saved . This one did . I appreciated the intelligent writing style and subject matter.I did like the ending . A reader should be able to interpret the ending based on Chuck 's beliefs and actions - or their own .	1
The Death Trip was a quick read and the story was surprisingly well done for such a short length . It did contain a few errors , but not very many . Chuck , an out of work aspiring journalist , originally starts researching the company behind the Death Trip experience to better understand his grandmother 's choice to take the drug instead of living out the remaining few months of her life with cancer and Parkinsons disease . He is drawn to a mysterious women he meets online who suspects the company of evil intentions and wants him to gather the evidence to prove it . As he digs deeper , he raises the suspicions of the company 's founder , who has a hidden agenda . The author takes a very controversial subject and presents the perspective from each side . The science behind the death trip experience was explained very well and was thought-provoking . The ending was a surprise and left up to interpretation .	1
Very interesting ideas . Shades of Soylent Green , one of my favorites . The book forces one to think about both sides of an issue we all think about uncomfortably . I personally thought the ending was great !	1
The characters had depth , and back story elements were introduced well . Relationships between characters were messy and complicated.The plot moved forward well . It was slightly predictable , but I 'm ok with that . I was ready for book two when book one ended .	1
I liked it but I can say that this was n't my favorite of the 4 books in this series but it was entertaining and worth reading . As a reader some things I both liked and disliked.Traver 's family honor and guilt drove the story . I thought there could have been other more appealing reasons that could have been more entertaining . Rusty being forced into a situation not of his making put a bit of a dampner on the story from the beginning for me . I became frustrated for him being stuck between a rock and a hard place trying to please everyone but himself.Leaving that subject behind some of the characters bothered me as well . I felt Deke became more insensitive and controlling toward Rusty and at times I wanted to stuff a sock in it . Maybe that is what Ms. Hestand wanted me to feel and if she did than it was accomplished.I kept feeling as if the author glossed over situations that could have been built upon making the story more spicy and entertaining . Examples : had she built on Jennifer 's appearance and the situation that occured . It would have made for more substance had she built more drama around the character . I wanted to see her pay and pay dearly for her manipulation.I liked the way previous characters made steady appearances throughout all the series so a reader could keep up with the happenings of those characters . I liked the way Cal was portrayed as the family support system even though Deke took the helm . Emma remained a strong female Matriarch and supportive character along with Sammy Jo making her appearances . I got to know and like this family.All in all I was looking for more meat to the story but what I read was enjoyable and more than I could have ever done . I can come up with the ideas but could never have made any attempt at putting it down on paper as Ms. Hestand has done . Bravo . Enjoy , the price was definately right .	1
you have you read the series . travers brother series . it is 1 of the best around . i do n't know which one i like the best	1
It is possible for simple things like plugs not to work . So I was happy win this animal came even in a fancy Amazon alimentation box and well packed . Pulling the zip open was like Christmas . The mini USB end is not as colorful as the original but it plugs in just as well and in newer vehicles the USB can plug in and charge without a special charger stuck in the old 12v auxiliary . There is a USB plug-in , leaving the 12v for other items . At work I plug into a power strip so I carry this with me . At home it finds its way into the laptop . Now I wonder what else I can stick it in ?	1
Only problem is it sucks having to spend 20 bucks for just a cord . However it is the same kind it came with and no problems .	1
Since my original cable was fine for just under two years and then began disintegrating after minimal use , I have no way of knowing if this replacement cable is of higher quality . If it 's working and looking fine in two years and I 'm asked to review it , I 'll give it a good rating . The cord is thinner and the covering seems less rigid , but that 's pretty unscientific.UPDATE : Still in fine working condition almost two years later , so I think we 're good .	1
Estoy conforme con & eacute ; l , sin embargo es un poco pesado , casi tanto como el Kindle Dx . Ser & iacute ; a mejor que diera la misma protecci & oacute ; n , pero con un peso menor .	1
This is good protection for your Kindle . I have dropped mine when it was in this case , and there was no damage . It also keeps the screen from getting dusty .	1
I like the idea that I can cover my kindle and put a strap to keep it closed and feel it is well protected by the cover . I 'd like it better if it was made from a lighter material and did n't cost so much . That 's why I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 .	1
In & # 34 ; Angel be good & # 34 ; our heroine Daphne saves the life of a man she barely knows during Vietnam war and dies instead when it was not really her time ; when she gets to heaven she requests to return to earth to be able to live her life.After some time the & # 8220 ; Angelic council & # 8221 ; agrees to send her back with the condition that she grants them a favor . They need her to save the soul of the son of the very same man for who she lost her life . Turns out that the soul she has to save belongs to a really sexy - though cold hearted - 30 years old business man and that she only has one night to convince him that love and goodness exists . Lucky for her it is Christmas ! The plot moves very fast as almost everything happens during one Christmas night but I enjoyed the way it is written . An important remark is that this is not the traditional clean Christmas tale ; there are sex scenes though not too graphic.I truly enjoyed this book , it is sweet and even emotive and it talks about redemption and second chances . My only complaint would be that it ends quite abruptly on 76 % of the kindle edition , but it does have an epilogue so at least we have the happy ever after .	1
This book was awesome , and finished it in 24 hours ! I did n't want it to END . I want more ! ! Read it , its a 'feel good ' book !	1
I really liked this book . It was a little different from most Christmas romances , very entertaining . I would read more from this author .	1
I received a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes . I read it in one day . A new twist on the classic Dickens tale A CHRISTMAS CAROL . Though it had the same premise as the Dickens classic , it is its own story . I found the authors ' substitutes for the ghosts surprising , and the inclusion of angels was a nice touch . Unlike the classic , this is definitely a romance . There 's even some hanky panky , which I thought was unnecessary . Daphne was a likeable character ( sweet and sassy ) . I 'm still not sure how I feel about Nathaniel ( scrooge ) . Though this is a Christmas story , I did n't feel it was overly `` Christmasy '' so it could be read any time ( I normally read holiday stories around the holidays ) . I liked that author added an epilogue to let the reader know what happened to the characters . The end of the story felt a little abrupt , but all in all it was a good read .	1
This is a great story set in a fantasy-world on Earth in the late 18th Century about a girl who after an embarrassing incident in front of the king her father chatises her so she runs away and stows away on a ship . Except the ship she choose Captain is fer fathers rival and not one to take kindly to someone hiding out on his ship . He knows just how to deal with bratty young ladies and proceeds to do just that many , many times as renny ca n't seem to keep herself out of trouble . This book has a little bit of everything from adventure , intrigue and yes ramance and lots of spankings .	1
Pursuit of Glory , by Korey Mae Johnson , stands among the finest historical romances I have ever read . What could have come off as just another historical with a spanking on every page , Pursuit of Glory can easily pass as a mainstream historical romance without one single connection of hand , et al . to the heroine 's bottom . That the spanking scenes are so seamlessly interwoven , making this book ( as another reviewer said ) a romance with spanking in it , rather than a spanking romance , thrills me no end ! Renny escapes her father after he brutally chastises her for criticizing the king , and she stows away on Admiral Logan Liam 's ship . At 18 , she thinks she knows it all , and she happens to know a lot , having studied at her father 's knee for many years . This is where Renny gets into most of her trouble , but in her we also see an aching need to be needed , and to garner the glory she thinks she deserves if only someone would give her the chance to prove herself . The author did a magnificent job in fleshing out the character of Renny so that each of us who were 18 once and wanted to be something to someone , can relate with aching clarity.The author also creates a sympathetic character in Logan Liam , a tough-minded old codger of immortal soul and little patience with Renny -- until he finds himself falling hopelessly in love with her . Other minor characters add fuel to an already glowing fire , rather that act as filler , and all work in unison for the good of the story . There is not one false move in this book , including the bit of sci-fi element , which I found gutsy and creative.I would read anything by this author any day . I learned from her .	1
Muller is like many heroes written during this period , smarter than most people . That 's a bit of a drawback , but the stories are well-constructed , pace well , and the writing style is quite good apart from the typical verbosity of this era of writing . I recommend the book highly as good entertainment . -- Dr. William H. Stephens , retired editor	1
This is a short story with cops doing undercover work , and 'work it ' they do . It 's a clever story but I still find it hard to use my imagination of how this 'manly ' cop can be so convincing as a woman/wife to the other neighborhood wives . But I remind myself that it 's entertainment that we are after and this one certainly delivers .	1
What a fun read ! Chris and Vin are great together and the contrast in their characters made the story that much funnier . In addition to the spot on humor , Ms. Watts managed to pen a tender ( and hot ! ) love story . Well done , Ms. Watts !	1
There 's quite a bit of unnecessary info , and although I try to avoid doing so , had to skip quite a few pages throughout . They were really , REALLY boring . The rest of the book , however , was really pretty good . I 'm not usually into religious stuff , and I only read this because I thought it was about the antichrist , but I still enjoyed it .	1
This novel was fasted paced after the first few chapters . It started slow but it picked up . However , there was some timeline that made no sense . If you disregard when the author says & # 34 ; 4 months later & # 34 ; then it seems like a good time line . I only wish the author had n't taken so long to get to the good stuff . Had a very good ending .	1
Question I have often wondered about , ANSWERED . Could we ? Yes ! Should we ? Hmmmmmmmmmmm You 'll have to read it to find out . Thanks Mr. Johnson ( and thanks Richard for the recommendation ) for a well written , engaging and thought provoking story-line . Looking forward to the rest !	1
When I first started reading , I thought what the heck ! After a few chapters , I was still thinking what the heck but was a little interested to see what was going to happen . After about 1/3 of the way thru , I was definitely hooked ! I have to say that this book was way more interesting that I ever would have believed from the way it started out . All I can say is that I want more from this author ! ! ! He really can write , and this book is one every Christian should read . Just get past the first few chapters and you 'll see what I mean . I loved it ! !	1
I could n't put this book down . It had a rich plot and the author was very knowledgeable about the situations included . You can tell he really did his research . There could have been somewhat better editing but it did n't distract me much . I would recommend this story .	1
Horror , terror , and dark fantasies are among my favorite genres , so when I saw some favorable reviews for `` Enoch 's Devil , '' I downloaded it . I had n't previously read any of author Suzi M 's work , but after reading this story , I 'm impressed . The story is very short , but in only ten pages she managed to incorporate eroticism ; the pitch darkness and dampness of an old abandoned subway tunnel under the streets of NYC ( the setting for many creepy horror stories ) ; the Nephilim , the Biblical fallen angels described in Genesis ; and Cthulhu , an octopus-like symbol of evil created by H.P . Lovecraft in the 1920s and recreated by many authors since then.Without giving away any spoilers , I 'll just say that the ending was perfect , one that the late Alfred Hitchcock would have loved .	1
From the first words of this story to the very last , author Suzi M. had me hooked . A mixture of Lovecraft and Biblical myth - Enoch 's Devil captivates the reader and you do n't want to put it down until you 've finished the story . Suzi M. has mastered the plot twists and surprise endings that make a a short story great !	1
Enoch & # 8217 ; s Devil is one twisted little tale.Suzi M has knocked out a tasty treat for Lovecraft fans , as well as those with a darker , biblical mythology fetish.This is a quick , one-sitting read that manages to be almost cute while still making the reader squirm.Well done .	1
Too be honest this was a short story recommended to me in a group on FB.AMAZED ! ! I so fell in love with this writer , wow , talk about draw you and hang you out to dry ... begging for the next bit of story ! Although a great little story on its own you cant help but then wonder what else is going on ... which leads you Suzi Ms Immortal War Collection ... . of which the first one is currently free ! brilliant build up of `` what the heck is that ? ! '' and not let down by the monster that emerges ! Cant wait to get my teeth in to the next book ... . or is that the other way round ?	1
I have read them all and these paranormal romance ebooks rock ! ! I am an avid fan of Heather and her stories ! ! ! Read Redeemer and all her ebooks you will LOVE them too ! ! !	1
First of all , I am a big fan of HK-W and have loved just about everything she 's written . So , when I saw this novel I did n't hesitate to order it . And , as always , I loved it . She is so good at characterizations and folding the past with a distinct take in the present .	1
This series is a great read . Very different from other novels I read . I happen to like the whole good vs evil genre . I liked the personalities she gave the angels . Great read .	1
Hands down , Redeemer is the best single ( by that I mean non-series ) book I have ever read ! Like almost everyone who left a review , I too could not put it down . I read it straight through , stopping only for normal human functions like food and bathroom breaks . It was a perfect combination of fantasy and historical events . I do realize that some people would have a hard time with the religious aspect of this book , either from the fact that it was there in the first place or from the fact that it 's not along the lines of the way they believed - but after all , it is fantasy and anything can happen in fantasy ! The author done such a good job of developing characters , twisting plots and building suspense that I really hated the book ending . I wish it was part of a series so I could read more of these people I have grown to care about . It will most certainly be a book that I will read over and over again in the future ( as I do all the books I love ) and I can not recommend this book highly enough to anyone who truly loves a good fantasy with superb writing !	1
I loved this book , it was great , I read it right before Easter , and I could see it happening this way . Love the lil girl Jessie and the whole storyline.. will be reading more of Heather 's books.. great writer ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Wow this book shocked me I loved this book . This book had me at the beginning with the crazy birth to finding out one of the twins is the chosen one and they both go on the run just to find more trouble . Their are magic beings and gods and devils and one hot man trying to do the right thing ... Cant wait to finish the next book..	1
I 've become a big fan of Heather Killough-Walden and this book is a prime example . Very exciting ... a tough one to put down once I started .	1
Loved this one . I am so glad that I found your books . Can not wait to receive the next book .	1
I loved this book ! Fell in love with the characters and the story . Ca n't wait for the next book . Heather is just an amazing writer .	1
I have to say I was pleasantly suprised by this book . I had read The Third Kiss by this author and was not thrilled with it , but because of the cheap price , I decided to try her again . I am glad I did ! The descriptions of characters and the settings were vivid . The pace was fast moving . I do n't really like the whole demon thing going on in this book , but because the author made it a whole new world it made it easier to swallow . I normally like more romance but I can see that the author is setting up the next book to have more . My only real complaint is that it was somewhat confusing at times with all the names . It might just be me , but I really had to think sometimes to remember who certain characters were . This book was totally unique and interesting . It is well worth the small price tag .	1
I was pleasantly surprised but knowing this writer , I should n't be . I found this to be refreshing and a really strong story line . Just when I thought I had things figured out I quickly and pleasantly learned that I was far from the mark . The characters developed with each one 's distinct personality and I find myself committed to yet another series written by Heather-Killough Walden . Kudos ! ! !	1
This book held my interest for the whole night ! It is well written , and action packed , with a little spookiness thrown in . I was sorry to see it end .	1
This is one of the best books I have read this year and believe me ... .. I read at least five to six books a week . I recently discovered this author and CAN NOT stop reading her works of art . I can not wait to read book two .	1
I love this first book in a new series . Heather developes wonderful characters full of mystery . It has lots of paranormal scifi and actoin a little for every taste . Raven is a beautiful girl who does n't know about true identity so she has to learn to be the strong person she is meant to be without all the human limitations . The ending is a cliff hanger but it leaves you wanting for more . I would recomend this to anyone looking for a good read .	1
the reviews i read were n't exactly wrong ... the end she does seem to kinda give up but there 's supposed to be a second book coming out and after everything she goes through i 'd be like yeah anything to just get a good nights sleep ... this book was awesome ... she did a great job introducing you to a whole other world full of different races of creatures and devils and gods ... without wasting time explaining about it ... she wrote it in a way that you just understood what was going on ... i loved it ... the only thing is if you 've read other books by her then you might have noticed she sure does n't mind having her main character have the crap beat out of them and some dirty junk happen ... i think this story was good ... i 've loved all her books so far ... and no matter what it was definitely worth a dollar ...	1
I used to read fantasy but seemed to outgrow it , but after reading the Chosen Soul , I think I 'm back . The story starts off with a bang , a woman is in the grips of childbirth , gives birth to a healthy boy and then the pain starts again . This time the child and mother are likely to die . A stranger comes to the door , asks to see the mother and after putting his hand over her , heals her and the daughter who 's born healthy instead of dead . And that 's just the first chapter . Who is the stranger ? What is the rumor of the ancient soul that was stolen from the spring of souls ? Enter a world of magic like no other . I 'm used to elves being the good guys and demons being the bad guys and so it goes . Not so in the Chosen Soul . Reincarnation , magic , demons doing good and elves doing bad , it 's all mixed up in the this extraordinary novel by Heather Killough-Walden . This is the first of a series and I was so disappointed to find that the second novel featuring these complex characters , was not available yet . I will certainly buy it because I want to see the characters again and immerse myself in their world.This is not your typical fantasy novel , it actually rises above the genre bringing in more of both the real world , and a new age flavor that sets it apart from all the rest . What a wonderful author .	1
I wish it had started off with one of his westerns instead of a verrrry long sea tale . But what the heck . It was a very good sea tale ! There is a vast variety of works giving the reader a lot to enjoy . Biggest criticism .. NO TABLE OF CONTENTS ! It could really use one .	1
I love old westerns , and I 'm not too critical of them so long as they are well-written . Max Brand can write well , but there is a sameness to his word products . His heroes often tend to be introspective loners on the lam , and thus we get a strong psychological component . But , since Brand was paid by the word , there is also a tendancy toward wordiness ; this , when combined with the aforementioned introspection , seems to prolong even the simplest actions.Brand wrote some good books ; he was bound to writing so very much and in so many different genres . Indeed , many of his books ( such as the Doctor Kildare series ) are not westerns . But forced to churn out verbiage in magazine stories and short novels to make a living , too many of his tales seem perfunctory and more than a tad familiar , one to the next . And some plot devices are downright odd . That so many of hs books are as highly regarded as they are is certainly to his credit , but overall there is some hard-to-define quality ( angst , perhaps ? ) about his western stories that does n't particularly appeal to me ; they somehow do n't ring true . Nevertheless , for those who enjoy his stories , this set conveniently packages many of Brand 's currently available public domain works.UPDATE 04-27-13 : Wildside Press has just published a particularly well-formatted , 20-title `` Max Brand Megapack '' for only $ .99 . You will probably wish to sample both , but THAT is the one I would recommend .	1
Other reviews trashed this volume . It was a reasonable price to get all of his works together . And yes , not all were westerns . Louis L'amour did n't write just westerns , either . A good story is a good story . Get over it.I have n't had time to read through all of the stories , but the ones I read were interesting.Too many books , not enough time ! Retirement 's coming closer , though , then I can read all day !	1
A GREAT book , the WRITER has out done himself and I have enjoyed every word of it I 'm looking forward to the next book	1
I found this an enjoyable read , albeit the typical epic fantacy . Leads you to invest in more than just the main character . Look forward to book two .	1
Read this book in a few days , good storyline and good pace . Love the fact that the book was only $ 2.99 on my Kindle . Will definitely have me going back to read the sequels.Highly recommend for anyone in between books like myself	1
I write this review after having completed book 4 and started book 5 . I do note that this and book 3 are getting negative reviews and frankly , I do n't think they 're deserved . Missing proofreader ? Absolutely . Tons of grammatical errors ? Certainly . Improper use of verbs and nouns ? Definitely . So drop a star off and be done with it . Three stars is harsh , because the thing is this author definitely has the gift of storytelling . It catches you , and makes you want to find out what happens next - and that 's hard to consistently do in a series.Book one introduces Flare , who is of royal descent . Without spoiling the story , Flare ends up leaving his kingdom to join the Guardians , who are sworn knights of a neighboring country . The Guardians are then placed in a live-or-die situation that defines that happens next.I did have a few issues with the story . First , the beginning part with his kingdom is totally glossed over : there 's an early scene with an escort that you hope will be explained later , and it 's somewhat alluded to but you really have to take a leap of faith as to what 's going on . There are no ramifications to Flare leaving the kingdom , at least not that I can tell , and he never goes back to revisit any of the people who helped him become a Guardian ( with the exception of one person that he competed against ) . In other words , it felt as though the author was trying to hurry up and get to the Guardians section and spend as little time as possible fully developing Flare early on . We also never get a sense of consequence for what he 's doing.Second , there are character interactions late in the story that feel random and contrived . There 's a death , and though we see a reaction to that death , it 's totally blown off in later books of the series . We do n't get that sense that the death was life defining . Trying desperately not to spoil things , but the actions in later books contradict the emotion that the author was attempting to evoke with the death in this book ; goes to a lack of continuity and story flow.Lastly , there are too many sub characters . The author had so much difficulty developing Flare that it spilled over into the development of the other characters . It 's extremely challenging putting a face to each person and how they fit into the larger picture . You know certain characters are warriors , certain others can use magic , some are female and some are male . Beyond that , you just do n't feel invested in the rest of the team . It 's as though their sole purpose is to have Flare not be a vigilante.There is an underlying plot that is reasonably well developed , and it is this plot that makes the reader want to continue with the series . It 's never blatant , never given away , just enough that you hunger for more . If the author were to work on their character development and continuity , they would have a tremendous story on their hands . Regardless , it 's worth the read if you can overlook the above .	1
I have found the books one to four of the Guardians book by Christopher Williams- great reading , very exciting and good story - not worried about the grammer as I just enjoy the story . I have n't finished book 4 but I 'm 78 % through it . Wondering if there is a book 5 ?	1
Enjoyed this book immensely and can , t wait to start the next in the series.if it is half as good as the first one I should be kept busy got the next few weeks . Has great potential	1
A better then average tale.Price point is great.Easy read.Good book for a slow nite.There are some twists and turns to the story that keep the reader interested.I liked the half breed part and the plot with-in it.For the money you ca n't go wrong.It 's by no means a great novel but well told and interesting.For readers who like fantasy it is enjoyable.A good book to bring new fantasy readers into the fold .	1
It was everything that I have been waiting for the story moved forward at a good speed and for all of us that hate how quickly mates meet and end up in bed this one works you get told the reasons why and she makes him work for it . And once she meets her mate the author does n't change her into some helpless woman she stays as strong as she was in the first chapter all the way through they both make compromises if you have been let down by them before please try this one and you will be more than happy	1
It 's rare to find a good book , and that 's what this is ... a book . Well over 200 pages & the cost was a bit over $ 5 . but worth it .	1
I really enjoyed the characters in this story . Although the hero is the ultimate alpha male , the heroine is the perfect balance and stong in her own right . The perfect couple .	1
The hero is a true alpha male struggling with it and you could really see that with this book but it seemed like every time they would start to form more than a biology bond some explosion or emergency would happen .	1
This book has several stories in one . The principal character and her love interest are meant to be together , but a teenage crush put their romance on hold for years . Both principles have family and friends join in the story and the reader can be overwhelmed by the number of characters.That aside , I enjoyed the book . Free on Kindle . I recommend this book but warn readers there are a lot of stories within and around the main characters . One can easily end a chapter with one set of characters and not get back to their story for a couple of chapters , and at the same time those characters are mentioned in the other romance stories.Confused yet ? You 'll have to read Denver Cereal to understand .	1
Enjoyed the book and plan to read more by CLaudia Hall Christian . Enjoyed meeting each character and they all interacted .	1
The book starts off at a good pace and only builds on it as the story progresses . One revelation after another followed by more questions and small mysteries keeps you engaged . Although the plot wont win much for originality , the characters are interesting with good interactions between them and the action is plentiful . I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and the next in the series and find myself somewhat annoyed i cant find any info on future releases.Id recommend this book to anyone who either appreciates a simple but well put together fantasy book that only promises better things in the future .	1
exciting book ! showed a lot of feelings , could be real life . most books you dont know what your in for . fact , fiction , little of both . i love a book that takes you away . this one did . i read at least a half a book a day and still work . love books this is a great one !	1
Beth Kery does n't know how to write anything but great stories ! Two hot characters get stuck inside during a snowstorm . Too bad she 's his fathers new girlfriend . Too bad for her this guy is a hottie , and nothing like what her new boyfriend has described him as . Tensions mount , snow piles up , story gets hot enough to melt a glacier , but who wants to leave !	1
This was a super cute story and was well written ... for a free novel I couldnt ask for better . I am pleased to say that they are a few free ones that I have really liked which shocked me so I started looking or more and even though I read thru the whole book in 3 hours it was worth every min .	1
I read this `` short story '' , I really enjoyed it . I knew it was short when I purchased it , it was a fast read , with some good sex and an HEA . It was just as I had expected .	1
I am so glad I did n't go with the reviews . I am glad that Julie got a backbone to handle her deceitful cousin , Corinne . She was such a hater . I 'm glad she got Gabe , he is an astounding character . I wanted her to tell her aunt how she felt . I wanted read on that confrontation . That would have been entertaining .	1
I think that this is a good but very short story about a mysterious place where very few people know about .	1
Oh my.. I was not expecting this book to be a hot read . I got reading and did not put down until I was finished with it . I ended up going and buying more in the series . The humor was great through out the whole book . I have recommended this book to a few friends already . If you want a steamy , sexy hot read , read this book . Delilah Devlin books have never disappointed me . They seem to only be getting better . If Delilah 's name is on the book it is going on my too read pile .	1
I read this book in one day . It was to good to put down . Can not wait to read the next book and enjoy the whole series !	1
this book just cracked me up . There is a tradition in theater about the 4th wall - where the audience sits . Usually the audience is ignored . Well , the author keeps violating the 4th wall concept in the book . He writes these outrageous disclaimers . `` No characters have been harmed in the writing of this book well except for the ones who are dead . But there were dead anyway '' and stuff like that.I kept wanting someone to read parts out loud to , and I was alone . well , except for the author but he already knew what he wrote ...	1
A Long Way From Disney is a great collection of short stories from Seth Harwood , the author of the action packed Jack Wakes Up . It includes a lot of touching coming of age stories set in the eighties . These are incredibly relatable and touching stories.I highly recommend this collection , which is priced far below the value of the stories contained within .	1
Part of what interested me in Harwood 's crime fiction ( JACK WAKES UP ) was his background as a graduate of the Iowa Writers ' Workshop . As explosive as JACK WAKES UP is with action , this collection of 15 stories is powerful with slow-burning emotion . I especially recommend `` What Happened to Everything , '' `` Rebuilding Men , '' `` Cherry Tree , '' and `` Walden '' .	1
Madeline did it again with this book beautiful story just like her other books another story that would make a great movie but once again exactly to the book otherwise the stories would be destroyed keep the native american romances coming cant get enough of them	1
I loved this story . I am a fan of Native American love stories and this one did not disappoint . The characters are likable and I really enjoyed the love plot . The cover of the book was also a plus !	1
Each time I read books like this I think it 's the best one ever . I was awed by the characters and my heart went out to them all . I know what it is to suffer , to lose a child , to lose the lice of your life , then be reunited 8 yrs later , enjoying 39 wonderful , complex years together . I loved this book . Job well done Madeline .	1
I enjoyed the story of Annabelle and Mike because it was a role reversal of the usual romance stories or worse , the romantic comedy movies where the gal wants a relationship and the guy has commitment issues . In this story , when Annabelle and Mike finally get together after having erotic dreams about each other for months , Mike is the one who wants a long term loving relationship and Annabelle is the one who does n't want to commit to it.That part of Annabelle is believable as is the fact that she had only one prior relationship . The only part about her that seems far fetched to me is her fear of letting anyone in the small town know that she and Mike are a couple . If she really does want him , would n't she want EVERYONE to know ? As for Mike , I thought it a little different that he wanted a committed relationship from only erotic fantasies . But ... they actually helped this story because the reader will be cheering them on hoping that they can be that loving couple.The sex scenes are not too graphic but certainly hot . It really feels more like `` making love '' than `` sex '' or that other word . Another aspect of the book that makes this very romantic . An enjoyable read .	1

Forty , divorced and in mad need of a night of pure unadulterated pleasure Callie Jones , with the prodding of a close friend , decides to take a chance . When she mistakenly receives an email inviting her to a Halloween party sure to be brimming with hot young studs Callie decides against her better judgment to attend . A one night stand with a stranger is just what she needs , someone hot , virile and a little bit rough . Kean Phelan an alpha male to his pack knows he needs to settle down but a night with some human escorts will help knock off the edge that comes with the full moon . He does n't expect to find his mate at the party and he 's willing to kill if that 's what it will take to keep Callie safe.Sometimes I 'm in the mood for a story that is light , sexy but still a bit gritty . All Lycan 's Eve was just what I needed on a wet , dreary fall day . Callie and I must be soul sisters considering the closeness in age and the dire need of a big O. LOL ; All jokes aside KyAnn Waters wrote a story that was fun but still dramatic . The coming together of Callie and Kean was animalistic ( no pun intended ) and the chaos that came with their mating added plenty of enduring thrills . I look forward to seeing if Mrs . Waters will continue the sexual exploits of this randy pack because I can only imagine what a hand full Callie 's friend will turn out to be and she so deserves her own story.IndyReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
This book was good and I 'm not usually into younger man older women , but this book did it for me ! I would totally recommend this book to anyone . I ca n't wait to get more of her books to reads .	1
Both primary and secondary characters ring true through Danes usual intelligent yet accessible dialog . Certainly worth the time for fans of the genre .	1
I actually read the 2nd book in this series several years ago . This book was a little harder to read at first due to the sentence structure . The story was very good but I took one star off due to some missed words , misspelled words , a couple of words used that when looked up did n't even match any description in The American or UK Dictionary . ( Totally out of context ) That being said once I got past that this is a good book , interesting , sexy , erotic book . I Know that I will save this book and reread it again . I would love to see another book from this series and I would definitely buy it . For 7.99I would appreciate Ms. Dane giving this book to an editor !	1
If Jessamyn Carroll had only herself to consider , staying in Pennsylvania after her husband 's death would have been a no-brainer . Her vindictive in-laws ' efforts to get their hooks into her infant son , however , force her to flee to a new home . Konigsburg , Texas.Peace ... at least for now . She 's even found a way to make some extra money , looking after sexy accountant Lars Toleffson 's precocious two-year-old daughter . She finds it easy -- too easy -- to let his protective presence lull her into thinking she and her son are safe at last.Lars , still wounded from enduring a nasty divorce from his cheating ex-wife , tries to fight his attraction to the mysterious , beautiful widow . But when an intruder breaks into her place , and Jess comes clean about her past , all bets are off . Someone wants her baby -- and wants Jess out of the picture . Permanently.Now Jess has a live-in bodyguard , whether she wants him or not . Except she does want him -- and he wants her . Yet negotiating a future together will have to overcome a lot of roadblocks : babies , puppies , the entire , meddling Toleffson family -- and a kidnapper.Warning : Contains Konigsburg craziness , creepy in-laws , a conniving two-year-old , a lovelorn accountant , a sleep-deprived Web developer , and lots of hot holiday sex . ( from goodreads ) This one could possibly be my favorite ! I do n't know if it was Jess , Lars or Daisy ... or even Jack who brought it all together for me , but this novel was great ! Jess is trying to hide from her crazy mother-in-law in the sleepy town of Konigsburg , Texas all the while the Toleffson 's have other plans for her . Daisy ( Lars ' two year old daughter ) adds to the mix and proves her intelligence on many levels . I love the interaction of Daisy and Jack and can relate to that innate sense of curiosity because of my daughter.Benjamin has done a great job of pulling Lars out of his slump and giving him a happy ending ( after his psycho ex-wife tried to ruin him by pawing their daughter ) with Jess and Jack . I love that there is such symmetry in all of the stories as well . We still know about the other characters and their lives , but only just enough that it does n't take over the main story . Benjamin also does a great job of setting up the next book for us by incorporating Erik just a little bit more and peaking our curiosity for him . I ca n't wait until July when we get to see more of him and find out what else has been going on in Konigsburg , Texas !	1
~* 3.5 Stars *~Jessamyn Carroll fled Pennsylvania with her infant son when her rich and powerful mother-in-law made it clear that she was expected to bring the baby into the family fold ... a fold that Jess 's deceased husband had escaped years before he 'd met and married Jessamyn . Mommy dearest will stop at nothing to get her grandson back - absolutely nothing , and Jess has taken refuge under her maiden name in Konigsburg , careful to keep her whereabouts a secret from the long reach of her mother-in-law . But making ends meet is tough for any single mother . More so when she 's got to keep her head down and watch out for any potential threat.Lars Toleffson is glad he moved down to Konigsburg after his two brothers , Cal and Pete , who are now both married and living happy lives with his new sisters-in-law . He 's got willing baby sitters every time he turns around , but the stress of being a single father combined with his two year old daughter 's ... precocious nature ( and the Mississippi is a small stream ) is wearing on him . Now that his daughter 's daily caretaker is moving , he 's got to find someone else to watch her every day . Taking out an add in the paper for a new caretaker brings Jessamyn Carroll to his office.The pretty Jess stirs Lars ' juices , but a horrendous previous marriage and debilitating divorce keeps him firmly hands-off . Jess is as pretty as new sin and great as a caretaker , but his juices are just going to have stew for a little longer . At least until a stranger asking odd questions shows up in a town that does n't feel too warmly about strangers and less so about presumptuous questions just before Jess ' home gets broken into - twice - and she gets assaulted by the perpetrator . Before Lars even realizes it , protective instincts he had n't counted on heat those stewing juices to a boiling point.Welcome back to Konigsburg , Texas , tourist mecca and home to lots of quirky characters just a bit off from center . Since the Toleffson brothers showed up it 's been one wild romance after another - and a true treat for happy readers everywhere . With each book , Benjamin has broadened and deepened the world of Konigsburg and the characters who populate it , improving stylistically with each turn . From a technical standpoint , I think Be My Baby is the most well rounded and developed of all the books , with a detailed plot , appealing , endearing characters , a steady , flowing narrative , and realistic dialogue , thoughVenus in Blue Jeans : Konigsburg , Texas Book 1still wins my vote for the highest level of quirky character fun and humor.The most serious of the first three books , Jess and Lars both have pasts that have scarred their hearts and impacted their daily lives , and tragedy has struck Jess in particular very deeply . The humor is more subtle and intermittent than in the previous books , though Konigsburg 's finest still shine bright . Overall , the story maintains a nice balance between humor and suspense , and there are far fewer gaps in plot , timing , and transition than in the previous books in the series . I did , however , feel the ending was too slick and quickly wrapped up , with all the secondary plots threads getting tied off too cleanly . Lars ' ex-wife Sherice , for example , went from being a plot thread to a footnote with jarring abruptness given the way that thread had developed . It was exceptionally anticlimactic , especially as I was hoping to finally see her get what she so richly deserves.Still , I think Be My Baby is the most technically and stylistically well written and developed . Even with that , though , it 's not my favorite of the Konigsburg books , for strictly subjective and personal preference-based reasons . In the end , I just was n't as fond of Lars as I was of Cal and did n't think he had quite the scope of development through the story arc of book that Pete had in his . I liked him , but there just was n't much about him that made his character really stand out for me . I felt similarly of Jess , but had the added problem of questioning her intelligence and logic in more than a few places . Maybe that 's not something I should blame Jess for , but when she repeatedly turned down a safer haven closer to town because of her primary job and the promise she made to the vacationing owner , but contemplates just up and leaving town entirely when she fears her mother-in-law is closing in , I questioned her decision making . You ca n't move into town because of prior commitments ... but leaving town is fine ? That issue in particular seemed too much like author 's choice to get the plot to a certain point , instead of organic character action . I also had a problem with the development of the romance between Lars and Jess . I read of their growing affection for each other and their hot little lust moments , but I never really felt there was any real fire behind it . I could n't get fully on board with the romantic aspects of the relationship because of it.I also had sort of an odd problem with Lars ' daughter , Daisy . I freely admit that I have no kids and almost no experience with two-year-olds , but her dialogue and actions seemed to me to be advanced beyond her age and it kept tripping me up when she was in a scene . I could be totally off base with the cognitive and verbal abilities of a toddler , or she could be an atypical child , I know and acknowledge that . But even so , as I was reading , the issues I had distracted me when she was in the scene.For those reasons , Be My Baby was n't my favorite in the series , even though I recognize it 's a more complete and balanced book with a more fully formed and realized plot . What has n't changed , though , is my appreciation for Benjamin 's Konigsburg , Texas series as a whole and my anticipated delight in reading the story of the final , and for me the most intriguing of the Toleffson brothers , Erik . Going hand in hand with the continuing improvement of the series , Erik is the most damaged and layered of all the brothers and the juxtaposition of those two things provide tremendous potential for a meaty , fun book . I ca n't wait to read his story inLong Time Gone : Konigsburg , Texas Book 4.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another .	1
Honestly I was unsure if I would enjoy this book . I really enjoy Jayne Rylon 's other work and the Powertools series has been on my recommendations for months now . I was very pleased and purchased all the remaining books in the series . Yes , it 's not realistic , but I read to escape reality so this was my cup of tea . It 's a fast , hot read.I actually enjoy the fact that the story begins with Kate already attracted to Mike and his crew . Love the male/male action . Mike and Kate watching the guys go at it was highly arousing.Some reviewers have said the sex scenes were confusing , but honestly the author did a fantastic job considering all the hands and mouths and other parts involved . I enjoyed how open Mike was and how he put Kate at ease . Recommended .	1
While I understand some of the lower star reviews about character development it has to be said ha this is just the first book in a series . The following books expand on the characters and you get to know all of them intimately ( pun intended ) .This book does have some m/m/m/m action but this needs to be there for the later books to make sense . But if this puts you off read the next book with Morgan and Joe . Each book is stand alone and can be read individually but you may want to read them in order so that you can see how all the characters relationship with each other and & # 34 ; the crew & # 34 ; develop into a working relationship.The love and & # 34 ; family & # 34 ; they all make is not the & # 34 ; norm & # 34 ; but you will see how they all love each other and if IOU let herself forget societies ideas go you will love the series .	1
I have loved reading all of Jayne Rylon 's books and this one did not dissapoint.The character of Kate is very understandable from a reader 's perspective and let 's just say that the `` Crew '' did not dissapoint . The book is hot and so is the action in this book !	1
If you want a hot read , with great characters and some steamy sex scenes , whoo boy , this is the one for you.Mike 's willingness to let Kate live out her fantasy was fantastic . I loved their interaction and the other guys were just so sweet . They need their own stories too !	1
I really enjoyed reading this book . Marco was super HOT . The love story between Marco and Carly was original and kept you wanting more . This book is well worth the money .

Anne Parker and Pete Crenshaw have known each other a long time . Pete 's been a good friend to Anne since her husband Brad walked out on her when she was pregnant with their son . Brad 's back and Pete knows something is wrong with his sudden appearance . Pete 's staking his claim on his woman . He wo n't let anything happen to her now that he finally has her where he wants her.Pete is a little Neanderthal when it comes to his romantic relationship with Anne . He storms the gates and takes over telling Anne that they are meant to be . It 's very sexy . Anne is nervous and unsure , but Pete is very convincing . He 's exactly the kind of man she needs . He 's very good with her baby too . It 's a lethal combination . Anne 's reluctance and anxiety about all of the changes she 's facing are unnerving and understandable . Undercover Lover is short , sweet , and hot.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I know there have been countless movies on this subject . Yet , the dialog the goes on between the two main characters is beyond funny . I was laughing out loud to the point I had to read it to my husband then he would crack up too . It is a fun holiday short story . I know you will love it too .	1

Chloe works for a software firm in a job thats going nowhere dispite her being so talented.She goes to a bar to ponder her situation over lots of vodka and winds up having a one night stand with the man of her dreams ( literally ) .She is totally shocked when her one night stand turns out to be Sean Keller , the man who is taking over the company she works for.I liked the story all the way until almost the end of the book.I was okay with Chloe being so weak for Sean.But I felt she let him off the hook and took him back wayyy to easy . And he really did her wrong.he should have had to suffer a little more.Over all its a pretty decent story .	1
Although it was very erotic I did like the connection the two main characters were able to make . This is definitely a keeper even though it did n't have the typical HEA that I tend to look forward to . Great job ... .instant fan ... ... wish the author would write more .	1
At first glance , I was n't sure how I would rate this book . I could n't pinpoint why I did n't love it , or what bothered me about it . Something just felt off , unrealistic or unbelievable . I 'm still not entirely sure that I can verbalize it . The love the main characters feel for each other is well documented ; Cree , Jake and Jenny seem to be made for each other . However , I do n't think that love alone would get someone over the trauma that Jenny went through before her guys got her out of the hospital . She had only one nightmare and needed no counseling ? I think one other aspect of this relationship that felt unbelievable was the unquestioned acceptance of their military team buddies . For a bunch of macho SEALs , these guys just accept Jake and Cree as a couple and accept them in a threesome with Jenny without question . No do n't ask , do n't tell controversies ? Not that I want to promote that kind of attitude , mind you , it is just never an issue . Maybe I 'm expecting too much character development in an erotica story.The plot is well written , the characters are interesting if not too complex , and the sex is very hot . The bad guy is a real whack job , and his evil adds tension to the story . The characters get a nice happily ever after . Since the series continues , the other friends get their stories and happily ever afters also , I assume , and since they seemed like really nice guys , they deserve it.Heat factor hot .	1
Carol Lynne Fan , have read all of her books at least twice . This is one of her first written and she has grown so much as an author .	1
Sommer is going to make a giant change in her life . She has decided to start her own catering company , and has refused all help from her family and friends . She wants to do this all on her own and to make sure of that she wo n't even take jobs from her families firm ; which would have guaranteed instant success . Prior to opening she goes with her best friend to a psychic reading and the Ace of Pentacles is the tarot card that comes up . While Sommer does not believe in what the cards are saying , her friend does . She decides to take the advice of her friend and begins looking for a potential lover . Too bad there is only one man that she would ever consider for that role , Caleb . But , Caleb is a love 'em and leave 'em type of a guy and has been her confident and friend for years . Too bad he has also been the man who has held the starring role in all of her nighttime dreams , the son of her Godfather and in some ways a big brother.Caleb has wanted Sommer for years but has bided his time until he feels that she is ready to accept him . This is one large hurdle for him to overcome as he is the `` Alpha in waiting '' and she is human . As the adopted daughter of the pack Beta she knows what Caleb is , will she accept that he is in love with her ? More importantly will she let him take on the role of her `` lover '' for a lifetime , no matter what the pack thinks ? Caleb 's Woman is a wonderful story about love , adoption , acceptance and determination , all rolled into one fast paced erotic offering . I liked how Ms. Vaughn gave us a bit of the background as to how Sommer came to be living among the Wulfen , or as some may joke , raised by wolves . I also thought she did the story justice by not making the characters go after each other when they were younger , but to let them both mature to know what they want . I thoroughly enjoyed the lessons that Ms. Vaughn wove into the story about how over protective parents can sometimes seem suffocating . I think Caleb 's Woman is a solid addition to the Torrid Tarot series.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1

Description : Best friends and ad execs , Mya and Milo , are fierce competitors in the boardroom , but they 're both nursing secret crushes on each other . Can they change their status from friends to lovers without losing their hearts ? The Good : This was a blazing hot , sweet , and funny read . Mya and Milo have serious chemistry between the sheets and in the office . I liked that they were at equal levels in their careers and that their jobs figured so heavily into their love story . I also liked that their lack of communication was fear-based as opposed to convenient-plot-based . And there was a great speech at the end that reminded me that a hot story can be romantic and touching as well . This was a tightly-plotted , well-structured read with excellent dialogue , fun situations , and really likeable characters . Definitely worth the $ 1.49.The Bad : Giving your H/H names that start with the same letter is always risky . Giving them names that start with same sound ? -- do n't do that.The Naughty : Erotic .

The thing I like most about Minx Malone 's `` Beg for It '' is how she creates two characters of equal standing . Now I quite enjoy an alpha-male , but sometimes it 's refreshing to read a story where female characters are n't somehow , in some way , subservient . It goes to show there does n't have to be such disparity in social status , etc . to create tension or develop plot . I also like how the characters ( Mya and Milo ) have worked together previously . Their five-year friendship lends the plot credibility , and offers a basis from which their sexual relationship can grow . The dialogue , on the whole , is sharp and witty . The characters are multi-dimensional , the sex scenes steamy.My one criticism concerns how Malone handles her characters ' doubts and insecurities towards their burgeoning love affair . ( This criticism is n't directed solely at Malone 's work but at the genre in general . ) For some reason , romance writers disperse this one piece of information repeatedly . In `` Beg for It '' , Milo is a ` player ' with a never-ending stream of buxom , blond beauties . This leaves Mya questioning her own worthiness , as well as Milo 's true intentions towards her and their future . Yes , as a reader , I need to know the story 's major complication ( s ) and the characters ' internal thoughts . Yes , as the author , Malone needs to communicate this effectively . But do we need to be told this over and over and over again ? I do n't think so . I get it the first time , and I 'm fairly certain lots of other readers do , too.Having said this , I totally recommend Malone 's novel . My grievances are minor and Malone 's work is worthy of our appreciation .	1
This was damn near everything that I needed it to be . The problem was that it was too short . Beg for It had everything it needed to be a full length novel , if the author were interested in investing a little more time on plot development . A huge chunk of the e-book is all sex , hot sex , but all sex . Still , I thought Malone did a good job of incorporating plenty of heart . Because of the length the novel felt a little rushed in throwing our hero and heroine together . They 've got plenty of back history but we do n't really get to experience too much of it because of the novella 's brevity.Mya Taylor is in love with her best friend , Milo Hamilton . A hastily made bet on who will get the new account at the ad agency they work for leads to a long , hot weekend during which they admit to wanting more than to be just best buddies . Only , of course , a random willowy , blonde shows up at the door and our short , dark , curvy heroine gets the wrong idea and goes home to pout . What little is left of the novella is spent getting these too wacky kids back together ( which turns out to be surprisingly painless ) .Malone is a strong writer , and unlike much of the other offerings in this category that I 've read of late , this was a well-written , solidly edited short . There were some things that I did n't care for , like some of the hero 's more cave man actions and the heroine 's limp pining , but overall it was a good read . The other thing that I did n't like was the oblique to non-existent references to our heroine 's ethnicity . She 's described as having loads of curls and with skin from caramel to cinnamon . Now , there 's a lot of distance between caramel and cinnamon . I , for one , like the cinnamon reference better . The cover is the only absolute description of the heroine as African-American.I 've been reading a lot of self-published Amazon novellas with interracial couples at the heart . Most of them are throw always , but the ones that I really do like highlight the differences between the couples . Sadly , for all that it 's better written than most of them , Malone 's story lacks that component .	1
All I can say is wow ! Milo and Mya lit the pages on fire . The saying is friends make the best lovers and that rings true for these two . From their competitive rivalry in the boardroom for the Lavin presentation , to their steamy love scenes these two just could n't get enough of each other . I know this series is a few years old , and I am so mad I never came across it before today . Looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series , it looks like they are all scorching . I 'm going to have to add Minx Malone to my list of fav authors .	1
Brace yourself for a very hot ride between these 2 co-workers who finally take their mutual attraction for each other to the other level ! The novel itself is relatively short ( i read it in 8 hours ) ... but it packs a very powerful punch . Loved the ending banter between the other office co-workers . Eagerly hoping there is a part 2 as I loved Mya and Milo together !	1

I was n't sure about this book the cover threw me off . The man on the cover looks blond but Tristen is described as having Inky black hair . Anyway the story was light and fun to read .

Great short story about menage sex and a lot of sexual exploring by a couple . OK , so you need to just suspend your disbelief immediately since the premise is that Hake , who has been disabled by an accident , asks his cousin and his cousin 's employee , to have wild sex with his wife to make up for the fact that she has n't been getting any lately . Or at least , not getting anything wild and hot from Hake since his accident.So Hake has no issues with watching two other men have sex with his wife , and she is all for it . And that sets the premise for an afternoon and evening of really hot sex . Be warned that there 's a little rough sex and faux forced seduction sex . There is also MM sex involved for those who are not interested in that .	1
Before I say anything , I will say that I am a bit of a book snob in that I 'm very particular about the types of books I really enjoy reading . That being said , I enjoyed this book . I read it in one sitting the other day and while there were a few parts I think I would have enjoyed had they happened a tiny bit differently , I was not disappointed at all . I would definitely recommend this book if you 're looking for a quick read that will keep you interested when you 're looking for a way to pass an afternoon . I would read it again for sure and will probably be looking for more things from this author soon ! : )	1

What she did n't know or understand was just how much Lynx really wanted her and what lengths he was willing to go to have her . Charlie 's Bargain was a novel of discovery and I loved every word.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
Whew , this book had some DETAILs going on with it ! I wo n't give anything away but the scene in the alley behind the bar ... . I will say that this book was very graphic and some readers may be turned off by that . I liked Xorn and I came to like Charlie . The ex boyfriend was somewhat of a stereotype but overall it was an enjoyable read . However , it is not for the faint of heart or those turned off by detailed descriptions of intimate relations .	1
I have to say that EA is one of the most imaginative authors I have ever read , how does she think up this stuff ? But I did enjoy the book , sort of a beauty and the beast at its most kinky-fied alien best . For all the embarrassingly steamy and erotic moments that EA can write , I still appreciate that she can write a good book that entertains me . I do n't think it would be an EA book without my having to roll my eyes and face-palm every now and then .	1
This was my first book by the author , and I was very happy with it . Her writing style flows well , and is neither too heavy nor too light . She had a wonderful sense of humor and snark that had me laughing and smiling through out the book.The heroine is an 'every woman ' in that she could be any one of us and at any age . The hero , Will , is ( and to steal from a previous reviewer ) just a great alpha-nerd . Being in science those types of guys have always appealed to me . The author does a great job with his personality ; he has the right combinations of smarts , social insecurities , and 'yum factor'.I loved the parts where they H/h stalk each other . Everyone has done it- broken the speed record to be able to seemingly bump into someone or make sure that a coincidence did n't seem too contrived.A very pleasurable read and I look forward to reading more from this author !	1
Being honest here . Thought the book was great . Yes , William and Jenny had great connection . This book does a good job in describing and having a connection between the two of them- as far as dialogue , and sharing emotion . Not just hot scenes ( although , there is that ! ) Oh , note please- there was , in my opinion- some anal play/stimulation mentioned in this book . Again , HOT .	1
It kept me hooked from page 1 till the end . Steamy scenes , great plot , and very romantic . love all her books	1
The civil war was hard on all sides , but mainly the poor widowed women left behind . That is the preface of this story and how two people come together fighting their own demons and end up falling in love . It is an enjoyable read .	1
what can i say , i knew it was short , but i did n't know it would be so good . it starts and ends in one evening at the desperate and dateless ball . H meets h , who is working security at the party . they share a mind bond as well as a lustful one , leave and have perfect soul circle sex.the story itself ended in a good place.i am guessing this is a lead in to a series of books about some vampires . they only suck a little blood occasionally , feeding mostly off emotions , although not a lot of time was put into describing this setting.the writing was of professional quality , formatting good , and i will be keeping an eye out for the follow up books . it was that good ... but definitely left me wanting more !	1
Vicci is working as security at the Vampire Desperate and Dateless Ball , where Vampires look for the one to complete their soul circle with ( think mates ) . With no interest in Vampires , she is shocked to feel the connection she does with the sexy vampire who has approached her . Prince Vladmir only attended the ball to keep tabs on fellow vamps , but he never expected to find the one woman who could complete his soul circle . Can he keep his control together long enough to seduce Vicci ? This was pretty hot , and it gave me what I love and is hard to accomplish in short stories : anticipation . While this does occur over the space of one night , it 's there and it was awesome . I also was n't bothered by the fast progression of the romance , as the paranormal aspects make it work . The characters are likable even if they do n't get too deep , the sex scene was well done , this is well written , paced nicely , and just a well rounded story.I really enjoyed this and would recommend it .	1
I thought this was a well written fun adventure . I 'm anxious to read other books by this author especially after reading about her . Serious Erotica for sure . Good plot . I think the female character needed more dialogue , but I got through it.Wished the guys did n't call her the specific pet names they used . But I liked how they were gentle and caring with her through everything they did to her.. lolPretty sappy ending , but heck , happy ever after works for me .	1
This is a hot book . Lauren is just looking to blow off a little steam one night drinking with her girlfriend little did she know that night would lead to one rockin hot night with two men that can make her melt with just a look . If you are looking for a book to definitely heat up your night or day or whenever you read it this is it . Well written great story line , and characters are definitely believable	1
I enjoyed this book ! ! I thought it was well written & I feel Ashlyn Chase is an AMAZING author ! ! If your looking for a good book with a great price you wont go wrong here ! ! Since I dont believe in adding spoilers or just quoting the book I 'll leave that up to you to decide ! ! I however really liked this book ! !	1
I loved this story . The girl in this book is funny . Rooms speak to her . Read the book you 'll know what I mean .	1
What a great story ! ! Ellis is super quirky and fun . Simon just can not resist her . Very well written and engaging story . Did not get steamy until the end but when it did , boy howdy ! ! ! Loved it and hope to see more from this author in the future ! ! !	1
My only issue with this short is the fact that he is her `` patient '' , the thought that a mental health professional gives into lust with her patient makes my stomach queasy . Once I put that portion out of my mind , I could appreciate the erotic scenes.Ross inherited certain alien genes from an experiment between human and Laetez scientists performed on his father . While the experiment enhanced his father , they caused hyper aggression and strength in Ross , which led him to a violent life of crime . Thyme is a counselor at Bane prison which houses only prisoners like Ross , maladjusted offspring of the original experiment subjects . Luckily with counseling and some drug therapy Ross has learned to control his behavior and is now being released . As part of his release he has taken a job as a manager of a space station , where he will live alone for 3 years . Meanwhile Thyme who had developed feelings for Ross , decided to try and meet Ross in the real world . Since he has never seen her face or even heard her real voice during the counseling sessions she has to be inventive as to how they can meet on a one man station . Then starts the passion.As stated in the beginning I have an issue with a doctor/patient relationship , especially one that has lasted for more than 4 years . However , when I ignored that issue , I found the story to be well written . The story line was plausible ( in a sci fi setting ) and the sex scenes produced that lovely little zing . Even though this is mainly a piece of erotica it also contained an interesting universe and several non sex related scenes which were written quite well and helped develop the relationship between Ross and Thyme.If you like erotica , I can recommend this story . FYI the language tends to the dirty talk type and it also contains mild anal play scenes .	1
I thought this book held my attention and it was written well . I thought of this book the day after reading it and read it again !	1
This is the first book I read by Kate Reus . I finished reading the book in a few hours . It had good storyline & I loved the hot & steamy scenes . I loved how Trent protected Sage even though she tried to push him away . I felt really bad for Sage for the trauma she was going through . I also felt Sage was being to stubborn to Trent when he was helping her . I would definitely read more books by this author .	1
I enjoyed Deadly Deceptions . However , I could not grade it higher because it did not have enough a story line , or enough plot . It left me somewhat expecting more to come .	1
Long ago a sorcerer cursed Kirill the Dragon with the affliction of impotence , something he refused to discuss with others of his kind . Now , hope comes in the form of a Drui female mated to Xanthus , his heir.Shy and introverted Jazzlyn McCabe has gathered the courage to beg a favor from a lady she barely knows . The owner of Inner Magick is Aislinn and she offered Jazzlyn help should she need it when they met at a gem mart months ago.Kirill has come to the world dominated by humans to find his mate who he glimpsed ages past in a mirror . Jazzlyn asks Aislinn to help locate her missing cousin Caro , but what Jazzlyn gets is the man she saw in a mirror at Inner Magick . It is time for Kirill to introduce Jazzlyn to true magic and her mate , him.Dragon Mate is the latest sensual treat in the Supernatural Bonds series by talented author Jory Strong . This is a stand alone story but fans of the series will remember characters from earlier tales . Dragon Mate is entertaining and sexy although Jazzlyn 's responses do n't always seem real . For someone with no previous knowledge of magic she seems too easily accepting , taking it all in stride with barely a squawk or real appreciation . I 've loved this series since the beginning and while Dragon Mate is definitely enjoyable there is just something that does n't ring true with the heroine 's reactions to the unimaginable.LisaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
I 'll admit that I struggled through the beginning of teh book . This is probably why I am not the biggest fan of backstory 's in a book . It ends up being a boring information dump . But it was a dump that Lena Matthews quickly dug herself out of it . What I do like about this story is that Shane and Paige have a believable chemistry . I am a firm believer in no relationship do-overs but after reading this story , there might be an upside to second chances .	1
I loved the idea of magic and read the whole book in one sitting . The romance was fun and sexy - ca n't wait for the next installment .	1
The story line is simple and it 's nicely written . It only took about an hour and a half for me to read it . I wish they 'd take that Blush tagline off of their products . I do n't choose a book for whether it has graphic scenes or not and for some reason , when I read that tagline , I always feel like the story is defective or a quick short story and not one of their better works . This actually was one of Ellora 's better stories.Possible spoilers from this point forward.Damien is a nice mage . He lives a good life as a Viscount and he 's happily living in obscurity until he comes across a young lady of 15 years , walking to her death into the tide . He rescues her , sends her off to a school for young ladies and then when she 's 18 and beyond the legal reaches of her guardian , brings her home to live with him and his sister . The only part of the story I did n't get was that there were a lot of rumors about the evil Baron , who raped Toria and how her father failed to notice these rumors or protect her from them and even made the Baron her legal guardian . Even while trying to guard her reputation , it seems like the Viscount could have had enough information to have the Baron arrested for other reasons and safely jailed or executed or whatever . But he manages to be a threat throughout the entire story and I think even if he had never been introduced into the story , he was definitely a villain in Toria 's mind.There were some side characters that were interesting as well and it would be nice to see their stories as well . Not deep literature , but definitely served it 's purpose of entertainment and an escape from reality .	1
Jeweled magic ... Meet Meredith whose fianc & eacute ; has just proven how much of a jerk he is .

Can I just say I adore anything by Desiree Holt ? Emerald Green did not disappoint . Fun and sexy , this book left me with a craving for fudge . And handsome strangers !	1
most short stories that are from are just so so , but this one was AWESOME ! ! ! could not put down till i was done !	1
Very hot sex . Well written . Too short . Kept my interest . Wish the emerald legends were true . Interesting reading . Lots of sand at the beach though .	1
Oh . My . God.With `` The Ride '' , this is probably the best short story I 've read in the last monthes . It 's scorching hot , incredibly sexy and yes , very arousing.Meredith is taking a break from men at her Gran 's bed & breakfast ; after she caught her fianc & eacute ; e in bed with other women ( two at once , apparently ) . After a couple of days , she is strolling the market when she meets a very sexy stranger , Connor . Connor buys her an emerald pendant . The jewel apparently has very special properties , which they ca n't wait to test.I do n't want to give away anything , so I 'll let you enjoy this story and get yourself lulle by Desiree Holt . It 's definitely worth it .	1
This is the first short read story I have read that did n't feel like it left me hanging for something else . Good book	1
At this time this is the last book in the series . For me each book in the series is a 5 .	1
Book seven by Lora Leigh was a very good book all of my friends abound read it they need to read the whole series	1
Allie 's life was at a standstill before she made the decision to leave town and accept employment with her father 's friend Griffin . While her love for Charlie might have induced her to stay , the knowledge that she 'd never travel and see the world if she did so made her decision a simple one . Throw in Charlie 's best friend Alex 's confession to Allie that he 's also in love with Charlie and the whole situation could get complicated fast and she simply is n't prepared for that sort of drama.Charlie and Alex are best friends and that 's not going to change but there are complications . For one thing Alex is in love with Charlie , but he 's also in love with Allie and he readily accepts that they could form a happy trio . Charlie has no clue that Alex is bi-sexual and he 's completely stunned that Alex and Allie seem to share some secret that he is n't privy to - it 's a bit daunting but since Allie left town to go on her grand adventure with a much older man ( yeah , Charlie 's just thrilled about that one ! ) , he has years to prepare for when she returns home and is ready to settle down.Six years later she returns , older , wiser and more prepared to accept the dynamics of the relationship that could be possible if she can convince Charlie and Alex to explore their feelings with her . All those years of pent of desire and frustration cumulate into a series of intimate moments that leave the men bewildered and uncertain about their future . For Alex and Allie the relationship between the three of them is sheer bliss but Charlie is struggling with not just the idea of sharing Allie but also his romantic feelings for Alex . Alex has had years to come to grips with his bi-sexuality but this is all new to Charlie . Can Allie and Alex convince Charlie that he does n't have to give up his dream of marriage , a white picket fence , kids and a dog - he just needs to alter it a little bit to include Alex.EVERYTHING NICE by Mari Carr is nothing short of a fun read . While I 'm used to the heroines being shy characters needing to be seduced into being naughty Allie thrives on adventure and her appetite for sexual escapades rivals any mans . Charlie and Alex are equally fascinating because their ideas about the sort of life they want are so similar yet so different - at least they were until Alex clues Charlie in on his long denied desire to test the boundaries of their affection for each other . Mari Carr does a brilliant job bringing these characters to life and making the story amusing while still instilling enough conflict that the reader eagerly devours each page waiting to find out what happens with this trio.Chrissy Dionne ( courtesy of Romance Junkies )	1
I really liked this follow up 'Sugar and Spice ' . As will all the Mari Carr books I 've had the pleasure of reading it is short , which is fine but I really feel like another chapter would have tightened the ending for the reader .	1
If you looking for and good book to read then buy this book . I think I have read almost everything this author has written .	1
Interesting to read . I enjoyed the story very much . Finding love where you can with who you can is awesome .	1
I liked this book because it was action packed and a romance . Caitlin had to come to her senses and forgive her husband Sean before she lost the only man she could ever love . The question being could she forgive his over protective nature and would he ever treat her like an equal . He was trying to protect her from the assassins that were after them but he had to kidnap her to get her to safety . She definitely was unreasonable when he was a policeman and knew what he was doing to protect her . She finally had no choice but comply . In the end he put her out of harms way which enabled her to come to his rescue . After some soul searching Caitlin realized she truly loved Sean and he was worth fighting for .	1
This story was short and sweet . Not as spicy as other reviews have argued , but not entirely tame . I was n't expecting much for 99 cents but I 'm glad I bought it . It 's a small glimpse into a story that 's been told many , many times . Do n't take it too seriously , just enjoy this quickie for what it is.Chemistry Between Main Characters : HotNumber of Love Scenes : 5+Sexual Content : Erotic ( tame , no BDSM/ rear door activity ) Overall Ratings/Comments : cute , short , worth reading ... 4 Stars	1
It took me few hours to finish this book . Its a hot & steamy story with not much of a storyline but I loved Sean & his wife as a couple . I also love how Sean fought to keep his wife .	1
For such a short story , Everything to Lose packed in quite a lot ! Sean & Caitlyn are a married couple , yet things are n't going quite so well . Sean suggested they get a divorce & said some hurtful things to Caitlyn when things got rough . Without looking back , Caitlyn left and one year later , she is back in town for Sean to sign divorce papers yet Sean does not want to . He knew he made a mistake by letting his wife walk out of his life , but now he is determined to make her see that they 're meant to be together & for her to stay permanently . But a killer from Sean 's past comes back to complicate things and he 'll do anything to keep her safe.Overall , I highly enjoyed Everything to Lose . For such a short story , I was surprised at how well-developed & fleshed out the characters were along with the plot and storyline . I 'm a sucker for second chance romances & this one did not disappoint . However , I would have loved for an epilogue , but the ending still left a smile on my face . With that said , I recommend Everything to Lose by Katie Reus for those looking for a sexy & fast romantic suspense to occupy their time .	1
i can not believe that this awesome book was so cheap . You can not go wrong if you decide to buy it . an easy , fun read .	1
Great introduction to a 'new-to-me ' series . I loved the unique spin on werewolf lore and their having elemental powers . The chemistry between these characters was compelling and very steamy . i particularly liked the heroine and her kindness as the new queen.If this were a full-length novel , I think i would feel more invested in the characters and I could see this being a 4.5 or 5 star for me . I will definitely read more in this series as this short was enough of a teaser to want to know where the author will take the story .	1
This is a book I have been truly waiting for . This book gave me a solid introduction to Talismans and the like , which is near essential to me as a Pagan . Recommended !	1
In order to understand this book , its better to read Eye of the Beholder first . Basically this is Neil and Cassie 's story a few years after Eye of the Beholder takes place . I loved that Neil got Cassie away by divorcing her , the entire story comes to light of how she came to him pregnant with another man 's child . Neil takes the child , a daughter , and makes her his very own . Another woman comes to him , someone who is decidedly small minded , but that is how she was raised , and is forced to stay with him when her husband dies . The lady in question was pregnant , but ended up having the baby on Neil 's farm and is staying there until other arrangements can be made . I loved Neil 's quiet acceptance of his reputation in town . He was known as a skirt chaser up until 5 years before meeting our heroine . A friendship blossoms between the two until circumstances catch up to them and they must marry . I liked this story . I highly recommend it for a light read , it has some heavy Christian overtones , but they 're more to provoke rather than inspire the plot .	1
Another great story about the people of Omaha , Nebraska . But , if you 've read the `` preceding '' books of the Nebraska series , do n't expect to read as much about the Larson 's , as only a couple of them make an appearance in this story and it 's brief , to say the least . However , it was nice to have a peek of Eliza 's ( South Dakota series ) previous life and how she came about to leave it , in this book.The story was made more believable by the fact that Neil and Sarah started off on a bad note , but became friends , before coming together in bed ( after marriage ) .The message of `` forgiving ones past transgressions '' is clear and the comical ending was a very nice touch . ***If you do n't want to read anything sexual , please go to the author 's website where you can learn the rating of her books , before you read them . There is no point in giving poor reviews , because you do n't want to see sexual content in a `` Christian Romance '' .	1
I really enjoyed reading this story . There were times I was close to crying , others I felt like laughing and those when I felt like cheering for the characters of this story . I enjoyed reading this book , I could have deleted the sexual content though , that was the only part of the story I did n't care for . That is the reason that I care more for christian romances more .	1
If i could i would give a 10 for this one.It was heartwarming , i cried and laughed , this book is the 2nd to the last i think.Isacc 's Decision is the last one i think which is the one i 'm starting now.The His Redeeming Bride ! ! i started in moring and wass done that evening . IT shows that someone that made bad choices can come out good..THIS IS A MUST READ ! ! ! !	1
i have now read a few books by this author and find them all good reads . You will enjoy the series	1
Book 8 : His Redeeming BrideNeil Craftman 's story is my favorite . He had married Cassie seven years ago after turning Mary away at the train station . Cassie was beautiful but ugly inside . Neil saw his error in not choosing Mary . Cassie wanted a divorce so she could marry a rich man but she left Emily , their little girl with Neil . She had never had the motherly instincts . Neil was known around town for visiting the saloons and soiled doves . The `` holy '' people stayed clear of him . Sarah Donner is in an unhappy marriage . Her husband is bringing her to his mothers to have her baby . On the way they are attacked and he is killed by the robbers . The only one to take her in and help her is Neil Craftman . As a good Christian who belonged to a church that preached from the pulpit to avoid Neil and used him as an example for sin , she was frightened to be in his home . This story shows Neil 's kind heart and how he changed . It shows how often people do n't allow others to change but judge them for what they use to be and definitely shows how Christians should NOT treat others . *Sexual situations within marriage .	1
I wo n't summarize the plot as this has been done by others . I will say-Solid writing , great price . This is a great story . For 99 cents-buy the book . It is a great story and for those of us who have read all there is to read by our favorite authors this is one that will introduce you to a new author .	1
Very sweet romance . Both Neil and Sarah had horrible first marriages and were able to find each other when Sarah 's husband was killed . They both deserved to find happiness .	1
I really loved this story about Sarah & Neil and everything they went through . So many things were against them but they worked everything out ! !	1
Once again , Rachel Myers becomes involved in a murder investigation . Although she never looks for victims and tries to lead a quiet life , the victims or their families always find Rachel . In this case , she was actually the person who found the victim 's body . I do n't want to say more about the plot because I do n't want to give anything away , other than the premise of this book could have been ripped from today 's headlines . What I can say is that , in the past , something has reached out and grabbed Rachel which leads her to the killer . This time , that did not happen and Rachel struggled to discover what really happened until , all of a sudden , things came together and made sense to her , leading her to the killer . I find Rachel to be a very likeable character and am always interested in learning more about her and her life . Apart from Rachel , her friends , and the crimes , the author beautifully describes the settings of her mysteries , such as the mountains , the trails , the rivers , the sunrises , the trees and their leaves , and a wide variety of flowers . I have never visited this part of our country , yet through these books , the author has given me a real feeling and vivid views which make me feel like I have been there . I just love these mysteries and will be deeply saddened if Ms. Jackson ever decides to end this series . I 've already started reading the next one .	1
I have read numerous shifter stories by Lori and this one did n't hold my attention like the others . It was a very good , just not of the same caliber of her others .	1
A joining of three species descended from one long gone ! Now to save two they must join . Imagine those we thought to be angels and demons were actually aliens . Two species that split from one . One that had visited Earth many times , mating with Earthlings . The original shape shifters . Jory Strong has introduced three new species to us and it was delicious . A fast paced story that captures the imagination , like a new love . A must read !	1
I have read several books from this author I 've found that her books are either love it or hate it.I 'm glad to say that I really liked this one.Troy is definitely Alpha but not overdone with it . He has his own issues about marriage and relationships ( he 's not ready for either ) and that certainly plays a part in the story.Angie is a plus sized chick who took an orgy cruise to nowhere with her friend in hopes to get laid . She 's very insecure about her weight and even more so when she notices that she 's most likely the only oversize woman on the cruise.Both are suprised by their attraction for each other but for different reasons.All in all I think this story was pretty well written . There was an actual story in between the sex scenes ... .which are super hot by the way.My only issue was how much Angie refered to her weight . I know she had issues with her size but she was so obsessed about it I started to get a little irritated with her .	1
This is the book that ruined me for all `` average '' romance novel about lithe super fabulous women who looked like a million bucks and get the man of their dreams , yeah , like that 's what the ideal woman looks like.After years of frustrating romance reading we have a burgeoning genre of BBW/Curvy romance authors that are striving to give the readers what we crave , a shred of realism amongst the fantasy ... that not all women are size 0-10 , and that a man can be just attracted to a `` curvy '' woman as he is to a reed thin super model.Fall From Troy is about a woman Angie who goes on a Cruise with her friend Corrie looking for romance , but what she comes to find out is she feels very out of place amongst the sexually liberated men and women on board the ship having the time of their lives in full view , she begins to compare her curvy body to the taut and tight bodies around her and feels insecure about how she looks.That is until she 's spotted by Troy Hunter , he sees the curvy brunette hiding behind a potted plant and he ca n't take his eyes off her , when she makes her leave , he finds himself following her and let 's just say that 's where the heat really gets turned up.We have the classic formula of our couple not believing that this is anymore than a weekend tryst , Troy believes his future is with a blond , willowly beauty that will be the mother of his children but as time goes by feelings begin to emerge and Troy ca n't get Angie off his mind.While there were a few moments in this book that I could have done with out ... I enjoyed this book so much that I 've been on the hunt for every BBW romance ever since and I 'm still going strong.Enjoyable book ... very hot and heavy so if your not into explicit love scenes , then this book is n't for you .	1
Super quick read with not a lot of substance but super hot scenes ! Imagine ... .being on a planet with too many sex crazed females ... .and not enough males to ga around ... .	1
If you want a book that will nearly singe your eyebrows off from the heated contents , this is it ! I wish there had been a little more character development/plot but the sex scenes ... OMG ! I really enjoyed this book . I would recommend it readers . Especially for those who like a MMF menage . Good job Ms. Matthews !	1
Thank you Lena . I loved this story . It 's great to live vicariously through your wonderful characters . I pretty much enjoy everything written by Lena Matthews .	1
Robin Hood is an offtold tale of the thief who stole from the rich to give to the poor . Here Robin is a princess of the realm who survived the assassination of her mother . She is raised by Friar Tuck in Sherwood Forrest and becomes a bandit . There is romance and adventure a plenty , and wonderful twists and turns to the plot . The characters are fun and believable . What more do you want ?	1
This is essential reading for any educated person . Josephus was a Jewish General who had a first hand view of events in Jerusalem during the Roman empire . There is no other history as good as this about that era . As well , he is one of the few historians who mentions Jesus , if I remember correctly .	1
Josephus is hard to follow but it 's worth the trouble to learn about all he has to say . It gives me lot 's to chew on .	1
An easy read if you like ancient history . Nice to have on your device when you need a break or are killing time waiting in line or at the airport .	1
Josephus is very hard to stay with and finish but for those interested in Jewish history it is a important and a must for your library , and for that reason I give it five stars .	1
Facinating reading , but it 's not for the faint of heart . This translation is much easier to read and understand than an earlier translated version of Josephus that I tried to read .	1
Like the history of the Jews wars and all the other history about the rulers in those days and what they were like . How hostile some of the rulers were and how the Jews finally ended up getting everything destroyed .	1
One of Jeff 's first books I read ... he has more , so check them out ! Absolutely fantastic ! Very engrossing , makes you stop and think . I can honestly say it made me change some of my views and thoughts . Very provoking reading . Give it a chance , you wo n't be sorry !	1
The book gets better . If you can make it past learning about the hero 's character , you very much enjoy the story line .	1
Remember when you were a kid and you went to the annual carnival ? You had a blast on the rides and won a few of the games -- and then someone handed you a cloud of melt-in-your-mouth spun sugar fluff that put a wide smile on your face . You never knew you could be so happy ! That 's how Healing Touch made me feel . I knew the male and female protagonist would eventually get together ( come on , it 's a romance ! & lt ; g > ) , but when they finally did my smile was a mile wide . I loved this novella , and I 'm sure you will , too . Buy it and get happy ! Donna Fasano author of : The Merry-Go-Round	1
I do n't normally read novellas because I did n't feel there was enough time for character development . I bought this one because of forum posts by the author and the price was definitely right.What a surprise ! I immediately understood the heroine , Tracey , her life , her feelings . Not only that , it was a fully developed story.I thoroughly enjoyed this book . It 's a great rainy day or beach read or anytime you just want to curl up with a good book for a couple of hours .	1
This third book of the trilogy does n't disappoint.More action ... rushing against a timetable to find a balance for the magic so that people are n't destroyed . Trying to bring all the different species to an accord , and keeping the magic balanced is a hard act , even for a Delver who has experienced many things and grown much.There are love stories mixed in with war and battles.The characters are still interesting and this world is still most believable . This book is a great finishing touch to a great story ! I highly recommend that anyone who likes a Fantasy ... read this Fantasy trilogy . It 's a great , epic story .	1
If you have read the first two books in the series , this makes a lot of sense , otherwise go back and read those first . Very enjoyable except for perhaps too much dialogue here and there , which sometimes becomes boring , especially where Enin is involved .	1
Great character development . The non humans were well thought out and they all meshed well into the story . I would reccomend this series to anyone who likes this genre . In fact I would reccomend any of the books I have rated to everyone who likes a good read .	1
Well , obviously I ca n't stop reading ... so guess I must admit that I am hooked . I have really enjoyed following the trials and tribulations of each character in this story .	1
I gave it 4 stars because it was a pretty good book , however it was my least favorite of the 3 . I did not like the character Enin at all , I found the character to be rigid and boring and the book was consumed with this character . Overall , I liked the story but did not like the elimination of some characters and the continuation of others .	1
I love this series , and even though I am a tight wad , I would gladly pay more for the rest of these . The author deserves much more praise then some of the other hacks that take way more money for their slush , and I wish more people knew about his work . However , I am sure Mr. Inlo does n't really care about the money , but rather more about producing excellent works for as many people to enjoy as possible .	1
Great plot and characters and twists and interesting ways of explaining the characteristics of the fantasy creatures . A little long on emotional details .	1
This book is the bait for the Delver Series . I really enjoy the fact ( having now read all the current Delver Magic books- can hardly wait for # 5 ) that each book is a story that stands alone . I love Jeff Inlo !	1
New characters , 5 races , a classic battle between good and evil and every kind of magic combine to delight the true fantasy fan .	1
I really enjoyed reading this book . I loved the characters , especially Ryson . I found the characters likable and the plot good . The writing was very descriptive and I found I was able to visualize what the author was trying to describe . The story flowed well and I did n't become bored or overwhelmed with the fantasy portions of the story . I look forward to the next book in the series .	1
I 'm now half way through the 1st Book of the `` Delver Magic '' series and LOVING it ! I will return and add more when I finish it ; but so far - so good.Jeff : Do NOT listen to the petty critics on here . You have the talent , and despite minor text typos and grammatical errors - the work is good.I especially enjoy the fact that like Lewis and Tolkein , you have the ability to tell a compelling story while keeping it clean . To many talented Authors nowadays who I would otherwise enjoy reading , have a nasty habit of peeing in their own talent pool , which makes it a `` No Swimming '' zone for me . Not having finished the book , I suppose I ought not to speak too soon.I look forward to returning to this review when I complete the book !	1
I read the 1st and loved it , read this one and loved it and will start reading the next one when I get home from work today . I love the different characters , races and magics associated with each one . The world is incredible . I never once lost interest , I wanted more !	1
I love to read Samantha Kane 's books - I have been a fan for many years . She writes historical & m/m steamy novels . Islands attracted me because of the story line & her dedication to her father . It also takes place during WWII . And , I loved the main characters Gabriel & Renee - I have read this 2 times & would love to read more books like this one altho I read all her books .	1
THIS BOOK WAS ACTUALLY GOOD . I 'D READ THE PREVIEWS WHILE SEARCHING THROUGH ELLORA 'S CAVE WEBSITE AND MOVED ON BECAUSE IT WAS A GAY STORYLINE . CAME BACK ONE NIGHT AND DECIDED TO GIVE IT A CHANCE AND I WAS N'T DISAPPOINTED . BOTH MAIN CHARACTERS KNEW THE RISKS INVOLVED IN GAY RELATIONS AND TOOK A HIDDEN CHANCE AT LOVE . THIS BOOK ACTUALLY HAS A REAL STORYLINE WRITTEN IN AN EROTIC MANNER AND IT 'S NOT EVEN ABOUT THE SEX BUT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TWO MEN . THIS WAS REALLY A GOOD READ .	1
Well crafted story of magic and magical settings . A human woman falls into the sensual and loving spell of a wizard coming into his powers just as they are challenged by a coven of witches.Full-length , stand-alone , and edited , the author delights with another world . Will read more from this author .	1
I have n't read an erotica book in a long time . This one was so indepth with the sex scenes , I could actually visualize them ! Definitely not an e-book for the weak and tame ! The story was okay , kind of rushed and could have added a few more chapters before ending as abruptly as it did , for instant , what happened between the two main characters ? Oh well , read it and enjoy !	1
This is one of my favorite erotic stories . I loved the characters and the setting . It was just such a magical story and SO SO sexy ! I 'm hoping she will one day write a sequel to it so we can find out what happens with the heroines sister . I 'm very curious about that.Reviewed this book for the author .	1
This was hot . I had to stop and fan myself a few times.I am a sucker for Highland romances but a Highland Werewolf romance ... ... ..BLISS ! And what can I say about Silas other than the fact that he was hot ! I love alpha male characters . But Silas was as gentle as he was strong . Martha did not have a particularly high view of herself . She thought she was a freak because she was an empath and she thought that she was unattractive because she was overweight . From minute one , Silas called her beautiful and showed her just how beautiful she was.The story was not filled with random sex . Ms. Carlysle wove a story of jealousy ( the witch who cursed him ) ; redemption ( Martha freeing Silas from the mirror ) ; conflict ( the wolves in Wolf Creek coming to attack them ) ; and surrender ( Martha agreeing to become a werewolf for Silas ) .It was an engaging and enjoyable read .	1
This book pretty much starts off smoking hot and does n't let up . Yes its pretty much love at first sight and sex within moments of meeting each other . But I was instantly interested in the book although the whole issue with the witch was way to easily solved . But thankfully there is another book to this series and I hope that we will have more of Silas and Martha .	1
This was a wonderful read and a very different shifter story . The hero is the heroine . Got to love that ! This story reads like a fairy tale , but leads to other stories that I am looking forward to reading !	1
this was a good book but it left you wondering what happened and if there were going to be more books to follow but good just the same	1
Action filled , passion filled with a funky twist . The fantasy of it all was intriguing to say the least . All in all a good read .	1
Leotine and Cyprian 's story is a great little novella . She is sent to kill him and ends up falling for him . Great new perspective , I just which they had their own full novel .	1
Wow hot sex and great story line . Was so happy that the sister ended up alright and Eva ended up being wanted and loved	1
This story actually seemed realistic which I like . They had a relationship that blossomed over time . Also not a lot of aganst and ridiculous/dramatic back and forth . These were to real people who fell in love , and had smoking hot sex ; )	1
I 've read a lot of erotic books , but this one is n't only about sex , sex , and more sex . This book has a great story line as well as a lot of great sex . It keeps you on your toes guessing what will happen next . Its a humorous book , I laughed through the whole trying . . One of the best books ive ever read ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
Great story . I loved the building relationship through email . I loved it when they got together in person . It was just a great falling-in-love story . Pretty hot , too . I wonder if there will be a follow-up with Wes and Jill ? Or maybe there already is ? As usual with a Mari Carr book , there 's also lots of humor .	1
A fun , suspend your beliefs , story about a kidnapping fantasy with some BDSM elements . I liked the main character - although she did continuously moan about her size . I also thought she should grow up and stop getting her sister out of jams - if she 'd stop helping her I think her sister would n't be so bad . Enabling ! The BDSM elements are good - very light compared to other stories I 've read . The concept of a kidnap fantasy features in many a female 's psyche ( whether they want to admit it or not ) and this story lets you play that out in the safety of words . The inner dialogue of the characters is very important and is done fairly well here . It seemed about the right length . Really more of a 3.5 stars but I rounded up !	1
WOW ! ! What a hot little story this was . Very quick paced and packed with naughty goodness . A must read for any BDSM Christmas lovin ' bibliophile.Jillian 's sister Sabrina is irresponsible , wild and crazy and inherited the skinny gene but Jillian loves her dearly . All her life she has looked out for Sabrina and rushed in to clean up her mess , and this holiday season is no different . As a present for herself , Sabrina has hired a company to kidnap her for the holidays and Jillian is appalled.Kyle is a Dom who reluctantly takes on the task of ` napping Sabrina in order to cover the job for his brother . He does n't like this one bit and wants to find his own curvy permanent sub , not empty encounters . When checking out Sabrina 's file he is intrigued by the client 's picture . Other than being too skinny for his taste Sabrina is exactly Kyle 's type . Reluctantly he accepts the job.Kyle is so pleased that the picture in the file was misleading . His target is actually curvy , just the way he likes them .

But Jillian has been gagged and ca n't tell her kidnapper he has the wrong woman . What happens when Kyle mistakes Jillian for her sister is a wild , crazy and sensual ride . Will Jillian ever tell this mysterious Master that he has the wrong woman , or will she keep quiet and see how far this will go ? Only time and a good read will tell .	1
Excuse me while I pass out on the floor now.See , I used to consume BDSM erotic romances like they were candy . Then they all got really samey for me . They all included a billionaire , and they all tried to mimic the formula of 50 Shades of Grey or they tried to pull the whole 'rule breaker ' theme that brats were cool . Because everyone suddenly wants to be spanked , they just do n't want the discipline that goes along with said spanking . They basically do n't want to lose control.I 'm down with fun in BDSM , for example I LOVED this book ! It was unique and original , and holy of holies I WISH there was a We Kidnap U around my area , but I know realistically , this 'business ' would never exist ! I do n't care . Evangeline managed to find the perfect mix of legit BDSM elements with a character that was coming into her own realizing she was getting of on this experience.If you are into BDSM reads I HIGHLY recommend this ! It was panty melting hot !	1
Two sisters ... . one young & wacky & the other older & afraid of life . A mix-up w/a pre-arranged BDSM gift & you 've got a story of fear , love , sex & taking a chance . Anderson knows how to write about sex & always keeps my interest . Hot & touching ... a unique combo .	1
Light , fun , sexy and perfect for the holidays.KIDNAPPED FOR CHRISTMAS is a treat as sweet as gingerbread cookies at Christmas . Do n't expect anything profound or deep . This is a tale of undeniable chemistry and self-discovery as two perfect matches find their round-about way to each other.Jillian looks identical to her sister , Sabrina , who is a year younger and much flightier . In typical impulsive fashion , Sabrina has bought and paid for a BDSM kidnapping fantasy for herself , contrary to Jillian 's warnings of concern . Then she sails off to Key West with her new boyfriend , leaving Jillian to care for the cat and her apartment.Walking out of Sabrina 's apartment , Jillian is mistaken for her sister , gagged , blindfolded and taken to the BDSM dungeon to live out Sabrina 's fantasy . Unable to explain through the gag , Jillian ends up finding herself curious and turned on by not only the BDSM but the enigma mastering her body . When the gag does come off , she not only does n't know the safe word to stop the fantasy , she is unwilling to call it quits before her curiosity is satisfied.Kyle reluctantly agreed to stand in for the first time for his brother who owns the new kidnapping company , only because he finds the client exactly to his taste . As the fantasy plays out , Kyle has a difficult time abiding by the rules of the company . His attraction to Jillian and her responsiveness to him is just too powerful.I enjoyed Jillian 's journey of self-discovery and found myself wincing each time the poor girl was pushed farther , thanks to her sister 's fantasy request . It was quick , tantalizing and cute ( if you can describe BDSM as cute ) . The whole thing was just a naughty little holiday break that will leave you twitching in your airline seat on the way home for the holidays . Enjoy !	1
When Jillian Marks ' sister Sabrina tells her that she 's hired Adam from We Kidnap U to fulfill her fantasy of being kidnapped and spanked , Jillian thinks Sabrina is crazy .

She never imagined enjoying all the things Kyle does to her , but she realizes quickly that his kind of loving is exactly what she craves . Kyle finds the perfect sub in Jillian . However , once Jillian 's kidnapping is over , they are n't supposed to see each other again . Their romance is hot , heavy , and fast . It 's literally a fantasy come true . Kidnapped for Christmas is a very sexy romance.NannetteReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed	1
This is a book that I will be rereading in the future ! It 's a very interesting concept and plot which I loved . Then you have Jillian and Kyle who are two characters that explore each other with such passion . I am definitely going to be looking for other work by this author !	1
WOW . I always read hot steamy books , and think wow this can never happen in real life . So after reading this HOT book I thought I could spice up the bedroom and sent it to my husband and said this is what I want minus the kidnap . He read it and delivered ! ! ! ! ! WOW . Thank you ... .	1
Kyle kidnaps the wrong sister . Jillian does not tell him . Does she want to live out her sister 's fantasy ? Misunderstands at the end of the fantasy could lead to a permanent break-up . Good story , good sex . I liked how Kyle pushed Jillian to see how far she would go . I liked how Jillian discovered how far should would go .	1
her sisters christmas present to herself was to get kidnapped but they kidnapped her instead and did the stuff they were going to do	1
I love this style and the creativity of this book is astronomical . This was a great romance read , and I ca n't wait to read other books by Walters !	1

I really loved this book . It was a great easy read . Good love story with a twist . Highly recommend it to any romance reader .	1
Although both books completely stand alone , in the series timeline , this story technically comes afterTurn It Up : Turner Twins , Book 2 , which was released later and is Maxine 's brother Max Junior 's story . They really do n't have to be read in order and you do n't necessarily have to read both , but I promise the whole experience is greatly enhanced if you do . The Turner family is terrific and since Max Junior and his wife Tasha appear here a little bit , their story will make sense and have some meaning if you do . Plus , it 's truly an awesome story - have Kleenex on hand.Maxine `` Max '' Turner decided she needed a security system installed in her huge family home when vandals broke in and the new client for her brother 's company and her web design services is an expert in the field . Forget sparks - what was a flicker when they first met turned into fireworks by the time she and Ryan finished going over the security needs at her house later . Neither one plays any games - they start dating immediately , knowing starting an affair is going to happen soon . Their relationship is complicated by her huge family intruding ( something similar happens in Turn it Up - it 's funny ) , his responsibility to his handicapped brother and the ongoing vandalism at her house.This is n't a story with a really intricate suspense plot or one with a huge , dark and evil secret ( like a dead wife ! ) that you know will threaten to tear the couple apart . This is mostly a story about the happy developing relationship between Max and Ryan and the smaller , irritating and sometimes sad stuff that keeps happening to them that they have to deal with to keep themselves together . I really found the resolution to the vandalism issue a little annoying . Not because the plot itself was poorly done , but because I just thought it would be something more interesting . There 's a little flip from Turn it Up - Tasha was twelve years older than Max Junior there and here , Ryan is roughly the same amount older than Max.I think my pockets are getting full of the guys I want to keep from the last several Arend books I 've read now that I 've added Ryan to them . He was a bundle of everything interesting - contrasted with Max 's innocence , his experience everywhere was exciting , from picking places to eat , to the bedroom . His grief over his brother 's accident and even his frustration about whether there 'd be any sort of place for him in a life with Max really emphasized how much more mature he was than her ( not sure if that was the idea , but it took me there ) . He tended to go a little overly-alpha on Max about the vandalism thing , but then she was a little too ditzy about it , so I balanced out the points there.Since I read Turn it Up first , I already knew Max was ultra-sheltered by her enormous family and had also been treated pretty badly by her stinker of an ex-boyfriend . How badly was revealed eventually when she and Ryan were together and it was just achingly sad . The way she eventually bloomed around him was sweet and I liked that she kept a little of her sort of gawky innocence even to the end of the story . Max is one of those people that everyone in the family takes advantage of - last minute babysitter , bringing an extra casserole to the party - you know the one . While she wants to stop her family always dropping in on her , she 's a natural nurturer and this causes one bit of miscommunication between her and Ryan and a brief , nearly head-bangingly stupid moment . Her stubborn and sort of wide-eyed idiocy on the vandalism issue gave her a few more moments , but thankfully there were only a few of them.I always seem to leave the sexy moment commentary to the end ( sort of like dessert ! ) . Ryan , being the alpha god that he is , brings it . He has to take it slow with Max because she 's been really messed up by the moron she dated before him , but it makes for some painfully hot scenes . I personally ca n't believe I 'm saying this , but I had one complaint - I sort of felt like Ryan was holding back . I have no idea why , but I thought he might get a little more..dirty.I 'm a little bummed that Arend did n't manage to dig up a hidden Turner triplet somewhere , I liked this duo of books so much . Ryan and Max 's relationship is sexy and complicated and full of family issues that made it fun to read . I wish it had been given a longer format ( it was category rather than novel ) because I think there were things that were rushed at the end and I 'd have loved another chapter or two to see how a couple of issues worked out for Max and Ryan .	1
Another fun and fabulous read from Vivian Arend ... I do n't want to give anything away , but I 'll just say it 's fast-paced , the suspense is artfully woven and the sex is totally hot . I am anxiously waiting for the second Turner Twins novel !	1
this was a very sweet and hot love story . He comes to her rescue and loves her !	1
Maxine Turner is finally striking out on her own . She 's moving into the family home she inherited from her gramma . It is the first time she has lived on her own . Unfortunately , the first thing she has to deal with is flooding and vandals . Maxine is a website designer . Her latest customer just so happens to be a security expert and she is in need of some extra security.Ryan Claymore is struck by the beauty sitting at the diner bar when he walks in . He 's surprised to discover the Max he 's there to meet is none other than that beautiful woman . Ryan is more than happy to help Maxine with her security especially if that gets him closer to her.Electricity sparks when Maxine and Ryan are together . They begin a fun relationship that soon turns serious . However , a secret that Ryan 's keeping could spell trouble . The vandals do n't seem swayed by Maxine 's new security their attacks grow more serious . Can Ryan and Maxine figure out who is behind all the threats before it 's too late ? Turn It On is a dazzling sensual love story with just the right touch of danger . Maxine is such a likeable character . She has such a genuine heart always willing to help someone in a pinch . However , it 's time for her to do something for herself and Ryan is the perfect place to start . Ryan has had a rough couple of years and is basically learning how to live his life the way it is now . Maxine soothes him . She gives him exactly what he needs at exactly the right time.Vivian Arend has a winning series with the Turner Twins . I recently read Turn It Up the second book in the series and loved it as well . I am happy that I read the second book first because I felt like I knew more about the family that Maxine is always helping . It gave me a better idea of who all these people are . It also let me in on the insinuation regarding that front porch swing . I just laughed and laughed about that because that swing definitely left an impression on me after reading Turn It Up . These Turners with their names that include Max are hysterical and easy to love . Turn It On will definitely turn you on with its intense lovemaking and beautifully remarkable story.MirandaFor Joyfully Reviewed	1
Absolutely loved this book . First time reading from this author but it wont be the last . My favorite part is the no games or fake drama . Just real love . Great read .	1
What I really like about this book is that the time frame spans months rather than just days . The whole development of the relationship between Max and Ryan is believable and they do n't just hop into bed right away . The story was really well balanced for what I consider Erotica ; yes there is lots of graphic sex but I do n't feel that it was crammed down my throat or the only focus in the story . What I did n't like is how the antagonist of the story was so predictable and how a '' security expert '' was being duped throughout the book . However , at least there was a plot going on behind just the relationship . There were some editing flaws that I found , but that seems to be common ground now a days and this book is n't nearly as bad in that department as some of the others that I have read recently.Overall this was an enjoyable read and I would recommend it .	1
Who would have thought we 'd ever get to read a `` How To '' book written by first century Christians ! Baptism , Fasting and Prayer , Sunday Worship , all from a 1st Century perspective . These are the folks who lived while the Apostles walked in their midst . Who would n't want to read what they had to say ?	1
A must read for every student of Christianity seeking an understanding of the founding years of the faith . A book that was nearly part of the New Testament , which shows the founding traditions of the Catholic church and how some have remained unchanged	1
This was an interesting book I enjoy the supernatural and look forward to his other books only thing was the book was too short	1
I was really impressed with this novella and am excited to read all of Guido 's work after having read this first installment in the Jason Dark series . Guido is a fabulous writer , and this novella is like a Sherlock Holmes story intertwined with paranormal elements and demon activity.Guido does n't waste any time with preliminary information , but rather jumps right into the action of the story , making it the reader 's job to keep up . While the reader is n't given any background information concerning who exactly Jason Dark is , or where he hails from , it becomes quickly apparent that Dark is a kick butt character intent on saving others and ridding the world of evil demons , one at a time . I liked the idea that Dark is n't completely known to us either as Guido presented him in a rather shrouded light , creating even more elements of gothic mystery as the story unfolds.I especially enjoyed the multiple perspectives of this story as Guido shifts between Jason and the demon he is in pursuit of , giving the reader more glimpses into the story to aid the plot along . I have n't yet pinpointed the time period of this series , as I 've only read this first piece , but I 'm thinking it 's sometime in the early 1900s based on the carriages and other context clues Guido adds to his story , and that is a time period I vastly enjoy ! Four stars .	1
Jason Dark is a ghost hunter in Victorian London , who becomes involved when a string of unnaturally desiccated and decaying bodies are found . He finds out that a Demon is hellbent on spreading chaos and destruction throughout the city . Can the ghost hunter stop the fiend in time ? This is a short story , but boy it does n't lack action , mystery and suspense ! I absolutely loved it ! I had n't read any of Guido 's books before , and I am truly sorry that I have n't ! The pace is fast and furious and kept me wondering what would happen next . I am definitely going to read more of his Jason Dark stories ! I think that this author is seriously underrated and I hope that everyone reading this review will take heed and have a look at his work . I highly recommend this book if you like mystery , action , adventure and the supernatural .	1
Okay , so I was bored and downloaded four samples of books that I did n't think I would be interested in just to pass the time . Three out of four convinced me by the end of the sample that I would be wasting my money on purchasing them . The fourth sample , this book , had me hooked by the first third of the sample . There was no doubt in my mind that I would be purchasing it and following Mac , & # 34 ; Peanuts & # 34 ; and gang through the rest of the novel.So I have now finished the novel and am truly impressed . You can tell the book is fiction ( an Independent for President who does n't truly care if he gets impeached ? ? ? ? ! ! ! ! ) but it is truly a good overview about the damage that a pandemic can do to our society without focusing on the blood/guts , shoot outs , political rally . Patient Zero is a just a poor schmuck working on his dad 's farm . The other characters are very life-like , complete with strengths and weaknesses . The & # 34 ; official & # 34 ; responses are very likely.The writing style is very fluid and definitely keeps you reading . It even has a couple of huge twists at the end ( no I wo n't spoil them ) .Read it - you 'll enjoy it !	1
Overall : 4 3/4 StarsPlot/Storyline : 4 StarsThe plot was an original idea and fairly unique in its execution . This is a difficult book to review as far as plot and storyline as I do n't want to give any spoilers.The book starts out with a few intriguing opening scenes that really made me want to keep reading . The storyline did progress pretty nicely , albeit at a slow pace , after those scenes . However , there were way too many extraneous scenes , sometimes entire chapters , that did not forward the storyline at all and just seemed to be added for speculation among the locals . There was plenty of speculating going on in the chapters that did forward the storyline without adding more.The exceptional storyline did make plodding through these extra chapters worth my time . I just had to discover what was going on with the new neighbors , the Aligers.My favorite parts of the story were the scenes where Perry Aliger gets confused with all of the English 'sayings . ' These scenes really made me think about how often we say things without thinking of the literal meanings of the words.Character Development : 5 StarsMs . Darnell excels at character development . Her novel is peopled with truly unique individuals . Each character has depth and is completely different in both personality and circumstances from every other.There was a lot of imagination and thought put into each character . Ms. Darnell knows how to make the reader care about the characters and what happens to them.Perry was one of my favorite characters , mostly stemming from what I mentioned above regarding his confusing with English colloquialisms.Writing Style : 5 StarsThe writing style was superb . The book was filled with imaginative analogies and appropriate metephors . Ms. Darnell 's command of the English language was evident in every sentence , without being overbearing . The sentence structure made for a nice , even flow to the reading experience . The descriptions were vivid , and the dialogue was like any conversation you would hear on the street or in your own house.Formatting/Editing : 4 3/4 StarsThere were some editing errors sprinkled throughout the novel , but none that would hinder the reading process.The formatting was of professional quality.Rating : PG for Adult Situations	1
This final review , of course , is for the trilogy as well as the last book . I upgraded it from the previous ratings because I think that a consistent good read throughout the whole trilogy deserves an extra star . If you enjoyed the first two ( Galactic Alliance ( Book 1 ) - Translight ! andGalactic Alliance ( Book 2 ) - Chroniech ! , then you really ought to get this one.This one has some interesting plot twists , plus some more development of the protagonist as well as adding some more dimension to the cultures involved , and it all adds up to making the book pretty engaging and interesting to read .	1
A great ending for a great story . I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the entire series.Anyone who enjoys science fiction can appreciate the talent and effort required to write this story.Bravo . A job well done .	1
I 'm still finding myself captivated by Ms. Harrington 's stories and fine characterization . Homeward hearts is the fourth book I 've read by her and I was as intrigued as with the other three.Homeward hearts is set in the Oregon of the mid-1890s . Since the town of Prineville is mentioned , I assume the dying mining town is set near there in the high desert . The story opens with a desperate Chloe Maitland seeking a man who can run her deceased father 's blacksmith shop so she can pay the mortgage owed on her home . She can only offer room and board , and she has n't found any takers . That is , until Travis McGuire staggers onto her property and collapses in her yard . With the aid of the town 's doctor , Chloe gets the man inside and tended to , but he 's not in shape to go anywhere , so she finds herself stuck with a very attractive but very ill patient.Travis is on the run from a bounty hunter , and he does n't take to the sharp-tongued plain woman who seems curious about things he does n't care to reveal . He 's rude and outspoken , and Chloe wants him gone as soon as possible , however , after a tenuous week , she realizes she needs the help he can provide . Thus begins their fragile relationship , one not appreciated by the local schoolmaster who has designs on Chloe and her house.To tell more would give away this wonderful story which must be read and savored . Both Chloe and Travis carry heavy burdens , and how they work them out is the delight of this absorbing read . Each character is well-drawn and the dialogue just sparkles . Overcoming her mistrust of Travis is part of Chloe 's growth process , while beginning to see her as a desirable woman is part of Travis's.I sat down to begin this book yesterday afternoon and finished it well after midnight . It was THAT good.Do yourself a favor and purchase this Kindle edition for the very attractive price of just $ 2.99 . You 'll thank me for the tip .	1
Despite the fact that I read a lot of BDSM erotica , I often find myself questioning what it is that compels people to need the dynamics of the Dom/sub relationship . I read the books because I am fascinated with the dynamics of BDSM ( in a voyeuristic/train wreck way ) & because they are usually heavy on the erotica and light on the ( sometimes ) too saccharine romance . Rarely do I find a book that makes it all make perfect sense ; that balances BDSM & romance without compromising either . Bound and Determined was so beautifully crafted that I could see that the Dom/sub characteristics of the characters were as intrinsic as their hair colour . The needs of the Dom , Owen were perfectly balanced by the needs of the sub , Sterling . This is a book that I will happily read again and again .	1
You will read this one again and again . Sterling and Owen are both wonderful characters and especially Sterling has such a surprising personality . They complement each other perfectly and I loved to see their relationship evolve . There is a multifacetedness to the novel that is stunning and makes time fly by while reading .	1
This novel follows the beginnings of Sterling ( sub ) before and after his meeting with Owen ( college professor and Dom ) . This is exactly the kind of novel I love . I 've always loved novels of apprenticeship wherein we follow the evolution of a young sub who knows nearly nothing of the BDSM Community , but very eager to learn . He does so through his mistakes and successes . The authors also show how a young inexperienced Dom ( Kirk ) may commit involuntarily significant physical and psychological damage . Very interesting novel .	1
Lovely story , believable and well-handled conflicts , perfect pacing . The characters , though , are the real hook . Owen has found a permanent place on my `` Perfect Dom '' shelf . Sterling is far from a perfect sub at the start of this story , but reading through his journey to get there is an experience not to be missed.Then you get to the ending and it 's just a chorus of `` awwwww '' ... because it 's perfect !	1
Sterling is a wonderful character in how he does n't want to submit , but he needs to . He is stubborn enough to convince Owen to take him on , despite being new to the scene . I love the friction between them . It 's a long story , though it does leave out a lot of the scenes that the reader wishes was there . Sterling will mention having enjoyed a scene with Owen , and it 's disappointing not being able to read about it and not seeing Sterling 's at that moment reactions . Owen and Sterling do have their troubles though , but by the end they both need each other .	1
Beautifully written , Bound and Determined is a book that does not disappoint . I 've got books by both authors and their styles compliment each other hugely and make for very cool reading.Sterling is such a brat and I loved his spark and innate cheekiness . It is such a perfect foil for Owen 's more reserved nature and theirs is a relationship that does n't always go smoothly as a result . The conflict was well written with the focus centered on the characters internal struggles . It was easy to read and did n't devolve into any silly BDSM tropes and Nancy Drew and the gang did not make an appearance I was pleased to note . heh.The relationship between Sterling and Owen is what carries this book . The slow development of trust between both men and the exploration of their boundaries , desires , and the chemistry that has drawn them together , was what made this a cut above other BDSM novels I 've read recently . Nothing was rushed and the authors seemed to allow Sterling and Owen to stick to their own timetable . The slow building of sexual tension as a result was off the charts and appealed to me immensely . The sex is incredibly good and they nailed that sense of trust implicit within a D/s relationship . Rawr . It was totally hot and made for magic reading.A lush , intense and engaging read I got totally wrapped up in . If you 've not read , then I highly recommend you get your backside over to Loose Id and buy it . One of my favourite reads of 2009 .	1
The book was sad most of the way through . No child should have to live in such surroundings . It has a way of showing how much children listen to the Mother and Father . People do not realize how much a child that is abused , takes on guilt from every one around them like every thing is their fault . So many things happened in his life that he had no control over . It was hard for him to sit and listen to gossip about his folks , when he knew the people talking were guilty of much worse . He had so much loss in his life , it seemed every one he loved or got close to died . He has a big heart and tried to live his life to be good to every one . Great read .	1
This book was good and sad . I like to read a variety of books . It 's hard to imagine that the stuff you read is real..	1
This book is full of action , and excitement . It is adventurous and mysterious with some erotic sex scenes . This book also has a touch of humor which I enjoyed . I recommend this book .	1
I got my Kindle several weeks ago and had read about independent authors on the Kindle Community , so I was a bit curious . I ran into a thread on the Kindle forum regarding this book and decided to give it a try.To be honest , I was not expecting much , but I was quite pleasantly surprised . The book is relatively short , yet in a small space the author did a very good job of character development and created a plausible plot . The story was well developed and did not leave any loose ends . It is a heart warming New Year 's story with just a bit of spice delivered in good taste . The author did a good job with writing as though it was still 1948 , keeping references subtle and not in your face . Not the usual kind material that I read , I must say that the Kindle and Ms. Callea 's book has opened new horizons for me . I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to more works by this author . `` Thorns to feathers '' , may Misha bring this author many blessings !	1
Plot/Storyline : 4 1/2 StarsThis book was billed as a gNew Yearfs Tale , h but it was very much in the spirit of Christmas . It was a romantic fairy tale , complete with a princess , a disheveled prince , evil family members , and even a perverted fiance to make it more modern . Yes , the fiance was sexually perverted ; there was also a little sex , though not graphic or detailed , and a rather violent beating , so this was definitely an adult fairy tale.The story was set in the 1940s , a perfect time period for the plot , which wouldnft have worked in a more modern time . This setting also gave the story a feeling of innocence , even in light of the perversion and abuse . Although it had a eChristmasyf feel , I think the story had some pretty original messages for a holiday tale.While this was a short novel , I think it could definitely have been shortened to a novella without losing any of the flow or meaning . It dragged in a few places , such as the scene where she was getting the haircut . Yes , the haircut was important to the story , but it was really what the haircut stood for , not the act itself.I especially enjoyed the idea of Misha , the New Yearfs version of Santa . My favorite part was Tashafs telling of the young , homeless boyfs meeting with Misha . I also enjoyed the ending , and the way some revelations made the story come full circle.Characters : 5 StarsTasha was wonderfully depicted as a young , innocent princess . She stayed in character throughout the story and had plenty of depth to evoke empathy in the reader.Mike was my favorite character . I really felt sorry for him when he was concerned about having feelings for someone other than his deceased wife . Kind , gentle , and nervous himself , he was the perfect match for Tasha.Writing Style : 4 1/2 StarsThe eloquent writing style had a truly mellow feel to it that was perfect for this book . The best descriptions were in the opening scene ; after that , they were pretty sparse , at least in any meaningful way . I would have enjoyed more time period descriptive scenes . There were one or two instance of viewpoint problems , but it was not prevalent . The dialogue was well done . The Tasha and her family speak a little oddly at times , but I chalked that up to English being their second language.Editing : 3 3/4 StarsTaking the length of the novel into account , there were quite a few errors . Punctuation was probably the biggest issue , especially when quotation marks were left out when needed , or added when not .	1
Reading Savita Kalhan 's The Long Weekend is like watching the latest chilling and mystifying thriller movie , as not only is it a freighting read , but it 's one that will keep nearly any reader- from middle-grade to adult- clinging to the page , waiting to know what will happen next , while these two boys land themselves in one colossal mess.Sam knows his newest friend Lloyd and he should never have gotten into the black shinny car that Friday afternon , but it was raining , cold , and chilly waiting there by the school . In addition , there were so many cool things in the car- movies , CDs , as much junk food as any young boy could eat . However , now he is in the scariest position he has ever been in . Locked in a big mansion with Lloyd and a petrifying man in black , he knows he has to get them out of there if he ever wants to the light of day . Will he be able to ? Will he come out unharmed , or will everything lead to the worst death imaginable ? In The Long Weekend , Savita introduces a duo of two unique yet stereotypical tween boys . Sam and Lloyd are both easy to like and root for , and I feel many teen boys will be able to root for Sam 's desire to be strong , and Lloyd 's fight to keep hope in the most dangerous of situations . More importantly , their friendship is fully fleshed out in a way that it not only plays an important part in the book , but also leads to yet another part of the book I adored.As mentioned before , the premise of this is frightening to no end . However , what it makes it even more so is how situations like these do happen to kids all the time in real life- they make the wrong decision , get in the car with the wrong person , and end up fighting for their life . Better yet , Savita does not sugar coat the situation . Instead she makes it realistic to the point that it leaves an impact on the reader as well as an important message.In addition , Savita 's writing was also quite good . I thought she did an excellent job of fleshing the plot lines as well as the characters and there feeling out given the book 's short length . Lastly , I really liked how realistic the ending was- it was happy but it still taught a lesson so to say to Lloyd , Sam , and hopefully the reader , and that is all I will say about that.The Long Weekend is perfect for readers- avid and reluctant alike- looking for a fast-paced book to get lost in- one that while contains not only shock and intrigue but a great underlying lying message as well.Grade : B+	1
This book was delightfully creepy , and I hate to use the word 'delightful ' with such a sensitive subject matter - but the creep-factor was incredible in this . It was just the right amount without seeming fake or forced in any way.As a matter of fact , this whole book flowed perfectly well with no sense of discord or falsehood at all . From the characters to what happens to them ... everything connected and flowed perfectly . I think the most shocking part to me was how Savita managed to capture an 11-year-old boy 's voice so well . All of his emotions seemed completely genuine . Everything he felt , you felt . Sam and Lloyd are both the `` boy next door '' types and very easy to relate to . Very easy to empathize with.From the characters to the actual storytelling , I was absolutely blown away . Somehow , the author managed to leave out graphic details and still be able to give me goosebumps from the creepiness of it all . Coming from someone who 's been into horror most of her life - that 's no easy feat ! From beginning to end , I was on the very edge of my seat eagerly reading to find out what happens to the boys . Because of how easily it is to relate to Sam and Lloyd , you ca n't help but root for them.I can not sing my praises loud enough for this book - it 's everything I 've always loved in thriller books . If you love psychological thrillers as much as I do , that have a nice helping of the creeps , then I strongly suggest this book .	1
The first thing I thought when I started reading The Long Weekend was 'creepy ' ! And I mean 'creepy ' in a positive way . The idea is simple : two kids get kidnapped and end up in a mansion full of games and food . They do n't really realize the danger they are in , not until the night arrives and the kids are separated.I really liked Sam ; he felt real , believable , exactly like a smart eleven-year-old boy would be . He is resourceful and does not let panic and fear overcome him . Of course he 's afraid , but he tries to use logic and reason to find a way out . He 's resourceful and loyal : he manages to escape the house but gets back in order to save his friend , who , at first , did n't understand the trouble they were in.Lloyd , Sam 's friend , is depicted as the 'cool ' guy at school , the one everybody wants to hang out with , and that 's why Sam is so eager to get his approval . During the story , though , it 's Sam who realizes something is wrong , whereas Llyod is too confident and thinks Sam is overreacting . Then we see that something really bad happens to him and Lloyd is frozen by fear , incapable to think or react in any way . It 's up to Sam to drag him out the house and only towards the end Lloyd does something which seems to shake him out of the state of shock he was in.I liked the story ; it was a fast , gripping read and you wo n't put it down until you finished it because you want to know what is going to happen next . I found it very realistic and pretty scary . It also has a message : kids , pay more attention and do n't take anything for granted ! In my opinion , the only flaw is the lack of psychological analysis of the bad guy ; I do understand that , as the book is narrated by Sam , it would have been impossible to know more about him , still I was curious to get to know him a little bit better.Reading this book was like watching a horror movie , one of those where you want to scream at the characters `` Do n't do it ! Do n't go in the car ! '' because you know something bad is going to happen . But , as it always happens in the movies , you can not do anything but sit and watch ( sorry , sit and read ) while Sam and Lloyd face the danger .	1
This was my second Nicholson read , the first being the short story collection Scattered Ashes . Both have reminded me of Stephen King 's grasp of true human fears and Hemingway 's ability to make the mundane a riveting read.Nicholson is clearly one of America 's most undervalued writers .	1
A little morbid , a little weird , a lot fascinating . And always well written . Looking for something different ? Try 'Burial to Follow . ' It will keep you interested .	1
This is n't really a horror novella . I would n't say it 's suspense either . As with many other Nicholson works it 's hard to put it in any one category.Roby Snow is helping the Ridgehorn family through the loss of their recently lost patriarch Jacob . Roby is a distant relation you see and that 's what family does right ? Being such a distant relation to the deceased how can he be of much help though ? He can be thoughtful and help clean up the kitchen during the sitting ... offer a shoulder to cry on ... and ... .offer each and every one of the family pie ... .again and again..until they eat it ... What 's up with the pie ? I 'm not telling = ) This is more a character study . While Roby is the central character as it follows his plight to give aid to the deceased and his survivors , we 're shown just how each and every one of the remaining family reacts and handles the recent loss of a husband and father . Greed , shock , anger . Each one of the family shows at least one of these emotions and many more.Of course it 's not as simple as all that because there 's an interesting Nicholson twist thrown in there ; ) The story is short ( it 's just a novella after all ) but it 's completely worth reading . Nicholson throws a lot of great ideas and character moments into a story no matter how long or short it may be .	1
My main issue with this was that it was too short and was not advertised as a short story or a novella . I do like the way Mr. Nicholson tells the story and has well developed charaters from the very start .	1
Nyssa is a hologrid star and a fem , genetically engineered to be an independent free thinking female . When she starts receiving anonymous threats , High Councilor Fem Dekalia , assigns her protection , primale Guardian Captain Theron .

Nyssa is horrified at the prospect of being in close quarters with such an overbearing but tempting male.Theron can not believe he is being assigned as Nyssa 's babysitter . Duty bound to protect her , it is obvious to him she is a brat needing some discipline . With permission from the High Councilor , Theron prepares to take Nyssa in hand . Dishing out primale style erotic punishment , Theron introduces Nyssa to a new world of sensuality.Fighting the threat against Nyssa , Theron also fights his desire for the very seductive fem . With societies dictates for the paths of primales and fems , a future together is impossible . Protecting Nyssa is his sole mission but can Theron protect her and his heart ? Reese Gabriel has written a winner with Nyssa 's Guardian : More Than Male ! Mr.Gabriel has built a vividly descriptive futuristic world with creative details that truly engages the reader 's imagination . I especially love the well drawn gender designations : fems , mems , obedients and primales . Fem Nyssa is feisty , beautiful and aggressive . Primale Theron is handsome , strong , noble and utterly delicious . His domination of Nyssa is erotic and loving . Oh , to have a primale of my own ! An engaging story , with a clever plot , and solid character development , Nyssa 's Guardian : More Than Male completely engaged my fancy . Mr. Gabriel successfully blends sci-fi , BDSM and romance ; a difficult task for any writer . A highly erotic love story , Nyssa 's Guardian : More Than Male , is a must read !

Loved all of the first five books in this adventure . Jaid Black really gets you involved in her paranormal world of fantasy warriors however after reading the reviews of books 5.5 and six I stopped the series . I really wanted some closure on some of the main characters not expand upon book 2 . Book six for the amount of reading I do , does n't sound like the story is ending . It is shame because up to this point I could n't stop reading it .	1

This book turns out to be a mini series if you can call it that , two books , so look for Never too old to complete this story . This is about a girl who is attacked , raped and left for dead by her dead beat alcoholic father . She is rescued by a cop/crush and is saved . The cop falls for her , then ignores her because , how could he fall for someone during a horrific event and she is 10 years younger . He is involved with his best friend ( sheriff ) and the story picks back up about 10 yrs later when the dead beat father gets released from jail . The crush and the sheriff try to protect and fall in love..	1
It 's not the Greyhawk series , but it was a different story . Interesting and worth the time . I just wanted more love and less demands .	1
Where do I start , this book was so hot I had my mouth open the whole time.Sin-Bad , A corny name yes but this Vamp is so hot I was able to overlook the name and many other sins.This is a M/F/M m & eacute ; nage , a little bondage and in the beginning there is a M/M scene that is brief and does not involve the main characters.I loved how the writer took creative license and changed how we view vampires.These vampires are not afraid of daylight , they can eat , and one cooks . Garlic does not bother them and they do cast a reflection.They are simply three extra strong and horny brothers/ Aliens from another planet.Sin-Bad not Sinbad is so hot he it is unbelievable.For some reason I like that he does not make excuses for who he is and the fact that he will do whatever it takes to have things his way.Chandra is a intelligent woman of color who has worked hard to become a police detective . She is strong and determined to keep her independence.There is a brief battle of wills and a lot of scorching lovin.I loved it and as always , I 'd love some follow up.I found this book after reading Marilyn Lee 's latest addition to the ( In Blood series ) The Stoner brother and the a few of her other characters from other books are long time friends or acquaintances . In the new book by Marilyn Lee , Rayna talks about how Sebastian is most likely also in love with Chandra as if she is jealous.Marilyn must do another book and make it about Max or Sebastian . I want to see what will happen when Seb finds is blood and Chandra has to share her men.LOVED IT , NEED MORE LIKE IT IN MY LIFE , MARILYN I THANK YOU and MY HUBBY THANKS YOU TOO ! HAPPY READING , MonaLisa	1
While this book took me wayyyy too long to get through , it was really good ! This marks my official move into more fantasy books . While it is n't usually my cup of tea , this had lots of smutty romance to soften the fantasy blow . The story was jam packed with action , romance , fun characters , and mythos . Totally worth the zero dollars I spent on it , and had me looking for the next book in the series .	1
This book was a big surprise for me . The action was non stop from the first chapter . Great character development as the story went from one fast paced scene to another , and another , and another ! I loved it and would definately recommend it for anyone looking for lots of action well told with tasteful romance thrown in too ! This author really knows how to tell a story easily pictured by the reader .	1
From the moment I picked up the book I was hooked ! Heather Killough-Walden has the rare ability to transform seemingly mundane scenes into moments of pure suspense and intrigue . I was so entranced by the relationship between Jack Thane and Annabelle Drake from that very first scene that I kept reading through the night till dawns early light when I finally finished the book and it was one hell of a ride.In order to truly enjoy the book it is best to appreciate it as a work of fantasy and just enjoy the ride . Those with puritanical views that are looking for a moral lesson should probably skip this one and head somewhere else . Now in real life my views may be a little on the puritan side but I enjoy my fantasy deep and dark so this book was definitely up my alley and Heather Killough-Walden delivered in spades . Her character development is wonderful and it was a breath of fresh air to discover the flaws built into the characters instead of the usual cookie cutter characters so often viewed elsewhere.The themes in this book are mature and there is a good smattering of adult language but other than that the book is clean . Much to the consternation of some of the reviews I have read . Usually I would be one of those as I hate a tease but I never felt a loss at the lack of a full on intimate scene . The book was too enjoyable and there was plenty of substance that held my attention and the intimacy between the characters transcended anything a mere sex scene could portray.If you enjoy strong female characters , dark and dangerous men and sleek and powerful motorcycles then this book is for you . I give this book 5 out of 5 . If I was concerned about the miniscule editing issues I noticed I might drop down to a 4.5 but this book was a Dollar and for that the author has given me an amazing experience that definitely deserves this 5 .	1
One of my best books ever . I love the drama and romance and seduction and suspense . Such an amazing easy read .	1
I loved this book ! There was nonstop action with a great love story in between . I will read it again !	1
Action packed the whole way , great plot . Loved the characters . Shame there is n't going to be a sequel , I would have loved to read one : ( Other than that , a great read !	1
Heather Killough-Walden 's new release , `` Hell Bent , '' kept me up reading at 2:00 in the morning even though I had to be up at 6:00 a.m . Combination thriller and love story , the two main characters , Annabelle and Jack , have been in a platonic relationship for ten years , although they are each others best friend , confidante and overall most important person in the world , as well as being significantly attracted to each other . Annabelle is a beauty who turns heads without realizing it . She is a hockey-loving , Harley-riding , graphic artist - feisty but vulnerable and an overachiever with her flaws which she deals with through good humor , self-deprecation and Vicodin . Jack , with his British accent , hauntingly light eyes and rugged good looks , leaves women in his wake and barely notices because he only has eyes for Annabelle , whom he alone calls Bella . His need to be constantly married to women other than Annabelle , as well as his career choice , has left Annabelle content with the status quo of their relationship . However , the sexual tension that results from their mutual devotion is incredibly effective , while eluding overt description . This is n't the `` will they or wo n't they kiss '' tension delivered teasingly over and over . It is something much more complicated and far more stirring . When Annabelle finds herself involved in a murder , Jack 's willingness to do whatever it takes to protect his Bella becomes apparent and he takes her and an extended cast of characters from one safe spot to another as together they investigate the murder . `` Hell Bent ' is a masterful telling by an author who delivers brilliantly complex relationships , scenes with staying power , and a story that manages to be sexy , thrilling , poignant and thought-provoking . The most fun I have had reading in a while .	1
I have never read a book by this author , but I just loved this book.I hope they all are the same . Also hoping to continue the story if possible ? I was so happy to see this was a very long book.I read about 4 hours a night lately have been reading more with the wonderful books Amazon.com has to offer .	1
`` Hell Bent '' reminded me of the movies `` Mr and Mrs Smith '' and `` True Lies '' . If you like sexy couples that are mixed up in killing , this is the book for you : ) There is humor , romance , and non-ending excitement . I bought this book on my Kindle Friday evening and grudgingly put it down just to sleep . Saturday , despite being a gorgeous day outside , I spent finishing the story . As with many of Heather 's books , there seems to be room here for a sequel and I hope she considers writing one so that we can have `` Adam 's '' story : ) I am so happy I found Heather Killough-Walden because she is really a great writer and this story did n't disappoint !	1
Could n't put the book down , Love the characters and the plot twists.. would recommend this book to everyone.. great jon Heather , will be reading more of your books ! ! ! !	1
Not Just For Breakfast Anymore PV LundqvistA boy and his pet overcome being the new kids on the block and learn many laudable lessons.I do n't know where to start , there were so many things I liked about this book . This would have been entertaining if it had been a boy and his dog but a boy and his pig makes it much more interesting.Benny is so likeable because he is so normal . He shows the fears and insecurities that are ubiquitous to human beings let alone children . His parents are not perfect nor are they buffoons.The conflict is not violent but it is believable . Bullying is a hot topic at the moment . Lundqvist paints a more realistic approach than many authors . He also show the impact a negative family life can have on creating bullies without in any way becoming preachy.The friendship between Major and Benny and the impact reality has , particularly in hard economic times , is poignant . All of us have been there at some point in our lives.So many laudable characteristics are exhibited that it would be tedious to list them all . Lundqvist painted real live people , showing emotions and empathy as well as pettiness and anger . Fletcher is icing on the cake . He brings humor and pathos into the story line.The title is indicative of the humorous attitude of the author . He illustrates that humor and wisdom in his blog which is linked below.I really enjoyed this book.I strongly recommend the book ! Web site : [ ... ]	1
Appropriate title in more ways than one ! They built a city above a city and blocked out the sky for anyone stuck below . They took everything they could from the people who were n't deemed worthy and then captured them to make them mindless slaves . They fight back with everything they have and you end up with a huge cliffhanger ! The story is told from several points of view so you know what is happening in all areas . This book captures your interest and keeps it .	1
I really enjoyed this book . I do n't usually go for combat scenes but there was plenty of other interesting elements . A good read .	1
Although I am a major fan of dystopic fiction , novels that deal with war and violence are an extreme turn-off . This novel could well be the only exception to that stance . Uprising , in spite of it being an extremely bloody tale , is a very engrossing and entertaining book.The author , Justin Kemppaimen , is quite brilliant in his sci-fi depiction of Haven , the self-devised land of autocratic 'perfection ' . His characterizations are well formed and believable , his story-line is direct and fluid , his descriptions of the milieu are clear and concise and , lastly , the suspense he develops is compelling . You will find yourself , as a reader , being led to a variety of conclusions as you read the story only to find out that the author had a completely different ending in mind . The editorial flaws are minor and the easy-flow writing style is superb .	1
Glad it worked out for them but I 'm still not sure if this was the worst blind date or the best .	1
A good story packed into a quick read . Lots of fun , well written and super hot , really enjoyed this book	1
This is a great quick read . You ca n't help but want for the mild mannered twin to experience some of what her sister has to offer ... even if she does break all the rules .	1
If you are a fan of Evangeline Anderson books you will enjoy this book . I will be looking forward to her next book .	1
This is a sweet short story with charming characters and a few good steamy scenes . True , this is n't great literature at its finest , but for what it is -- a Romantica novelette -- it 's fantastic ! I thought the main character was well-written and easy to relate to , and her romantic interest was certainly an awesome fantasy ! The scene is light kink , nothing remotely over-the-top or anything . Take the negative reviews here with a grain of salt ; most of them did n't know what they were getting into with an Evangeline Anderson book , so they 're negative about the length and simplicity ( duh , it 's a novelette ! ) , or the graphic content ( duh , it 's erotica ! ) .All in all , it 's a sweet little story .	1
This was a hot READ . I devoured it and was wanting more . I love stories of twins switching places and this one was naughty . Zoe has hurt her ankle so she gets her twin Chloe the shy school teacher to meet a client for her ... the thing is Zoe is not the investment banker everyone believes she is , she is a dominatrix . Chloe goes but the tables get turned and she ends up being dominated and loves it . Defiantly a good quick read to raise the heat in the room . I would love to see Zoe get her submissive .	1
Wow , this had me squirming in my chair ! Hot , steamy and downright scorching ! I needed a cold shower after reading.Good story with a great ending . Loved it !	1
4 out of 5 stars ! This sizzling novella will hold your attention to the very end ! ! I loved how Zoe found a way to get her shy twin to open up in the most unexpected way . It turns out to be a very sweet read . And if you are not into reading hot and heavy erotica then this should be just the right amount for you . Since at the beginning it leads you to thinking it will be the typical BDSM read but this was a lot softer then I expected yet I still enjoyed what I read ! My only wish was it was longer and there was more to read about of Chloe and Mark ! They made such a cute couple ! =0 ) I recommend this to anyone wanting to read a unique take on a contemporary romance ! Review By : From Me to You ... Book Reviews ( read more of this review and a teaser on my blog )	1
What a wonderful surprise to find this short story as a free e-read ... Although the `` plot '' was completely predictable , it did n't detract from the content at all ... .Chloe was adorable in her vain attempt at being a fill in dominatrix and Mark - what can I say ? - Just read the title on my review - : )	1
This was an unexpected light bondage romance . I was n't expecting to enjoy reading this book so but I am glad that I read it . It gives a girl hope that her future blind dates would end up the way Chloe 's did .	1
At first , I was a little turned off - not because of the subject matter but because I felt like some of Zoe 's ( the sister ) actions were totally illogical . With the Jaguar she drives and the swanky house and additional office across town and expensive vacations , Zoe was making a mint as a Dominatrix but she sends her wallflower sister off to handle one of her clients without giving any instructions or techniques to help Chloe do the job and fool the client . I ca n't imagine a highly successful professional in any industry having a novice fill in for them without giving instructions . Of course , all of this is explained as you get into the book so I was glad I kept reading . The other thing that sort of got my goat was her total lack of action , nary a peep to protest it , when he turned the tables on her and took over their interlude.The story took less than two hours to read . The writing was good - it did n't make my brain hurt to try to read it . I noticed that the author seems to have an affinity for the verb `` relent '' ( I 'm a geek and counted.. she uses relent , relentless , and relentlessly 8 time in this little story ) , but that was just a little quirk I noticed as I read . The sex was definitely not the steamiest thing I 've ever read and it most definitely did n't make me squirm about like some things I 've read , but it was more the sweet kind . These were basically two people who were both looking for the same thing and happened to find it in each other . I do n't want to spoil the ending for anyone , but I was happy with the way it ended . I think the story would have been ruined for me had they 'd professed undying love.I liked the little bit of character development in the book . With short stories like this , especially of the `` naughty '' sort , many authors tend to forgo character development in an effort to just get their point across . You get a glimpse of who these people might be ... you get to see some of their passion and some of their vulnerability.For anyone who might be turned off by the possible inclusion of domination/submission themes in this story ( or those who might be expecting that there are when they purchase the book ) , there are no D/s scenes nor are toys ( i.e . ball gags , whips/crops , etc . ) used , with the exception of an Andrew 's cross , which is minimally used.In the end , it 's probably about 3.5 to 3.75 stars .	1
Masks a little bit too much porn for me . The story and characters were engaging and the story was entertaining	1
If you want a quick , funny and steamy read , well this might work for you as well . Both MC are endearing and it has its twits that makes the story worthwhile .	1
Chloe and Zoe are identical twins but , are total opposites . Zoe always stood out in school and got a lot of attention , while Chloe always stood in the shadows and was n't as popular .

Chloe thinks that she is an investment banker until Zoe tells her that she is a Dominatrix and that the client is too important to lose.Chloe finally decides to give in and her sister gives her 3 rules to follow.1 .

Never take off her mask.Mark Jacobs was a computer tech and business owner that told Zoe about the problems that he was having getting a woman , when he came to repair Zoe 's computer . Zoe thought that it would be great to set Chloe up with Mark without letting her in on it or telling her about his secret .

I would recommend reading it ! ! !	1
This story was one of my favorites of all the free stories that I downloaded . I will certainally be looking for more of Evzngeline ` s work . A must read .	1
Hurray ! A short story that is not just a lead-in to another book to buy ! Chloe is a shy retiring school teacher , whose dating experience is extremely limited . Her twin sister , Zoe , is identical in appearance , but her complete opposite in personality . Chloe is shocked to learn that Zoe 's luxurious life style is not due to a career as a financial wizard , but rather her skill as a dominatrix . Zoe , it seems , has always been able to talk Chloe into anything , and when she talks Chloe into taking her place for her next appointment , Chloe 's in for a life changing experience.I liked this story . The idea was unique , if unbelievable . But , hey , it 's fiction ! I also wanted to know how the hero became so knowledgeable in the ways of pleasing a woman , but maybe he was just well-read.For a short , free read , I recommend it , as long as you are a fan of erotic romance .	1
I have n't read a lot of erotic books but I decided to give this one a chance . Usually I do n't like erotic books because I find the sex a bit harsh because it seems like out of context , forced in the story . But this book was really good , not good as in good literature , but good in its genre and in its length . It is a short book , I read it in less than 2 hours , but I found it an extremely nice reading . Strangely for an erotic it is very sweet and I had a pleasant two hours with it . The characters are very likable even if they do n't seem `` real '' ( real was n't possible in this kind of situation , I think ) and the story is told in a pleasant tone and rhythm .	1
Chloe and Zoe are identical twins ; but that is where there similarities ended for each was as different as night and day . Zoe lives her life in the fast lane , working as an investment banker ; Chloe life consists of a quiet existence working as a first grade school teacher.When an injury prevents Zoe from meeting with one of her & # 8220 ; clients & # 8221 ; she asks Chloe to step in and pose as her . Then Zoe explains that her job as an investment banker is a rouse , for she makes her money working as a dominatrix.Chloe reluctantly agrees to stand in for her sister ; she questions if she will strong enough to be a stand in dominatrix . When the time arrives for her to meet with Mark Jacobs she finds that he isn & # 8217 ; t the submissive man she had pictured . Instead , Mark is a true alpha male who quickly takes control of the situation.Zoe finds with both of them masked , a sensual side she never knew existed comes to the surface . Mark brings her body to unspeakable heights she never knew she possessed . Chloe wants to know more about the man behind the mask , when she asks him to take it off and reveal his face will what she finds change her feelings toward him ? MASKS is a sensual divulge into the word of erotic fantasy . Evangeline Anderson has done an exceptional job in creating these outstanding characters . I was highly impressed with how she weaved a Beauty and Beast theme so easily into the storyline .	1
I enjoyed this book a lot . A good plot and likable characters make it even better ! Short but really hot .	1
This novel was short and sweet . The love scenes were fun and enjoyable . The characters were both awesome and enjoyable . Hopefully there will be more to this series later on ca n't wait to see if both the hero & heroin are still together .	1

Gr8 short story . Very hot . You will love the entire series beginning with Rees . I 'm reading them all again and hope that Ms. James keeps these sizzling stories coming ( no pun intended : ) !	1
Once again Charlote Boyett-Compo has written a riveting story . Glyn Kullen is a reaper with enough worries on his mind . The last thing he 's interested in is a mate . That is until he meets Mystery Butler and her precocious daughter , Valda . Just as he realizes that he does n't want a life without them a horrible evil force enters the picture and challenges the possibility of their relationship and their lives.The characters in this story were so real . They leaped off the pages . I was so immersed in the story that I stayed up through the night to make sure that Glyn , Valda , and Mystery would be okay . The reapers are the good guys with a bond so close that they really seem like brothers . The glimpses into their past lives before becoming a reaper really endear the reader to the reapers . Each story is heartbreaking and makes you cheer for them to defeat the evil and come out on top . I do think that Valda 's character kind of upstaged the rest of the characters in this book . The author did an excellent job of adding cultural/racial/ethnic diversity without dumbing down the characters or exploiting their race/culture.The storyline had numerous twists and turns . Just when I thought I knew what evil force was coming against them and how they were going to combat it . It turned out that there was another entity or several other entities at work against the reapers . I enjoyed every moment of the suspenseful element of the story . I absolutely love that Boyett-Compo 's characters are lovingly flawed and each element of the storyline exposes those flaws so that the reader gets a deeper insight into the actions of the character . This book is number 6 in the series , but it is written so skillfully that it can easily be read as a standalone . However , the series is so addictive you will feel compelled to read all of the books.This was another homerun ! ! ! Reviewed by Michelle for Cocktails and Books	1
I am really enjoying the WesternWind series I 've been reading them non-stop since I discovered the first book . This book was set in the south of what is left of the US after the burning war . Reaper vs various unexpected foes . It is so south I expected someone to say 'fiddle-de-de ' at any moment . Plenty of action in this book and of course scorned lovers who try to get even in a dark arts style .	1
Read . I enjoyed this book from the very first page . Its full of excitement , action and adventure . And of course plenty of hot steamy scenes . Kudos to Kate on this book .	1
Much better writing than many m/m books have , but oddly weaker characterization . Or maybe we are dealing with genuine flawed people , but then we should n't get shock twist endings , and more should be explained earlier on . Fundamentaly a book about jealousy and trust , with acts of bad faith on either side . Both men escape into addictions - one alcohol , the other work , neither is intimate enough , both are highly sexual . I liked the writing and will look for more AM Riley but was not really satisfied with this book , though I class it as a noble failure , at least she was trying to do something different and interesting here !	1
I read Amor En Retrogrado by A. M. Riley because Treva Harte said it was cool beans . Reading the synopsis , after I bought it , I was initially not that keen as the book focuses on an established couple and the break down of their relationship . I am rather guilty of preferring that first flush of romance between a couple and all that lovely anticipation . I was happily proved wrong and could not have enjoyed this book more . It was romantic , heart breaking and beautifully written . I think I almost got what I wanted really , but do n't want to spoil it ! I loved it .	1
Delicious ! I guess I 'm just a sucker for fantasy , and this novella was a great quick read . Excellent writing , interesting plot and fascinating universe . The only thing I can complain about is that I wanted MORE.MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW : Tam is a slave , promoted from the kitchen to the house ( the Guildhouse , to be specific ) , he tends to the every need of the Guild 's visitors . So when Lucan , a dark mage , shows up in a rainstorm with his lame horse , it 's Tam who is assigned to the frightening man . But Tam is incredibly drawn to Lucan , who appears quite taken with the young man . Tam is quickly bound up in Lucan 's work , and in spite of the fear Lucan 's magic elicits , Tam wants nothing more than to serve the mage . The ending is sort of an HEA , probably as good an HEA as Tam will ever get , although I 'd be thrilled if there were a sequel.Mr . Lane 's writing is evocative , and his imagination comes through his words . The story is told from Tam 's perspective in first-person narrative , but we still get to see a great deal of what goes on inside of Lucan . Tam is charming , beautiful , and utterly subservient . He knows his place , even if he is cunning and likes to push the boundaries as far as Lucan is concerned.All in all , a real treat and quite sexy , too .	1
Another hot one . It totally cinched my eyebrows it was so hot . Definitely sweet and intense love story mixed with a bit of thrill . Loved it	1
A romance that has love , romance and sex in it . It is one that will keep you interested in it until the end .	1
Title : One Thousand BridesAuthor : Solange AyreGenre : Science Fiction Erotic RomanceRating : 3.5 starsSummery : Janis Stone , along with 999 other Earth women , finds herself abducted by a Terilian colonists who have lost all their females two years ago to illness . Even as she is outraged by her kidnapping she finds herself attracted to Dr. Delos . Their budding love is threatened by a higher-ranked male who has every intention of claiming her for himself in the upcoming Spring Running.Not the best sci-fi romance I 've ever read but I did n't think it was as bad as some of the other reviews seemed to believe . I 've read a LOT worse ! I myself thought the arrogant way Primus Taddus suddenly announced to the world that they were pretty much taking 1,000 brides and there was nothing they could do about it was rather funny ! I can just image how Earth would have reacted to the announcement and sudden disappears of so many women.Star Brides seriesOne Thousand BridesBride RebornBride 's Holiday Gift	1

Playing to Win . Shelley MunroReview from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.So , in the mood for a straight romance I chose this . Its a romance , and also a puzzle with danger coming to Kate along with the solution.I liked Kate , she 's mum to her dead sister 's child , and she and Jamie have carved out a contented life for themselves . Then their world is turned upside down when tabloid papers print a story over Jamie being local hero and rugby player Lane 's son . Of course as always they 're not interested in the truth & # 8211 ; just want scandal for the ratings . Kate is bombarded with Press at her home , Lane completely blind sided by the fact he may have a ten year old child , and Jamie struggling with insecurity wondering if he 'll be taken from Kate ... Kate 's firm and insistent , nothing will take him away from her , though she 's willing to let Lane build a relationship with him.Along the journey to the truth there 's a potential kidnapping , danger and attacks on Kate & # 8217 ; s home and business , and threats to her safety . Lane steps up his protection of her and gradually falls in love . He just needs to persuade Jamie and Kate that they should be a family.Its a fun romance with a snippet of danger , not heart stopping but a more subtle kind that creeps up quietly and lands with a bang . The police were great characters too , becoming regular visitors . The protagonist did n't really come as a shock to me , but it was well done , and everything added up & # 8211 ; I hate when we find out who the & # 8220 ; baddie & # 8221 ; is and it doesn & # 8217 ; t fit the clues we 've had , none of that here though . Looking back we can see how things build up to that dramatic climax and reveal.Priced at 0.99 for 228 pages its long enough to let the reader get into the plot . Its a bargain for lovers of gentle contemporary romance.Stars : Four , fun read but a one off for me.ARC supplied by Netgalley	1
This was a great book about love found , lost and found again . There were interesting revelations for the characters and it was great to see their reactions and actions based on these revelations . Wonderful read , would recommend it !	1
This is my favorite of the Westernwind series so far . It 's got action , it 's got romance , and it has suspense , who done it ? I really liked the dream sequence , a little bit of old time in the midst of a sci-fi adventure .	1
I love all of her books ... well just the ones with a f/m relationship ... She is an incredible writer , period ! ! ! ! ! But this book , I have to admit is one of my favorite books ... i think i have re-read this book 4 times ... and I still find fascinating ! ! I am completely in love with it !	1
A little twist on the slave storyline that feels so right because Evangeline is so good at building up her characters . You really feel why her commanding officer rushes to save her and why he treats her the way he does . Very nicely done .	1
With love you can get through almost any thing . That 's what I got from reading this book . The first book that I 've read of this author . But after I finish this review , I will be looking for more from this author . The relationships , the love scenes , the interaction with others were all believable and fit the situations . All three characters were well developed and real . In short I love this book from beginning to end .	1
I wanted an easy read for a weekday night and I 've got just that . Two friends with benefits who are reluctant to make things permanent because there is something missing in their relationship and then they literally stumble over him .	1
The cover of the book is defiantly misleading . I was initially turned off by the book because of the cover , but thankfully , it does the book no justice . You 'll truly enjoy another wonderful read by Kimberly Kaye Terry.In a nutshell , Liza and Greg marriage is on the rocks . Liza feels that her emotional and sexual needs are n't being met by workaholic attorney and husband Greg . Liza has a hard time talking about her past with Greg because she 's ashamed by it . Growing up in poverty with an emotionally abusive single parent mother seems to be the root of all Liza 's problems.Greg , who once use to pull Liza 's hair during sex , seems to have his mind on other issues pertaining to work as well as his wife.Greg finds himself at a standstill . Wanting to know more about his wife 's childhood , Greg presses Liza to open up more about her past by informing her he knows about a dark secret Liza thought she kept hidden from him.The couple finds that in order to have a successful marriage , they both must be willing to give up something to make the other one happy . `` Pull My Hair '' is defiantly an erotica read which does n't disappoint when it comes to the sex . Most of all , there is a story line which I think sometimes lacks in erotica novellas . It was more than your average sex book . With the way it 's plotted , you find yourself actually pulling for the couple . I was overall pleased with the writing . However , it could have used a tad bit more sex scenes ; but that is just my opinion.I would recommend getting `` Make it Last '' which has `` Design of the Lifetime '' and `` Pull My Hair '' in one book . `` Design of a Lifetime '' deals with Liza 's best friend Karina who has close ties to Liza 's story . However , you do not need to read `` Design of a Lifetime `` to get Liza 's story . Both books are great .	1
This book was a good read . It dealt with an issue that a lot of people deal with , being ashamed of your past .	1
I could n't believe that every reviewer gave this book 5 Stars , so I had to read it for myself . I must say that I agree that the book deserves the 5 star rating . I could not put this book down . I highly recommend this mystery thriller .	1
Excellent read ! Just got this yesterday , read it today and am very impressed with this author 's first book . Great characters , lots of action , could n't put it down and a totally unexpected twist at the end . What more could you want in a book ?	1
The book was just what I expected with the exception that I did not realize it was so short . When reading it there was a feeling of wanting more . Hopefully there will be more in this type of format from the author .	1
Enjoyed this book immensely . Would n't it make a great Lifetime movie ? Seriously , it was enjoyable all the way through . Evangeline 's books are not all alike - each one is very different from the other ( with the exception of the words she uses to describe sexual parts ) . Not sure I like them so much , I like softer less crude sounding words .	1
This is one hot read . I really enjoyed it . If you like stories about werewolves and hot sex then this is the story for you . It is the first in a series of four stories . I think you 'll like this one and you will want to read the other three in the series also .	1
I wish this short story was a little longer . I wanted to learn more about the pack . Maybe there will be a follow up later . Otherwise it was short and sexy read .	1
Just what I wanted to see happen . Jason and Kelsey are meant for each other . Is there a sequel ? I hope so .	1
3.5-4 starsThis was a pretty good story . I liked Kelsey and Jason and the story , while short , is enjoyable . The story does have a insta-love setup but since the story is a PNR the mating bond makes the fast fall understandable.Kelsey is a reporter . She grew up as the only child of a Father that 's a journalist that owns a newspaper in Washington DC . Since she did n't have a mother growing up , Kelsey took after her father and lives , eats and breaths for her story . She 's intent on getting an interview with a Senator ( a young , handsome and single Senator ) so she sneaks past security to wait outside his room . When he shows up however , he mistakes her for someone else.Jason is a Senator in Washington DC and also a shifter . He and his family are out to gain power in Washington to try to get protection for his people for the eventual time that they 'll be revealed . When he leaves the latest shindig to get to his hotel room , he 's expecting a woman to be waiting for him ( a setup by his Beta ) . When he sees Kelsey he 's strongly attracted to her . He realizes she 's not another shifter and he should n't be with her , but the attraction is too great and he knows she 's meant to be his mate , no matter who she is.Kelsey is n't expecting a seduction and was actually there for a story but when Jason kisses her she 's looses her head . She goes with it and gives in to Jason . Sparks fly and they end up spending the night together . When the truth comes out about Kelsey 's identity and job , Jason is understandably not thrilled about it . He feels the mating bond forming though and ca n't give her up . He asks her to spend the weekend with him so they can get to know each other better . Kelsey is n't sure if she should be going away with Jason , especially since she 's agreed that everything is `` off the record '' for the weekend but she likes Jason enough to give it a try.Jason and Kelsey have a great weekend together but Jason does n't tell her his secret yet . He is very pleased with her though and wants to tell her and hopes she 'll agree to keep the secret and stay with him . Kelsey is falling for Jason and things seem pretty good between them when the full moon arrives . Kelsey , being curious ends up finding out about Jason at the wrong time and in the worse way . She has a drama filled night ( FYI , there is a sex scene where Jason takes her in his wolfman form ) and afterwards goes home for some time alone to think about things and ( Jason fears ) possibly write the story that would ruin his and all the other shifters lives . There 's some uncertainty as Kelsey struggles with her feeling for Jason and what to do but things work out and Kelsey and Jason get their HEA.This was a pretty good story . I liked the characters and the story was enjoyable . It was a short story but it did n't feel like it needed to be longer , it worked as is . I 'm planning to read more of this series in the future . I 'd recommend this book . Thumbs up ! : ) * note - I listened to the audio version of the book . The narrator did a good job .	1
I have always liked Jaci Burton . Her books actually tell a story in vivid detail . I would recommend this book to anyone who loves supernatural erotika ! I only gave it four stars because I wished it was longer ... ...	1
I liked the story I just wish there was more background to Jason ... But I guess that 's why this is book one	1
The path to Heaven starts in Hell - or so Jared McTavish found out ! Fighting for his country was never going to be easy , but it was Jared 's life plan , so when he gets shot to bits and finds himself crippled and relying on others to tend his every need , he 's not sure he wants to carry on with his miserable existence . Except through the darkness there is one small glimmer of light , Ninia , his strong , capable and completely alluring nurse . But what 's a Dom to do when he 's bedbound , has a life changing injury and is n't sure if he 'll ever be able to go back into the BDSM scene and be the Master he was before ? Roped is the start of a series , and I am certainly keen to read more . The writing is elegant despite the at times difficult subject matter , the characters believable and the sex scenes frequent and explosive . I enjoyed seeing how Jared and Ninia came together and how the title , Roped , was part of that fun . The growing love between the couple was tender without being sappy and Ninia 's support of Jared the right balance of nurture without pandering or fussing . There was a slightly non-starter of a storyline with Jared 's sister and I wonder if there is more about her in the subsequent books , I hope so ! Roped is steamy and sultry , ticks all the boxes of an erotic romance and has some extra elements in it that makes it a real page-turning read . I would definitely recommend it to a friend who enjoys spicy reading material.Originally posted at LAS Erotic Reviews	1
BDSM books are my favorite.This one however was not a 5 star read.In the m & eacute ; nage scene there were mistakes with the names , and it was n't all that hot.The head shaving was also a weird concept and not sexy or hot.I liked that Jared was portrayed as an amputee , it made it more current and real than a perfect Dom.Also it states that it is over 200 pages which it s not , it is a short novel .	1
This is an enjoyable read covers a sensitive subject with humor and a lot of great sex . Both parties learn as they go along . Hope you enjoy it as much as I did .	1
Great read hope to see more about this writer 's stories from free kindle books store . I hope the story never need s	1
I did n't expect much , but I still did n't find myself disappointed . This is one of those guilty pleasure reads so do n't expect much plot.At times it did get a little weird . Some of the language was over used and kind of awkward .	1
This was a sexy read with a spoilt princess and a barbarian whats not to like about that ? we do have some girl on girl action in this one just fyi but overall pretty dang hot	1
Here you get the continuation of the story between Cynyr and Angiel . The Jakotai warrior is still looking for her and wo n't give up his woman . You get that and you get to meet all the reaper 's in preparation for the rest of the series ! Fast passing !	1
I have loved every book by Katie and this one did n't disappoint . I wish the story had been a little longer though .	1
I 've read a lot of craft books and attended many writing workshops , but Alexandra Sokoloff 's Screenwriting Tricks For Authors is an amazing tool that I refer to over and over again . The author discusses writing techniques in practical terms and gives plenty of examples to drive home the point . I 've heard Sokoloff present workshops several times , and she is clearly an expert in her field . The tone of her craft book is similar to how she comes off in person -- confident , knowledgable , and relatable . Whenever I read this book , I always come away with greater faith in my ability to tell an engaging and entertaining story . I especially love how she provides information on how to analyze a manuscript for specific elements , such as suspense . Definitely pick this up if you want to be a better fiction writer !	1
Southern Debutante Madison Lee is a lot smarter than most people give her credit for , and the town where she lives loves her no matter what they think she is hiding . When she returns from her European vacation she seems to have not only had the best sex of her life but she now turns into a werewolf monthly . While this has allowed for a bit of revenge on some it is killing her in depilatory cream department . What she never expects is to have Nicholi show up inNicholi seems to be the investor who is going to help move the Lee Manufacturing group into the 21st century . But , will Madison stand for it or will she drive the one man she has looked at more than once away ? Before she can decide it appears there are killers on the loose looking for Nicholi and there is also the biggest Cotillion of the year at the end of the week.I have to admit I love a writer who can not only have fun with their characters but can even give them a lot of spunk , and have it work . In this case Madison at one point even comments that she is snarky . Loved it ! Where Love Blooms is n't your typical werewolf story and I think that is one of the things that make it a fantastic read . I could n't wait to see what Madison would do next , or what Nicholi would react to when she did . The highest praise I can give Where Love Blooms is to make it a Joyfully Recommended Read , and I feel that is just what it deserves . Run , ok southern ladies do n't run ; order it for your electronic reading device as soon as you can.Reviewed by TanyaFor Joyfully Reviewed	1
I enjoyed this book , laughed out loud so many times . The situations , small town environment and the interaction of the characters is very well done . What a blast ! Okay heading over to get the next one .	1
I fell in love with this story and simply could n't put it down , even though I was supposed to be doing other things ! It is a definite page turner . I had to see how things turned out for the characters . It is well-written with fast-paced , exciting action . I instantly fell in love with Davyn who is a true hero , I have to say . I love Tami Dee 's sexy Vikings and ca n't wait to read more !	1
Dee crafts a tale full of excitement , adventure , and love with `` Dawn of a Viking Sunrise . '' Rosie Chan and her cousin , Singlee , are accidently sent back through time , but after being stranded in the past , will they still want to go back to their time in 2009 San Francisco ? Dee 's writing grabs the reader 's attention immediately and does n't let go . The plot moves fast and transitions well.The characters are compelling . Rosie has been spoiled her whole life , and when she 's kidnapped , she learns what it means to be truly humble and thankful for the gifts in her life . Davyn also has some things to learn . When he finds his wife half starved to death in a neighboring Laird 's dungeon , he pushes aside his `` alpha '' personality to give her what she needs to survive . Singlee also has to face his problems . He does n't take things as seriously as he should . How these characters grow are a delight to the reader.Dee 's descriptions are vivid using a good economy of words . It 's easy to picture her novel 's settings . The story is `` sophisticated '' for romance readers with a love scene between Rosie and Davyn . `` Dawn of a Viking Sunrise '' is an action packed thrill ride filled with heartache , loss , and love .	1

What about first impressions ? Do you tend to jump to conclusions when you meet someone for the first time ? What kind of first impression do you leave ? Sammie is a female officer in the Army , stationed at Fort Huachuca , Arizona awaiting deployment to the Middle East . During her down time she decided to join a local acting troop in Tombstone to learn how to flirt with a man . Sammie had not had much practice in the art of attracting boys due to a strict upbringing by her mother . Sammie goes into a local shop , Shady Lady 's Closet , to find a costume to wear . After she picks out something , she tries it on and although she likes what she sees , she 's a bit embarrassed by how much of her is showing.Jimmy is a counselor who likes to people watch . He says it helps in his job . He also enjoys acting with the Tombstone actors and is playing the part of the lonely stud . And with him it is an act . He has decided not to get too attached to any young woman until God directs him to `` the one '' . When he sees Sammie , he almost ca n't believe his eyes . She 's almost too pretty to be real . Is there something familiar about her ? I liked how Jimmy stood by his convictions . Even when it got hard , he stayed true to his faith . Not that it was always easy ! When Sammie and Jimmy get together there is definitely sparks . I got a kick out of how Sammie was trying to be something she definitely was not . She had no idea what she was doing in the flirting department.Michelle did a wonderful job of creating the characters and developing Jimmy and Sammie 's relationship . It does get a little steamy but not too much . I 'm looking forward to the next one in this series .	1
Ms Michelle Sutton has written a wonderful poignant book about the connection of two people who faced problems and struggled daily to overcome them . It is unusual to read an inspirational story with true-to-life conflicts the characters have to face . This one was realistic . It delved into how they had to deal with their sensuality . I found this book so believable and did n't want to put it down.Sutton explored her characters as they both wrestled with their emotional conflicts . She presented more in-depth studies of this couple than is usual . I felt as if I was living through this with them . There were several supporting individuals in the manuscript that played pivotal , although small , roles.I am excited that this is the first in a series . I can not wait to read the others . This is another author I plan to put on my ` must-read ' list . I highly recommend this book to others . It has a fabulous storyline and Sutton 's writing style is great . Kudos , Ms. Sutton ! - Brenda Talley	1
Four good stories ; great price.Benjamin Button : Born as a 70 year old man , Button is oft rejected by his Father ( surprisingly no real mention of his mother - ever ) and all social institutions appropriate for his age . As he gets older , he is in fact aging in reverse - meaning that things sort of balance out when he 's roughly 35 . He gradually reverts physically to infantilism where the story ends . In my own opinion it may have been more interesting if Fitzgerald had pressed further biologically and had him turned zygotic then divided sperm / egg and then ultimate non-existence ... but that 'd be too surreal ( note : sarcasm ) .Bernice Gets a Bob : Women 's hair - contextually for the time a hot-point issue , short hair was rebellious and usually seen as defeminizing ( I 'm a huge sucker for short-ish hair , wicked sexy - hello 2012 ! ) . Bernice , one of the most boring women depicted in literature , begins taking lessons on how to attract men from her cousin Marjorie . What Bernice is unaware of is that it is all part of a grand ruse to humiliate her . She , however , in the wee hours of the night has the last laugh and ultimate vindication - what you maliciously hope happens , does and it 's fulfilling.The Jelly Bean : A ` jelly bean ' is someone who is no more than an idler , a tumbleweed that rolls whichever way the wind blows and seems to have no interest in manifesting their own ambitions ( if they even have any ) .The story revolves around Jim , the jelly-bean , who idles about doing much of nothing and not showing much interest in doing anything anyhow . That is until he re-encounters Nancy and is prepared to change his life and do something with it ... I do suppose though that when love goes awry before take-off , reversion to what you are familiar is only natural.Dalyrimple Goes Wrong : Caught in the grind a young man turns to dishonest ways of getting ahead . He rationalizes that the only way to get to the top is to ` be hard ' , which basically translates to : doing whatever you want sans moral scruples because someone , somewhere , is going to do the same to you . Humanistic in the most pessimistic sense , it 's no wonder that Dalyrimple aligns with politics .	1
I purchase this Kindle Single for no reason except the name . After reading the short story , I was hooked on Repairman Jack	1
I have n't gotten around to the Repairman Jack novels , although I have been exposed to F. Paul Wilson 's works . I really thought this stood out , however ; I 'm not sure how to explain why . Perhaps I feel that Wilson 'claimed ' Jack more , somehow , or that he felt more strongly attached to or connected with Jack more.Regardless , I think that this is the best of Wilson 's work I 've read yet , and I could n't put this down . The writing is sharp , and I felt as if I were more in suspense while I read it . I would suggest this to any horror fan , especially if they have n't read the RJ novels yet ; I understand that if I read All the Rage that I 'll reread this , but I honestly would n't mind . This was worth a dollar to get introduced to Repairman Jack ; I would have been more hesitant to buy the first novel without having read this story first . Now , however , I am eager to continue reading this series .	1
Having read other repairman jack stories , I was pleased to find this one . However , this deals more in the realm of science fiction or fantasy than plain realistic action . Still , the descriptions of the people and places of the Pine Barrens in NJ were very interesting and seemed realistic . I always wondered what was between those far-apart exits on the NJ Turnpike ... .	1
Very high quality science fiction in the old style . Some of the predictions of future technology were very entertaining such as high speed micro tapes that perform their own indexing and searching .	1
I thoroughly enjoyed this novella . Not many words but lots of heat . Seven Minutes in Heaven was very engaging and I had trouble putting it down . Recommended .	1
i really enjoyed this book . i wish this book had been a little longer . looking forward to reading book 2 .	1
I loved this story . Every woman fantasizes about a love like this . You nailed it ! I look forward to more like this .	1
Loved it ! Cant wait to read the rest n the series . Jaci Burton rocks ! Love all her books . 4 star : )	1
Great imagination ! Could have had more depth and back story to the past . Wish it was longer but an overall great quick read ! Give me more Skin !	1
I ca n't get enough do tatt 's ! The story is n't what you expect either . It was a really engaging read . I 've also read slither and hope there will be more to this series ...	1
This book was super hot and not what I thought it would be about . It is full of smoking hot love scenes and some definite paranormal thrown in as well . I would recommend this book you will fall in love with the characters and be looking for the next book when you are done to see what happens to Heath	1
I love this series of books I think everybody would love to read this book and the rest of the series	1
I really enjoyed this short story . Readable in one sitting , it was entertaining and what I thought would be predictable , but there was a twist at the end which was a nice surprise . The male lead is entertaining and not too outlandish and the female lead is bland enough that most readers can easily put themselves in her shoes . A very nice diversion for a rainy afternoon .	1
I like Karen Erickson and I really enjoyed this story . Celeste was great , warm , intelligent and forgiving . I did n't like Alex that much - well , he was decided to steal from her just to make his horrible father happy , he lied to her and run away when it got dangerous . At least he was handsome . All in all , a nice read .	1
No wonder Mari Carr is a best selling author . What a great read . Read the book in one sitting and I 'll read it again and again !	1
This book was great and I loved reading it . I loved the characters and all the great sex we had ! I would love to meet my own Ryan ! ! !	1
It mixes the past and the present . Which one to believe . It held my attention throughout . You know that it did not happen , but you know you what ... maybe it did , and it take your imagination where the writer wanted you to go . It puts your mind in a dream world and makes you forget today 's mixed up world . Imagination	1
I am so very thrilled with this story , I was sad when I thought that Kelsey would leave her husband behind . I was ecstatic when he was shot and she refused to leave him ... Even happier that they went back to to the Lakota ! I would have stayed too !	1
A truly satisfying read . This is the first time I 've ever read a novel of this um ... . nature and I have to say I was not disappointed . I was glued to my Kindle .	1
I had a great time reading this one ! I love sci fi , so this one fed that need . Also , the story was well written , plot believable , characters were fun.There is also a nice amount of hot sex in this . I love the female character , she is strong , intelligent and quite believable . The two male characters were fun as well.My ice cube rating for this one is four ice cubes to cool down after this read . I had fun with this one , thanks to the writer !	1
This is another one of Lora Leigh 's books that I love . She really gets you into the moment and she also has a story behind it . It is not to short , but not to long either .	1
Steamy menage erotic story . But it also has a good love story . I liked this book enough to buy all the others in this series . If you 're not into unconventional explicit sex stories , do n't buy this ... but if you have an open mind and love steamy graphic sex.. BUY THIS BOOK !	1
Not really much of a story , but who cares ! The sex is off the charts ! ! If you read this book , makes sure its on a weekend and you have your husband , boyfriend or BOB available . You 're going to need it !	1
I enjoyed the first book so much , I bought books 2 and 3 to see how the story ends . Humans may be the weaker party in the series , but they put up a good fight against both vampires and thralls as they fight for survival . The book has great characters and plenty of action . I ca n't wait to read the third book in the series .	1
I like the 'good ' vampire novels , like Anne Rice . This book was free so I expected to read maybe two chapters and say 'this is corny ' . But it was really exciting from the get-go . And more believable than alot of the ridiculous stuff out there now . This is a real page turner . I 'd look up at the clock to be shocked how much time had passed . I 'm getting ready to buy the rest of the series . I have my Vampire Apocalypse , coffee , snacks and my couch and they will get much use tonight .	1
Apocalypse meet vampires , I 'm sure you two will get along great . In this story humanity has really messed things up and is in a world of trouble that 's all our own fault . As if the end of the world was n't enough though , now the vampires have decided that humanity is no longer organized enough to be any kind of a threat and come out in the open to conquer and enslave . Humans are now cattle , drugged into submission , and constantly on tap to feed the vamps . There is a glimmer of hope however , in the form of a small group of resistance fighters that have found ways to avoid the drugs and are now fighting back for real.I have to say this combination worked great for me . It just makes sense that if vampires did exist and we all but wiped out technology and began isolating ourselves in ever smaller communities with little to no communication to the outside , then those vampires would see this as a great chance to take over with little to no risk . And as happens here it would be simple for them . The serum used afterward just makes sense , the vampires are n't stupid , they would come up with ways to control their food . No aspect of the story seems unlikely at all , and the author does a great job of telling it . If you like vampires , or end of the world scenario stories then I could n't recommend this one highly enough , you will definitely enjoy it .	1
Vampire Apocalypse is a yummy way to spend a rainy Saturday if you are in the mood for a good romp with the vamps !	1
The Bible is always the BEST book anywhere ever ! My entire family enjoy reading the Bible . I am thinking of getting another version .	1
I love to be able to look up the bible verses so easily and I love the convenience of having it easily accessible on my kindle and easy to store .	1
The synopsis has been comprehensively attended to by other reviewers . Helene and Daniel were both interesting characters in this intense novella of Dominance and Submission . What starts out as the manipulation of Helene through blackmail becomes a love story . The novella is explicit but it also shows the psychological struggle that Helene undergoes . It also touches on the strength and insight that Helene gains through her submission to Daniel . Daniel `` sees '' Helene for what she is , a submissive woman.For a novella this is a compact , intense story . Both Daniel 's and Helene 's feelings were well explored . The only concept that I had difficulty with , Helene had no realisation that she had met Daniel before . But for a short novella it was surprisingly comprehensive and erotic .	1
Great read . Very steamy well written and makes me wish I could be in her place ! A must read for the adventurous at heart .	1
Very good read . This book is very hot to read . It is not for the soft at heart . But well worth the time I took to read .	1

Ty Ransome may be the latest Hollywood director and action-flick hero superstar , but he is tired of playing the same old roles . He wants to make a serious movie , one that means something to him , and he knows exactly what book he wants to base his movie on : a collection of four stories titled Evening Songs . This book touched him and spoke to something within him that he did n't know existed , and he has finally persuaded the author to come to Hollywood and co-write the screenplay with him.When Ty finally meets Gwen Preston in person , she strikes the same chord within him as did her book . As they work through the scenes of the movie , their role-play becomes intensely sexual and delves into the BDSM elements of the stories . Having read her stories , Ty knows she is a sexual submissive , but he did n't realize just how affected he would be by her . He wants to dominate her completely in the bedroom and love and cherish her in their daily lives.But Gwen is not as willing to accept that part of her personality as Ty is . Regardless of the sexuality of the stories she wrote , she is convinced that her need for rough and submissive sex is something to be ashamed of , not something to embrace . It 's up to Ty to convince her that her needs are natural ... and that the two of them are destined to be together . ********I 'll admit that BDSM is not my flavor of choice when it comes to reading material . However , no one twisted my arm to read this story . I purchased it for myself , because something about the blurb ( and the gorgeous cover image , I have to admit that ) interested me . Maybe it was the fairy-tale appeal of the Hollywood actor finding love with a `` commoner , '' but I think that it was actually the promise of tenderness and discovery that intrigued me . Mari Carr 's novella `` Rough Cut '' is the story of a woman who learns to accept herself and embrace her needs and who finds the love of a lifetime while she is at it.Ms . Carr gives us a couple of three-dimensional and complex main characters in this story . Both struggle a bit with their non-traditional relationship . While Ty does n't have problems with being a dominant , he is absolutely surprised at both his emotional reaction to Gwen and his realization that the hard sexual play between them is necessary to him . Gwen is ashamed of her sexual needs and thinks she must have some terrible sort of character flaw as a result . `` Rough Cut '' includes something of a story within a story . Along with the love story between the two characters , we also have the four short stories that Ty and Gwen are transforming into a screenplay . While none of those individual plots are delved into in detail , Ms. Carr gives us enough to make the stories and the idea of a film resulting from them intriguing and to elicit a bit of an emotional reaction from the reader . Well , an emotional reaction from me , anyway . I found the premise of the final of the four stories to be quite touching.Ms . Carr has titled the chapters of this story to give the reader just a tease of what to expect over the next few pages . I thought this was well-done and entertaining . `` Rough Cut '' brings home the fact that light BDSM can belong in a loving relationship and that it is not just one person shoving another person around and whaling blindly on them . I found this to be a very sexy and surprisingly sweet read , and I also enjoyed the Hollywood fantasy aspect . Overall , I thought `` Rough Cut '' was well worth my reading time , and I shall probably be investigating what else Ms. Carr has to offer her readers soon .	1
Loved this story , shows the struggle that many people have of coming to terms of what they like sexually and out of the norm . The chemistry between the characters were amazing , the sex scenes written brilliantly . I love a good story especially one that makes me cry at the end . This is a must read for Mari Carr 's fans , and even if you are not a fan this is a good way to start .	1
LOVED this book . makes me want to be an erotic writer . it was so hot . Hollywood Movie star/producer want me to write a screen play with him at his house for 2-3 monthes ... ok , when do we start ?	1
Love all of Eden Bradley 's book , this series is very good and easy to read , I would recommend it . Awesome ! !	1

NO SPOILERS or plot summaries . Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL : Book 1 of a light , but lusty para-romance featuring m & eacute ; nage up front and center , some BSDM . Quick note on the m & eacute ; nage- this is about two men falling for the same woman and sharing her , not each other . Not very complex mythos , focus is very much on the erotica but satisfying in that . I 'm a BIG fan of Alexander 's `` Children of the Goddess '' series , so the lack of complex mythology here was a bit disappointing.CHARACTERS : Surprisingly down to earth for a bunch of witches . All very sexy , but not a lot of depth . The three central characters were not given equal face time , so I came away with an unbalanced sense of them . The story was told from third person perspective , limited omniscient on Callie- without the benefit of shifting from character to character that you find in the `` Children of the Goddess , '' so you do n't get to know Tyghe and Tucker as well as you 'd like . Left me feeling a little unsatisfied because they were great characters.BOTTOM LINE : This is a fast , hot read with only enough substance to carry the story . Climax of plotline was anti-climactic , but the sex sure was n't . If you are a fan of Alexander , you 'll enjoy this despite the lack of richness . I look forward to reading more of the series and hopefully it will only pick up intensity.RECOMMENDATIONS:1 . Vivian Arend'sTidal Wave : Forces of Nature , Book 1- with frolicking dolphins and alsoStormchild : Pacific Passion , Book 1- with multiple seaside creature shifters . Both also light , lusty reads.2 . Anya Bast'sWitch Fire ( Elemental Witches , Book 1 ) - sweet , sexy para-romance with witches , demons and more3 . Kresley Cole 's adventurous and intricate magical romance series ( never mind the ridiculous title ) : A Hunger Like No Other ( Immortals After Dark , Book 1 ) 4 . Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob ( The Nightwalkers , Book 1 ) - demons , were , vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy5 . Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound ( Demonica , Book 1 ) - demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city . Not as well written as the others.6 . Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters , vamps and Greek gods . The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.7 . Renee Michaels ' sexually adventurous , but basic werewolf romanceHer Chosen Wolf : The Were Chronicles , Book 18 . J.R. Ward'sDark Lover ( Black Dagger Brotherhood , Book 1 ) - also darker , more violent and incredibly intense vampire romance series . Vampires protect the world from evil . Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.9 . Lara Adrian'sKiss of Midnight ( The Midnight Breed , Book 1 ) - also darker , more violent , but incredibly intense . Vampires protect the world from their evil brethren .	1
My first read by this author . Good story surprising twist at the end . Hoping there is more so that we can see when Callow & her men go to next .	1
This book was intriguing , and heartfelt . I liked the relationships between the characters , sexy without being too hardcore . Recommend this book for people who like romance .	1
When the author herself gives this type of warning , you have to be intrigued : & # 34 ; Warning : Explicit sex , magical dresses , mind-reading rooms , and mind-boggling threesomes. & # 34 ; This is a novella , but a nice , sexy read with a HEA , and some hot menage action . Plus there 's magical intrigue and an evil person out to kill the heroine .	1
**IF YOU ARE NOT A FAN OF EROTICA DO N'T READ THIS ONE** IF YOU ARE THIS SHORT IS A MUST READ . THE BEST SHORT STORY I 'VE READ THUS FAR .

I really liked Wicked Sexy . The story line was something that I have n't read yet and I must say that I was surprised . If you 've ever fantasied about having two gorgeous men at once and for your dreams to become reality then this is a must read .	1
An exceptional read , it was completely different approach to the crime/thriller genre . The author focuses on the emotions of the main characters , while the crimes play a secondary role . The victim looks back upon her decisions and how her needs overshadowed the one she left behind . The detective in charge fights with guilt , anger and almost wallows in self pity . This approach made the book off genre , whilst at the the same time staying completely in genre . I absolutely loved the ending , it was truly a brilliant piece of work and I found myself sucking in my breath and then almost groaning , as I realised what had happened . Except for one or two language glitches this was a great read and I highly recommend the author . I received a free copy of this book for my review.Before Her Eyes ( Thriller , mystery )	1
I requested this book from Rebecca Forster , the author , because I loved her novel , Hostile Witness , and she was kind enough to oblige . I give this novel 3.5 stars.Before Her Eyes focuses on two protagonists , Dove , a hard-boiled small town policeman , and Tessa , the beautiful model that has vanished . The setup is interesting -- there is a dead man in a convenience store , which is the last place Tessa was seen before she vanished . We see alternating perspectives between Dove in a tight third person , and Tessa in first person . As Dove tries to track down Tessa , he finds himself uncovering mysteries that others hoped to keep hidden.The strengths of this novel include some of the great description and some interesting plot twists . Forster excels at revealing secrets and bringing the unexpected.However , I had some difficulties with this novel . The pacing is a little off -- I found myself uncertain why we were following Tessa at all . The middle drags some as we wander around with Dove trying to figure out what is going on . And although I really enjoyed the twists , particularly at the end , some of them still do n't quite make sense to me.That said , I still think Forster is one to watch -- and her Witness series is excellent . This was not my favorite of her books , but still a fun read .	1
I actually really enjoyed this book . It was one that kept me wondering . If I 'm reading a book and ca n't put it down , then it 's pretty interesting .	1
Ms. Forster does n't make this story easy to read . Instead she weaves a wealth of seemingly unrelated threads into a tapestry of amazing depth . What some might see as a slow start is a masterful building of a solid platform leading the reader into a complex , satisfying story . I came to the end realized not once did she mislead me , I was just too caught up in the characters to see the subtle hint . The iconic story of an ethical sheriff vs. personal disappointments , corruption , drug dealers and culture clashes would make an amazing movie . Unfortunately you would lose the most important part of the book . Ms. Forster has always been an impressive storyteller but this transcends even her Witness series . Thank you for a wonderful weekend of reading .	1
`` Before Her Eyes '' is not usually the kind of book I read , but I agreed to review this book as a nice break from the usual fantasy and science fiction books I review . I thought it would be a quick and easy read of solving a murder mystery in a small town , but I was wrong . This book is so much more than that and made me do a lot of thinking about how we all judge people based on our own perceptions and biases of who we think they are when we look at them.The story revolves around Sherriff Dove Connelly , a good moral stand-up kind of guy who battles his own inner demons while trying to solve the murder of his friend , Fritz , the local store owner , and the kidnapping of Tessa Bradley , a local socialite , from the scene of the crime . Throughout the investigation that covers 48 hours , everything that Dove thought he knew about the people of his mountain enclave is challenged , warped and then twisted back into a new slot . Even Dove himself must undergo this torturous journey if he ever wants to have peace and happiness with his wife and child.The author lets the story unfold through two viewpoints - third person to follow Dove and the investigation and first person for Tessa Bradley . It is Tessa 's voice that draws you in , haunts you , makes you listen to her , and leaves you a shadow of former yourself when she 's done with you . Her beauty blinds all who see her , but no one really sees her , no one really knows her , all except for one , and he 's never met her before . Dove is determined to find Tessa not because she 's a beautiful woman , but because she is a woman in need and that 's his job.This book makes you think and I like that . I highly recommend it , but make sure you carve out the time to read it because once you start , you wo n't want to put it down until the last word is read.I received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for a fair and honest review .	1
That 's a product description that makes you want to read the book . I found `` Before Her Eyes '' very ingeniously engaging , believable in plot as well as the rich character development throughout . You find yourself guessing what the outcome will be but you will continue to read on because it becomes evident that things are not what they seem . Rebecca gives an attention-grabbing ebb and flow to the writing style that keeps your attention throughout as you find yourself right next to Sheriff Connelly helping him along his path to find Tessa alive , her kidnappers , murder suspects as well as encounter corruption along the way that threatens to deter him from doing his job . You wo n't even begin to know how it will end until every last word is read.Other 's you might like : SILENT WITNESS ( legal thriller , thriller ) ( The Witness Series ) PRIVILEGED WITNESS ( legal thriller , thriller ) ( The Witness Series )	1
This is the second book that I 've read from Rebecca Forster . What can I say ? She 's done it again ! I loved this book.Rebecca Forster 's novel , Before Her Eyes , draws you in from the very beginning and keeps building momentum . This book walks you beautifully through a murder investigation and the hunt for a missing woman . While following the investigation , we get insight into what the missing woman is going through in first person dialog that kept me intrigued throughout the book . I also really liked the back story for each of the characters , and how it affects them and others throughout the story Rebecca is telling . WAIT UNTIL YOU READ THE ENDING ! There are some surprises in store . This is a must read .	1
I should know better , but i always expect that books in a box set are likely to disappoint . As if authors dump their duds into these sets just to make a couple bucks they 'd never make on their own . This was included in a 9-book set of murder mysteries that have yet to disappoint ! I thoroughly respect Forester 's method for maintaining hope in the face of despair..of keeping the reader in the dark with the lights all on . Without spoiling the story , realize I awarded it 5 stars and rave about the technique . Say no more !	1
Everything I expected to happen in this book did not . I was so surprised with some of the revelations of the end of the book , I emailed someone at 11 pm who is very familiar with this book `` Wow , I did not expect that to happen ! `` ... Great ending ! This book bounced around a bit at the beginning , it took a bit for me to get into it . But the characters grabbed my attention quickly ; I liked Dove right off and wanted to know more of his history with Cherie and the baby . I hurt for Bernadette and Dove for losing Fritz , and wanted to know who killed him . And I wanted to see how Tessa reunited with her family . Another great book from Rebecca Forster .	1
This is a 4 1/2 star read . I wanted more for the ending . This is an IR but once you get to know the characters you forget about race and concentrate on the growing friendship and romance . I would l love to read a story about Ricky 's little brother .	1
Goodness me , EnvyNone has put down so eloquently what I feel about this book . First off I must say it was a wonderful book and so enjoyable to see how Rick and Carolyn 's attraction developed over time . You could understand how two seemingly different people could fall in love against the odds but even if it all sounds a bit too far-fetched it completely immerses you in the fantasy . The downside was that I occasionally struggled to attribute a name to the dialogue in parts . Also I may be slow on the uptake but some scenes were too cryptic for me ; as EnvyNone said I did feel I had walked in the middle of a conversation I knew nothing about and worse ; the other parties did not bother to elaborate . So though these issues did not detract much from the engaging story , I could only award 4 star 's . Still , a truly great read and I will be looking out for this author 's future work . Other writers of IRR fiction please take note ! A solid , well written , articulate story is always worth it 's weight in gold .	1
Now that is a real story . I could so see it happening . With a real couple . The story continues to capture you from beginning to end making you feel as if it a friend you know and care about . It brings a few issues to light and makes you realize how hard we are on those we say are not ... ... Sweet and engaging . A must read . Nobody 's hero finds a little bit of hero in the strangest places .	1
I absolutely loved the story line . I was captivated by the relationship . It was refreshing to read a romance novel that showed some real life struggles . This book is a definite keeper .	1
I am so not going to be a hater ! Her writing style is different and leaves some question for the flow of the story but I found myself loving all of the characters involved because they were real . In essence they are both writers and finding their true dream involved having each other . The dynamic and amount of miss understandings was quite astounding considering where they were coming from . Writing in any form is easy to get confused when it all gets lost or artfully hidden in translation.The very clear thing is that love finds you in a moment that colors your past , present and future with a kaleidoscope of color and nuances that can be missed if the heart is closed . This is not a book for everyone who enjoys IR stories . This is well developed and thought but has the ability to confuse the reader if you are not familiar with rap and the disconnect of truth and prose mixed with sarcasm to cover the pain and confusion involved in the lyrics . There is a lot of emotion and personal truths for these characters and the readers to wade through . Love is the truth even in all the contradictions and misunderstandings involving the human heart . It is n't simpl or complex but a medley of everything great , small and everything I between.I highly recommend this book on price and the depth this author went to for these characters to be so real . I have paid more for worse reads . Why not a 5 star rating you think ? Because I believe this is n't her best work and the little jumps in thought that can be down right frustrating to readers who want a straight forward story without getting confused or lost in the realism of the human condition as it pertains to love in all it 's forms and colors .	1
A Dominant with a soft heart . Wow ! The best of both worlds . I loved both characters and feel as if I could be Jax . Highly successful and in charge of EVERYTHING all day . I want a masked man to come along and dominate me in the dark hours .	1
How could anyone not buy this book once you see the cover ? . Story inside is just as yummy . Would like a beast of my own .	1
this book was good , it started out better but then I got too long and kind of boring but I liked it .	1
Such a sexy story . Could n't wait to read on to see what was going to happen next . Loved the characters	1
And this book did not disappoint . The chararcters are great , story interesting and sex scenes hot . What more can you ask for ?	1
I enjoy Beth Kery 's work ... I was n't sure where it was leading me at the beginning but was well worth the reading to get there . Very steamy !	1
enjoyed reading this one and would like to read more as well it 's good enough to re-read as well and enjoy it all overe again	1
I rate the erotica genre differently . I give this book 4 stars . Very light read , took me about an hour with minor disruptions included.I enjoyed this book . Very few errors and the ending was perfect . All of the characters leaked sex appeal from the pages and scenes were descriptive enough to enthrall you . Everybody needs a Craig ! The entire time my inner dialogue went something like this : She did THAT ! ? She would n't , would she ? ! SHE DID ! And WHAT is that for ? Oh , that 's what that is.I really did n't see this coming.And neither did she . ( Clears throat ) Or he.He would n't dare ! Oh My ... he WOULD ! I ca n't believe this ! They really went there.Well , if that does n't sum up this novella ... I do n't know what does . I unlike one reviewer in particular , did not find the pace of this book off . Actually I really could n't imagine it being any faster or slower without ruining the overall feel . But , I do n't read many short-story eroticas so to each their own . The main character Jessica could have used some fine tuning just to make her more relatable , however , I do n't believe that made or broke this story . I am the type of person that hates weak women ... or men . So I was pleasantly surprised that I could like BDSM.WHY THIS IS A 4 and NOT a 5 : Besides the aforementioned fine tuning in the character relatiability department , I actually wished there was more back-story to begin with . I believe this would make a lovely full-length novel , especially with those Bennett Brothers ! ! Overall , I do n't have many complaints.Good job to the author and happy reading to all !	1
This book has twists and turns that you wo n't see coming . It holds your attention right up until the end . I ca n't wait to read the next book	1
I ENJOYED the whole setup of the lonely mountain road and the cabin . It is not hard to imagine yourself in Lynne 's place .	1
This is one hot and steamy short story ... a perfect bedtime story ... short and sexy . If you like a man who likes to talk dirty then you 'll love this story .	1
This story was pure fun and a fantasy fullfilled ! The sex may be un realistic-but , a girl can dream , ca n't she ? What made it even better was the soft , tender heart the hero had hidden under his uninhibited wild side . Love it ! It would be fantastic to hear Rick 's story now .	1
This was the first work by Ruth D. Kerce that I 've read & wow , it did not disappoint ! I 'll definitely be looking more into this author . Virgin Seeks Bad-Ass Boy is the perfect 'quickie ' if you 're looking for a short & erotically charged story . This one delivers ... and them some ! Ms. Kerce definitely knows how to write an erotica and she does it very well judging by this story . Considering how short this story was , the characters were developed along with the plot & storyline . The writing flowed smoothly & I enjoyed reading every hot minute of it . So my last words , I highly recommend Virgin Seeks Bad-Ass Boy . It is a well-written erotica and definitely a panty-melter ! So grab this one if you 're looking for some heart-pumping , panty-melting fun . However , I must warn , grab a fan and do n't read in public . This one 's a scorcher ! ; )	1
This was a fun and very Steamy story . A fun fast read . Alice ( Ali ) is a 24 yr. old virgin librarian . Caleb is the guy across the street who seems to have a parade of women going in and out of his house . Ali decides she does n't want to be a virgin anymore so she walks up to Caleb , while he is working on his motorcycle , and asks him if he 'd like to help her out of her dilemma . I know that sounds a little far fetched but what fun and excitement . She does n't even know him except by sight . But he 's hot looking and she thinks about him a lot.I recommend this book to those who like contemporary erotic romances like me . With an HEA .	1
I loved this book . It was interesting due to the fact that it took Sir James a LONG time to respond to Rachel in any kind of a sexual manner . He deals with her training in an almost `` clinical '' way . The reader is unaware that the Dom is falling for the sub through a good portion of the book . I also liked that this book dealt honestly with some of the practical issues of cleanliness of being a sub . As always Sierra captures the true spirit of a D/s relationship . Worthy book to read .	1
I enjoyed this book . we all make choices and have to live with the consequences . These people have done wrong and you see how everyone handles their consequences differently .	1
What a refreshing story . Written in the style of Charles Dickens with some of the same sentiments and twists of fate that he used , this tale tells of a setting about 100 years ago , when honor still meant something and love trumped all .	1
I believe it is even harder to write a good short story or novella than a full length novel . The restraint of space in which to develope characters , pen a plot , cause a conflice and resolve it are limited to say the least . This author is brilliant at it . I ca n't wait to read more of his work .	1
This was a great short read . Mr. Graham was able to pull me into the story , so much so I was a little disappointed it ended so soon . This is the 2nd novella I 've read from Mr. Graham , and I 'm looking forward to reading much more from him !	1
This book was so great I forgot about the clothes in the washer until I was done.I managed to get a freebie of one of Beth Kerry 's books and was so happy I quickly downloaded several others . Best decision ever.I loved this one , very hot and great read .	1
I really enjoyed this book . Even though Trick continually treated Grace really shabbily , there was such a vulnerability that you could not hold it against him . Between the great characters and some unforseen twists , this book is deserving of 5 stars ! ! ! !	1
A different approach to a story involving a wrong side of the tracks girl who falls for a right side of the track boy but ends up married to his father , who is killed and the whole town hates her for the marriage and the death of the older man.What I thought happened in the back story did n't really come to fruition - just another story and I did n't really see it coming . I enjoyed this book and wished there had been a little more tenderness with the heroine by the hero but there was a least a HEA for them regardless.My personal star and hotness rating is ... . & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 127775 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ; & # 128293 ;	1
loved this book , the characters were fantastic , recommend this love story to anyone wanting to get that gooey feeling again	1
This was a steamy and well written story with some interesting twists to the plot . I enjoyed it immensely . I did n't feel like I was left hanging like I do with many of the short stories . It had a beginning , a good story line and an a satisfactory ending . Well worth the read !	1
This book is Rated M for mature . From the first page to the last , there is no doubt that it is an erotica novel . But it is a work of art , that quite frankly , it reminded me of the the Japanese classic film , `` In the Realm of the Senses '' which though definitely X-rated is considered a work of art by film makers and film aficionados all over the world.That said , `` Tricked Truth '' is also a love story . Trick Burnett and Grace Jamison , two ill-starred lovers who after 13 years met each other again . Grace married Trick 's father when she was 17 , making her exactly 7 years younger than Trick . After a decade of being away from their hometown of Everly , Grace returns with her son Randy whose physical traits and personality characterists resemble the Burnetts so much that no one can deny his parentage.But , there were layers of secrets that Grace kept and Trick needed and wanted to find out so much . But , his attraction to his stepmother had not abated even after 13 long years . And the feeling is mutual . So , in the grand tradition of `` In the Realm of the Senses '' , sex was used for pleasure , for torture and sometimes , a weapon though definitely softened with love albeit one-sided at times.A great read for erotica and mystery/thrillers fans .	1
I loved how Trick tried with all his might not to want or care for Grace , but could n't help it in the end . In fact , the only thing I did n't like was the way Grace allowed Trick to treat her . It was as though she had no self esteem . It 's explained in the end , but I like strong-willed and sassy heroines usually . She did n't ever gripe or whine about it though , so that made up for it.Grace puts everyone ahead of herself . If you are ready for an emotional read , this is the book for you !	1
The cover is what drew me to the book , and Thoth ok free book , what can I loose ! ! ! I lost my heart to Trick and Graces story ! ! ! The story was so well told , and kept me in suspense ! ! Along with the steamy intimate scenes , yum ! ! !	1
Now you have the final sacrifice to save the races . This is indeed so close to following the teachings of the Bible and it even uses names from the Bible for God and his servants . Loved this series !	1
Finished reading this series and I just hope and pray I have not read the last of these characters . In my top 3 all time favorites !	1
Good one . Keeps the reader going - tend to go to fast - very exciting . I would recommend for excellent escape reading .	1
I would recommend this story to everyone who loves adventures . This should be made into a movie . I love all the characters Seth is my favorite .	1
A Beautifully written saga of the power of our Lord . I enjoyed this so much . I could n't put it down .	1
An outstanding conclusion to this trilogy ! A shame about what happens to King Dung ! A big surprise awaits you concerning the evil man-of-war ships . I would highly enjoy reading about the adventures of the new realm shifter , Prince Phineas , in another trilogy .	1
THE BOOK : This is a short novella.He marked her but did n't take her with him . Wolfe is man and a breed whose DNA was altered , infused with the genetic code of the wolf . Her mother , a Genetics Council scientist , created him and when the breeds are rescued from the labs she proclaims him dead and Hope has believed for 6 years Wolfe is dead.Wolfe is only waiting for the right time to claim her . But Hope 's mother , has forced his hand . She wants her creation back , and she wants any children he may breed with her daughter . His unique genetic makeup has created a male unlike any other and Hope is the one woman destined to be mate . Now Hope must convince her mate she has n't betrayed him , and they must defeat the plans of a scientist gone mad , her mother ... THE SERIES : This is the third of a series of currently 26 books thus far . The introduction of the Alpha and Lupina of the Wolf Breeds . The Feline 's have Sanctuary and the Wolves are building Haven . The premise of the story line sets a new slant on shape shifters . If you enjoy the genre you will find this book a good start in the series . The author notes on her website that the series was published over a few publishing houses and the series sequencing is hard to catch because titles are not set in true order and the mix between the different breeds makes for confusion in reading the titles . The sequencing on her website and the book descriptions are sketchy or incorrect . However , if you want a summer series to read , this is a good light read.7 out of 10 Bookends	1
This the first book by Charlotte Boyett-Compo that I have read and it will not be the last.I do like her voice . The characters are strong , good people and fun to read about . Cynyr Cree is an unlikely hero who saves a woman in distress , Aingeal . She is in an alley screaming for help as a man is trying to rape her . Cynyr quickly dispatched the man and leaves her to take care of herself . Later at his campsite he senses the woman 's presence and invites her to come closer and share his dinner . Before long they become lovers and enter into some wonderful adventures and a good bit of sexy loving . I enjoyed the story and am very pleased to learn that there are a lot more books in this series ! I will be ordering more soon !	1
This book was very different from what I had imagined and I loved it . The reaper concept was great and I look forward to reading more books by this author ! !	1
I was stuck between the four and five star rating . It was a page-turner for me with enough action to keep me interested . I really enjoyed the characters and this has to be the most original story I have ever read . Which is what brought me to the five star rating.The one thing about this story that made the reading difficult for me were the names , most of which I could not understand let alone pronounce . I found myself replacing the names in my head so that I could read through but too often I got caught up trying to figure out some sort of pronunciation for them so I lost track of the story . And because of the incomprehensible names of all the Reapers , I could n't find myself relating to them as individuals because I could n't keep their names straight in my head.The only other issue I had with this story was with the ending . It was a long story with a lot of very different issues they dealt with , so I though that it really should have had a conclusion , allowing book two to start off with a different character and their own trials . Or at the very least , allow for one of the other Reaper 's stories to take over book two but while working off the conclusion of book one . For instance , another Reaper could find his mate while in Haines City helping Cynyr and Aingeal with their battle . Although , I have only read the synopsis for book two , so maybe that did turn out to be the situation . But that did n't sound like the case in the description.Even with the above criticism I still managed to love the story . Go figure ! It was the first I 've been really excited about in a long time and had a difficult time putting it down . I would definitely recommend it . Just try to work out the names before you start . It will make the reading go smoother .	1
I really liked this book . The sex scenes were pretty hot . The history of their world was hinted at but it did n't get bogged down with a lot of detail . I do think it ended a little abruptly .	1
I was pulled into this story from the first page . I fell in love with the story . The sex scenes are hot , the romance is well written , and the were even some laughs . Well done Ravyn Wilde ! Perfect read .	1
The book was great . It is an erotica book so there is lots of sex and it is sci-fi/fantasy . So I do not understand people 's comments either about it being way out there or garbage . If you are not into the dominant male/sex slave wife sort of thing were the woman 's only real role is to pleasure the male and make sure he is happy it is not for you . So not sure what people were expecting other than that , but I recommend the book . Personally I have always liked the thought that there is only one perfect mate out there for you . The links help them to figure out who is their one true mate , as well as other things . In our world there would be draw backs to some of the other things the links do , however once again this is fantasy . I do also like the thought that the links can increase the sexual pleasure . With all that said Nyssa does start the female revolution in this book which continues on thru the 3rd book . They are all good .	1
Omg Lora Leigh writes another story that burns the pages of hottnes . she makes you want to be a part of the books she writes . looking forward to reading everything she writes	1
I do n't think i have picked up a book from Lora Leigh that I did n't like . She makes me wish I was in the book iteself .	1
I read this book in a few hours and LOVED every minute of it . I would definitely read this book again . This book brought out so many feelings in me in such a short time that I was immediately ready to lose control . It 's short but is definitely a must read . Lora Leigh does take her time and develop her characters and the story line .	1
I LOVED THIS BOOK ! ! ! It was such a nice way to wrap up the family 's tale . It had everything you need for the end of a series . I liked the way that Lora Leigh was able to get this family through everything and yet gave each one their own end in one book . If you have read this series it is a must read . For those who have not this brings interest to a group of people you will want to know more about .	1
Very steamy book . I loved this series . The story was quite a surprise . You can read as a stand alone book .	1
This is a Lora Leigh book , what else is there to be said . Anything written by Lora Leigh is great !	1
I wish I had Mikahla 's problem ! She is a women coming to the age when she needs to make a choice for a lifemate . Unfortunately she not found a man to marry yet and has choosen to choose from her 3 best friends . After a brief date with each of them she ca n't make up her mind so they deciede to help her make that choose . Very hot and steamy scence .	1
In general , I like military-type books , love the guns , enjoy the `` tough-guy '' soldier talk , the whole scene is pretty exciting . This book was no exception , even with some minor flaws , I still enjoyed the action . Worth the read just to find out what happens at the end .	1
I like Bob Mayer . He writes real well , good book . I like this kind of book , hard to put down .	1
I ca n't believe someone would agree to framing themselves for murder ! Even though I kind of figured out early on a little bit about what was going on , it was still interesting to see how it all unfolded .	1
I took a chance on this book and Im so glad I did . I really liked it . It was a really easy story to follow . I highly recommend it .	1
After reading Eric Christopherson 's marvelous thriller `` Crack-Up , '' I was highly skeptical that the author could repeat such a success . I was wrong , very wrong . `` Frame-Up , '' by Mr. Christopherson and co-author Brad Schoenfeld , is every bit the equal of `` Crack-Up '' for ratcheting up the tension as the reader wonders if Will Pruett will really be executed for a murder he framed himself on.Even after will realizes that he 's been suckered into framing himself for the murder of a cop , it 's no certainty that he can escape the death penalty . His only hope lies in convincing police detectives Ortiz and Dyrstad of his innocence , not an easy job , especially with the Manhattan DA pushing for quick justice to help his struggling campaign for re-election . Fortunately for Will , the two detectives are determined to find the truth , despite having to sift through the red herrings in their way.There are some memorable characters in `` Frame-Up . '' Will Pruett is cool as a cucumber as he goes through the arrest process , but he never bargained on the dangers waiting for him at the jail on Rykers Island . Samantha Ortiz is a spicy enchilada of a detective who 's going to prosecute Pruett all the way to the death chamber , and it appears that she 's succeeding.If you 're into nonstop action thrillers , `` Frame-Up '' is for you .	1
Plot/Storyline : 4 3/4 StarsThis was not a `` figure it out '' mystery with clues dropped for the reader to ascertain what is going on . It was one-half police procedural and one-half thriller with a regular guy trying to figure out the clues.The book has an outstanding opening sentence that automatically made me want to read further . However , the first scene suffered to provide it , as the author ( s ) had to backtrack to `` fill-in '' . This backtracking was not very well done and caused a little confusion.The story progressed at a pretty fast clip , taking me along for the ride at a fast trot . New twists kept the story interesting with no filler added . The book also managed to give an interesting view of capital punishment without ever becoming ` preachy'.I found the mystery to be well-planned and well-executed in the writing . However , my first thought when the nefarious person ( or persons ) were uncovered was , `` Why go to all that trouble ? '' I did n't feel the author addressed that question in enough depth.I 'm still trying to decide if I liked the dual scenes at the end of the book . It certainly kept me enthralled , but I think that it could have been better told linearly . I kept trying to picture it as a movie with cut-scenes/flashbacks , and that almost worked.Character Development : 5 StarsWill was a very nicely developed character that any reader could empathize with somewhat . I do admit to wondering at times , `` Do all young , black ( or African American , if you prefer , but I 'm old ... LOL ) degreed professionals really think in terms of so much slang ? '' However , I ca n't take off for that because I , of course , have no idea what goes on in the minds of others . Also , it was relatively believable and gave Will 's character more depth.Sam , the lead detective on the case , was also a very good character . She was pretty and smart , without being a model or a genius . In other words , she was ` real'.My favorite character is actually the little old German lady . I was amazed at how well the author ( s ) portrayed the `` German attitude . '' I lived in Germany for three years and found many Germans to be of similar personality as this woman.Writing Style : 5 StarsThe sentence structuring is excellent thoughout the book . One thing I did not find here was a disparity between chapters that belied the fact that there were two authors . I could not tell who wrote what , which made me wonder if only one wrote while the other had ideas ? Either way , the writing flowed smoothly from beginning to end.The dialogue was filled with rich voices , giving each person their own distinct one . The descriptions were vivid , almost too much so when describing certain scenes.Editing : 4 3/4 StarsAlthough the grammatical editing was of professional caliber , I have to mark this section down a bit because of the dead man talking at the end . Yes , there is a scene with a man named Finch , but `` Lynch '' seems to change facial expressions and talk several times . Unfortunately , `` Lynch '' is the dead man that Will framed himself for killing in the beginning of the book , so I was pretty certain that he was n't chatting it up with the cops at the end of the book . It was pretty funny.Rating : R for Graphic Violence , Blood , Gore , Adult Situations****This review was originally posted on my blog . The author has stated that he has corrected the `` name problem '' I discussed in the `` Editing '' Section . `` ****	1
It has been a while ( I hate to confess ) since I have committed my brain to the inner workings of a `` cop thriller , '' but I am ecstatic to say that I still have that `` need '' to figure `` it '' out.There are few things better than trying to figure out a mystery , this is the exact reason television shows like CSI , and Bones have thrived for so long . The viewer , or reader ( in this case , ) is given a handful of situations and asked to figure out their significance , but right when you think you have it , the author takes those pieces , throws them into a Yahtzee cup , shakes them up and you have to start again.In `` Frame-Up '' Eric Christopherson and Brad Schoenfeld do exactly that.Will is a magazine journalist who 's life is about to change . On a mission to make an example out of New York 's legal system he does the unthinkable ... he frames himself for a murder he did n't commit . What murder exactly ? A racially motivated murder of a New York police officer . Hoping to get some insight ( and maybe a Pulitzer ) Will takes the plunge and lands himself in the slammer , but when his `` search for the ultimate story '' starts to become a little `` too real '' he is desperate to find a way out . Is it to late to take back all of the evidence he stacked against himself , and will the people that helped him get there have his back or will they leave him hanging ? While this is not necessarily a traditional `` who done it '' ( more a unique way of spouting the authors political views ) the writing/plot elements are still the same . The `` focused '' plot is immediately established in the opening sequence of the novel , and is then followed up by sub-connecting plots which are inserted to create a web of conflicting clues . The pace was quick and solid , leaving no time for the reader to nod off , and the characters ( with 1 exception ) were very will established and superbly detailed in not only their personal but business persona's.There was , however ... one VERY notable problem with character development ( this is the aforementioned exception ) `` Will '' is a very ( highly ) educated man . He not only spouts a private primary education , but a degree from Columbia , so the authors need to fill his inner and peer dialogue with rough Ebonics not only felt misplaced , but in places came across as ridiculous or offensive . Establishment of this character as having `` come from the ghetto '' was clear , and the authors ' constant need to reiterate his education made his use of words like `` fo shizzle '' sickeningly unbelievable and had me rolling my eyes.This novel was by no means perfect , but the twists and turns were enough to make it enjoyable . Approximately 70 % of the way in the plot gets smacked around making it hard to put down , and though then ending of the novel left a little to be desired , I would n't call it a deal breaker.All in all ? Intelligent story , captivating plot.Get it , Live it , Love it ... pass it on.Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember : never leave ALL of your `` evidence '' with 1 person ... what if they suddenly decide they hate you ?	1

This is a cute romantic story . While not having a lot of adventure and action it still held my interest . This book is straight to the point by having the characters connect from the start . I recommend this book for anyone .	1
As with the other Doan and Carstairs books , this one is funny , witty and smart and I enjoyed it from start to finish . The author knew how to create three-dimensional characters that you enjoy reading about and following along . And Carstairs is the star of the show ! Rarely do I really like the trick of adding an animal into a story and making them the smartest of the bunch but Doan and Carstairs are true partners with their quirks and personalities . It was a pleasure to read and I 'm only sad that there are n't more of them .	1
Unfortunately , Norbert Davis , the author of OH , MURDER MINE , is not as well known as other pulp fiction writers of the 1940 's for three reasons . First , his stories encompassed a wide array of genres , so he never built a reputation as a practitioner of a specific type ( e.g . detective , SF , etc . ) . Second , his detective stories included a strain of humor which was highly unusual for the period , a hard boiled detective story was not supposed to be funny . Third , he committed suicide at age 40 , supposedly after he had been diagnosed with cancer . Thus , his potential literary legacy was truncated . However , among his peers he was regarded as in a class with the best writers of the era , including Hammett and McDonald . He graduated from Stanford with a law degree , but never took the bar exam - choosing instead to pursue a career which he had already established by being published while still in college , usually being paid at the going rate of a penny a word . Hopefully , the advent of ebooks and specialized small presses will allow many more potential fans to enjoy his works and dog lovers will be irresistably drawn to Carstairs ' collaborations with Doan.This is the last of Davis ' stories featuring the hardboiled detective DOAN and his Sidekick CARSTAIRS , a Great Dane the size of a Shetland Pony . It was published in 1946 , and after greatly enjoying the few stories about the duo which were published before Davis ' suicide , I feel a sense of loss that the duo 's adventures were prematurely ended by Davis ' death . Given the obviously boundless limits of Davis ' imagination and his keen powers of observation regarding human frailties , the duo easily could have become a staple of the genre.This story takes place on a college campus , where we first meet Melissa Gregory , an anthropolgy instructor at Breckenridge University . She soon has a confrontation Eric Trent , a meterologist who has just joined the faculty , and for whom Doan is acting as bodyguard . Why ? You 'll have to read the story to discover the answer . They and Melissa 's fellow faculty member and boyfriend Frank Ames are the only four relatively normal individuals in a book populated with such characters as among others Professor Sly-Myrick ( a refugee from the Gestapo ) , Heloise of Hollywood ( who `` radiated as much warmth as a diamond '' ) , President T. Ballard Bestwyck , the Aldrich twins , Beulah Porter Cowys , Deputy Humphrey ( no one is this dumb ) , Herbert `` Big Tub '' Tremaine , Bumbershoot Bennie , and Sebastian Rodriguez y Ruiz . In addition , Handsome Lover Boy got his name is integral to the plot . Many of these individuals are caricatures rather than characters , but it is all in fun - unless they happen to get killed as several do.Davis ' plot involves at least as much misdirection as in the earlier stories , but in this one it seemed almost incidental to his parody of campus life and the convoluted backstories of his characters . At first it was a letdown after reading the earlier stories which were structured more as detective procedurals , but after I realized it was simply a lighthearted episode of the adventures of Doan and Carstairs allowing Davis to poke fun at the culture of the period I was able to just smile and enjoy it.A lot of the humor in this episode is much more slapstick than in the previous stories , at times could have sen this Carstairs being a model for Marmaduke as detective . Relative to the other books in the series , I found it difficult to rate this book , so depending on your interests you might rate it very differently than I did . My rating is composed of the following elements -Humor - 5 starsCarstairs ( for dog lovers ) - 5 star quality but not enough face time , he and Doan form a good teamParody of Campus Politics - 5 starsWeird Characters - 5 StarsPlot - probably 4 stars if you like misdirectionRomance- an over the top 3 stars , no suspense hereNarrative - 3 starsSo , read this if you want to have fun for a couple of hours ! And , of course , Carstairs is his usual superior self and he and Doan once again make an unstoppable duo.Tucker Andersen 6/9/2010	1
This book keeps jumping out and reaching for a solution . Then it gives you an ending you never imagined . At least I never caught on . A lot of suspense in this book to keep you entertained . There is a romance developing , a dog with his own personality and a foreign dignitary . The bodyguard is a character	1
Pretty good book ! SUPER HOT ! I had tingles throughout most of the book . I love how much action and emotion and sex is put into this story . Its relatively short but not too short . I really really enjoyed it ! I 'll be getting the second in this series !	1
I really enjoyed reading this book about Tamara & Kendrick Prince of Bondair . They meet at club and he has been eyeing her since she walked in the club . When she tells her sister she had enough , she leaves and Kendrick follows her and confronts her in the park . They have amazing chemistry but she still walks away . Read this book because it will make you laugh and cry and cum a lot .	1
Not what I was expecting ... but a good book . She will become a regular author in my reads . Fun story !	1
In this world Werewolves are hunted down or treated like second class citizens . It makes it even worse when the Queen Nayla was attacked as a young teenager . Her parents are killed and she was hurt . When a strange pack wonders into her country , she wants nothing from them except , to rot in her dungeon . Mace the alpha of the pack , sits naked and in filth , as they starve and wait to die . The pack had been wandering looking for a new place to call home and were attacked and thrown in a dungeon , just because they are werewolves . Nayla , according to the country 's laws , ca n't marry and can not have a human lover . So it becomes a very lonely place unless you have someone to occupy her nights with . It has been tradition to chose a Were Slave . That is the only acceptable lover that the people will allow and she is very lonely . So Nayla walks among the captives and sees a hansom blue eyed werewolf . She is horrified at what she is thinking of doing but knows that if she wants a companion at all this is her option . Mace see her and is just angry . Mace , is an alpha , and a very proud man . When he learns he is to be a slave to the queen , he is not thrilled , even if it is sex with a beautiful women . So the story is about the 2 main characters working through there differences , learning that evil comes in all packages not just Werewolves , finding love and LOTS of sweaty sex . The sex scenes are plentiful and very good !	1
WereSlave puts a different spin on werewolfs and humans . The chemistry between Queen Nayla & Mace is electrifying making this a definite must read ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	1
A paranormal/sci-fi erotica novella , WereSlave is a quick read that can get your blood pumping as the hero and heroine finally succumb to the mutual attraction to each other.Nayla , human queen and Mace , alpha male werewold met in unusual circumstances . As queen , she can not get married or take a human lover , but she is allowed by tradition to take a were lover . Mace is the alpha male of his pack . He could never be tamed as a slave/lover to the Queen , but it was his heart that he had to careful about or else , Nayla would own him heart and soul if he did not take care.The story takes place in an earthlike planet where humans , vampires , witches and werewolves co-exist though not in harmony . The world building started good and the author was on her way in creating a believable imaginary world . But , somehow she did not finish . And that 's why I had to take away one star from what would have been a 5 star rating.Perhaps its because this is the beginning of a series of books . Something has to be new or developed in the next books , which is a good strategy by the way . I just wanted more from Nayla and Mace who are lovable in their own right , just needed a little more fleshing out to make them unforgettable . And that goes for the world building , too .	1
I really enjoyed this book . It was exciting and I anxiously awaited the next page . The only criticism that I will make , is that I wish it had more of the science developed in it . That is just my personal preference . Again , it was a very enjoyable read .	1
I enjoyed the story line , with all of its political maneuvering both in the academic world and in the commercial world . I have always enjoyed stories with an underdog . Besides , as a Navy wife of 10 years , I enjoyed the Coast Guard portion of the story in particular .	1
This novel is frightening , poignant , intelligent , and disturbing . I could n't possibly be more impressed . The first thing I should say is this : the author had many opportunities for this story to become tedious and boring with too many facts ; after all , she has 'built ' a world war ( based on realistic ideas that are plaguing the world as we sit at our computers right now ) . But this story never became tedious or boring . I found myself marveling at the brilliance of this writer to give so much detail and still keep it interesting and moving forward . There was a major risk of alienating readers with the continuing build up of what was going on around the world with the Islamist movement , but it just built up more suspense and dread as the story moved along.It is written in the first person - a challenge on its own , especially in such a detailed and driven story . The main character is engaging and human and it is impossible not to root for her at every stage . Something that I truly appreciated throughout the story was the connection between the main character and Ann Frank . At first I thought Francisco would have a difficult time making a clear and useful connection with Ann Frank , but my concern was proven wrong . This connection was deeply important and gives much meaning to the story . It is another world war , and the main character is very human , lonely ( even though she is always surrounded by people ) , driven to care about others and her family , and the main character is somewhat nave , just as Frank would have been , considering her age.I found several quotes from the novel to be compelling : `` I wonder why it is no one ever seems to learn lessons from history , particularly from war '' ( Francisco ) . Another important quote is : `` War restricts choice . Restricted choice makes love fiercer , more precious . War makes love worth dying for , love makes it possible to fight '' ( Francisco ) . These two quotes show a truly profound understanding of the meanings behind this story . A third quote states : `` Someday we will tremble in horror at the tens of thousands of innocent Muslims who have been killed . Now it only feels necessary and inevitable . '' When we consider what is taking place around the world in regard to Muslim thoughts and how Christians ( and other religions ) feel about Muslim thoughts , it is a chilling realization that one day we will look back and wonder how we could have considered certain actions to be 'okay ' and even necessary , in the name of security ... just like there are many Germans who wonder how they could have given approval to the Holocaust at the time , and how people during all wars justified the inevitable devastation all in the name of their beliefs - even though they were justifying the deaths of innocents . In sum , this novel makes you think about what we are willing to say 'okay ' to ... this novel will leave the reader chilled and deeply embroiled in self-contemplation regarding what we are willing to do and approve of for our beliefs.I eagerly await the next novel by this clearly gifted writer ! ! !	1
Amsterdam 2012Do n't open this book until you have a lo-o-o-ng amount of free time in front of you . Otherwise you 'll find yourself doing what I was doing this morning : trying to tie your shoes and read at the same time.A realistic , believable , nightmare . One of the best novels I have read in quite a long time . The opener hints at a small amount of overly workshopped material , but by the fourth page you 're into a major page-turner . In the entire book I found four misused words and one misspelled foreign word , but I 've been an editor and writing teacher more than twenty-five years . I do n't think anybody else would notice them.Each peak leads inexorably toward the next peak , so that it 's very hard for me to say anything substantive that would n't be a spoiler . But maybe this , about a quarter of the way in , will work : '' This is great , I thought , my boyfriend is being held as a terrorism suspect , my brother is a Nazi , and my sister is a Muhammad groupie . '' A few pages before or after this , the narrator refers to her parents as liberals . When the book begins , the narrator is a prototypical rich liberal college kid on her European backpacking tour with her boyfriend . When the book ends . . . .No , you 're going to have to go and read it for yourself .	1
This one really scared me , as I think it is a strong possibility what the author has put into a work of fiction may become our reality . Nice interaction between the characters , and will there be a sequel ? Hope so !	1
Ann and her half-Arab boyfriend , Peter , go to Europe to explore and Ann is the typical college student ... in love , alternating between deep feelings and superficiality , and very self-involved . Her world and , in turn , the rest of the world starts to crack apart , when they both meet a fun Dutch couple and stay the night . Waking , they find their guests butchered and then ... Peter coolly tells her to touch nothing and leave . They flee and soon Ann comes to believe she may not know her lover as well as she thought . Could he be an underground Muslim extremist ? The Dutch assassinations start the long slide to religious war . Some of the premises are very hard to buy ... .that Ann was not a `` person of interest '' due to her relationship with Peter , relentlessly interviewed and hounded , that the Muslims have infiltrated US culture and are preparing the downfall of the US . Yet the suspense of finding out where and what has happened to Peter following his arrest and disappearance , keep up the interest . The ending , well , ca n't say I believe it based on the character development . Overall entertaining read , but an alert , the politics , although fictional , may be offensive to some readers .	1
What can I say ? This is a fast-paced ride through an all-too-plausible future . I was impressed with the pace of this book and thought the plot was terrific . If you think it could never happen here , strap in and hold on .	1
Amsterdam 2012 kindle edition.I usually can tell from the first paragraph if I will enjoy the book or not , this book did keep me interested and I enjoyed the description of the surroundings and the personalities very much . I would have given the book 5 stars but it did have some curse words at the start but not enough to keep me from reading the story . I am purchasing this novel after sampling the content.suspense , mystery , romance . author Ms Francisco did a fine job of keeping the action moving along.Mary Ann - Az	1
I found this book to be a fascinating look at what our future could look like . I 've often wondered how present-day political and social situations could affect our future in the world . Even though it 's fiction , it does give a reasonable look at what life could be like in the near future . Lots to think about after reading this book ! !	1
I would have given a 5-star review , except for `` my bad '' . I am not great on geography and must admit I had some stuggle with that . That said , I was completely engrossed . Everything is so plausible . The gnawing away at Ann 's complacency brings her face-to-face with the world 's reality . Gut-wrenching toe-to-toe survival , whether you are the aggressor or the aggrieved , may start in a grey area -- but must end in only black and white . A really thought-provoking read . Shamefully , religious wars or wars in the name of religion have always been and will always be . I 'll have to read it again to make sure I understand it all . Definitely worth your time .	1
So sense the brothers fell in love tell me how did everything worked out with there new pact along with their familys as well so where is part two only for the brothers ?	1
This book was really good I was n't expecting it . I picked it up as quick read because one of my favorite author was releasing a new book the following day and so I read this one in the mean time . The story was short , sweet and to the point I find myself reading all three books in like a day and the half .	1
PLOT : Lucas walks up to Nita in a club to avoid an ex-girlfriend who 'd broken his heart . Nita 's really not his type , but after they share a kiss , he ca n't forget about her . Nita is drawn to Lucas despite knowing that he 's not the type to commit.PROS : Nita and Lucas were sweet together . They really opened up to one another . Nita was likeable.The plot was well handled . I liked the added bit of mystery that Deandre 's character contributed . I did n't think I 'd like the story of a woman trying to choose between two men , but it 's always obvious whom she prefers.CONS : The novel could afford to be proofread one more time . It was n't as bad as some I 've seen . I can only recall one misspelled word . There were numerous times when the author left a word out of a sentence . What she meant to say was understandable , but at times , the left out word would change the meaning of the sentence.Nita and Lucas decided they were in love a little too quick . It just was n't believable.4 STARS : This second book in the City Wolf series is better than the first . The characters are more rounded and mature . Also the plot is more interesting . A longer ending or an epilogue would have been appreciated but not entirely necessary . This is an enjoyable read over all .	1

PJVs QUICKIE POV : This is one of those rare moments in a series history that I actually enjoyed book two more than book one . The characters were very enjoyable and the plot line was more explained and developed so it was easy to lose myself within . This is an enjoyable series that is not polluted with the usual erotic trappings that you find in the more sexual novels that are out there.REVIEW : Sorcha is a huntress , employed by the goddess Rhiannon to hunt down and eliminate immortal traitors of Avalon . She lives for the hunt and is content with her immortality until her latest kill turns out to be sexy gargoyle shifter Cale.She ca n't deny the attraction she feels for the cat , but she does n't have to believe his claim that they are mates and that they were together in the past -- - until she supposedly died . Now with a death order on his head , Sorcha must fight her urge to finish the job and serve her goddess or succumb to the wicked attraction that is propelling her into Cale 's arms over and over again.A rich mix of historical Arthurian references , paranormal aspects and romance , the Pendragon Gargoyles series is a hot and entertaining one . Like I mentioned earlier I really liked the hero/heroine in this one and found their romance pleasing . Somers has a rich descriptive voice and weaves a very romantic tale - *sigh* if only these cats were real boys . Just the right mix of dominant male , caring partner and stubborn valiantly.The downfall came in my usual distaste for pre-existing romances and mates . I just find it a banal trapping that authors fall back on so that the fall in love is easier to handle . This had two of those . Cale had the already established love with Sorcha and then the mate scenario , but it was redeemed by the fact that Sorcha had no memory of it and he had to win her over , so at least there was `` falling '' motion on one character.This is a great transition novel for paranormal romance fans to more erotica flare . The sexual encounters were not overpowering to the story-line or over-the-top with crazy actions . You know what I 'm talking about - ever read one of those scenes where you are like - HE DID WHAT ? - and in no way find it sexy or realistic.Overall , an excellent follow-up.RECOMMENDATIONS : Adults only . Paranormal Romance fans , shifter fans should enjoy . The price is cheap too , so do n't worry about splurging . Listed for $ 3.60 on amazon.com	1
The second installment of the Pendragon Gargoyles series is red-hot ! It seemed like every time I turned a page someone was getting it on . This novella is lighter on the story-side of things than the first book . I was a little disappointed because the plot is intriguing but this tale is still a nice , light read . Primal Attraction will get you turned on and you 'll stay that way until the end ! Sorcha and Cale are reunited after nearly a century apart . Cale thought she was dead and she does n't remember him . Quite the pickle ! You can probably guess how such an encounter would play out ... Cale ca n't believe his eyes while Sorcha is mystified as to why this cat shifter is all up in her personal space . To make things even worse , Sorcha is a huntress and her current target is Cale . While he 's trying to jump her bones she 's trying to kill him . Talk about mixed messages ! My favorite element in this novella is the primal `` mate '' instinct that drives the two main characters . The hopeless romantic in me wants to believe that we all have a special someone who we 're destined to be with . That their pull is stronger than gravity . Cale and Sorcha 's relationship illustrates this theory to a tee . Even though her mind does n't know him , her body recognizes him . Kinda corny but it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.When Cale and Sorcha are n't going at it between the sheets there 's still a decent amount of action unfolding . Even though most of the fights seem to end in bed . There 's an alley encounter that 's particularly toe curling . I highly recommend it ! On the downside , I thought Sorcha was n't the best name choice . I had a hard time getting past it and as a result was n't a big fan of her as a character . Shallow much ? Maybe.Primal Attraction was n't as good as the first installment but still a nice diversion . This novella is great if you want a small vacation from reality . The sexual escapades are delicious . If your man 's idea of foreplay falls short , try reading this first !	1
This book had me from the very first page . From the very first time that I read an Arthurian tale I was hooked and have been searching for stories about Arthur and his times , this book does not disappoint . Cale is a great alpha who knows just what he wants and is not afraid to go after it . Sorcha is a strong willed and smart woman . As she struggles with understanding her feelings for Cale Sorcha rides a roller coaster of emotions and bring the reader along for the ride . The two play off of each other well and make a great couple . I loved the fierce determination of Cale and his unmoving faith in Sorcha and their love for each other . The bond of love and trust that these two form is a wonderful read.Sydney Somers knows how to pull a reader into the mystical world of shifters and magic , keeping you entertained all the way to the end . With unexpected twists and turns this book was a great read . I am eagerly awaiting the next in this series . This author has quickly become an automatic buy for this reader . - Gabrielle	1
I loved this book and ca n't wait to read the next book . I love the author of this book . I liked his vocabulary and grammar . I think this book is perfect for almost anybody .	1
This is a delightful little book about Alice 's initiation into a world of mystic , magical creatures as well as some very dangerous and evil ones . Alice is accepted into the prestigious Nocturna Academy . Only after beginning the year does she realize there are some strange things going on in the school . She has to fight the evil which will be released upon the world . Great character development and fast paced story line , make this little fantasy book a real keeper . I highly recommend this book to all readers of vampire and paranormal fantasy stories.Gaston Sanders , Author	1
i liked this book it was good and i couldnt stop reading so i stayed up reading it . loved it !	1
Surprisingly well written , although it is directed at at an audience younger than its YA designation . Tweens I should think , and perhaps some of the younger avid readers . Certainly less sophisticated than Vampire Academy . I enjoyed it thoroughly .	1
A GOOD BOOK WITH A GOOD PLOT TO MEASURE . IT LEFT ME WANTING FOR THE NEXT BOOK , WHICH I INTEND TO GET ! ! !	1
The most beautiful thing about fantasy novels are the languages in which they are written . ( I want you to take the time to think about this for just a second. ) 1 . The time period in which these novels are set is seemingly insignificant.2 . The setting in which the scenes are formed is of the writers own design , and3 . The common use of gods/demons/magics open up reels of recently lost or dismissed vernacular.Here is a genre in which the author makes the rules , not conforms to them . Their characters speak in whichever manner they like , and the author is free to build kingdoms and histories with loads of imagined flourish . ( no need for factual poignancy when your lands are your own . ) That being said ... if find you are one of those people that love the eloquence and epic nature of fantasy ( think Goodkind or George R.R . Martin ) then the reason above should be more than enough to entice you into the world that Carolyn Kephart created in `` The Ryel Saga . '' But if you are one of those people that need more convincing than a beautifully sculpted magical world ... then how about the fact that this is a 2fer . Yep ... that 's right , 2 books for the price of 1 . ( $ .99 ) Ryel has been living a lie , but have no fear , all of his misconceptions and preconceived notions are quickly unwound and rectified when his long lost uncle ( who just happens to be a wysard ) comes to take him back to Markul where he belongs . Being thrown headfirst into `` wysard '' training is draining and ( to be honest ) a little daunting , but not as daunting as the very sudden death of his mentor . Finally realizing that his mentor is stuck in the wraith-world ( or held captive by a malignant sorcerer , as it may be ) Ryel sets out to rediscover a long lost spell and set him free . Can he pull off the unimaginable ? Who can he really trust ? And more importantly ... when he finally gets what he wants ... is it really what he wanted ? In the first couple of chapters I was certain that `` Kephart '' had bitten off more than she could chew . Her descriptives were brilliant and vivid , but were leading nowhere ( lots of hoping around , no clear promise of a steady plot ) but thankfully , after mentally scolding Kephart '' to get to the point , she finally did and the journey began . Yes ... I do think that there were several occasions in which she floated away from the plot in search of unnecessary detail and expanded back-story , but this is not an uncommon mistake among new authors . ( It 's hard to chop up a story you worked so hard on . ) Also ... as with most fantasy novels ... it is not a quick read . It will take focus to keep up with the plot ( especially the names ) and you may at times find yourself rereading a passage just to make sure you did n't miss anything . Since there were 2 novels in the version that I read it is also important to point out that the writing got even better ( more fluid ) towards the end of what would be the first novel ( Wysard . ) All in all I think it was a valiant and noteworthy start to a promising career and the future of fantasy writing . ( aka ... buy the freaking book.. you have spent more money on less entertaining things . ) Happy reading my fellow Wysards and remember : If your lovers eyes turn black and she starts laughing hysterically ... take it as a general rule of thumb that something is wrong .	1
Good read for one night . I would read another of his books if it comes across my list . Might use some editing	1
Likable characters , decent very believable and timely plot with plenty of cliff-hanging coupled with good plot threading adds up to a nice good read . Everything is believable and entertaining . And , oh yeah , for the grammar cops the editing seems pretty good as well . Recommended .	1
this book is truly interesting and shows another side to our problems than have ever been shown before . I would highly recommend it .	1
I throughly enjoy this book . It has a terrific plot and characters . I now have all five of the books in this series .	1
I could not put this book down ! The story is fast-paced with enough detail to feel real ! The characters are 3-dimensional and HUMAN . They make mistakes , they get angry , they get scared . M. H. Sargent has truly got a gift for writing .	1
I was n't sure I wanted to read a story set in Iraq , but from the beginning I was hooked . I found it riveting and until near the very end , could n't figure out what was going to happen . I downloaded the sequel even before I had finished this one and ca n't wait to start it .	1
If you like action this is a great book . Many twists and turns with nothing outlandish . One of the traits of a good spy or thriller author is to keep the action real and possible . Sargent does that while keeping a fast pace with out losing the plot twists or the direction of the book . Very little drivel in this book as you will find in my reviews I hate drivel and nonsense . My only complaint is that I was hoping for a bit more busting down doors and hard core fire fights one of the things I love about Vince Flynn 's Mitch Rapp character is his brutality and no nonsense this could of used just a bit of that .	1
I originally downloaded this book and then let it sit in my library for some time before reading it . I just was n't 100 % convinced that the genre was exactly what I wanted . When I finally got around to reading it , though , I was pleasantly surprised . I found the characters interesting , the plot absorbing , and the technical aspects of the writing ( grammar , spelling , punctuation ) to be first class . I read it through in one sitting and immediately bought the next in the series . I have learned not to buy all available from a particular writer as sometimes they become redundant and , frankly , boring , so I bought Sargent 's work one at a time . Well , I have now bought everything by Sargent and anxiously await the next one ! Sargent is on my `` must read '' list .	1
From the brutal beheading by terrorists to the threat of a major terrorist attack , Seven Days introduces readers to an American CIA team and the brave Iraqis who partner with them to prevent the unthinkable . Great read .	1
In Seven Days from Sunday , M.H . Sargent immediately brings you into the characters stories and vividly portrays their personalities . Sargent weaves the riveting stories together , going back and forth between scenes and character groups as you begin to see how they are related . It 's a fantastic start of a great series that involves a team of CIA agents working undercover in the Middle East . I highly recommend the entire series . If you have any interest in Middle East issues , you 'll be intrigued by this entire series .	1
Great writing fantastic plot ! Has to be good because I am extremely critical when it comes to these types of books . Most authors who write about military or spy scenarios tend to be a bit dry or too technical so I lose interest quickly . This I read all the way through and started the next .	1
I got hooked on the MP-5 thrillers with this free book . After this one I went and bought the whole series.It is so realistic that it makes you feel the events actually happen . Some incidents are gruesome but then , when dealing with the Taliban , I 'm sure its not a stretch.Is very fast paced . All the main characters are likeable . Once you start it you cant put it down .	1
My only beef with this book was the poor job done by the proof readers . Words were missing and some spelling errors . But the plot was good , fast paced , and a tad bit of romance involved . One of only a couple of books I e-mailed the author about the missing words and a couple of technical issues related to military jargon and radio procedures he missed .	1
This book kept me anticipating and being surprised by the plot the whole way through . It is not only a suspenseful thriller but the characters are so different and interesting as the story weaves its way towards the dreaded Sunday of disaster . I have now read all the books in the MP-5 CIA series and have not been disappointed by a single one . Try one , you will be hooked !	1
For the money , this is a good read to have in your Kindle . Good character construction and a plot that flows smoothly and believably .	1
This story emphasizes just how vulnerable everyone is to a group out to do harm.It makes you give thanks for the military and all the others whose aim is to protectus.The most likeable character was Aref who put himself into dangerous places hoping to bekilled so he could join his wife without actively committing suicide , but we come to know thathe really does value his life.Though the author tried to keep us in suspense about the complicity of Ghaniyah and Adnan , he was n't entirely successful . Adnan was just not believable as a bad guy , and you suspect his girlfriendwould n't be in the bad camp without coercion . Or would she ? Over all , it was a good story that should keep you interested . If you would like a very light story check outLove Unforgotten	1
Exciting and quite different in that it focuses on an Iraqui point of view rather than having them be the bad guys all the time .	1
Hard book to get into but then I could n't put it down . Pretty much a story for young readers , good vs bad , anti establishment types rule	1
A really . Good reading experience about finding true l love this characters and their experiences in the unexpected ways that they interacted with other people . A must read .	1
I would recommend reading this book by Rita Hestand . She did a good job keeping your interest . Looking forward to reading more of your works .	1
I admit it , I snapped this up the moment I saw it on new releases , because I tend to do that with anything written by Timothy Zahn . He is , in my opinion , one of the best contemporary sci-fi authors where it comes to world building , intricate plot , and edge-of-seat action . His Thrawn and Conqueror 's trilogies were incredible , Quadrail and Cobra were very unique and engaging , and even his one-off novels like Icarus Hunt and Outbound Flight are excellent . So I figured this would be too.First off , when I hit the end my jaw dropped and I literally said aloud `` Huh ? That 's it ? ! '' I then spent several minutes looking to see if it picked up somewhere else . It is a really short story , barely longer than some of the ones that appear in the 'Tales ' Star Wars series ( and those books have several of them ! ) . It 's also , I must say , a lot less interesting than most of them and probably the single weakest plot I 've seen Zahn write . It 's not terrible , but it really is n't that great either- there 's no twists and at the end you 're left wondering where the other half of the story is . The novella revolves around a force of Stormtroopers who are only somewhat memorable ( as is the case with most such white-armored shock troops ) and though there is quite a bit of action , it kind of reads like a ( short ) movie or videogame script.Overall , not worth paying for . In fact , it should really be free if you ask me .	-1
Somewhat of a disappointment . The articles were all there , but I missed Pepper and Salt and the list of declared dividends , currency exchange , weather . These were the small things that I would like for travel , the whole stack of paperes was waiting for me at home . This was just a stop-gap for travel abroad where the WSJ was not available .	-1
1 . Costs more than delivered to your door paper and online version combined.2 . Very confusing to read . Not intuitive.3 . Layout is a nightmare4 . Cant find anything like in the paper or online version.5 . Price went up even more.I cancelled until they get it right just like everyone else who has tried it . Big let down .	-1
This is it , the big kahuna of financial newspapers delivered right to your Kindle . You do not even need to get out of bed or off the throne to retrieve a soggy paper version from your snowed in yard.Just read it right there on your beloved Kindle.The problem is the high price for what you get and the pesky DRM content that you have to put up with.All the Kindle content is like this . This is the evil DRM inherent in the Kindle . It only lets you view the content on the Kindle . No printing articles , no emailing articles to a friend , no using it in presentations . You are stuck . Very evil is it not ! So , if you can live with the price and restrictions of DRM then go for it my friend .	-1
This is an update of my original review ... The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered . There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that 's ok because it 's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web . The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome . Graphs , photos , and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format . It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access . WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible . Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete , you have to put up with ads ! Considering the new cost of $ 21.62/month or $ .072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies . I am seriously considering canceling.6/2/2012 Update : I have canceled my subscription .	-1
ten days into my trial subscription and i have decided to cancel . have read the wsj for 30 years and i guess i have one foot in the digital world and one in the analog world.i wo n't repeat all of the other comments , i can concur on the difficulties of making the transition to kindle reading . if i was still in a job that had me traveling alot it might make sense but since i pick up my wsj of my front porch it just does n't work.the one thing that really baffles me is how to cancel a free trial . unless the magic button is hiding right out in the open , i ca n't find a website or kindle method to cancel . i had to call into customer service and yes , it got taken care of but i was disconnected three times before i made it into the queue , the fidelity of the call made it almost impossible to understand what the person was saying , and the english of the rep was spotty at best . not up to the usual amazon quality .	-1
I have not received one of my fourteen free copy of the NYT so please end my non subscription at this time , meaning I 'm not agreeable to any charges being placed against my account for NYT . Thank you . Douglas	-1
I am not from Washington , but enjoy good media . Unfortuntely , the Washington Post is mostly about politics , or the Redskins and other local stories pertient only to Washington DC . Whereas the NY Times is more international , and the Wall Street Journal is very business oriented but at least national , the Wash. Post is very narrow . I unsubscribed .	-1
I got about two pages into this before giving up . The style is clunky , the internal monolog does n't gel with the character we know , and the story starts at the end of a chase scene that probably would have been really interesting if the author had bothered to write it .	-1
Sigh ... What can I say ? This is more of Karen Traviss ' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty , infallible , infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians , who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It 's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual , Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story . This book is pointless , as the whole premise is flawed , based on a non-canon idea , and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars ( which trump the C-Canon ( soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon ) ideas in Traviss ' books . ) Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying , uninteresting , boring , obnoxious , mary-sue characters ever written . She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett , and turned him into a character who just Would n't Shut Up . She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive , lost , dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy , into a clan of dancing , singing , Mando'a speaking , boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And do n't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is . If you want to know every tiny , minuscule , stupid thing about a character , just turn to Traviss ' books . You 're lucky if she does n't tell you how , when , and where Boba acquired his underwear , and what they 're made of.Suffice it to say , I 'm not a fan of Traviss ' work . I consider her Star Wars books to be a notch below Barbara Hambly 's disastrous efforts . Read this only if you 're a huge fan of Traviss , or a huge fan of Non-Canon Star Wars books ... Because this one ca n't stand up to scrutiny .	-1
He does n't need my recommendation but since you asked , unless you are into thorough reprobates , give it a miss . As the wag once put it , Mark Twain shows promise .	-1
Never realized the fairy tales we have heard all our life were based on such horrible tales . I thought this was a good book to have on hand for my grandchildren , but I would not read or allow them to read this .	-1
I did n't care for this story , others may like it but it just not for me , I just could n't keep reading . Too much good stuff out there to keep going with this one .	-1
Admittedly , I only read the first few stories . They seemed disjointed , did n't flow , or seem to have a point . It was written as if it were & # 34 ; I tripped as I walked down the street . The bus went downtown . The end & # 34 ; Perhaps they just did n't translate well , or maybe they put the worst stories in the beginning .	-1
It was not like the in-print edition . It was printed like a word document . Not what I wanted . I did n't want to pay for that .	-1
Try Reuters international for $ 1.99 per month and leave the liberal opinion pages to the drama seekers . You pay $ 9.99 for more left wing political opnion pages than news .	-1
I LOVE BELLE ANDRE ! ! ! ! Let me start by saying that I truly truly enjoy reading Belle Andre books . Yet this one fell short . Usually I can sit down with my pot of coffee on a Saturday and Sunday morning soaking up the romance that drips from the pages and by Sunday evening , I 'm sorry that I read it so fast and want more . The story just did n't make sense to me . I had a really hard to time getting into the characters . It was steamy but usually Belle Andre has me with the love story and the steam is the bonus . This one not so much .	-1
I like the Nation magazine , but I zoomed as much as I could and the type was so tiny it was not readable for me . I have great difficulty reading small type , it makes my eyes ache and gives me headaches . For me , this was not a viable option for reading on Kindle . I was glad I purchased just one issue , rather than subscribing as I intended to do . Others might not have this difficulty , but for me , it just did n't work .	-1
Since NYT began a paid service to view articles online I can now RARELY clip an article to view later or save . A message appears that the article is no longer available.Guess NYT and Amazon wants me to pay $ 20/month for a full subscription . I 'm cancelling this blog .	-1
I should have know by the cover it was a bit out of my taste for books . It started out good , but i got bored before i finished.mary	-1
Within minutes of meeting each other the two main characters are having sex , graphically . And then it gets worse from there.The plot could have been good if it was n't turned into a porno . A naive young woman meets a dashing knight who rides a dragon . The woman has the unique ability to speak to dragons and joins the companions at their new base of operations.The main characters happen to be married within weeks of meeting after numerous sexual encounters between her new husband , his dragon and her other new husband . The narration then documents the continual mating of the dragons and the humans over and over and over again.This book is not appropriate for teens and I would recommend any squeamish adults stay away from it as well .	-1
Not very romantic , and not very steamy , with the distracting element of one of the characters being psychic . Very little actually happens .	-1
It was free , or I never would have even considered this book , just by the title and the little I knew about it . I should have gone with my gut - if I would n't pay money for it , then why waste my time reading it ? ! ? There was barely a plot and it amazed me how `` into it '' she was . I mean , this guy was her new boss . MAYBE I can let some of this slide and go along with that she was madly in love/lust with this guy and so she was up for anything with him . But his friend , Wade ? ? ? Give me a break ! Just the description of the guy made me want to gag , much less the things she did with him.This is truly a case of `` you get what you pay for '' and in my case I paid nothing . For those of you who do actually spend money on this trash - know that it takes less than an hour to read it , so even if you do end up enjoying the book , think about how much you are willing to spend for an hours worth of `` entertainment '' .	-1
First of all the back description throws you off a bit and the book went in another direction I didnt expect which was a disappointment . Esme is desperate to leave her father who physically abuses her and is marrying her off to a much older man so she goes to her new neighbor next door who happens to be a rake - St John and insists on being his mistress but St John is trying to be a gentleman - after returning from war , he wants to make amends with his brother the Duke and his wife Miranda and so he wants to repair his reputation ( plus he is poor though waiting to find out if he 'll be an Earl due to an inheritance ) . So fearing that Esme might kill herself like she hinted at if she returns to her father , he takes her to the care of his brother and his wife and two children . They agree to help Esme by lying to her father about finding her lost and in an illness ( Yea , I wasnt buying that ) . During the next few weeks , St John and Esme become close and her father keeps writing to her to come back home . I liked St John and Esme character but though I understand why St John kept pushing her away ( but I wanted to strangle him when he talked about taking her virginity and offering nothing ) and though I can admire a female who can read people and know that she is wanted despite the hero 's protest , at some point you need to get some back bone . Which came too late , she finally gets what she wants and now decides to make up excuses to push him away ? What ! ? I wanted to slap her . Then the story is like a soap-opera , now the guy she is be-throned to is even more wicked than her father . And Esme gets bad ideas in her head about St John when she was so sure he loved her even though he never said it ? The book just had too many silly and stupid things going on for my taste . I skimmed alot so I can not in good conscience give this book more than a 2 when it could not hold my interest and just got me upset . And I was left wondering whatever happened to the children of the duke ? why bring them in the tale if you hardly mention them ? The hero/heroine were likeable but not enough to save this book .	-1
The summary seemed cute and interesting and the story is ... until you meet Stacy . This is a heroine you want to like after you hear of her past and her heroic actions but then it 's near impossible to like her.Gina Wilkins had potential in this story but it gets weighted down and just plain eye-rolling when it you have an extremely Stacy not even trying while Jake is giving and showing just how nice of a man he is.Ms . Wilkins emasculates Jake Hinson completely turning him into Stacy Carter 's new dog ... simpering , whimpering and pleading for Stacy to throw him a bone . Oscar the Yorkie disappears and Ms. Wilkins makes Jake his replacement in a quick transition.I definitely wo n't ever read another Gina Wilkins book if this is the way she writes her men .	-1
I kind of take the reviews with a grain of salt , it 's subjective to each person 's viewpoint . I liked other books by this author like Collision Course and No Souvenirs . I thought ok it 's a short story , it ca n't be that bad . I was wrong , it ended at 1109 locations , 66 percent . The ending was so abrupt , it was n't just having a few questions . It was almost as if the story stopped in the middle , I expected to get the next chapter when I turned the page and all of a sudden I am staring at the author 's bio and I ca n't figure out what happened . I even rebooted my kindle thinking the story loaded wrong . Then spent 15 min combing through pages and pages of blurbs for other stories looking for a sequel with no luck . I have read many stories by this author , some I liked and some I did n't . However , I have never been so pissed or so disappointed and disgusted as I am now . I gave 2 stars cause the story was started so well , but there was hardly any relationship development . Just basically 2 guys with insane chemistry . If she had developed this story like the 2 books I already mentioned it would have been great . Mitchell chose the wrong story line for this short short story . I hope she revises and republished this story in a way longer format . I want to know what happens . Trust me , I have read short stories that had the perfect plot line that it could be told in a way that the reader was happy at the end . This definitely is n't it . Save your money , do n't make a mistake like I did .	-1
First of all I should mention that I could n't bring myself to finish this book . I stopped after ca . 40 % .I like fantasy , werewolves and vampires , in general . For some reason I just do n't seem to be able to like this genre in mm-literature . Especially werewolves , because of the `` mating '' . Two guys see each other , and suddenly they 're supposed to live and love each other for life . No build-up , nothing.Well , I wanted to give this genre another try . ( AndLone , for example , was n't that bad , after all.. ) .This one , however , is the most boring and unimaginative story that I 've read/started in this genre so far.This is , in general , what happens in the beginning : [ Be warned , the beginning might be too exciting for some of you . I really do n't intend to cause a heart attack or something ... ] Laine : `` Hey , you 're my mate . `` Dev : `` Seems that way . `` *Both start having sex . *After that ( next morning ) the 2 characters make plans for family introducings etc . for the next day.No build-up . No suspense . No tension . Nothing ! Well , that 's exactly what happens , there are more words in the book of course , but that does n't really make it more interesting.Whatever happens next ( I gave up on it before ) , it might get a tad more enthralling , but I 'm already too fed up with the beginning to really believe that it 's going anywhere near `` great '' , not to mention `` sublime '' ..But do n't let my opinion scare you away from it . If you happen to like a werewolve and mating plot in mm-books and have no problems with immediate mating/falling in love , with no build-up whatsoever , who knows , maybe you 'll like it ...	-1
Great story line ... .but that is all ! Penny our heroine is BI POLAR ! Could have done a whole lot better . Characters needed developement not candy land .	-1
This not a book ; so lets call it a not-book . '' It starts by claiming that it is against the Constitution to hide information about UFOs.The cover is not only at the beginning but in 2 other places.This is the first not-book I have gotten from Amazon . The 3 covers AND several reader comments ( can we spell advertisements ) made the experience of this non-book just about worthless.I can understand when an author states that this is the beginning ( James Patterson comes to mind ) of a book to encourage a reader to buy the rest of the book ; unfortunately Mr. Wilkenson did not say that.I would not recommend this non-book to anyone because the lack of material and using reader comments as advertising . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Some M/M fiction is plot and character driven , with a spicy romance in there somewhere . This is the writing style that interests me.Other M/M fiction is just a series of sex scenes hung on a flimsy plot . `` Court Appointed '' is an example of this type . I did n't even find the sex scenes compelling , since neither the characters nor their interest in each other were skillfully developed . I posit too that people in imminent danger of being murdered are not likely to take time out for some nookie while they are still in an extremely vulnerable locale . Nor are they likely to take even more time to make a phone call from that locale - a call that could easily and safely be completed via cell phone as they sped away to a safehouse.Wish I could figure out which kind of tales these are before buying - its not always obvious .	-1
These stories were just not on a par with the original , TWILIGHT PHANTASIES , and I was so disappointed . Now this is just my take on this . Maggie Shayne is a good writer and these could possibly be right down your alley . I am merely stating that I was so excited to read all of her series but the first book was the best to me . Her vampires do not possess all the traits of other vampire characters I have read - they do n't have as many skills . Also , they think they are so wonderful they are constantly putting themselves in harms way as though they are not all that bright . Just off somehow .	-1
I was very disappointed in this book . Not Christmassy at all . In fact with the explicit sex , perhaps it should have been titled Porn for Christmas.The writing was ok , but the plot very predictable . Mercifully , this book was very short and I 'm glad I got it free .	-1
I downloaded this book free for Kindle . I read the reviews and was thinking I would enjoy this book . Boy was I ever wrong ! I was so bored with this book because it did n't seem to move out of the bedroom once the main characters made it there . I decided that was enough for me and I was done . I finally deleted this book withoug ever finishing it . I only rated it one star because I could not rate it NO STARS !	-1
I am a great fan of Gena Showalter and this series but this was awful . I am convinced she did not write this book . A big waste of my time ... Now I see why they HAD to make this book free .	-1
Despite the negative comments , I read this book as a prequel to the Lords of the Underground series . I am now reading book 4 of the series and I am not sure what help this book gives to the series ? ! ? The story was pointless and there was a very thin line connecting this story to those of the Lords . Read it , I guess because its free . But it does n't impact the series at all .	-1
a very basic love story that is so boring and not believable.ca n't believe jane wrote this.disaapointing and not her best	-1
This book had a real weak story behind it . I really could n't absorb the characters since the story was how they frequented sex due the strong physical attraction they have for each other . Despite the heroine 's past issue it was difficult to get into them later in the book .	-1
A cutesy love story , and somewhat predictable . The bedroom scenes were pretty bland . All in all , a little vanilla for my taste ...	-1
Could n't resist the potential of this plot . It started out O.K. , but went downhill from there . Way too predictable to the point of lame . Could not drag through another page , so I gave up about halfway .	-1
This book nearly put me to sleep . I love learning about laws of other cultures and the forerunner of our current system of laws but it was very dry .	-1
the story was boring . the hero was boring . when he saw sarah he did not visit his dead fiance 's grave . i did not like the heroine because she was willing to fall for the worse without trying anything else .	-1
I admit that at first I thought I was reading a factual history book . Later I found it to be a novel based somewhat on facts . Although someone pointed out that some of the book bordered on slander as far as the Pope and the Catholic church are concerned . I was put off by the sex scene by the German Colonel and his mistress . It would be enough to say they had sex without going into detail .	-1
I would not have bought this book but by the description it sounds interesting . The book jumps around past to present , it makes no sense until the last three chapters . I had to turn the pages and turn because I kept waiting for some thing to happen and for it to make sense . I would not recommend this book to anyone	-1
Time travel and pirates - I thought I would like this book because they are two of my favourite themes in the romance genre , but alas I was wrong.I thought this was meant to be a romance book but all it was about was sex . Some of the scenes even made me cringe , such as the one with the candle and the paerls . Ick . Just porn , no romance , and not very good writing .	-1
This book was just ok . I was really looking forward to reading this one because it was a different take on the menage story . Instead of coming in on the part of the couple 's story when their relationship was just starting we come in on the middle where it 's on the verge of ending.I 'm beginning to wonder if maybe I expect too much from my taboo or erotic reads . For a romance I expect likable characters for the leads , characters that even if I do n't agree with what they do that at the least I 'll understand why . Both of those factors were missing in this book . Logan the alpha male in the threesome was all alpha and not at all likable . Usually I am the first one to jump up and root for an alpha male , but in this case there were very few redeemable qualities to be found in Logan . As a reader you understand Catherine loves him , but why ? Rhys was better than Logan in that at least he was likable , but that was it . There was nothing wonderful about him.To me the story would have been better if Catherine had stuck to her resolve even once , made them really work for something . It just seemed that at every turn Catherine was giving in and going along with what they wanted . In the end I found myself just skimming the last few chapters . I 'd recommend skipping this one.Stats : Ebook pages : 118 of actually storyGenre : erotic , menage romanceRe-Readablitiy : NoneSteam Factor : Hot	-1
Story line moved to quick you didnt get a chance to connect or even care about the characters . She met him he left and at some time she had a baby . You did not find out how she handle trying to find him or the hardships being a single mother . Too fast of a story line	-1
The version I downloaded is in a font that hurts my eyes . I have no idea what the story is like because I ca n't read it .	-1
I thought that the hero was very annoying at first . He wanted the heroine and then went back to give his ex another try because he felt he owed it to her . The heroine then met his controlling , jack butt of a cousin when she was vulnerable from the hero and married him . A year later , her husband left with the heroine 's money and best friend and the hero was no longer engaged to his ex . The hero could have saved them both a year of heart ache if he would have just stayed with the one who gave him the 'spark '' he kept mentioning , but nope , he had to go back to the woman who was good for him in a robotic way . It was his fault entirely that she lost her `` fire '' because his cousin drowned it out and she would never had went to the cousin if the hero did not reject her the next morning ! ! !	-1
Gave up about half way through . Too much repetition , too much that did n't make sense and was hard to follow .	-1
... I find the preaching very intrusive , ruining the whole novel , although as a story it would still only merit maybe 3 stars . It was not well-written or tight enough in the action sequences , dragging on and then switching to another thread . Also for an experienced submariner it is hard to understand why the author had to distort so many facts like ships ' speeds . I am glad I only borrowed this .	-1
I 'm sorry I bought this book . I should have borrowed it or tried a sample before buying . It jumps around too much and definitely overdoes the submarine layout . I got partway through it and decided I did n't care whether I finished it , so I moved it to the cloud . I may bring it back and try again , but not soon .	-1
also too religious-based but that 's just me . I wo n't be reading this author again . I 'm a sucker for a sub book , I had high hopes ,	-1
I decided to buy this book because I had seen come up a few times on my recommended author list . It was just too short , too boring and did n't really capture my attention . I guess there was n't enough heat between the two main characters and the 'love ' seemed shallow . I was disappointed .	-1
This is not up the usual quality of Ally Blue . It got so predictable , I put it down before finishing it .	-1
Accidentally , I ordered a Kindle version of the book . Either the author or Amazon Kindle has dropped the last 4 chapters in the kindle verson . This was a good book . M. L. Rhodes , in the beginning , wrote some excellent novels , then she switched to , my personal opinion , the `` crank out mode , '' probably due to greed , shortened her books , raised her prices . I now refuse to read anything with her name as author .	-1
I ca n't say I liked this one , just not the type of story I care to read . It was , in general , well written ( save a few very odd metaphors ) , but I found it to be awkward . The two MCs do n't have much depth and they sort of stumble together and they did n't have a connection that I saw , and they just ... ..are there.I also found some of the plot points odd . ( Small Spoilers Follow ) : Brock , who is the down on his luck model , made a sex tape with his heiress-celebutant ex-girlfriend . This apparently ruins his career . Hmmm . That seems unlikely given that Kim Kardashian has made an entire career out of having a huge butt and a very well distributed sex tape ( Thanks Mom ! ) . So ... .I did n't get the big deal . The sex tape is described and it 's not as though young children or sheep were involved so I 'm just not seeing it.There is no HEA either , always a downer for me.Overall I just was n't invested in the characters and I did n't buy the plot . It just was n't for me .	-1
This starts out with M/F and M/F/F scenes that are not mentioned in the description . The actual M/M section is so juvenile as to be unacceptable . It 's difficult to accept that this author has had any kind of sex with any kind of person . I returned it .	-1
I did n't finish the book as it 's written in the lengthy-description and ponderous style of the lat 19th and early 20th century . Not nearly as fast-paced or involving as Sherlock Holmes -- but good fair mysteries .	-1
After reading Volume one , I was really looking forward to becoming re-acquainted with Dr Thorndyke . Whilst the first couple of stories met my expectations , this volume contained stories where the character is completely absent and one where he plays only a peripheral role . What a disappointment !	-1
This was not at all what I had thought it would be , Matter of fact , I did not get very far into it before I decided to delete it .	-1
Really just a collection of memories written by the daughter-in-law in the woman 's own words . Not enough structure to keep me interested . I should have sampled it , then I would have known that it just was n't what I was looking for .	-1
I can see this being a great read for family members and acquaintances , but for me at least it just could not hold my attention . That 's just my opinion for what it is or is n't worth . Sorry .	-1
To rushed . The story skips ahead to fast . Things are not explained properly . To many details are left out . And it is the details , after all , that make a book a book and not a movie .	-1

What a dead end book ! I not only struggled to read it as it was so boring yet forced myself to finish it to get the most ridiculous ending possible . It may be free but don & # 8217 ; t waste your time as you & # 8217 ; ll never get that back I sure wont . To make it worse the female lead was a split personality that went from a battered , scared introverted woman who was petrified of her husband to an independent , confident woman who could take on the world from the smile of a complete stranger she immediately fell in love with . The silliest book & biggest waste of my time & don & # 8217 ; t expect much Native American storyline added in , the name and cover were about as good as it got	-1
The comparisons to Bridges of Madison County drew me to this book - comparisons I now recognize as being overly generous if not completely insane.This story is poorly written and whomever edited it should find other work .	-1
The story is okay but the book has so many errors that halfway through it I started another book . I am not sure who did the proof-reading on this book but they did not do a very good job . It really messed with the flow of the story .	-1
This book was not the kind a reading I was looking for . It was hard to get into and after SEVERAL BORING CHAPTERS I through the towel in . Beware to others .	-1
Really ? I usually like Lorelei James , but this story was just plain distasteful ! ! ! ! Trashy , trashy , trashy . Better to have a great love story with just Billy .	-1
The story was n't too bad - what little there was of it . HALF the download was ads for other titles . I felt my money was completely wasted .	-1
did n't like him . barely liked her . no sympathy for either character ... plot totally undeveloped ... just scene after smut after scene . DO NOT waste your money !	-1
I got this one for free . It was too short . The characters were not developed , and the storyline was iffy at best .	-1
This is the first book I read by Sami Lee . It 's not much I can say it just is n't a story for me .	-1
I bought this after seeing an ad on facebook , reading the review posted , and seeing that it was only [ ... ] s. But I did n't finish it , which for me almost never happens . My main problems were poor formatting of the book ( paragraph tabs were inconsistent ) , poor grammar ( its/its 's mistakes among others ) , and that I just did n't care anymore . The characters really never grabbed me , and it was pretty much impossible for me to suspend my disbelief at the plot ( no ozone , and the US government has created basically a doomsday device to save the Earth ) . If you are a heavy-duty reader , this may be worth [ .. ] to you ; unfortunately , the book is certainly not worth much more .	-1
I know that some very good books can have unexpected endings , but this was just strange . It was as if someone just chopped off part of the book .	-1
Lately , I have been devouring Laura Lippman novels ; I think her stand-alone books are outstanding examples of psychological suspense . So , I was mighty pleased when I saw I could download one of her short stories for my Kindle ... for free . And , now that I 've read it , I 'm shaking my head and wondering , `` Did I miss something ? '' I actually flipped the page when I got to the end , expecting the story to go on ( and no , I did not expect a novel , but maybe a twist or at least some kind of resolution ) . When it did n't , I felt cheated . The set up was great , the characters artfully drawn , and the story itself had great potential . But from where I sit , it seems Lippman abandoned the potential and just stopped writing , rather than going to the effort of finishing the story in a satisfying way . The sad thing is , her publishers probably released this short as enticement to buy THE BABYSITTER 'S CODE . I fear it will have the opposite effect .	-1
Too complex for little ones . Maybe a book for 6th graders but not toddlers . I did n't like it at all	-1
The idea of this story was interesting but I disliked the writer 's style . The storyline was confusing to follow , all of the characters seemed similar , and the descriptions seemed very stilted and dry . Also , it was annoying that the author had one of the characters repeatedly pondering the relationship between two of his colleages but never seemed to come to a conclusion . Everytime , it came up in the storyline I was thinking , did n't he already go over this ? Usually when I read great story I become so immersed in it that it 's like watching a movie , this book was a struggle to get into . Sorry for the bad review but I just did n't enjoy .	-1
Normally I love books on shifters and was eager to start this one . And though the author had some intriguing ideas about werewolf culture , the book had one fatal flaw that I could n't over look : artificial conflict.I ca n't stand it when the conflict in a story only comes as a result of the characters making stupid choices and putting themselves in unnecessary danger . After promising multiple times not to put herself in danger , the heroine does exactly that the very first chance she gets , and willingly gives herself to the bad guys . Plus , I do n't think it was explained well enough about why the heroine was changed in the first place or why the bad guys wanted her so much.And the relationship between the two main characters progressed too quickly and unbelievably for me . I found myself doing a lot of skimming while reading and ultimately gave up before the end.I gave the book 2 stars for the interesting bits of world building at the beginning . I really , really wanted to like this book ( and the hero had an interesting back story ) . But I just could n't get invested in the story enough to really feel connected to the characters or worry when they were in danger .	-1
I downloaded this book as a Kindle freebie . I liked the title and thought it would be a light story about an encounter between a delivery man and one of his customers . It is n't . This is the product of 1,000 monkeys banging on their typewriters and flinging poo . Have you ever been watching TV with a friend who keeps flipping channels ? That 's what this book is like . The author stays on one storyline for a few paragraphs before switching to another . It 's very awkward and will give your brain whiplash . A few chapters in I was starting to wonder if the author just cut and pasted several different snip-its from drafts that she had on her computer . There 's blatantly obvious editing errors and inconsistencies . Then there 's the `` ick '' factor - a husband telling another man to `` do '' his wife and a swimmer fantasizing about a `` golden shower '' ? Gross . If you 've clicked on this page , back away slowly , return to where you came from . There 's better options .	-1
I downloaded this as a freebie , I would have been seething if I 'd paid for it . Bad writing , no plot , ridiculous characters and cringeworthy dialogue all add up to a book you can well do without .	-1
I pick this story because of the great reviews it got . Honestly ; the only thing it was worth the money was the cover , and I still got jeep when the cover did n't appeared on my Kindle . The story could had been better . Obviously this was not for me .	-1
I should have stopped reading when I read Keep on Truckin by Al Green . ( Eddie Kendricks was the singer ) . This book was full of inconsistencies like that . The music says one decade but the clothing and cars give you a different decade . And then the ending was totally disappointing . The story line does n't match the title .	-1
I paid for this book & all I got was approx 10 pages & there was n't even anything interesting about it . VERY ANNOYED	-1
buy a speed reading book by Evelyn Woods and your better off.the author does not deliver what he promises -- o else I missed the boat.I still find it interesting -- but i would not buy it .	-1
Nice story thoroughly spoiled by mis-spelling and poor editing . It was a an effort to get through every page . Real shame	-1
The story line was OK , the characters interesting enough , the only problem was that about half way in they start praying for each other and asking for prayers . This prayer thing was inserted very randomly in there and had absolutely no rhyme nor reason.I did finish the book but cringed every time the prayers were thrown in . It was a free book which was good , I will however make sure from now on to read the reviews before hand . I guess I am not a fan of Christian fiction.To summarize : story line is pretty good , it is a decent read if you do n't mind the random God and prayer inserts.I would NOT pay to read it .	-1
The predominant issue with this book is the editing . Just about every sentence is a run-on sentence . I tried to ignore them , but reading them is the literary equivalent of tumbling down a hill . On one page , the average sentence was five or six lines long -- all joined together with commas and very difficult to follow comfortably.Putting aside the editing issue ( which I know the author is aware of , but has n't yet fixed ) , the novel would be 2.5 or 3 stars . The basic premise of the book -- retired police chief from Wisconsin helps solve mysteries in Palm Springs -- is n't bad , but the actual mechanics of it leave some questions . I need more back story to help me understand why a small town police chief would have the ability to be especially good at solving these mysteries ( the story of him just being a `` natural '' at profiling and even doing freelance profiling for the F.B.I . did n't ring true ) . We never really saw Henry being good at figuring things out or having special insight into people . He just sort of talks to people and the mystery solves itself . It was kind of like watching your grandpa solve a case -- not a detective grandpa , but just your regular grandpa.I also had lingering questions about the plot . The device of the autographed pictures did n't make sense . I do n't understand why somebody would be more likely to buy a house if there was an autographed picture of a celebrity in it . . . either you 're an easy mark for that sort of scam or you are n't . What was the picture supposed to convey -- that the celebrity had left an autographed picture of themselves before moving out ? It also did n't make sense that nobody on the police force wanted to solve the crime because they 'd heard rumors that the victim liked to have sex with teenage boys . Detectives ca n't just opt out of murder investigations -- they may do a halfway job , but they ca n't just call in a local volunteer.I give the author credit for attempting to create some characters that add life to the book . Wayne and Henry were too alike to be distinguishable -- they need to be able to play off of each other better if this is going to be a successful series . Charles was actually an good character and I can see the potential there . It was jarring to have him continually introduce himself with `` Heeey , '' when no other dialogue had any sort of spelling alteration to imply dialect . It was distracting and unnecessary . The character of Amit was interesting in that you could see the author 's attempt to surround Henry with characters who were very different -- Amit was young , of a different race and nationality , technically savvy , and very different in personality . Like the vast majority of the dialogue , Amit 's did n't ring true , but with more work and development ( in dialogue and character ) , I can see this being a solid group and am hoping maybe Amit is being set up as a regular character.This has the potential to be a good series . It is n't there yet , but I would check out future books if I felt the author addressed the editing , tightened plots , and focused on characterization . I think there is room in the mystery world for a detective like Henry .	-1
Can you review a novel that you did n't finish ? If so , I found the writing extremely & # 34 ; wooden & # 34 ; . Sort of what you might expect from a freshm , an in a school of journalism.I did n't feel that it would get any better after the first two or three capters , so I stopped reading .	-1
This book is a sequel to Derrico 's first book , Right Ascension.I gave Right Ascension 4 stars.This is a sequel , but not quite a sequel , it is a more of a `` let 's get it over with '' type book.Too many characters doing too many things , too quickly , in too many places all at the same time.It is hard to follow and the `` resolution '' is totally unbelievable .	-1
An interesting idea , but I would not recommend this book to my friends . There are some errors . I 'm not sure if they are from bad formatting or from author/editor error , so I wo n't fault the author on that . However , I do fault the author for not being able to decide if he was writing for an adult audience or a YA audience . I wish he had made up his mind . I 'm not sure how to explain it , but sometimes it felt childish and other times it seemed a bit 'too much ' . YA-lit is a tough thing to write . It 's always a fine line between being too watered down and being over the top.Also , everything seems 'too easy ' and 'too convenient ' . Everything the kids need falls in their laps . They want to build a better shelter - a guy from a logging camp shows up . A girl is pregnant - they find a nurse . It would be interesting to see how the kids had handled the birth of a baby with no medical help . It would have also been nice to see the kids fail once in a while . I know there were bad guys around and they killed people and caused problems , but I 'm not talking about that kind of thing . It would have been nice if one of the kids ideas had not worked . `` Lets make this ... Lets build that '' and every idea works out perfectly . That 's not realistic . It 's ok to fail at a task . People learn from their mistakes and people can learn from reading other people 's mistakes too.I 'm all for supporting new authors , and I do give the guy credit for coming up with a good idea . I just wish he had proof read a little better and did some re-writes to fix parts of the story that do n't flow well . Also , the first chapter could be dropped completely and it would make the story flow much better . The first chapter sounds like a scifi novel from the 50s , then the rest of the book has a totally different tone .	-1
I love Gena 's Lords series , but this one is not for me . I was n't captivated by the world og the buildup .	-1
I quit reading when I realized that this was n't a full story in itself . I have read series before that at least held their own story for that book and continued in others . But I was half way through this book and quit . I just found out the story line when I was half way through . That does n't bode well for the ending . It will be a huge cliff hanger for sure and I do n't go for that when reading . At least it was free on Kindle since I would have to pay alot to continue the story if I chose to .	-1
The book was quick reading , but I was n't impressed at all.The story line just seemed to be a rip off of the hulk story with some twists to it . Evil hulk ( Trent ) with a religious cousin ( Jonathan ) who has the same power . All created by a mad scientist ( Trent ) who was infected ( along with Jonathan ) in a accident with the formula.There you go , that 's the story . That 's it.The good , the book was cheap.The bad , the story equaled the price of the book .	-1
I loved the first chapters and had a good laugh . I specially liked the enchantress behind the scenes and her self made mutt ; and admired the courage of Beauty and her quest to get her loving Beast back after finding the grass is always greener in the human side . Her early misfortunes and encounters with other famous story book beautie were original and funny , but alas ! the enjoyment soon faded soon turning into a noir overload . I like dark humor , satire , noir etc . but in moderation . One by one , the beauties that Beauty encountered , from Snow White , to Cinderella , and without an exception they were all damaged and incapable of being nurturing , loving , caring , and unable to have a good relationship . Besides their beauty , they were endowed with few reedeming qualities and doomed forever after.. Beauties be aware , there is not a happy ending unless you are NOT ! !	-1
Beauty 's Beast became a callous , unloving fop when he lost his beast form , and Beauty sets out on a quest to turn him back into the Beast she loved.While the story idea itself was n't bad , the execution was awful . Ditchoff mixes tenses and flashbacks without regard to the poor reader trying to follow the storyline . She confuses words , such as `` bridal path '' for `` bridle path '' - both useful but NOT interchangeable . When a couple of dwarves come to Beauty 's aid and accidentally uncover her `` ta-tas , '' I could n't take any more .	-1
I was doing a puzzle , and accidentally turned the page , then a new game appeared . That made me mad . All the puzzles are the same thing . If you do n't listen to me and think you want it anyway , try the sample to see how bad it REALLY is . Do n't listen to those that give it five star reviews . Try the sample , and see for yourself .	-1
The plot of the story was very promising . The first several chapters kept me interested and I could n't wait to see what happened . But that was where the problem lie . I felt like a waited and waited and waited to see what would happen . About half way through the book the dialogue became utterly boring and I did n't think I would ever reach the end . When I did reach the end , I felt let down . The grammar was pretty bad so if you are not able to overlook errors you might not want to even try this one .	-1
This book is written with zero chemistry between the two main characters . The punch lines were cheesy and I do n't even think that the author seems to like or respect women very much .	-1
I was so disappointed with this book , it had so much potential but didnt really go anywhere . The characters were shallow , the plot was predicatable . Very disappointing . I imagine this would be a good read for younger audiences or those new to the fantasy genre or who want a `` lollypop '' version of the middle ages , but if you 're serious about your fantasy/sci fi fiction , do n't bother with this book . You 'll find it too chaste and shallow with no depth or realism . Not for serious fans !	-1
the editor should be sued ! there many spelling mistakes grammatical errors and word usage and tense usage mistakes . basic premise ok. this stinker should have been offered free ... six wasted dollars . shame on me !	-1
it was a quick read and did not have enough depth . liked the idea of some f the punishments , but it was rushed . and some arts were confusing . I should retread a section of a story for one reason only , it was hot and had to read it again because ... wow ! um , read some lines again because it was kind of confusing . but like I said , liked the idea though . will read their work again , I liked their writing style , next time more to the story . that magic stuff was unneeded fluff or nt fluff enough .	-1
The early stories are quite well done , but later in the book there are many I gave up on because they are revoltingly violent and/or not very interesting . I would have quite liked to read more stories featuring the Jack Daniels character .	-1
This author receiving two stars was more than generous . Stealing Innocence 1 & 2 was garbage ! I guess for the price , you get what you pay for ... ..NOTHING !	-1
This is a nice read . It 's not Tolstoy or anything , it 's fluffy entertainment . I liked it . What I do n't like is it 's super super short . And the other parts are not free and equally as short . There are 3 other parts to this book , totalling 4 `` books '' . When you add up the price , you end up paying for a full novel , which all these stories put together do n't equal . All the stories put together would equal the size of a little Harlequin paperback . There are excerpts of other books added , so even the KB size is misleading . Such a rip off . You 'd be better off buying a full novel . I 'd recommend Backstage Pass and Rock Hard by Olivia Cunning . GREAT read and worth the price and time , in my opinion . U can buy old paper backs for cheaper and get just as good a read . They really need to re-evaluate this .	-1
It is very frustrating to see authors/publishers loading part of a story for free and then selling you the follow-up pieces . Free books should be free . If you want to give me a free sample of a book , then be honest about it in the description . This `` book '' ends right in the middle of a conversation.It is n't even very good . Jane Porter takes a vow of celibacy after finding out that her `` master '' is married ( I put that in quotation marks because that is what she calls him , but she seems to be very unfamiliar with the lifestyle later in the story - it was difficult to figure out exactly what her experience level was ) . After a year , she attends a BDSM-themed party she set up as a party planner . This whole turn of events was so incredibly unrealistic . First of all , a guy was throwing it for his half-brother . Who throws a party like that for a sibling ? Nobody in the book was engaging in any sort of negotiation or conversation about what they wanted to do . It was just guys throwing their weight around while mouthing bland inane nothings like `` You know that a submissive is really in charge of the scene ? '' Well , if that 's the case , then maybe try talking about what she wants , what she is looking for in the scene , what is n't on the table for the session ? The whole reason Jane got into a bad situation in the first place was because she did n't talk to her `` master , '' but she 's going to get right back into that same mistake again ? This was like somebody 's poorly thought out fantasy , not anything close to how this would play out in real life .	-1
You will not be getting a whole story here . Although a good start , you will have to purchase several other books to get the whole story .	-1
I did n't enjoy this story . It was so drawn out and , at times , downright boring ! I really could n't get a feel for how these characters looked -- -the author did n't paint a vivid picture for me . In addition , I felt that the story was n't well told . So many details were lacking , especially the history of Sydney and Tyler 's relationship . What happened for them to break up ? Had he always been crazy ? How did she not see this before ? For her to be such a feisty girl , why could n't she have dealt with Tyler better ? I was not impressed with her hiding from him and nearly allowing him to rape her without much fight : `` At least she would n't be awake for it . `` Now , let 's talk about chemistry in the book . The chemistry is quite tepid . Sydney and Tyler kiss a bit , she gives him advice , they flirt , then they 're headed to his hotel for sex . What ? ? ? I really would have preferred the book without the ONE sex scene . It was horrible . The lackluster description of the sex is so vague I had to read it twice to be sure I was actually in the midst of a love scene ! This is definitely what I was expecting from a Wild Ride story , but then , I thought this author was comparable to Cat Johnston and Lorelei James . Boy , was I wrong . Even more frustrating , at the end of the book , I was surprised that Levi wanted a permanent commitment to Sydney . Why ? There was no chemistry , mundane sex ! Overall , poorly written book that left me desiring a REFUND !	-1
They are the Economist and they are not priced well ? Maybe like Geithner they can say the software did it . I find their articles a bit facile in tone , and I think they are in danger of becoming a relic by their digital Ludditeism .	-1
Not only the premise is unreal . The characters are superficial and hard to care about .	-1
Awful . I wanted to delete this garbage just after reading first 100 or so pages . but thought it must have some redeeming qualities ... wrong . main female character unbeliavably unsymphatic . Justin should have told her Buh..bye in no uncertain terms . Waste of money and time .	-1
Downloaded the sample , and at page two of chapter two the grammatical errors began . I will no longer pay writers for poor work on amazon kindle . The lack of attention so called professional writers pay to their work here is tiring , perhaps in their haste to 'get it out there ' ? And this writer said he had proof read this after comments ... Proof read chapter one perhaps.Thumbs down .	-1
The first thrd of this book is taken up by very lengthy discussions of technology and maths . I could not get a hold of the hero at all . He did not capture me and I could not identify with him . He was a techie and was naive and shallow and had a teenager outlook . This is fine as he has spent his whole adult life cooped up with a smart computer and his maths problems . However he just did n't cut it for me as the hero . I found him frustrating . The next books in the series are not so fixated on the technology and IMO are better for it . PS the author replied to my review and so I encourage readers to write as he seems to care about what readers think	-1
What a basically `` blah '' story . Neither of the characters are especially interesting , the violence is n't at all effective ( and of questionable reality in certain areas ) , there 's no motivation for what 's going on and basically just not much here to like.This story perpetuates one of the great myths of serial killers ; that they love doing what they do and will snicker about how gloriously EVIL they are while doing it . We have two serial killers who like doing their thing through the medium of hitchhiking ; one as a driver and the other as a passenger . When they meet up , it 's like `` Frankenstein vs the Wolfman '' , only even less interesting . I also find it vaguely amusing that the violence is quite graphic , but the sexual content is glossed over quickly , as per the usual for American audiences.There 's some real potential here as a plot idea , but the execution , as it were , is terrible . I have no interest in reading anything by either of these authors and if I 'd not downloaded the story for free , I 'd feel quite ripped off .	-1
I read the whole story , and I must admit the horror and sex both made me feel very uncomfortable while reading it . While that may have been what the authors intended , it really was not for me.Best wishes , Dave Wile	-1
The `` novella '' started promising enough and what a great premise ! I 'm not sure if it was because two separate authors collaborated via email to write this piece or what but the ending was a let down . Too abrupt , almost predictable . I probably could have done a better job.I 'm just glad I did n't pay anything for it .	-1
The premise was interesting , and the concept was adequately executed , but the potential was overshadowed and ultimately stripped of any redeeming quality by the vulgar and gratuitously graphic descriptions of violence and sexual acts . I am not weak stomached , or a prude , but this book was literally nauseating in parts.I would not recommend this book to anyone , and I deleted it from my Kindle immediately upon finishing it , which I was only able to do because of it 's brevity . Had this been a full length novel I surely would have given up on it well before the end , and I came near to deleting it in the first or second chapter .	-1
Not only was this a very short read..took about 15 minutes to read it , it was also boring and a bit too gory for my taste . I was surprised that this book ( short story ) offered so little , I did expect more .	-1
Ya know , I really have to quit falling for the marketing gimmicks being used with books like this . I was getting bogged down in a history book and was looking for something quick and easy to read as a sort of mental palette-cleanser before jumping back into the second half of a rather long history book . Viola ! There was Serial , a quick-read about a killer who preys on hitchhikers and a hitchhiking killer who preys on drivers and the mayhem that ensues when this unlikely pair meet . Toss in some hype about how each of the authors wrote a chapter featuring one of the serial killers , then collaborated on the final chapter in which the killers meet and it sounded like it might be a promising story . So I downloaded it . After reading the story in about 20 minutes I can definitely say this is a book that was worth every cent I paid for it.I guess I should n't complain because it was free ... but even so , I got the feeling that Serial was less about a unique collaboration between two action/horror/thriller authors wishing to share their experimental fiction with readers than writers finding a new way to foist rejected first drafts on readers . Other than the authors competing to see who can come up with the most gross-out scene , there 's not really much to recommend the story . Do n't expect any character development or insight ... just prepare for a story that could have easily been told with sound effects : Screech , thud , smash , scream followed by slurp , clang , thump , bump , scream . If you like your reading to be all action and no introspection , then by all means go for it.Oh , and as a postscript , I notice that Amazon is now selling an `` extended version '' of Serial . That 's a $ 2.99 I think I 'll keep in my pocket .	-1
I wanted to like this book , as it had a clever premise , but I found it pretty convoluted . The main theme was so obvious that I wanted to smack the main characters ' heads together for being so stupid . I ca n't believe all the scrapes they kept getting into for just a short trip.I might have enjoyed this book more had the layout of the book not been so distracting . It downloaded on my Kindle in huge paragraphs without a break in between , so it was hard to keep my place . Then at a few points , the paragraphs went all clumped together down the middle of the page with poor punctuation and little delineation between scenes . I do n't know if this was the fault of the author , but it was very distracting and kept me from being able to concentrate on the book itself.The basic idea of the book was interesting , I just did n't think it was very well-written , on more than one level . And whoever tagged it as Christian romance was hallucinating . For that matter , I would n't have called it erotic romance either . The male character just did the same thing to the female character a couple of times . Whoopee ... .	-1
This short story took me about 15 minutes to finish and left me wishing i had those 15 minutes back . The Sith are the dark side of the force but there was nothing dark about this story , it is hinted that the characters do have the force but do not indicate why they may be considered the bad guys . It also has a cliff hanger and than starts up again 2 years later without filling in any of the blanks . I am sure this was meant to be a teaser and the complete book will go into greater detail but even for a free kindle book i felt like i was ripped off .	-1
Got about halfway through , The book seems to try and rely on gore and not enough on story . I also prefer the traditional Zombies , these were a little ridiculous	-1
Gore filled if that is what the reader wants but unbelievable zombies that think , are smart and snack on toddlers .	-1
One of the worst zombie books I have read . The writing is , at best , high school level . Amazon is great at giving opportunities for talented writers to break through , but this is not one of them .	-1
It was ok . I liked the way they included the view of the zombie along with the view of the survivors . It was original .	-1
First of all , the grammar , spelling and punctuation use ( or lack thereof ) are all terrible . I think this needs a serious going over by a professional editor.Second , the characters are bland . They have no substance to them at all ... .nothing that makes them special . Also , the swearing is excessive and mostly unnecessary.Third , zombies are de-evolved creatures . When infected humans die and then get up again as zombies , the brain has been wiped clean except for a few basic skills such as walking/running/other basic motor functions and the instinct to kill . Therefore , instantly having zombies with problem-solving skills , cunning and such right off the bat is a bit of a mistake . If you want to have evolved zombies , build up to it as the series goes on.In conclusion , I do not recommend this book .	-1
I read one other slave narrative and enjoyed it . During the depression the government sent writers out to interview former slaves so we would not forget . I enjoyed it and finished the book . Interesting to read about slavery from former slaves/ There was not one person who claimed any abuse from former owners in this book .	-1
After having Read wolf creek series , I was really ready for Tri Omega mates ! The first one was pretty good , but the second one Forbidden Desires could have been left unwritten . Ryland was an immature fool who did n't deserve any mate let alone two . Once a tri omega found his or her mates he or she could not live without them as the needed the additive his mates carried . I found myself wishing Gregory could have found another mate besides Ryland who was tri omega and Viktor who was the second mate . At least the books were cheap so I do n't feel too bad and I 'm hoping the other two are better but this one I would not recommend to anyone ! It 's a bad relationship when one person has to do all the compromising . Ryland and Viktor were HORRIBLE characters , Ryland was a backwoods slut with a sugar coating , no wonder his family tried to kill him -sorry they missed ! Not a good on a bad day !	-1
I got this as a free download , and usually score them more generously , but even free , something 's are not worth my time ... I have to finish the book to give it 3 stars , and I did n't , so it gets 2 . 5495 locations.Jim Richards is 60 years old , has only one friend and drinks 6 beers a night ( he prefers to drink 8 but he 's unemployed now ) and he also lives with his parents , but they did n't seem to have much personality or input . But it was n't his character so much as the simple way that the story was told that lost me . When pondering on who the killer might be Jim thinks : `` Honestly , I would n't know what a killer even looked like . All my crime books left that to my imagination . On TV , they were the last person you would suspect , not very outstanding looking '' - and that 's about the level of all the writing . It was too banal and I was n't engaged . I let it go.Edited to add - I immediately received a very curt comment from the author and looking at the other reviews , I can see a trend of bullying of any negative reviews , which puts me off the entire matter . I would never read anything by Bob Coates again ... Bob Coates has since deleted his comment , but the issue of his rudeness and attempts of intimidation are still true and I will keep this review up .	-1
The main plot of the story was n't too bad . The part that was confusing was the age of the character . Although the main characters were over the age of 60 a lot of times I found them acting like people my age ( 37 ) or younger . Also , I am somewhat tech-savy , but was a little put off by references to outdated gadgets . I actually had to Google what a Palm Treo was . This book is probably best for people over 60 . I also found it to be a very hard hard . It seemed to take me forever to get through it .	-1
I struggled to give this book two stars . The author holds our policemen in such low regard that I found the story distasteful and ridiculous . No police force could be as dumb as the book suggest . And it was not entertainment . It was so unrealistic and the love story was so silly that it totally distracted from the main storyline . Will not read any more books by this `` author '' .	-1
this book was just silly and made no sense plot was not good enough for me . I expected more and it was a short novel	-1
I found this story to be dull and lacking in charisma . It was missing the excitement of the first book . This second book seemed to have been written as an afterthought . I did not even care about the characters in this story.The CONSTANT paraphrasing of dialogue seemed to be just plain , lazy writing ! Hopefully , the third book is more interesting ...	-1
I bought this after downloading the first book for free . I am pretending that this was free because it was n't worth the money . It lacks the pizzazz the Classmate book has . I have n't been able to finish it -- too boring .	-1
Unfinished ? ? ? ? I agree with the other reviews about this book beimg umfinished . The story line was pretty good amd just when it started getting good , BAM over . I hope this is a series or there is a follow up or that is just a bad for the author .	-1
SPOILERS IN THE REVIEWI actually think that reviewer Lasha described perfectly what I think about this book , but instead of just commenting on her review I decided to make it my own review because this book is a perfect example of why I think GFY trope could be so very offensive in my opinion . I think it can be beatifully and sensibly done too , just not in this book in my opinion . I was ready to scream more than once when I was reading it indeed and not just about who pitches and who catches . I was ready to scream when author made her characters say over and over AND OVER again how they do not want to do REALLY gay stuff , whatever that meant for them in any given moment . Or when one of the characters when they are getting ready to pose for the calendar and watch gay couple posing says that he is relieved that heavy duty gay action was over.Guess what you dolts ? No matter how many times it is stressed that other naked guys do not turn you on you ARE gays or bisexual . If you are a gay guy it is my impression that maybe a person whom you are not attracted to does not have to turn you on , just as every guy does not have to turn me on as straight woman.Oh let 's not forget the `` he has gay friends '' thing and how those gay friends according to one of them are TWINKS which is translated as effeminate men with swimmer physique , contrary to what our characters are.Oh I can go on and on . Yes , sex is hot , no book in my view is still horrible.And those are smart boys , yes ? Studying to be pharmacist and another one is supposed to go to prestigious Ivy League business school ? One would think their vocabulary would be a little bit more diversed .	-1
You will find more depth to the characters in the Dr. Seuss books than you will find in the characters in this book . Kron Darkbow the hero is supposed to be this tough warden from the prisonlands . He is constantly falling for traps and just blundering thru the story like a bull in a china shop . From the very first scene , he has supposedly achieved his goal of killing the man that killed his parents , the thing that haunts and drives him . Only to find out this was not the guy responsible for their murder but just a lackey . He then sets about trying to discredit the bad guy in a manner only the great Maxwell Smart would be proud of . But thru the events , he completely drops his life 's quest to run off after another bad guy that just seems to be a bigger threat . Please , you could have at least let Kron decapitate the guy he was after before switching to the new one.I read the first two thinking well , it might get better , sorry the same mindess dribble carried on from the first .	-1
The characters are very one dimensional and easy to predict . As such the book was a straightforward easy read , and for the price on the kindle I am not horribly unsatisfied . Characters are littered throughout the book who are brought to life through the entire book only to serve some minimal purpose at the end and then the characters are removed . There are budding relationships that are awkward and seemed forced . All in all , worth the price , but I would n't read it again nor recommend it to another with all of the low priced novels available on the kindle currently .	-1
After reading all the glowing reviews about this book I bought it . It sounded so wonderful & about all the things I like to read . I was disappointed I 'm sorry to say . I found it slow going & a bit boring . I finally did finish the book but personally for me it was n't worth it .	-1
This book was extremely disappointing ! I feel cheated having taken the time to read this book in it 's entirety in the hopes of some redeeming quality . I do n't care that its free , this book was disaplontingly horrible . The heroine just automatically accepts she is an untriggered wolf and that the hero is her mate . A little scepticism and a believable amount of time are needed in order for two life altering revelations to be accepted and dealt with ; not the couple of hours given in the book .	-1
I decided to try this book since it was free on the Kindle . I did n't realize how short it was . I think I read it in an hour and a half . The description sounded like an interesting take on a tried and true storyline of girl wolf meets wolf mate -- has a few issues , threatened with death , but lives happily ever after . The different take was that she was mute . Except she 's not mute . She can speak a bit -- ok , there are mute people who are able to articulate somewhat , but our girl can speak with an Alpha voice and force grown , mean , desperate wolves to lay down and show their belly to her . Yeah , right.Other than a short plot about figuring out she was a wolf -- and that took her only a few pages to accept -- and a short threatening scene which she handled with that Alpha voice , the rest of the book was about sex . In fact , I 'm pretty sure that was the entire reason the publishing company chose to publish it -- as a soft-porn venture with a little , very little , plot thrown in . The company is Samhain . They do have an amusing website . Apparently you can get anything in romance that you desire . They list categories of romance comedy , contemporary , fantasy , gay-lesbian , historical , horror ( I ca n't imagine a horror romance . ) , inspirational ? ? ? ? , interracial , suspense , time travel , and western . Everything that is except a well-written book ? I plan on checking publishing company names and avoiding anything from them in the future .	-1
UNLESS A BOOK IS PART OF A SERIES I DO NOT LIKE WHEN THEY REEL U IN SO U MUST BUY THE NEXT ONE BIG TURNOFF FOR ME	-1
I really liked the idea behind the book , but got really bored reading the book . Even if I had read the `` real '' book instead of the excerpt from the Kindle Download , the way she wrote and what she wrote just really bored me .	-1
I read the entire `` book '' which is the only reason I did n't give it one star . Apparently this prequel to other Rachel Vincent books in this same genre is supposed to explain some of the backstory and entice the reader to want to read more . If so , it does a terrible job because nothing is really explained and I had zero desire to read any further in this storyline.I disliked the teen girl protagonist 's attitude throughout the short book , although I think she was a reasonably accurate picture of the extreme egocentricity , wild mood swings , annoying sarcasm , and lack of rational thought exhibited by many teenagers today . I 'm the father of two female teens so I 've got quite a bit of experience with them . She may have been accurately portrayed but she was n't sympathetically portrayed and as a result I could not care less what happened to her .	-1
More of my reviews can be found on my blog @ http : //littlepiecesofimagination.blogspot.com/I jumped into this series without knowing that much about it . People were gushing and raving about this series everywhere and I just could n't look pass it anymore , so I had to see what it 's about.Kaylee is at the mall with her friend Emma and they 're trying to figure out a revenge plan on Kaylee 's ex as well as shop for homecoming . Then all of a sudden Kaylee feels the urge to scream the heck out of her , because she sees shadows creeping upon a child in a wheelchair and when she starts , she does n't stop . The next time she 's conscious Kaylee realizes she 's been commited to a mental hospital . How did it happen and how , when and if she can leave is up for you to find out.The first half of the prequel was intriguing , but I could n't read more than 5 pages tops every night . My eyelids grew as heavy as rock and I felt like this book did n't attract me at all . I found this whole situation rather confusing and this mental institution just pushed me away even more.However , after complaining about it on Goodreads , I gave myself a promise to finish this ASAP in order to finaly start the real book . I was glad I did , because as soon as I started reading it got interesting all of a sudden . The last ten pages were fantastic and I 'm anxious to find out more . If it 's anything like the second half of the prequel I 'll read it with pure pleasure !	-1
This book was bad on every level.The plot was pretty much nonexistent . There was a small thread of `` escape Bedlam '' that was just unbelievable and after pages and pages of nothing it was accomplished in a spur of the moment afterthought way . From what I could gather the plot line consisted of absurd sex scenes ( really ? hours after meeting a filthy , epileptic crazy man she is `` tiddling '' on the floor of an insane asylum with him ? really ? ) interspersed with , well , not much more.The hero was a sniveling , blushing `` genius '' with no real depth . If he blushed or `` brushed away a tear '' again I might have had to break my kindle . The heroine was a self-centered little sleaze . Her first concern was always the crazy man she had just met , not her totally incoherent sister or anyone else who had been there for her through all of her troubles.The editing started out okay , for a cheap kindle book , but it was almost like by the end even the editor/proofreader was just skimming as the spelling and punctuation errors increased dramatically.The dialogue was unbelievable and almost painful to read . The H & h 's soliloquies of `` love and devotion '' were nauseating in the way they went on and on and on page after page all the way through . We get it , they love each other like no one has ever loved before and will be there for each other forever and would give up their lives for the other . There were times when a character would use a phrase or word that was just not true to the time but in the whole scheme of how bad this book was this was minor.I am still not sure what the heck happened in the ending . I know there were tears and `` happily ever after '' with the promise of more to come -- -not for this reader though ! -- after a silly chase scene where it all `` came together '' and all made sense to everyone -- -not ! The supporting characters were as inane and uninspiring as the mains -- -none were developed in a way that made them feel like real contributing parts of the story.There is so much more I could comment on that made this book bad , but I have already wasted too much time I will never get back on it .	-1
I was disappointed . At first the book was too full of raw brutality for my tastes ( man eating parts of a woman while she is still alive and restrained ) . As I was about to quit and started skimming over the story it turned around somewhat . It is not sophisticated writing , nothing of the quality of a Stephen King , just raw animal brutality that turned into a simple B-movie type story . Half way through the book the story ended . I would guess this is maybe a 30-minute read , if that . The rest of the book that I paid for was an interview with the author which was just advertising for the rest of his books . A very long advertisement I must say , that should have paid for this simplistic story . I 'm sorry I paid 99 cents for this and will remove it from my library , the fist time I 've ever done that with a Kindle book that I bought .	-1
I downloaded this title when it was offered as a Kindle freebie . Unfortunately the free offering could n't even get me through to the end . I found the writing to be a cross between a bad Disney channel sit-com and a bad porno movie . The description mentions cheesy - yes , it is.I realize that Samhain titles are steamy and if a title is marked as erotica it will contain sex scenes . That was n't the problem . I 've read some good erotica and sensual romance . There are plenty of well written titles to pick from . This was n't one of them.Vivi Andrews has a few other titles that are getting much better reviews . I will give her another try .	-1
In a sort of Romeo and Juliet spirit , Sydney ( Juliet ) , from a hunter family , falls in love with Jason ( Romeo ) a werewolf . She has dreamed of him over the years and meeting Jake in person , she falls in instant lust . They consume their relationship pretty quickly and he bites her , therefore starting her transformation into a full-fledged werewolf.Meanwhile , her father keeps trying to get her to hunt and kill werewolves.The hunters , who know full well the wolves they are trying to kill are human , are shown as uneducated rednecks , whose collective IQ is less than 100 . The werewolves are not much better . Why they would want to run wild in the woods when they know they 're in danger is never quite explained . One would think that they would have leaned to control their instinct in order to survive . Or at least do something to stop the hunt ( politics , law-making and media relation anyone ? ) But there 's worse . The relationship between Sidney and her father is unhealthy and made me cringe . She 's an immature little girl looking for Daddy 's attention and he does not listen nor takes her feelings seriously . Pathetic.I did not find anything funny about this story and recommend you skip it .	-1
I really like James ' books . I think I 've read them all . This just was n't as interesting . It felt flat without as much characterization .	-1
I hated the characters , a whining virgin who after being chased and almost forced does a 360 and has a threesome ! One guy is a bully and the other is his `` honey '' . You get what you pay for	-1
It felt rushed as if there was no time for them to actually get to know each other . Plus , only a few sex scenes which failed to impress . A bore .	-1
I understand it 's religious fiction but it was condescendingly preachy . If any religious zealots know of a girl pregnant or with a child out of wedlock this is the handbook they would give to them to make her feel as low and bad as possible about her big bad 'sin ' . She feels the need to publicly confess her sin . Just give them the avenue they need to stone you Vivian . That is ridiculous ! Billy is a nice man but he 's too preachy . Lessons about God can be given without copy/pasting scripture . As a Christian , this book made me sick and ashamed like I am when I see people who claim to be Christian and do nothing but judge and judge other people . This is the nauseating type of Christian.Vivian has a baby out of wedlock and is always thinking she 's about to be smite down for her grave sin . The relationship between her and her baby is weird . Sure she was raised in an orphanage from 14 to 20 but still . EVERY woman knows you breastfeed a baby . How she never clued in that the baby needs to be breastfed is ridiculous . Billy notices but never mentions it.She did n't act like the baby 's mother and she even mentions having a friend at the orphanage who was good with the babies . Well , Marie sure did n't tell her anything about babies because even monkeys have better natural parenting skills . They say if baby is lost in the jungle a monkey would be the best protection for them . But Vivian does n't even have monkey sense as a mother.That and WAY TOO PREACHY . If you want a great religious novel about forgiveness and coming to terms with your past and realizing that God loves you READ Heart of Stone : A Novel by Jill Marie Landis . It 's religious but not preachy . THIS is preachy .	-1
This book sucks . Save your money . If you purchased this book like I did can we join together & sue for pain and suffering .	-1
I really enjoyed the first book in the series , but this entry just fell flat for me.I felt as if I knew everything that was going to happen before it happened . Tanner and Maddie just did n't have the chemistry that Charlie and Brittany had . The sex scenes were a bit rote and their conflict was very easily resolved . I 'm not ready for love . Oh , you want love ? Okay , I 'm ready to love again ! ) .I 'm a fan of Erickson , so I 'll continue to read her work -- I think was just a case of this not being the right book for this reader .	-1
Just as I said with One and Only , the first book , this was a short read . However , unlike the first book , I suffered through it . I was done with it about halfway through and only finished it because it was short and I felt that I needed to get to the end in case there was something there to redeem this series for me . Sadly , I did n't find this elusive redemption.Same as One and Only , I think that if you read the synopsis above , you can just skip the book , unless you want to read about some vampire sex . For me , because the character and story development was so lacking , I could n't get into the sexy parts ... I did n't really care , because I could n't feel the connection . They were each others ' destined mates and so everything was pretty much instantaneous for them , just like Atticus and Lissa . As soon as they had sex they knew they loved each other and that was that . No struggle or anticipation . And , honestly , the lovey parts read like this to me : he was all like `` I love you ! '' and she was all like `` I love you ! '' and he was all like `` I love you more ! '' and she was all like `` I love YOU more ! '' And I was all like `` shut up and ... [ you 'll have to see my blog in order to actually see what I said here , cause it 's not appropriate for amazon - haydeereviews dot blogspot dot com ] . There were promises for dark delights that Marc was going to initiate Kelly into , but aside from a light slap on her ass nothing really outlandish happened.Okay , I have nothing against people proclaiming their undying love for each other . I really do n't . I just wanted to experience their love , not be told about it . That 's why we read these books - we want to feel something and aside from some mild irritation I ca n't say I felt much . I wished for some more struggle , more action , more passion ... just more.Let 's talk action . This is where I ask , what action ? ? There was supposed to be this big challenge with a rival , but again , if you read the synopsis then you read the details of the challenge and the fight . It was completely glossed over . I was disappointed . Which is pretty much how I felt about the whole story.To read more of my reviews go to haydeereviews dot blogspot dot com .	-1
If you enjoy M/M action , then you may like this book . Me , not so much . I truely wish the book descriptions were clear on this . I have a few Delilah Devlin books on my keeper shelf , but this is not one of them . I love her paranormal Immortal Knights series , but she seems to be expanding her story ideas . Male on male is so not my thing ! And the repeated image of ( how do I say this nicely ? ) two men in one hole has me cringing . Unfortunately she has been using this scene/act in a lot in her other books as well lately . Sorry Delilah , sexy it is not !	-1
I 'm a fan of Ms. R.G Alexander 's work . Ms. R.G Alexander is a talented author with a fruitful imagination . I purchased this book shortly after reading her `` Children of the Goddess '' series . Although i did n't have many reviews available to me before purchasing this book , I expected great things . Unfortunately i felt this book was a waste of time . I was less then impressed on the character development in this book . They just felt `` flat '' . I kept reading it expecting it to get better . The plot also left much to be desired . I was uninvolved as a reader and did n't care one way or another about Charli and her men . I would characterize this book as trash . The only reason i gave it 2 ( 1.5 not available ) stars was because i like the amazing race idea . It 's a shame the potential was never reached .	-1
This is a pretty nasty book . Honestly , I think some orifices are not meant to be filled.I came back to read the description to see if I had inadvertently downloaded a book that is clearly porn . Not the case . The description does not foreshadow the nastiness within . Rather it suggests it 's a run-of-the mill romance .	-1
I enjoyed the story up to a certain point , but when plausibility took a nose dive so did my interest . It was too much of a hackneyed deus ex machina plot device when what amounts to an invulnerable ground-skimming flying attack vehicle with everything INCLUDING the kitchen sink was introduced .	-1
Do n't get me wrong . I like a lot of Stormy Glen 's book but this one is definitely a miss for me . Sasha was suppose to be a mischievous and lovable character , I found him annoying at best . His sarcastic and cute attitude was did n't sit well with me . The sex was too damn much , it was in every page . I could n't finish this story .	-1
Usually , this type of book is right in the sweet spot of work that I love . It is a shame therefore for me to say that I just did not get this work . The book did not capture my enthusiasm either in terms of characters or the universe that was being portrayed .	-1
I love Andre Norton and to me she is the Queen of Sci-Fi . That being said , this is one of the first books I purchased for my original Kindle and I did n't realize that this book was a compilation of public domain novels that are available on Project Gutenberg . Knowing that these books were recompiled public domain novels , later I repurchased versions of these books that were properly edited and also looked at Project Guttenberg 's book list.As far as the stories go they are great but I was disappointed to find incomplete series of novels presented and that it included genre other than Sci-Fi . I did give the stories 5 Stars but as far as the book is concerned I give it 1 Star . I am now much more careful when I purchase older material . I am surprised that Amazon allows public domain books to be sold in their store.In Andre Norton 's favor , I still love her work 50 years after I read it the first time !	-1
I had a hard time finding it sexy and with as much bed hoping and clownish behavior going on I some how found it all just a bit boring . I was disappointed .	-1
The dialogue in this book tends to be rather simplistic . This book would be improved if the punctuation and usage errors were corrected . The author should become aware of the difference between PIQUE and PEAK . He also should learn more synonyms for SAID . ( I read the book before it was re-edited , so I do n't know if any of these problems have been corrected or not . )	-1
Keeper of the keys I give 2.5 stars . I nice quick read.After winning the lottery and a new man has come into her life and life is good . Kai finds out she has AIDS at 32 years old with a daughter 7 years old .	-1
Ctales Publishing should hire me as an editor . My qualifications ? Let 's count them:1 . I understand the proper use of commas , colons , semi-colons and periods.2 . I understand that , when conversing with each other , people do not say `` I am '' or `` it is '' . They say `` I 'm '' and `` it 's '' . This is especially true in high stress situations.3 . When writing , I know to identify the subjects of a scene with a break in text or a completely new chapter . The writer tended to shift to new scenes by starting new paragraphs with zero indications that the scene was shifting.4 . I can frigging spell ! ! ! ! More specifically , while using any decent word processing software , I recognize the significance of the red , squiggly lines under words.5 . Notice , there are zero run-on sentences in my review.I truly enjoy post-apocalypse-world stories however , if this is what passes for acceptable writing , I weep for our literary future.As for the characters , Dora , Tim and Mary would not survive more than a week in my zombie bunker . I 'd shoot them in the knees , throw them outside and ring the dinner bell . All three would make acceptable zombie bait . Please , do n't think me cruel and heartless ; I 'd graciously end it before they turned.Paige could stay because she became an asset over time.Does anyone know what Mike 's fate was ? I lost track of him during the confusing combat scenes and run-on sentences .	-1
I have enjoyed other books written by this author but this book was n't up to par . The angst felt contrived and over-blown . I felt like screaming as the 'solution ' to ensure their HEA was so freaking obvious . Aside from that there were some minor consistency issues ( M wearing contacts one minute and his glasses falling off later in the same scene ) which made me twitch with annoyance . I just could n't enjoy this book at all . It felt too formulaic and I did n't feel the author 's passion or interest . Disappointing .	-1
This just was n't a great read at all . J.L . Langley has been a favorite author of mine since I read Without Reservations and I expected His Convenient Husband to be just as good , but it was n't . While I might not be completely into the cowboy trope like the other readers I have enjoyed it on occasion ( so it 's not that ) , but this one just felt like a cliched , by-the-numbers plot . It lacked any kind of interesting qualities and missed the sexual chemistry between Micah and Tucker by a mile . I like her other books immensely , but this will be quickly forgotten for her other entertaining books .	-1
I have never give two stars to an author before . I have given one star for badly written books , with typos and spelling and grammatical errors . I am mainly disappointed by the length of this book . I hate , hate , hate being deceived and that is what I feel happened here . I paid for a full length novel . Instead the story ended 83 % , according to my Kindle . The rest was samples of other books . Gee I can get samples for any book on Kindle for free , I should n't have to pay for a novel with nearly 20 % of samples . The story was so so . It did n't have enough angst for the MC . It was well I loved you but I left anyway but now I am back so all is well . By the way Duncan is a bad guy , oh wait he suddenly realised he not so bad but bye bye and everyone lives happily ever after . ( Sarcasm here ) I have bought 3 other books from this author , but I am going to get my money back on this one and not buy any more . Because I hate being taken advantage of when looking at the number of pages I am buying and is cheated .	-1
This was kind of off . Did n't quite end the right way . something was lacking in the character department . This was odd on so many levels.there was some points in this book that was pretty good but overall it really comld have been a lot better .	-1
This story was over before it started . The story starts off with this queen who has so many traitors in her midst and the guy is on top of that list . He quickly seduces her into a boring , too quick sex romp and then the story is over . This story took about 7 minutes , but the excerpts from countless of other stories they want you to buy took much longer , about what this book should have been .	-1
This tale left me wanting ... it turned out to be a `` wham , bam , thank you ma'am '' for the most part . The story was so short that there was no time for character building or background or rhyme or reason . I did n't really find it `` steamy '' or `` erotic '' , so other than the author 's ability to portray the time period adequately ... there really was n't much else going for this one . Sorry , but it only rates two stars with me .	-1
It had potential but never got there . I 'm glad I did n't pay for this . Just an essay so the author can promote her other books . Unfortunately due to the lack of being able to hold my interest in this essay I do n't think I will be reading anything by this author anytime soon .	-1
This is really just a political statement , albeit one I agree with . It is fraught with unbelievable characters and in the end one immorality is substituted for another . It is not a mystery , not a thriller , merely an overblown ( pun intended ) statement of a position .	-1
The story starts strong with a classic Noir set-up ( woman walks into dive bar looking for her lost sister and gets a big dose of trouble ) , but does n't proceed strongly from there . The relationships between the characters are unclear . Every character seems to be a stereotype of some sort . The realism factor is missing . The ending is unclear . With a stronger editorial hand , the author could have had something here . But it takes more than visits to dive bars , missing women in peril , and characters who live on the wrong side of the law to make a good Noir story .	-1
I thought this book would help improve on my digital skills . Not the case . The author gives a few good pieces of information ... but very few .	-1
The grammatical , spelling and formatting errors were distracting . Being new to my DSLR I am always looking for good books to help learn to be more proficient in my hobby . I appreciate the pictures to help illustrate the subject matter . This is an okay book for beginners like myself . I would give it more stars , but the author states she is a & # 34 ; writer and photographer & # 34 ; , leading me to believe she should have proofed her work MUCH better . For instance , the very first page starts with the first letter on one line and the rest of the letters on the second line . Then further down the page , there is a square at the end of the sentence . A little further , a misspelling . That 's just on the first page . The information is good , the & # 34 ; writing & # 34 ; is not .	-1
So basically this book is about a girl whose in to baseball players . She 's with 4 of them throughout the whole book then suddenly picks one of the guys within the last 4 pages of the book .	-1
Not worth the price for only 65 pages . This was my first book by this author and will be my last . The story line was so different from other books of this type , and I had high hopes , but was disappointed . Reading other reviews , I see this is a series , and the rest of the books that follow are a lot better . Unless the author offers a book from this series for free , I wo n't be taking a chance . ( ljb )	-1
nothing special but nothing bad either . a harmless read when you have nothing to read and it was freeskip it	-1
This book needs serious editing . There is too much repetition and misuse of words . ( Cohorts instead of cahoots , for example . And per say ? Really ? ) I also felt the writer does not have a good understanding of the age group she is working with . Fifty-three year olds are not as decrepit as she makes them out to be and not likely to be wearing french-twist hairdos . The villains were a bit too stupid to be believed . Background information is presented in such a circuitous way , the reader has no idea what the point was . Aggie moved from England to Palm Springs to be with her daughter . No . wait , she moved with her friend Betty because of Betty 's cousin . Betty 's cousin and Aggie 's daughter both happen to be in the same place . Aggie moved and bought Betty a condo ( so she would move , too ? ) The writer needs to figure this out , write it down and refer to it from time to time .	-1
I felt that this book could have been better suited to teens and/or young adults . Not enough depth to even bother finishing it at this time . Maybe at a later date I 'll look at it again .	-1
The quick description on my Kindle made this book sound good to me . As I started reading it I got bored by a third of the way through . Every paragraph seemed to be saying the same thing . It 's as if the author was obligated to write a book with a certain amount of words and thats all it was ... .boring words . The story moved too slow . I would not recommend this book . There are others in the same genre that are much better .	-1
If this was a short story to draw the reader into the series - it FAILED big time.Nissa goes to a Vampire club because she wants sex with a vampire and to ultimately become a Vampire herself - ( maybe because she is lonely , not really explained ) . The author tells you that Nissa is drawn to the club and to Hex & Aleron . The reader is then told after days of having sex in every way possible in a menage that love now exists . At that point - all I could do was think - well , that 's nice - did n't ever feel the love but whatever.I like stories with a high `` heat '' factor but I also want well-developed plots with interesting characters and interactions.In this novella : - Dialogue was flat- Characters one dimensional- No originality- The plot is ? ? ? ? ? - not sure if there is one- Sex scenes read more like a `` how to '' book than an erotic scene- Rushed HEA - they had sex and then the reader is told that they are in love - did n't really feel itThe short story was mostly pages after pages of the three having sex but I would describe it as just graphic rather than erotic and definitely not sizzling . If you want a very short `` how to '' book on a few of the different ways to have sex - then this book is for you . Not very imaginative but it does contain some of the standard ways found in countless of erotica books that are more original and better developed .	-1
Bringing very little to the staple Vampire stories.The beginning looks promising , untill Two enters the vampire scene , but then it goes downhill and really is a bummer to finnish , because the action is slow and the vampire 's flashbacks are very tedious.I am not particularly keen on vampire boks , but , seeing that this one was for free , I thought that a guy who offers his book really would have somethinhg different to show to the world.No . My mistake.I wo n't , however , give it a one star review , because I respect an author who has no qualms about offering his work .	-1
This was odd throughout the whole story.I did n't understand what the plot was supposed to be about.The characters were one dimensional and had no personalities.The story was confusing and nothing made any sense .	-1
First off , the main character bothers me from the beginning . What a snooty , condescending woman . Her dealing with her so-called Alaskan clients is the most disturbing of all . What kind of a real estate agent ( yes , I do n't care you hate being called that ! ) lets clients sign documents that allow no inspections and free rent from the original owners for a year ? I do n't condone violence , but she truly deserves the beating ! And her hating Tiffany Reynolds for & # 34 ; screwing & # 34 ; people to get to the top ? Come on ! She does exactly the same to get her hands on that mansion ! The mystery itself is stupid ! First , you do n't get to the so-called mystery till almost one half of the book really . And the culprit and reasoning behind it is dumb ! A real waste of my time . Good thing I downloaded for free .	-1
I generally like to complete reading of any books I get but this was not interesting to me.I had to delete after three chapters , I do n't care who did it !	-1
The book was moving very slow . I finished the book because i wanted to know who did it . The book did get better about 3/4 of the way through .	-1
I really did try to take this all into context but just could n't . It was ignorance like this that left amazing cultures so broken , filled with alcoholism , lost tradition and domestic violence . This dude should have been trying to learn the sacred ways . Only my opinion .	-1
I should read the title eh ? I thought it was his works , but it was just the TOC and Index . That 'll teach me to pay more attention next time , eh ?	-1
Bought ths book and then I found out about this blog that took materials from the official church website and converted them to MOBI format . And the best part ... it 's free . If I could I would rate this 0 stars . Someones trying to pickpocket you , so do n't fall for it . Here 's the link nk : ldskindlemobi.blgspot.com	-1
I read the reviews and many of them praised the `` science '' and `` research '' that went intoPeak Erectile Strength Diet , but after reading this short , interesting tract I can find neither science nor research on these pages . There is nothing here but bold , unfounded assertions based on the typical social justice meme that seeks to perpetuate the lifestyle of subsistence farming peasantry at the cost of everything modern and everything truly scientific.The recommendations that so many people praised with such blissful closed-minded endorsement are pretty simple:1 . Exercise more2 . Eat organic foods3 . Become a vegan or as close to it as you can tolerateWhile these suggestions are indeed fitting and appropriate for the descendants of French , Indian , Chinese , and Spanish peasants , the rest of us can not survive on such meager fare . If these ideas were so very helpful to the peasants , then why did they work so hard to abandon their ancient `` healthy '' lifestyles in favor of rebellion , destruction of the aristocracy , and modern living ? A vegan diet leaves a person physically weakened , emotionally impaired , and dependent on someone else for daily guidance . In short , it creates peasants and there is a profound move through the modern world to convince you and I and everyone they can reach that we need to become peasants who do nothing but slave away in the factories and commercial farms established by the modern elitists for the benefit of the elitists.Early onset erectile dysfunction is founded in genetics . It is the result of countless generations of humanity that did not live beyond thirty years of age because their world was violent and their climate harsh . While diet may , in some cases , have a minor impact on erectile function , it will never have the huge impact books like this one are claiming it will have . The reason a starvation diet and hard exercise can , in some cases , bring minor improvement to reproductive function is because it stresses the physical animal beyond enduring and forces the genes to seek to reproduce in a younger , stronger specimen.The suggestions in this book will be helpful , but they will not transform an impotent or semi-impotent fifty or sixty year old into a breeding stud capable of marathon sex sessions . Such claims are hyperbolic at best and downright deceptive at worst . It is a pleasant lie designed to convince men to abandon their core strengths and become mild-mannered urban dwellers who wo n't argue with police and will consistently vote for bigger government and more government intervention into their daily life.If you truly want to know why your body is failing at forty , then you need to be readingThe Selfish Gene , Principles of Paleontology , andHard Evidence : Case Studies in Forensic Anthropology.The one thing the writer does get right is that replacing the candy bars and ice cream in your diet with dried fruit and dry roasted nuts will do wonders for your emotional life , your physical life , and your sex life . But that 's a far cry from abandoning your morning bacon and eggs in favor of powdered maca root/cocoa smoothies with a side of green tea .	-1
This was far too short to develop a 'relationship ' with the story . I liked the idea , saw potential for more for this horror story about what happens after death .	-1
Rgua story was ok . Was n't awful ; had it 's semi erotic moments but I felt it kind of lost its potential and rushed to finish an OK 15 min read ... But not the best .	-1
was shorter than it should have been . I liked the little I got of the characters personalities . Needed more writing .	-1
The truth is that I have not noticed this was Harlequin romance at the time of downloading . I usualy do not read romance books but since it already was on my kindle I decided to give it a try during my vacation . Well - I did finished it since it was quite a quick read . I never realy grew to like the main characters though . The female character Lorna was weak and strange while the male character James was so perfect that he sounded out of this world unbelivable . Anyway , this was an interesting experience for me .	-1
I tried this book on a free basis . It just did not suite my style of reading . It is worth a quick read .	-1
Could n't finish it . This is why I am giving it a one star review . I just could n't get into it .	-1
This story is a social farcical commentary on how the ongoing debate on abortion caused the US to fall into civil war . The storyline was consciously over the top describing the liberal and conservative path from public debate to public violence . The descent from heated public discourse into mass violence was short . The point of the author was clear , I just did n't find it very engaging . It was political/social commentary versus a future history in the model of Harry Turtledove or Heinlein .	-1
This book had nothing do with a Second American Civil war , it was mostly the writer religious view . Bad book .	-1
She never had anything traumatic happen that should make her dress frumpy the way she does . She had a car accident , that does not make you less of a woman because you think you can not have children . I think the hero , when he first decided to go for the heroine , seemed like he was playing with her for his own amusement . I would SERIOUSLY have thought this if I did not get his insight for a brief time or if he was not so caring at the very beginning . I am pretty sure he did not sleep with another woman since he met the heroine because he talks about cold showers over the months A LOT , even though he did go to events with other women . He just put her into the role of his wife and hostess without telling her ANYTHING and expected her to just know how he felt about her . Well here is a newsflash , telling the heroine that you have wanted her from the beginning sexually does not tell her you want to marry her . The heroine also changed COMPLETELY from the beginning to the end . She was a scared , easily intimidated woman at the start and goes to being a seductive , vixen type at the end . It was weird to see her change so much in such a short period of time because of a guy 's attention . I am not sure what the purpose of his friends on the yacht were . They did not have a significance with ANY decisions the hero and heroine made and they barely talked . It was all just annoying . I like this author and based on the reviews , really thought I would love this book ... .I did n't . I hate to say that but this one was not for me .	-1
Some bookswhich are advertised as Christian fiction are really not . This is one of them . The characters acted spoiled , controlling , and in my opinion just pretended to be Christians . This book was not well written and had many incorrectly used words . For example you 're instead of your . The repetition was very boring .	-1
I thought it 's a crime thriller . When & # 34 ; elves & # 34 ; were mentioned , I thought it 's a metaphor . But it turned out to be a supernatural novel with elves and a beast.There are some loose ends the author did n't answer . For instance , Izzy suspected someone was helping George to get in the building . Nothing was mentioned about it afterwards.Some plots are hard to believe . Why did the police not take the case seriously ? How did George and his car hide in a small village where almost everybody knew everybody else ?	-1
This was so boring I had to quit reading it - something I almost NEVER do . It seemed to go on and on and on and I was n't making any headway with the story . Felt like I had been reading for days and could n't get beyond the 20 % mark . Really a disapointment !	-1
Trite , uninteresting characters . improbable story line . Secret scientists who inject radioactive cells that give you telepathy mixed with the doings of the church pastor and community center ? .. send in the clowns ... there ought to be clowns ... .	-1
I read this book last week but did not leave a review at the time . I really liked the premise of it and tried hard to like the book . However , I could n't keep track of the characters and they seemed to just appear from nowhere . I felt I had missed a part earlier in the book where they were introduced and their story told . I actually went back looking for it the first time it happened . I decided to leave a review now because I just read a couple of other reviews that support my view . The similarity of character names combined with missing pieces of the story left me tired and disappointed .	-1
The novel may be missing sections in the kindle edition . Characters are put into play without clear introduction and the story jumps without transitions . On one page she is leaving to go to Gran 's , the next she is in bed having sex with her ex . I gave up a third of the way into the book . I was not interested in the characters and the story was n't engaging enough to warrant a greater investment of time .	-1
This work is a lead in to the author 's next piece in the series entitled , `` The Darkness '' and occurs after `` The Fury . '' I am not familiar with this series but after reading this piece , I have some interest in reading the full length stories . That being said , I was very disappointed over the misrepresentation of this work being a novella ( a short novel ) when it really is just a sample.The characters were interesting and the writing style easily hooks the reader and I will be looking for `` The Fury '' at my local library . I wish that Amazon would list Kindle literature more accurately since it 's very annoying to read a piece of work only to find that it is incomplete - a sample . I prefer knowing upfront what type of work I am reading ( novel , novella , sample or promotional piece of work ) . Just because this work was free does not mean it gets a free pass.I have read other lead ins ( like the one to Me , Myself & Why ? by MaryJanice Davidson ) that were Kindle freebies but were short self contained stories that prompted me to either read the novel or give it a pass . This work is more like a first chapter and not a self contained story .	-1
The story had potential but failed to deliver . The main character Elizabeth was weak , filled with self-doubt , selfish and annoying . She kept saying she was concerned about her 10 year old boy , but she constantly ignored his feeling in pursuit of her own desires . Even when a chain of events occurred that had the potential to change the course of his life . Then the one time that demanded her to be selfish she could n't make the right decision until she hurt the person she now loved.I struggled to get through it . Good luck if you decide to purchase .	-1
OMG , WTF and all the other short hand language that is used to say no . I truly hate not finishing a book but in this case I 'm ok with it . The names are wacky , the language is difficult plus the start of the book is dry . This book was drier than my sister -in-law 's turkey and she cooked it for 12 hours ( poor bird ) . If you need something to put you to sleep then this book is just what you need .	-1
As the author suggested , I read this one after I read THE ACCIDENTAL COUNTESS.This novella prepares the way for TAC . What it actually is , is one sexy scene after another.I did n't like Stephan in this nearly as much as I liked him in TAC without his memory.There was also the plot flaw of the children . They are barely mentioned here , and in TAC it is stated that Emily has been their mother from the day of Victoria 's birth . Not so here ... they are apparently in the care of a governess ... elsewhere.But if you are looking for a bit of sexy times , this is a good choice for you .	-1
Yet another book that is marketed as BDSM yet you need a magnifying glass to find the kink in this one.It 's a sweet little fluffy tale but so implausible that I ca n't really recommend it . If you want a 30 minute read that does n't strain your brain then this is the short for you . If you like a believable plot ; decent character development ; & a realistic development of the relationship ; this is n't the book for you . Not dreadful but definitely forgettable.Originally posted on Goodreads.com	-1
I could not make it through this book . It just did not hold my attention and I actually went to sleep while trying to read it . Thank goodness it was a free download ...	-1
[ ... ] Have a look at the link above and you 'll see that you can legally download all of these titles for free . Volunteers worked hard to transcribe all of these and whoever put this `` collection '' together took advantage of their work and added nothing to it.Any book from before 1923 is probably on Project Gutenberg .	-1
I bought this item when i first bought my kindle dx ( i LOVE my kindle dx ) after having it for a little over 4 months i noticed it cracked my kindle dx and its so not worth the $ 40 i paid for it , i had to go and buy another case for my kindle and only paid $ 15 for it and its not ruining my kindle .	-1
For the record : I like spanking romances . I 'm not one of those people who reads one and does n't know what she 's getting into.This historic novel is what is called magical realism . It is set in the real world but has magical elements . I like magical realism.I went back and forth on liking this one . I feel like a lot of these novels are really anti-women 's rights . I do not think that historic novels or DD ( domestic discipline ) romances have to disregard women as intelligent creatures so much . I do not think that BDSM , DD and all of that has to disregard feminism . In fact , in real life it rarely does and if it does it should be avoided.The fact that the main character is a strong woman who was born in the wrong time is fine . It makes sense that she would be beaten every time she expressed an opinion . It was awesome that she was so strong and capable but still feminine . I liked that she was able to earn some respect.The things that bothered me about this book were these : -The men in it were unrealistic pigs . They did not act like gentlemen would have acted at the time . A man of that time would have acted like a gentleman in public and the fact that he was chastising a woman would not have been publicized like it is in this novel.-Her brothers were abusive monsters.-The men acted like the main character was some horrible brat when all they needed to do was reason with her . Seriously , a polite explanation as to why she should n't do something would have gone a long way . In fact , some politeness somewhere , anywhere in the book would have been appreciated.-When she proved herself they still refused to allow her some leeway.-All the men were bullies except one and he did n't get the girl.-The characters were all fairly unlikable . If I 'm going to read a cheap romance novel I want to like the characters . The point of cheap romance novels is wish fulfillment . Literary fiction is for disappointment.-The men in this story at some point just decided that they would be unreasonable for no reason . The author was using those instances to get to the next spanking scene . However , it made it really hard to like the male characters.-The main character was smart but acted like a moron . At some point she needed to figure out how to act and how to get her way.-At one point the main male character lied to the heroine and tricked her . Then acted like he was in the right.-The thing that bothered me the most was that at the end the heroine tried to implement a change that would have advanced women 's rights . She was beaten by her husband until she promised to recant that move . Of all people her husband should have supported her . What she was asking for was not unreasonable and the king was willing to grant it.Anyway , if all you read these for is the sex and the spanking scenes you will enjoy it . If you actually want to read a decent story look elsewhere .	-1
The story line has been interestingly mediocre , but I have kept reading through the third book . Still , he needs a dictionary . He uses `` your '' for `` you 're '' , `` peak '' for `` peek '' , `` here '' for `` hear '' , etc , etc , ad nauseum . Get the man a proof reader !	-1
I started this book with great hopes . They were dashed on the rocks with tremendous force.This story was so predictable that I had to laugh out loud while reading . As I read the book , I could easily envision where it was going and how it would get there . I 'd turn a couple of pages and there it was ! Just the way I would have written it myself.Even the ending was so trite that I 'm surprised the friend / husband of Maria was n't named Joseph or Joe . That would have turned this into an out and out parody of the birth of Jesus . It was so close to that already it could have been written by Bevis and Buthead . The author should be ashamed .	-1
I think that this author may eventually learn how to write . I hope so because she has a great imagination . I did finish the book , which is saying something , but it was a stretch . Her characters are shallow shadows of a well developed character . They story line was jumpy and inconsistent . The ending was dreadful . I hated it . It seemed like she was out of ideas and just cut it off . The bad guy became a hero in one paragraph . I know that logic is not a strong element of fantasy but this book was worse than most in that regard . I gave it two stars instead of one because I reserve one star for books I simply can not finish .	-1
This was a collection of stories from an author I have not read before.which means I did not pick the story or writing style . This style of writing is not my preferred style to read , which is not fair to the author .	-1
This book reads like the work of a talented teenager . It lacks any evidence of writing belong a high school essay . Emotion on the part of the main character consists of getting upset stomaches . Chapter five seems to be a rewrite of a similar chapter in McKinley 's 'The Blue Sword ' . Perhaps the author will someday develop the ability to write at a professional level , but there is no evidence of it here . Others have complained of the editing . I see no issue with that in the version I downloaded . 99 cents may be two high a price to pay for this book .	-1
I bought this after I read the Fey ( which I ENJOYED ) . At first I found the characters interesting and it held my interest.I really thought I was going to enjoy the story . I was mildly surprised to see the cast of the Fey in this series . Maybe I should have guesses by the title that it was going to leave me hanging.That 's why the low rating . If you do n't mind waiting for the sequel , then it 's an OK read .	-1
This book reads like something written by one whose first language is something other than English ; awkward sentence structure and poor word usage run rampant , and this tends to further slow the already crawling plotline.What 's worse is the plausibility of character actions and events gives this novel the inescapable feel of a work geared towards children , despite any allowance for the setting being a fantasy world of magic.In short , another poor and seemingly rushed attempt to capitalize on the success of `` Harry Potter '' , and one that should be labeled 'Young Adult ' .	-1
While this book is a quick read and decently written , I feel like there was one page of story for every 5 pages of sexual scenes . Maybe I am just not into that type of novel , not to mention Vampires are overdone . Definitely will not be buying the sequels , mainly because I do n't see how this has anything to look forward to plot wise . However , if you are looking for raunchy sex scences page after page this may be the book for you .	-1
I know this is the first book in a trilogy , but as such , I expect there to be enough material to understand the basics of the story ! In this first story , I was very confused my the different characters , aside from the main two ( Zyra , Molly ) . The basic plot and understood it was that Molly had something and Zyra was going after her . This story had a lot of loose ends which were not described well enough to make sense . The action scene was written horribly , full of overly technical terminology and too much detail . Aside from the weak cliffhanger ending , there 's nothing here that made me feel like continuing the trilogy .	-1
At first , I thought the book is a good read but after a few pages , I could n't quite get what the whole book is all about . I understand that the author has his `` own '' way of writing , but this one got me really bored . The whole story is going off on all different directions , which tends to confuse the reader which usually results to loss of interest.The book is dissected in different sections , and lots of different parts that introduces one character or a single event on the book , it makes the book very uninteresting to read .	-1
I did not like the flow of this book . I felt like there was too much going back and forth . It did not keep me grounded .	-1
I was very disappointed in this book . I expected it to be written from a real life experience . Did not enjoy it at all .	-1
There was not a nice build-up or chase to this relationship . The heroine , while likable/admirable , quickly succumbs to the alpha wolf . I like the thrill of the chase ! There was n't one here and instead the author has waaaayyy too many sex scenes - too much of it makes it boring . My interest in the story actually perked up on the assassination attempts that 's how flat I found the romance . The story got really weird with the menage and the admitted orgies between mated partners - really turned me off as it cheapened the whole idea of a true mate . I did appreciate that gay relationships were represented .	-1
I have been reading PNR for a few years now , and I can usually devour a book in a day or so . This one took me over a week ... .. it was n't horrible , but it was n't good either . There was something off about it . I think the biggest problem I has was the h , she seemed to piss me off . I 'm not sure if was her attitude while she was `` kidnapped '' or after she come to accept her life . I guess she came off as bitchy through the whole book , and not in a good way.Also , I think that toward the end the book was skipping several months , then years . The whole someone trying to kill her , taken a back seat through the whole book , then was resolved in a matter of pages at the very end.The sex was a little boring ... . except the whole Ryan and Phillip scene , that was hot.This book was n't the worst I have ever read , but it definitely was worth the money I paid .	-1
I like a book with some sex . I like a book with plenty of sex . But I like the characters having sex to connect in a story before they jump into bed , or in this case the floor . I know it is a very short story and there is n't room for a lot of exposition but I can read free porn on the internet anytime . I read a book to get a connection between characters , emotional as well as sexual . These short sex stories just do n't and ca n't provide that.It is well written and if you just want graffic sex , then this might be the book for you . I need more .	-1
no plot no character just a free excuse for a couple of badly written smut scenes . not worth the time to read it	-1
Dear me ! The good points about this book is that it can be downloaded for only $ 2.00 and can be read in a little more than an hour . I see that there are two 5-star ratings that have been written . Is T. A . Chase a friend of theirs ? I found the writing puerile and totally lacking of any tension or drama . While sometimes nice endings are wonderful and there was one character ( great aunt ) you loved , this book is not even worth the [ ... ] for a download . Sugary sweet is all it is -- and I generally love gay romance novels !	-1
I really wanted to like this book . The theme should be one that I would enjoy . The problem is that the characters were not fleshed out enough and I did not care about them . It was also not believeable in nature	-1
I found this book to be disappointing and very poorly written . The characters lacked grit and testosterone . Story 's lacked depth .	-1
There is very little character development but lets face it how much can you get into 49 pages ? Obviously you can get in a lot of sex which seems rather second thought for the male protagonist . He is more concerned with punishing the female Protagonist and when he becomes aroused ... well might as well finish the encounter . There is spanking in this novella as well as a boorish Cash and a slutty Noelle . Noelle is so desperate to get sex from Cash that she will even risk it in the bar backroom where any one of his brothers can walk in and obviously they did view the event . The only nod to the holiday is the fact that Noelle rings a bell for a charity on the street corner . I 'm not likely to read this author again . Even for Free .	-1
So after reading this , I realized that this series would not be a series that I 'd be buying when they come out .	-1
I did n't get it have no idea what was going on it was like it started off in the middle of the book I needed more info . To get a better idea if I would even like the book	-1
Why bother to write at all ? this is really bad , especially when the house building stuff gets to be more interesting than the characters ...	-1
This is nothing but smut . I realize that erotic books are suppose to transport you to a different place , but come on , seriously would anyone meet a random stranger and then ( with out the aide of alcohol ) be having raunchy sex in a public place with them within 15 minutes ? And the ending of this book is completely off ! Poorly written . Waste of time .	-1
The story is about Alex , alley , and Taylor .Did not like . Just not my cup of tea . A threesome happy ever after story . Not for me	-1
I like a story with my sex scenes . This is a short that takes place in a 24 hour period ( give or take a few hours ) . No thanks	-1
This book was ok but to be honest for me there was too much sex in relation to the story . I like sex and kink but it has to fit in with the story and this I felt was sex heavy .	-1
Could n't get into this book . Sorry , maybe I will try again . Have too many other great books to read/review . I usually love the shifter books .	-1
It 's gay sex written for women who like M/M action . Things happen immediately - no one has any control or finesse . If you like that sort of Insta-Luv drivel then this might be a story for you .	-1
if there was a previous book it might have helped . i just did not enjoy the story . did n't like the characters	-1
I read all three books and they were entertaining but very slow to develop . Once you get where your being led you not suprised . I lost Intrest several times and had to leave it and come back . The good new is that it was no charge . I guess you get what you pay for	-1
Unfortunately did not like this book at all . I found the plot to be dumb , and the writing was sub-par . The ending was better than the first 3/4 of the book , but not worth the money paid . Sorry Rhyannon ! Normally I love your books , but this one should have been scrapped .	-1
I thought I was going to find some new information about early Christians . This book is really a summary of their beliefs , so I did n't find anything new .	-1
I wanted.. I needed something dark to read . What better than an urban fantasy mystery ? This is what you get if you buy this ebook.Despite the fast pace and the continuous action all through , the protagonist was two-dimensional at best , as where the villains and the companion of Jason Dark.The author has a good grasp of how a demon would `` feel '' when possessing a human body , and offers a good deal of descriptions regarding this . But other than that his ideas about the occult side of things show that he swims in unchartered waters . Maybe it 's just me , but I would have my fantasy with ounces of realism on the side , magical/paranormal realism as it may be.The mystery is only in the description and the atmosphere , which I would say was `` ok '' , but at no point is there a question raised of who was the killer or how was the murder commited.2 stars for the action and the pace .	-1
The writing did have a certain charm and there was a feeling of nineteenth-century London , but the plot was predictable and unexciting . I also saw some inconsistencies that made me backtrack and reread . Disappointing . Hopefully the following books are better , but I wo n't try them .	-1
I already wrote a review for this and do n't think I need to send another one in on why I did n't like it	-1
Did n't get past the first chapter before I made myself quit reading the book ... From the introduction where Lynda was looking out sadly into the rain in her shop to the first time she was described , I was completely turned off to this book . Glad it was free and I did n't buy the sequence books ahead of time .	-1
As erotica alone , it might delevers . Unfortunately the plot lacks logic to make the story worth following . I did follow though because the mystery was intriguing enough and really puzzled me but in the end a lot of scenes was not explained so it was a messy and loose story at best . ***Spoiler***My biggest trouble is that the heroine dreams about or sense when the villain is on the move . It was never explained why she alone were able to and not the hunter who was centuries older than her or all the paranormal characters.If you are reading for the erotica alone this might work for you but if you want the story behind all the sex to make sense this book will missed it more than a mile wide .	-1
I 've read Scott Nicholson books before and have liked them , but this was so boring and I did not find it at all entertaining and when I got to the end I went back thinking I had missed something but no , that really was it ... Definitely would not recommend .	-1
I read & # 34 ; No Cry For Help & # 34 ; and really liked the book . I thought I would try this one . It was full of horror to me . You have people being burned to death , shot to death , kept in holes in the ground , starved , doing with out water , being beaten . You name it.I stopped more than once and thought I would quit but thought surely it would get better , guess what , it did not . You can read other ref ewers write ups to see details . It was just a book filed with very bad things happening to good people for no reason . I would not recommend it at all .	-1
Nyssa is a spoiled brat at the beginning of this story . Sadly , she does n't improve much : she does n't seem to mature at all as the plot progresses , despite supposedly falling in love and learning things that should have offered perspective . She 's whiny , rude , and selfish right to the end . Theron , the titular Guardian , is described as a highly engineered dominant protector . He was more appealing than Nyssa , but the near-instant and repeated collapse of his deeply ingrained discipline around her made me roll my eyes . The `` futuristic '' vocabulary chosen by the author also detracted from any potential romance .	-1
I wanted to give this book more stars but I could n't because honestly it does n't really feel like a `` book '' . It feels more like an episode . It is such a shame because I LOVED the first one and I was hoping for something similar here but was disappointed . ( Truthfully I was hoping the same for the last three books of the series but my hopes have been for naught ) There could have been sooooooooo much more done with the story elements presented for Jek 's and Bryn 's story , while still giving clues to the inter-arching storyline the author has created that has spanned over the course of the series . That she did n't take the opportunity to write more scenes , to just give more like she did in the first book , is a real disservice to the worlds and characters she has created . Really quite shameful .	-1
I tend to cut this author a lot of slack . I know when I order her book that the sex will be raunchy ; there will be lots of foul language and an ambitious plot that loosely comes together . Unfortunately , this story exceeded even my worst expectations . The plot was weak and I found the characters so weak and unendearing that I could n't even force myself to try to make sense of their silly background story . Chandra , the so-called heroine , was annoying with a capital 'B ' and too contradictory . I like a story with a strong but not militant Black female character and Chandra was no such character . It was hard to believe that one , let alone two hotties would ever fall for this hot mess . The only good thing about this book was this author knows how to deliver a good sex scene . However , with the characters and storyline so lacking ; this book was reduced to being on the level of a low-grade porn . It was a HUGE disappointment . I ca n't say that I will never , ever purchase another of her works but this has certainly made me more hesitant to do so in the future .	-1
The idea of twin sisters switching roles is fun , and perhaps a little silly . But it 's a bit much to expect the reader to swallow a storyline where a primary school teacher agrees to fill in for her sister whom she and everyone else thinks is an investment banker but is really a Dominatrix . A little ridiculous to say the least.This is pure sexual fantasy which is all well and good but the characters have no substance to them and there is absolutely no chemistry between them - so it 's boring.This book is just an excuse for a few pages of sex .	-1
This could have been a good book with better dialogue and less corny locker room language . The characters showed promise , but bad writing killed this tale for me . Ca n't recommend this one .	-1
Not much to it , I must say . I did n't expect much to happen in such a short story , but the writing is not strong either . There was no flavour , no spark in the sex scenes , just a bland description that left me wondering when the hot parts were going to come , if at all .	-1
When I first started reading this book I thought what a different concept and I quite liked it , but as they kept adding characters it got harder to stay with the story . By the time I was half way through I just gave up and did n't even finish the book . I like stronger women in my books and that was a disappointment as well . I would say try it , you might like the way this is written just not for me .	-1
Story wise it was a bit unbelievable , She was expecting a & # 34 ; toy & # 34 ; party and ended up in a room with two men who rubbed her down , shaved her and placed & # 34 ; goop & # 34 ; in places they should n't have touched nor did she make any effort to really leave even after they took her down to the dungeon , after all the times she screamed to be released what Dom would have kept her and then she continued to let him touch her . This Dom did n't give her a safe word nor did he release her when she was screaming to leave ... Come on get real at least make the story believable . Amazon write up said it was 420 pages , it was only 100 , I could n't get past the middle of the book and returned it for a refund.. This would have been a great buy at .99 but not at $ 5.00	-1
This book was such a struggle for me to read . I was annoyed and bored for awhile . Then I just gave up and did not finish it . This book was not my cup of tea .	-1
This story annoyed me from page one . it got 2 stars instead of 1 because the grammar was decent . the sex scenes were stupid and boring and the plot was idiotic . do n't waste your money .	-1
on page 45 and i am so lost . this is not well written . the terms for the private parts are very silly . i can not finish . do not waste your time .	-1
that what you get in this book . no story line , the two mains are doing it the whole time , they do n't have time to talk .	-1
The fact that they were written long ago does not make them & # 34 ; vintage & # 34 ; , just old . There 's a reason i did not read these stories long ago - they tend to the mediocre .	-1
I downloaded this while it was free for Kindle and boy am I ever glad I did n't pay for it . The storyline is dreadful and the dialogue had me cringing more than once . I wo n't be looking out for book 2 !	-1
A disappointment from of my favorite IR writers ! The sex was what be would expect frm Lena 's book , thus the 2 stars , but the story was blah . The whole premise of the story '' I 'm upset with you , so I wo n't speak to you for two years , because of what happened in the closet ... '' .oh please . Story could have bee a lot better . Not to mention the whole group having sex issues with each other ... I have to pass on this one . I KNOW Lena writes better books these days . Skip this one !	-1
This book was good . I would 've liked more history on the `` magic '' . It was mentioned frequently towards the end of the story , but really vague . For that , I gave it 2 stars . I wanted to know about the relationship of the lead female and her parents . Again , they 're mentioned , but that 's it . This book has a good foundation but seriously lacks in the character development area . The chemistry between the lead characters is believable , but there 's just not that much there . Good free read , glad I did n't pay good money for it .	-1
I 'm torn between a 1star review , for the blurb not saying its paranormal , and a 4 star for hotness.The story is at a good price , it is hot , but the lack of a warning that it is paranormal story really annoyed me very much . It started off okay ( the story about a conservative girl wanting to break out of her shell and get a tattoo ; stopping at a tattoo shop and finding the tattoo dude like super hot ) and then all of a sudden it took a sharp left turn off into La La land ( talking about dragon protectors , mates , cr & egrave ; ches Verikos , and Gemii 's ... It was just weird ) and seriously that drove me CRAZY ! ! ! If you like paranormal , for a 1.50 , you ca n't go wrong with this story.However if you 're not a fan of paranormal STAY AWAY ! !	-1
I LIKE Erickson ( Fortune 's Deception : Fortune , Book 1is a particular favorite ) , but this book is just dull , dull , dull . A bland female main who is suddenly somehow a vixen once she gets her cashmere twin set off and a weak daddy 's boy ex-con male main who ca n't make up his mind . Their instant attraction comes out of nowhere ( which can be okay ) , but there is too much time spent with the weak and uncompelling plot ( gangster wants a bracelet because it belonged to the widow of his boss ? ) and not enough time in the bedroom . Even the sex scenes felt phoned in.Erickson has some really good stuff out there , but this novella is free for a reason .	-1
this book is just sex and no content needs to have more of a plot along with the sex . not happy with book	-1
I decided to read this book because it was free and I had read a few things by Lora Leigh before . I had never read her bound hearts before and have no desire to read another . : Spoiler : Tess had a call from her father asking her if she was coming to his party she had not been to one in over a year.She agreed to come for a week.Her mother and father were divorced she could not deal with his kinky life style.He is married to a dumb blond only ten years older than Tess and she did not like her . She has a thing for her brother he had told her two years ago all the sexual things he would like to do to her . She had not seen him since . She had read books when she was in college that her mother called her a pervert so this is the reason of the story . She hears from Cole asking her about the party while she is pleasuring her self . she has not heard from him in two years.She goes to her father 's he and Missy are not there.They are supposed to come back the next day except Cole comes . You find out her father has gotten Cole to teach her how to be submissive .She wakes up the next day tied down and spread eagle . He tells her she can say no but he never stops if she asks . He brings in another man who works for her father as well as Cole.For a threesome.So far no love or foreplay its what Cole wants . While the three are in bed in walks her mother screaming pervert , than her father and step mother . The other man leaves says he is not involed . So what does Tess do go into the kitchen with her hated step mother and eat ice cream . They are friends now and Cole has disappeared . I will leave the ending off did not seem real to me . I could not get over her father setting her up , plus the other man there was no romance what so ever . I do not like the bondage story but can deal with it if maybe you tie each other up for fun once in a blue moon.I do not see how someone else can tell you what you like . I think they should have the devil beat out of them for a change and see if they feel pain . There was no heavy stuff in this the only thing I can say good about it . I would have given it one star but one was for Lora Leigh as she can write better books	-1
I wish heroines would learn the word no and stick to it occasionally . It might be a refreshing change . I did n't like the book because : -Tess is tricked and lied to by her father to come to visit him and his second wife for 1 week.-When she gets there he and his wife are not there.-She thinks he will be arriving back from a trip but the next morning she wakes up tied to the bed by Cole who is nude.-She tells him to untie her and let her go but we all know what his answer is going to be and because Cole has loved her for 2 years and she turned him down he is going to force her into admitting her kink one way or the other.-He tells her that her father set her up because he knows what she really wants in her heart because when she was younger her parents found some of her erotic novels on dominance and submission . So what about it ? Just because she was reading that did n't mean she was wanting to be a willing participant.-So her father is leaving her alone and at the mercy of his brother-in-law for 1 week to get her to admit her kink . Her father is divorced from Tess ' mother because he is also into kink . This means that he discussed Tess ' private business with his second wife and his brother-in-law.-There is a menage scene with Tess , Cole and a stranger to her who also happens to be Cole 's best friend and the second in command at her father 's business . She does n't care about him and he does n't care about her either . EEWWWWWhat a turn off ! Her father 's betrayal and there is nothing else you can call it along with the menage between 3 people , 2 of which did n't give a fig for each other ruined the book for me .	-1
The story just did n't grasp enough of my attention blocking me to connect with the characters . Maybe because the story felt repetitive and not enough sustenance that I just got bored a few chapters in . I went into this book wanting to check out Lora Leigh 's writing style and believe me i really wanted to like her book . Unfortunately , I would not recommend this book for others to read . Perhaps she might have written better books so I 'm not completely writing her off just yet . However , I will be visiting other writers before revisiting Leigh again .	-1
Did not like this book at all . The bondage is something I am just not interested in . Removed it from my library after the first chapter . I did try to read it ...	-1
This Bible is not easy to find your verses . You can go to Table of Contents to pick the book of the Bible but then it takes you to Chapter 1 of that book . If I need Psalm chapter 150 I have to scroll through 149 chapters to get to it . You can touch the link at Psalm 1:1 but all that does is bring up every chapter and verse ( sans the actual text ) and you still have to scroll through all of it to get to Psalm 150:1 . This is useless . Waste of money . I still gave it 2 stars instead of 1 simply because it is the Bible which is the greatest book ever written .	-1
Everytime I have tried to use the search function , my Kindle totally freezes up . I can go to the table of contents for my chapter , but then to get to the verse , I must page through each through each individual page or else my Kindle stops completely and I have turn it off to get it to work again . Even turning it off is difficult , my Kindle balks at that and it takes several tries to actually torn it off . it is evidently not properly formatted for my eReader .	-1
There was n't enough to this story at all . I could n't really connect with the main character at all enough to care if she ended up happy or miserable . For a while I kind of wanted the guys to drop her all together and have the story just be about the two of them .	-1
I could not get into this story . The femal lead just got on my nerves . And in my opinion menage relationships are just a hard sell . Three people - usually two men and one woman are that into each other . I only see it really working if the men are bisexual or brothers . Seems to me ego and testerone would be a big issue . So , if an author does n't sell me on an emotional connection between the men I ca n't imagine it working . I did n't get an emotional connection from this trio .	-1
The positive : The book is very well written with tight scenes and well-developed characters.The negative : I could not bring myself to like Briony . Her constant daydreams about the perfect Master quickly became irritating as well as highlighting her shallow materialism . The many insertions of e-mails from an online BDSM dating website were disturbing and really did n't add to the story of Chris and Briony . In fact , the majority of the story was n't about the relationship between Chris and Briony , but was about Briony 's neurotic need to find the `` One '' and the destructive behavior in which she indulges.I completely agree with the previous reviewer who mentioned that the first-hand style of writing hampered this story . I found it difficult to understand why Chris would want Briony when I had no clue to his thoughts .	-1
This one got mixed reviews , but I figured what the heck , it 's free . Im not through the first chapter yet and im not sure i want to read more . It 's not horrible . Believe it or not I 've actually read worse . But the author does a large amount of telling instead of showing . For example , Ty will often tell us how Gwen was feeling rather than the author showing us through Gwen 's actions and expressions . Typical beginning writer mistakes . The characters as well were unfortunately cardboard cut outs , and some of their actions poorly motivated , IOW unbelievable . No chemistry between the characters either . Unfortunately I wo n't be looking for anymore of this author 's works . Had I paid for this , I 'd feel cheated .	-1
I 'll make this short and sweet . Every book should give you some sort of visual when you read it . Well , when I read this I got the visual of a cheap BDSM porn movie . That is not my idea of a good read but if it is yours then knock yourself out .	-1
Not what I expected by the book description ... Jessica is not the typical innocent drawn to a professor but - for at least the first part of the relationship - she is definitely the aggressor ... Too fast they get into the bsdm stuff ... that part was ok but not great ... I think the author tried to include too much considering the size of the story turning it into a too forced and rushed plot ( it felt like : ok I have only 60 pages , lets describe and make them practice everything that I know about BDSM ... ) Do n't get me wrong , there are so many great erotica books even shorter than this one that I love and in which authors are able to develop a plot despite the few pages ... so to me the problem is not the size but the writing ... not recommendable if you are looking for something more than sex .	-1
I almost bailed at the end of the ridiculous first chapter where ( Spoiler Alert ) a prisoner with a life sentence is working as a programer on the prison 's payroll system ! Really ? The prose and pacing is unbalanced in the sense that much of the background , color , or descriptive material detracts from rather than adds to the story . Here is an example : `` He never did anything on the computer while he ate , since he despised crumbs in his keyboard . `` Several typos are noted , for example `` ... it would be the usual -- unning the kids around ... '' ( @ location 246 ) .Having reached the ten percent mark , I can take no more .	-1
I am afraid that this book did not grab me at all . I didnt relate to the characters , and was surprised that there really was no depth to this tale . I would not recommend it .	-1
what a epic let-down . this book could have been so much better . but there was no plot and tons of pointless oral sex and it was n't even sexy sex , more like gross and crude . the main male lead did n't even think the main female lead was good enough to have normal intercorse with so he did her in the ass . gross much .	-1
I know that the cliche plucky heroine can be so annoying , but I 'd rather read about that than a gal who is a squishy doormat so besotted with the hero , she takes whatever belittling abuse the hero gives out . I get uncomfortable and have to slog through to the end . So , this was slow , painful going for me.Wo n't give any revelations away -- and those may make it okay or even uplifting/romantic for angst-loving readers who embrace a self-effacing female lead who 'understands , ' 'forgives ' and keeps on giving head with an open heart -- but I just can not get into it , given how much and how relentless he was in his anger at her up front and how limp she was generally . Trick ( hero ) dug himself into a pretty deep hole from my point of view and she made me want to scream & # 34 ; Wimp. & # 34 ;	-1
I could n't get into this story . I 'm glad I got it for free ! Does n't the guy look like he is playing with himself on the cover ? There was a lot of head hopping which made the story confusing to follow . The best part of the book was the sex scenes ( which were n't that great either ) . All in all it needed a lot more editing . It was poorly written and I do n't plan on reading more of this series . It just gave me a headache .	-1
I could n't make it past chapter 2 . I dislike giving 1 star reviews and I am the first to admit that I may be more picky that most , and I do n't want to take away from the author 's hard work by tearing her book apart , but I do feel I should explain why I stopped reading after chapter 2.Through most of the first chapter it was hard to tell if the writer was writing in first person or third person . I love fantasy , paranormal , and science fiction ... a lot ! But , chains that pop out of your body to tell who your life mate is , well , seems beyond weird and a little gross . But the clencher was the sex scene in chapter 2 . It was rape . She said no , period . I have a hard time with `` erotica '' that passes off rape as sensual and enjoyable.So , there you have it . Maybe it gets better after chapter 2 , I do n't know .	-1
Not worth your time or money to read unless you feel need a Walt Disney ending . Story lacks heat and things become vanilla . Suddenly everyone is healed and wants normal relationships and lifestyles . Huge disappointment . Even their disagreements lack warmth .	-1
Too slow , read 25 % , but gave up . Also did n't like the Snoop-Dog lingo inserted here and there . Not big on rappers in general .	-1
I am not impressed with this installment in the series . I agree with many that the first two were much better than this offering . I did appreciate the history of the lead characters Pip and Jeff . Their combined past experiences explained alot behind their beliefs and actions . I understand this this is an ongoing series , but with the other stories , the lead characters ' story was pretty much wrapped up at the end of the book . This story was not cohesively written , and that ended up being a distraction . After everything that happened between Pip and Jeff , the manner in which the ending was handled did not leave the impression they would necessarily end up together . There were too many issues between them that were not resolved for that to happen.I see on Amazon that this series was just released in November 2009 , but I originally purchased the first two books when they were released by Ellora 's Cave over two years ago . I do n't know if the break between the books in the series had an impact or not , but I was not impressed with this one . Read the first two , and skip this generously rated two star disappointment .	-1
I asked for british countryhouse mysteries and this book is far from that description . I only read a couple pages . I will never again fail to avail myself of the `` peek inside '' .	-1
I ca n't remember anything about this book , so it must have been very forgettable and a complete waste of time and money	-1
My major issue with this work is that it starts and stops three separate times . Fascinatingly , each separate start is a really good premise ! But its frustrating for the reader because the characters are put back to square one and repetition and redundancy ensues.A second issue , is that the world building is lacking . I do n't understand the wolf culture . Neither the old ways or the new ways were explained . So when the twist happened and the wolves went back to the old ways allowing Zan and Brant to be together I did n't really feel an impact . And we do n't get more about Zan 's background until the end , and it was n't that much . Lucas seems to be worldly and wealthy , where Zan only finished high school and works at a cafeteria and then a perfume counter . I needed more reasons behind the attraction.Another reviewer mentioned that Brant did not stand up for Zan . He let Lucas walk over him and her and their relationship . Brant did not layeth the smack down upon his brother when Lucas saw them having sex not once , but twice ! And the second time it was n't just Lucas who got a sneak peek ! Un unh ! And worse , Zan did n't call him on it.I really liked that this was an interracial PNR , but I wish I had known whether there were any other skin tones in the pack ? Was it not a big deal that Zan was black because there were other shifters of color ? I was constantly thinking about that .	-1
the characters were flat and undeveloped , it seemed like the writer was trying for 2 books , one a disaster book and one a soap opera romance with the obligatory sex scene to spice things up . the beginning started off pretty good but it bogged down real bad and i had to keep flipping pages to find something interesting -- -this was supposed to be about a tsunami coastal event , right ? but , it wasnt , not really . i felt tricked . its just a soap opera .	-1
I hate to give pan reviews , but really - the limericks in this book are poorly written , do n't always rhyme , do n't always follow the appropriate meter , and are rarely humorous . I read through more than half the poems to give it a chance , and I found perhaps one that was worthy of being published . I would give this a pass .	-1
The book was good but it was kind of bland and boring . It could of used more snapshots and thought shots . To me it was snack book , it would be good for ten year olds .	-1
Ok , so I can read a young adult book with no real sex in it as good as anyone . My problem is when a book has two naked people on the cover who are vampires and adults . I feel like I was totally cheated here ! ! The book felt a lot like a vampire : the masquerade novel and was kind of unfulfilling . Cliffhanger ending , no smut , the only thing that kept me going was my love of vampire romance and Dimitri 's wit .	-1
I found this book to be very childish in its deliverance . I had to skip so many pages to stay on course with the plot . Finishing the book , I thought , geez , what a waste of time . This went nowhere as far as I am concerned . Just another author using cliff hangers to get people to buy buy buy . I can not even fathom reading anymore of this garbage . Very bad form . A good author does n't need to use cliff hangers to captivate their audience . Getting sick and tired of this writing 101 tactic . Do not recommend this author .	-1
I read sixty percent of this book and it was a snoozefest ! I love vampire adult fiction , but nothing happened in the first three quarters of the story . There is no romance , no action , and all they do is travel from one city to another by foot and stare longingly at one another . Waste of money .	-1
The story premise is an intersting one , but as a reader I was repeatedly brought out of the flow of the narrative by grammar mistakes.Like in the first two books , the writer exhibits no understanding of the proper use of the words he/him/himself , she/her/herself , I/me and they.Also , the use of the word 'floor ' in particular is often misplaced , with jarring results . One can not look down at the floor unless one is inside ! If an editor was paid , get a refund . If not , get some grammar lessons.K Young , BA English Lit .	-1
I love exotic romances ! This cover looks hot , but the story missed a lot of what I needed as a reader . I would not buy or read again !	-1
I like the way the books started , with a strong story base line and what seemed to be strong definable characers , but after 15 % of the book it all went down hill from there ... if the author would have stuck to a little bit of mystery and crime solving and lot less sex it would have turn out to be a better book , as it was ... porn pretty much sums it up and for me that is disappointing .	-1
Ok ... I shut my kindle screaming `` Stupid story ! ! '' I know there are people who are into the extreme BDSM and this was definitely a tale of subjugating the female character ... all because she 's part of a clan that she did n't know she belonged to . The whole premise was ridiculous and half way into the book I was thinking about just deleting it but I persevered to the end.Michael started out as really intense almost to a stalker stage . Kate started out as this really independent woman and in the end due to Michael 's `` training '' she becomes a submissive - much to his delight ... because of course only through being controlled , whipped , pinched , shackled , tied and treated like a dog will Kate ever achieve ecstasy and release to become the submissive she was born to be ... because that is part of what the clan is all about - pleasure through pain . And Michael is the ultimate dominant that needs his submissive dog in order to be whole ! Blech ! ! ! ! ! Gag ! ! ! ! I can stomach a little BDSM but this type of sexual play is so demeaning . At one point he fantasized about all the purple bruises he will leave on Kate 's white skin because that turns him on . Ok Michael ... and uh..Michael also has an abnormally huge manhood that he hurts Kate with when they finally do have actual intercourse . Oh please ! ! ! ! Spare me ! This book was all about demeaning a woman to bring pleasure . Excuse me but I think I will pass . I did n't see much romance in this book but with the title of `` Power and Pain '' what did I really expect . Uh ... I will NOT get Book 2 .	-1
I got this book for three reasons , first because it was free , second because it sounded interesting , and third because of the BDSM assert . that said this book is very , very dark . The sex is violent and there is little consent by the woman . We keep hearing about the clan and her lost ancestry , but none of that gives a reason as to why he needs to be so very brutal and unforgiving towards her . Not to mention that we Do n't learn anything about the clan , it 's need to function or how it fits into the story . There is absolutely no kindness , compassion , or gentleness AT ALL from him . Shame on the author for not goingving even a safe word she could use to get a break from this sadistic Monster who supposedly is her mate . Not once in the entire book does he profess his love or caring for her . Instead he repeatedly abuses her and has no care for her pain and suffering other than HE needs her to accept it so HE can be a man . This is no more BDSM than 50 Shades of Gray is ! ! !	-1
It 's a short story . It implies a relationship about D/s , gives vague details , & does n't really explain anything . I understood more about her family than about what was happening with her & Will . They did a couple of kinky things , I would n't really call it a lifestyle or D/s relationship . Almost more domineering than Dominant.I 'm just not feeling it . I want more about Sean & Chad . I believe I know what happened with the fight . So I 'm only gon na get the last novella . Hmmmm just checked price , added to my wishlist . If I 'm feeling rich maybe later .	-1
First of all I 'clicked ' for this b/c it was free . I must say that I have read hundreds and I mean hundreds of books but have never read such a bunch of crock in my life . I 'm trying to be polite here and not use the words I really want to use . At first , I thought this must have been written by a man . A woman could n't have written this but I was wrong and I apologize to the male population.Savannah should have been screaming rape from the get go and the minute she was freed cut off the magic pencils of the oh so generous , considerate , thoughtful , and oh yes well dressed businessmen involved . Who because they gave her SUCH pleasure were only really doing their part because Matt loved her . Let us ignore their physical reactions to the whole incident . Such magnanimous perverts . I actually laughed a few times when I was n't spitting nails at the philosophical logic behind it all . Honestly , some people will believe anything if someone double talks to them enough.When Savannah asks Matt to please do n't hurt her , a little late I thought , but at his reply `` Never , sweet Savannah . I 'll destroy anyone who causes you a moment of pain . '' I cracked up . I do n't think it was the author 's intention but it was absurd that he professes his love and devotion after he attacks her and exposes her to the abuse by other men . Savannah is pathetic since once her lovely experience is over she begins to remember Matt 's many kindnesses and was impressed that he just 'knew ' she is a masochist since he is a sadist . Excuse me , but I think I need to go puke now .	-1
I had heard a lot about how wonderful this author was so I bought this book.I hated it . Could not finish it at all that that is not like me.In my opinion this is no a romance . This is more about how many ways a group of men can get one woman off.I almost gave up on this author because of this book.I finally decided to give another book by her a chance because it did sound good.I am very happy I did . I am in the 4 book of the Nature of Desire series and love them all . I have already bought the other 3 books . I ca n't believe this is the same author.I highly recommend this author . Just not this book .	-1
I thought this book wasted so much time up to 55 % of it to give a year by year run down from 1999 until preset on Adam and Ronan . Adam actually listened to Ronan getting it on with various women while he became Ronan 's roommate . Unrequited love is one thing , but I can not believe that Adam never had a relationship with anyone while Ronan was getting it on with every female he could . I was flabbergasted that the two partners at a security firm had not noticed that Adam never dated anyone and no one thought that was weird that Adam never showed interest , unless Ronan asked him for a double date favor . He moved in with Ronan at 18and someone should have figured it out that he was gay since that is their job to notice something that does not add up . Ronan would not have been seen the scene with Kasey and be oh hey i wan na do you . There is a scene in the book where I had to say `` OMG No BFF of any gay guy would do that '' and I quit reading.I am a fan of Stormy Glenn , Lynn Hagen , SE Jakes and Christine Shaw , so to me this book stunk .	-1
I guess it was an OK mystery ... not the best I 've read . The writing style was kinda awkward ... did n't flow well in my most humble opinion .	-1
I wanted to like this book . It started out promising and then dragged . I actually put the book down and came back to it four days later . I NEVER DO THAT ! If I have to stay up late to finish , I do.The good : I liked many of the characters . The author did a great job with the main characters , and the best friend . She also was very good at showing their insecurities and putting their emotions and fears into their inner dialogue . I understood both main characters and they drew me in . They were not enough to win me over.The bad : One of the worst covers I have seen in a long time . It does nothing to draw in the reader . The story itself needs editing . Some words were wrong , say instead of stay . Also jarring transition from some paragraphs . The story did n't flow . I would turn the page and have to go back . The `` mystery '' was also lame . It was over simplified , as if for a child to figure out . This felt like a rough draft , or the first book by a struggling author who has n't found her voice yet.Overall , I give it 2 stars . I 'm frustrated with the glut of books available of amazon that are sub-par . This could have been good , but it was rushed to the public , or maybe it was done to make quick cash . I do n't know , but it did n't feel like a real book , and sadly that seems to be the new norm on amazon . No quality control . I probably wont be reading this author again .	-1
I had a very hard time reading this book . Worst were all of the grammar , punctuation , and spelling errors . `` Lose '' is spelled as `` loose '' more often than not . `` Where '' instead of `` were '' and `` murder '' instead of `` murderer '' over and over . Aside from that , the premise of the book sounded good , but I was 50 % through it before it even got into what the description said it was about , so a very slow start . The ending was kind of lame . I just was not impressed .	-1
Book downloaded fine , so that 's not my problem . This is not a romance . Maybe comedy , scifi ? Anything unbelievable . The plot was absurd . The author tried to follow to many characters . The conversation between all the characters are annoying.Spoiler spoiler spoilerwho has a hit out on them from the mob and goes gambling ? Who joins witness protection and goes back to what put their life in danger in the first place ? Who gets shot in the shoulder and is able to drive across town to die in the right spot . Even Hollywood plots are more believable then this book.I 'm glad this was a free downloads . I do n't recommend reading it even for free .	-1
Not sure about this one ... .YES the scenes jumped around too much and I 'm not an editing freak but it gets real annoying when the paragraphs jump around and the characters name changes on one line but than back to the correct name , I know I should n't do this but I skipped some chapters because of it.Once I started reading this story it did not draw me in but I muddled thru most of it ... .yes , the characters are black but you know that within the first chapter , that did not bother me but the massive typos/scene jumping did ! Last ... I hate when someone uses the & # 34 ; CU** & # 34 ; word..it totally turns me off . The sex scenes were also choppy . ( Ex : Marcus woke up with Karyn in his arms ... Karyn wakes up and smiles at Malcolm . ) See totally confusing .	-1
I found this book really boring . Not much went into the writing of this book . The only good thing was that it was short .	-1
I feel like I should have given this novel more of a chance but I genuinely just can not get past the horrible grammar . The author has endless amounts of run-on sentences , some of which are worded oddly . I feel like it could have been a good novel , but the premise does n't interest me enough to try and work through the bad writing .	-1
I am an avid reader and a huge fan of Leah Brooke . Her books was the first erotic books I ever read and I placed her on my top ten author list for erotic novels . As far as I am concerned she is as good as Maya Banks , Lauren Dane , Shayla Black , Lora Leigh ect . However , this book , I am not sure what went wrong but this is one of her worst . The story feels incomplete like everything in the book was just thrown together haphazardly . I did not like Elizabeth , I thought she was selfish , unforgiving and a proud woman who made stupid choices as a child and then proceeded to blame others for her own mistakes . Her daughter although really cute was just so undisciplined and spoilt and her mother had no control . I liked Chandler but could not find a liking for Hayden ( although I loved the names ) . What could have been a great book just flopped all around.What attracted me to Ms. Brooks books was the way she develops the relationships between her characters . She took her time with each character and you get to know them , you relate to them . I also loved the way she develops her characters romantically , sexually , mentally and emotionally and that 's what attracts me to her writing and her books . This is not the norm for Ms. Brooks . I believe ALL authors have a few books that are not going to be good and I believe this is one for Ms. Brooks . I hope to continue reading her books in the future . Unfortunately , I can not recommend this book .	-1
I was not impressed with this book and do not recommend it . I was expecting more but I was highly disappointed .	-1
I really liked `` Containment '' and following that I bought several more of Cantrell 's books . However each one seem shorter than the one before . This was would have been good had it been longer but this was just ridiculously short and even though I was expecting it , I was still surprised by how quickly it was over . There simply is n't enough time to build any character background enough to care about them in that time.The guy has good ideas but really need to learn to expand on them !	-1
This book is a compilation of short stories . To me when stories are short the plot should be developed quickly.At times this book lost my interest .	-1
It 's hard to find a good balance in a book between story development and passion . Given that the title of this book is `` Surviving Passion , '' I must say that there was not enough of it in there for me . It seemed to take a really long for the two of them to admit that they had feelings for each other , then once they acted on it , they tried to pretend like nothing happened . They did n't finally stop playing the let 's tell each other how we really feel game until the end . I had high hopes for this book , but it lacked the passion I was waiting for .	-1
Boring . I fell asleep while reading this multiple times , and I ALWAYS finish books , even bad ones , but this one I just could n't bring myself to finish .	-1
I did n't enjoy this book . I read it all of the way through and it ended worse than it began.There were too many `` main characters '' to begin with . The reader was given glimpses of each in their little `` flashback moments , '' but there was not enough to like any of them . As others have noted , most of the characters came off as jerks -- self centered jerks to be exact . Because there were so many `` main characters '' each one 's `` romance '' was given no time at all . Seriously , I would definitely prefer one GOOD romance than 4 rushed jobs . When you try to mish mash 4 romances together like this the characters are lost and the plot ceases to exist.This is billed as an `` Irish Romance , '' and I can only assume that is because everyone speaks like a bloody Irishman -- despite the fact that only 2 of the characters are from Ireland . If the author wants to make most of the characters American , then bloody well learn how they talk . The editing was poor but that takes a backseat to the lack of a plot and poorly developed and unlikeable characters .	-1
Sorry to post a negative review - not something I do very often.I really felt like this was like the & # 34 ; Foreword & # 34 ; for Gompertz ' next book . The title I thought was brilliant , and it was that which made me readt it on the first place.Unfortunately I was left wanting , and when I had finished I wondered why I had bothered.Disappointing - but I wish him well with the book that it is obvious he is more excited about .	-1
More a few tales of living and working overseas . It felt like an introduction or an advertisment for other works by Gompertz , without really going any where .	-1
The story is too dragging . Basically the story is about lust and sex . the only love story literally on the & # 34 ; last page & # 34 ; . How can a woman who is a virgin gave herself to a man she barely knew without fighting . Heroine describe here is not a virgin . Only a non virgin can react like this . The Hero in this story is a jerk and always flaunting his money to their face . the story is basically & # 34 ; ugghhh & # 34 ; . I rather think the alexis and daryl have a better love story than dione and nikias . it repetitive , the dione is smart , etc etc . For a 10 chapter novel almost 4 of the chapter is about sex . so disappointing . Minus the sex . The story would have been good .	-1
This was the choice for our book club this month and I thought it sounded like something I would have liked . I was wrong . The book has great potential but it 's missing everything that is important to me in a book . I do n't want to sound harsh because maybe this was a first attempt at writing ; but if I read the word & # 34 ; such & # 34 ; again I may scream ! & # 34 ; Such & # 34 ; was used at least one time in nine out of every ten pages.Secondly , what the hell is wrong with Diona ? This guy has held you hostage on an island ! Sure it 's paradise but he still held her there against your will . And for what ? To prevent his brother from marrying this girl ? ? ? But it seems the only thing that mattered to her is the tingles she gets between her legs at his appearance ! She even goes as far as to give him her V card ? ! ? ! ? ! ? A man she knows NOTHING about , who believes she is someone she is n't , and who has KIDNAPPED her ? ? ? What the hell ? Nikias is described as a smart , intuitive , sharp business man . However , he does n't even know his brother 's fianc & eacute ; 's name prior to kidnapping her ? He investigates her location however , does n't know anything about the woman he is trying to keep from his brother ? Completely unrealistic.I never felt the chemistry between Diona and Nkias . I was bored throughout the entire book and disappointed	-1
The author desperately needs to learn to write in first person present tense ... or any other present tense . All the `` she had woken the next mornings '' and `` she groaned as she had remembered '' were almost unbearable to read by the time I got to the fourth chapter so I had to take a third break from reading the book . There were even a lot of sentences with multiple hads/haves . Also , this plot is an update to a harlequin romance from the 70s , so really is n't original ( not saying the author ever read it , but the 2 Greek Shipping company guys with the 2 British sisters and the mistaken identity while the real couple are free to runoff and elope is a book I read way back when people actually were rich from owning cruise lines . Which brings me to the implausibility factor . I read these books for fun , fantasy , escape , so I do n't have too much issue with the fact the plot really was extremely unlikely , but coupled with the writing , it just made the flaws more obvious.I got this book for free but would not recommend anyone actually pay for it . ***I read some of the other reviews which suggested the book was edited a few months ago ... .I only got it in Sept. and it was definitely not edited .	-1
Again I have to write a less than stellar review and unfortunately , again , many of the issues would have been addressed and rectified in the EDITTING process . That said , here goes : - A period is required at the end of a sentence , even if the end of that sentence is dialogue and encased in quotation marks.- Very repetitive . He does , she does n't . She does , he does n't . What was probably supposed to be drama , when repeated over and over and over is not . The inability of the main characters to believe anything but the worst of each other leads the reader to conclude they are morons rather than successful adults.- Phrases joined together all over the place with commas and conjunctions when they should have been separate sentences.It 's pretty basic : you can have the best story idea in the world , and you may even be able to write it , but if you do n't get an EDITOR to tighten it up and correct the errors you ca n't or do n't see , it ends up reading like a teenager of average intelligence wrote it for an English class.This review sounds snarkier than I intended , but I 'm getting really tired of reading uneditted books ( I think most of you have figured that out by now ) .	-1
I will admit I did n't finish it . i did n't need my braincells leaking out my ears on the sheer stupidity of it all , not even plausible not even fantasy plausible not even sci-fi possible . its just ... there . in your face and dumber then a box of rocks . I tried , it was a free book thank god I 'd hate to think someone actually paid for that drivel .	-1
What was with all the hads..I was concentrating so hard on omitting and reforming sentences so it made sense it distracted from the book ... but that was ok because I wanted to gag at the foolishness that was the female lead ..read if u want to but its trying .	-1
The idea for the story was cute however the characters themselves were weak at best and the writing style was downright terrible , I almost hesitated to give it even two stars.Nikias , the hero is described as being a protective , interesting and good guy who is just arrogant and a bit of a hothead . The problem is the only time he speaks in the book he comes across as a manipulative , controlling jerk . The scenes where she supposedly sees the fun sweet side of him she falls in love with are only briefly described in a general way . Diona , the heroine is also described as beautiful , intelligent and strong however again most of her scenes display her as weak willed and pathetically willing to take the crap the hero is dishing out . Because of this I had a very hard time believing this whirlwind love that was supposed to have taken place between them . Lots of sex yes , love ... I never really saw it . Even the one scene that had the potential for it , when she saves the girl , is ruined by him acting like a horny teenage boy.However I could have given the book a little more credit if it had n't been for the horrible grammar and writing style . Constantly changing tenses mid sentence , writing it mostly from a perspective as if the story is recalling a past event but telling it as if its happening in real time . Also I do n't know how many times the writer used the word `` had '' but I found myself mentally blocking it out as I read to tolerate the story . It was used once if not multiple times in pretty much every single sentence and often its use did n't make sense ... drove me crazy !	-1
The premise and basic plot for this book is not incredibly unique or creative . Billionaire older brother kidnaps the wrong sister when he tries to save his playboy younger brother from making a big `` mistake . '' If you 've ever read any Harlequin books , this premise will be very familiar . However , whereas Harlequin books are edited and the plot generally follows in a concise manner , this book was unedited and all over the place in terms of character development , plot development , and writing style.I wo n't reiterate what many of the other posters stated regarding the incorrect and ubiquitous use of the word `` had . '' It starts in Chapter One and continues until the end . Having been forewarned , I did n't try to make sense of it when I first came across it . Because , when you first see the incorrect use of `` had '' you wonder if the character is having a flashback or something . Then you realize , no , we are not going back in time ; the author just did n't take any writing classes . I ended up not even reading the `` had '' and automatically changing the sentence structure in my mind as I read it.So why is this a Harlequin book gone bad ? Because so much of the plot and characters just reeks of the typical Harlequin plot , but without the Harlequin delivery . So much so , that it makes me wonder if this author was an avid Harlequin reader who one day decided to try her own hand at writing . And I say this because I 've read so many books that I 've thought maybe I can write one too . Only to realize that there is big difference between editing/critiquing/reviewing , and actually authoring a book . As the other posters stated , an editor would have done this book a great deal of service . Aside from the `` had '' issue , a good editor could have pointed out that the plot does not flow naturally , that the characters are just not developed enough ( either make them very basic cookie cutter characters , or really flush them out ) , and just the general movement of the plot is entirely unbelieveable.Example : After kidnapping Diona , Nikias spends time with her going snorkeling and showing her around his island , etc. , etc . Now , if he was really the ruthless b** # $ % & d ; that the author tries to convey him as , then he would have completely ignored her while he continued with his own playboy ways . I also find it unbelieveable that this brilliant self-made shipping tycoon did n't do the basic investigation necessary to know that Daryle had an older sister who was a nurse . If you 're going to spy on little brother , then do it properly.I 'm glad the book was free , otherwise I would have felt ripped off . In fact , I still feel that the author should be paying the reviewers for the free editing critiques that we offer .	-1
If you into modern day romance it 's a good book to read . If not give it a skip . Just another book	-1
I did n't connect to the characters in this book . It seemed like every other sentence pulled me out of the story . Quite a few run-on sentences as well .	-1
I did n't expect to write a review of this book . I read a lot of books , way too many to do reviews for all of them , so I generally only write reviews if they were exceptionally good or really bad . I do n't want to take the time to review an average book . And this one should have been average . It reminded me of an 80 's Harlequin , with Yanis , rich and powerful , dominating Lee throughout most of the book . I was ok with that because I was in the mood for a `` mean '' hero and I thought the storyline flowed pretty well . I noticed in reviews of her other books that people complained about grammatical errors . There were plenty of those , but if the story is good enough I do n't mind overlooking them.What I could n't overlook was the overuse of the word `` had '' . By the middle of the book it was to the point that I could n't even concentrate on the story because `` had '' kept jumping out at me . Sometimes several in one sentence . Out of curiosity I counted them once and there were 16 just on one page . So I basically just skimmed the last half of the book because it was too painful plowing through the `` hads '' . But the story itself was good enough that I wanted to see how it ended.If not for all of the `` hads '' throughout the book I would have given it 3 stars . It 's a nice average story . I got Kidnapped the Wrong Sister by this author because it was free and I 'm sure I 'll read it , but I noticed one of the reviews for that book also mentioned that had was overused , so it 's obviously a trend . That 's too bad because her books have a lot of potential . I do n't think I will pay for any more of her books though .	-1
# MAJOR SPOILERS IN REVIEW # I picked up the second book on the advise of another reviewer . I did not realize it was part of a series , so I bought `` A Red-Tainted Silence '' to make sure I had background on all the characters from the second book , `` Long Way Home . '' Now I am dreading reading book two because I really did not enjoy this book.While the writing was solid and Ms. Gray shows promise as a romance writer the plot completely failed in its execution for me . Why ? Completely unrealistic and melodramatic . I felt as if I was watching a Spanish telenova as at the end of every chapter there was a major reveal or cliffhanger which got more and more unbelievable as the long novel progressed . By the time I got to the dead deer in the protagonists ' bed , this was very nearly a do not finish for me . But I held out , hoping that the book would improve -- it didn't.The characterizations of Brandon and Nick were fine , in fact , I loved that they fell in love at first sight and endured so much together , but the plot ultimately dragged the love story down . I knew who the bad guy was 15 pages in , so that big reveal at the end was not a surprise . The bad guy 's motivations made no sense to me and so I was lost there.Also , for people with triggers , this is not the book for you . There are multiple rapes in it . MULTIPLE . Nick is n't abused once , but many times by many people , as is the other main character , Brandon . The rapes were the main focus of the plot and I hate it when sexual assault is used as a plot device . That did not work for me and was another unrealistic part of the book.I thought I was getting a book about two rock stars in the closet and their relationship woes . What I got was a stalker-rapist-thriller that did not work on any level . First the police procedure was not researched . When one of the main characters is kidnapped the FBI are not involved , just local police . Second , when crazy stalker sets off a bomb , the ATF are not called in to investigate . And lastly when does protective custody mean Rolling Stone reporters can come in interview and take pictures of where the persons in protective custody are hiding ? Would n't that make it easy for the bad guys to find you ? Hello.I just needed a little realism for this , just a little . What could have been a great love story between two bandmates turned into a angst-fest of rape , violence and a convoluted plot that had so many unbelievable twists and turns I gave up 35 % of the way in . Not recommended . ( I hope book two is better and has less drama , stalkers and rapes because hot rock stars in love is a favorite plot of mine . )	-1
This one was better than First Contact . It concentrated more on story than on just fighting . I have a gripe about Tesh-Dar . In this prequel series , we keep getting `` told '' how mighty Tesh-Dar is . I got tired of the repetition quickly . Fine , the author wants to change his mythos in these prequels . I guess that is his prerogative , but it just feels wrong if the reader still remembers the other three books . It undoes the logic and therefore the suspension of disbelief . Tesh-Dar can walk through walls , send herself through space , but ca n't get out from under a cave-in ? ? ? ? Even taking into account that she was 100 years older , in the first three books , it just does n't feel like it makes sense anymore . I 'm going to finish this series ( I bought them ) , but I really feel like this is not a prequel series worthy of the first three books . I really wish that this prequel series had just been about Tesh-Dar 's life . What brought her to the point of not killing Reza when she first found him ?	-1
This book had a good story line going but to short in my opinion the author could have done a lot more .	-1
While agreeing with Avid Reader that this is a Vegan polemic posing as science fiction , I would disagree about his calling it `` liberal '' . Very few liberals are Vegan , and in my experience very few Vegans have much in the way of politics , liberal or conservative , beyond `` eat Vegan '' . I 'll be willing to agree with Avid Reader if he or she can name for me one liberal presidential candidate who did n't eat barbecue in Texas or brats in Wisconsin ... Two stars for the attempt , but do n't waste your time on this.Now , if someone would write a book about a Vegan-turned-zombie and what she does when the only thing she an stomach are brains ... That might be worth reading . `` Vegan gets Brains '' , by ...	-1
I wasnt overly impressed with the story , the plot , the characters , basically all of it . I definitely would not suggest this book to anyone .	-1
This book really skipped around . No high and low points and no big drama in the story . I have never been so incredibly bored	-1
Storyline but the spelling and grammar confused me at times . The story would be describing a she but the writing was all about he .	-1
Story line was n't bad but the writing was choppy , the f word seemed to be thrown in randomly for shock value . Personally I am not a fan of nasty language in books . This was more of a erotica story than a romance and was not really worth my time .	-1
Possibly the worst book I have ever read . The beginning is positively excrable . I can see that this book was started when the author was very young . The sex scences would be laughable if they did not make me squirm so much . I have no problem with erotica , rather enjoy it on occassion , but her scenes are jarring . One minute they are caressing and kissing , next his c @ ck is pounding her ... well , you get the idea . Do not make the same mistake I did , you will just loathe yourself afterwards .	-1
I do n't particularly enjoy writing bad reviews . I do appreciate the difficulty in being a writer and being successful at it . That being said : I usually read the lowest rated reviews for a book before I purchase it . I do that because a lot of the time the reasons some readers dislike a book would not bother me in the least . Well , I should have listened to the bad reviews for this book . They are all very accurate . I have NEVER ... .NEVER EVER read a book where the grammatical errors took anything away from my enjoyment of the book as long as it 's a good story . Until this one . There are so many errors that it distracted me to the point where I was actually confused completely . Like another reviewer stated , there are incorrect words , words completely left out , apostrophes where there is no need for them , etc . What really got to me were the `` missing '' words and the `` incorrect '' words . Those mistakes literally made those sentences useless other than to confuse me ! ! Okay , the story . So , so boring . Nothing happens . Seriously , ... .nothing . Childhood sweethearts separate for the good of the boy 's career . They meet up 11 years later . Well , that 's nice . But there is nothing in this book to make it interesting ! No jealous exes , no dramatic occurrences while they were separated , no obstacles in the present . I mean NOTHING . The hero , ( I use that term loosely ) was n't overly jealous , or possessive ( which I LOVE ) . The leading lady was n't suffering or in need of help or in need of a `` hero '' , she was doing just fine in life . Like I said , NO SUBSTANCE here at all . To top it all off , the very last sentence of this book was horrible . Many may think I 'm crazy for thinking that , but without ruining anything for anyone , the last sentence made me think , `` WTF does THAT mean ? `` This is n't the worst book I 've ever read , but even 99 cents is TOO much for this book.LOL I read another reviewer state that the author uses too much vulgar language , ... WHERE ? ? ? ? ? ? The `` F '' bomb was dropped a few times , so what ? ? I also read that this was labeled `` erotica '' ? ? ? ? SERIOUSLY ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? No . Absolutely not erotica in any way , shape or form . That label for this book is hysterical.So , there is MY opinion . Do with it what you will . But if you like dramatic , sexy , romantic , exciting stories this book will NOT do it for ya.Some of MY favorite books are : The Blood Bound series~~by Amy BlankenshipThe Black Dagger Brotherhood series~~by JR WardThe Night Huntress series~~by Jeaniene FrostBeautiful Disaster~~by Jamie McGuireReal~~by Katie EvansBeautifully Damaged~~by L.A Fiore	-1
Ellen - You 're now 2 for 2 on 2 Star reviews . Girlfriend , you need to double check your editor 's work and keep an eye out on your reviews . I would think the error described below would be an ( avoidable ) embarrassment to an author.A previous reviewer , Catherine Winterfox ( Portland , OR USA ) , sums up perfectly the 'Ooops ! ' moment near the end of the story ... '' Drew , our heroine , is heading out to the car after the hero 's mother 's wedding . She has to get her purse for her tampons , because her period has arrived `` with a vengeance '' . Okay , fine , is the author going to use this ? Maybe . Drew is kidnapped , stripped , and tied to a bed . When the hero finds her , he 's afraid something horrible ( well , more horrible ) has happened , because she 's bleeding . But no , he 's referring to her arms , which are bleeding because she freed herself from the ropes binding her . Okay , not using the bleeding thing . Then , that night , they make mad , passionate love . This is a very straight couple -- he 'd never even had a girl on top , she could n't identify a vibrator . They are not going to be doing anything with her bleeding . Also , she uses tampons , so there 's a logistical problem . At this point , I paged back a bit just to make sure more time had n't passed and I skimmed it . Nope , same night.It 's a case of something very minor -- the author using a tampon excuse to get the heroine alone to be kidnapped -- turning into a major case of oops . An editor should have spotted it . I sure wish I had n't . `` And I totally agree ... the mistake took away from the story . I hope someone contacts you about this and the mistake/error is correctable .	-1
I never thought I would give anything written by Laurann Dohner a bad review . She is one of my favorite romance writers , and I love her New Species series . The first Zorn Warriors book was pretty good , and more in keeping with her usual tone . This second installment failed on so many levels for me . I could n't develop any liking for the hero , mostly because throughout the book he continually took away the heroine 's choices . While he repeatedly tells the heroine that she 's his world and he 'd do anything to keep her , he never once considers what SHE wants or how she feels about being kidnapped and forced into a lifestyle she did n't choose for herself.What 's more , there 's no & # 34 ; a-ha & # 34 ; moment when he realizes HIS happiness is not necessarily the key to HER being happy too . I kept waiting for him to redeem himself but it just never happened.And the heroine seemed weak to me because even though she did n't shy away from physical confrontation , she never really tells him & # 34 ; NO. & # 34 ; That subtext of & # 34 ; her lips say no but her eyes say yes & # 34 ; played here ad nauseum . Her protests were pretty weak and insincere , which makes her either totally spineless or the kind of woman who says one thing , means another and expects the guy to know what she wants without her really saying so.Do n't get me wrong , I 'll never give up reading Laurann . This book , however , will definitely be on my & # 34 ; do n't need to read THAT again & # 34 ; list .	-1
I ` ve read one of the other books in this series and liked it . I like Alpha males as long as the women are strong too . And as long as there ` s no rape . Being Alpha does not mean you have to rape women even if you ` re stronger than them and want them.Unfortunately this had a heroine who was supposed to be strong but wasn ` t at all . And there was rape . These are the two main things I have against this book.Casey was captured from Earth when she was trying to run away from an ex who wanted to rape her . Only to end up with a Zorn who not only kidnaps her but also treats her very poorly . He rapes her ( and yes , it ` s rape if someone says no even if she ` s forced to orgasm ) and is forgiven for that . I find it very disturbing that a woman who escapes rape ends up being raped - and that is portrayed as a good thing.There are probably some readers who can accept rape-turns-into-love , but for those of you who are like me - this is not a book for you !	-1
The book is accurate of what Navy life was like . The author was just to much into himself . Would have been much better if he would have just told the story with out patting himself on the back so much . Sorry .	-1
This one started off alright - though the `` Good vs . Evil with a side of prophesied Chosen One '' has been done to death.But after a while , it just got tiring . All of the characters , particularly the `` Good '' ones , are just inept . If it were just the underage heroine , that might be OK , for a while at least , though I simple hate a weak female lead character . The `` Evil '' characters at least have some spine , though are similarly one dimensional . In the beginning of the book anyway ( I could n't finish the thing ) , virtually all of the authority figures could be described with the phrase `` officious prig . `` And of course the author feels the need to lay the `` Evil has the upper hand and the poor little Chosen One must forever suffer '' plot device on thick . This is one of the the most overdone bits in fantasy writing and it just gets so old .	-1
This book has the potential of a great read . However the torture and indecision that the characters ' have makes me want to pull my hair out . The story could have been half as long without `` I ca n't '' stuff . I wont be reading the second book .	-1
The only reason I 'd recommend this story to anyone is because it 's free and so short you really do n't have to commit that much time to it.There was nothing original here , which is n't always a bad thing if the story is well done . I found this one very rushed . I never connected with Sara ( killing vampires to avenge her brother and friend 's murders ) or Wyatt ( the sexy vampire originally sent to watch her after her brother died & now to stop her vampire killing ) . It was unclear who Wyatt is or what his `` choice '' is - to stop or kill Sara ? to date her or leave her ? The `` bad guy '' was also pretty random & unconnected to the overarching story.I 've never read anything by this author , and if she has full length novels , I hope they are better edited than this . Spelling errors , typos & grammatical errors are a pet peeve , therefore , I rarely comment on them in a review unless it 's really bad . There were so many mistakes littered in such a short story that it became distracting .	-1
It took me several tries to actually get into this book , but once I got started I liked the characters and was at least starting to develop an interest in them and their relationships . However , the book leaves you hanging as none of the story lines are resolved . For this reason I gave it only two stars . It seems less than fair to me to write a book with several different plot lines and not tie up any of the loose ends.Unfortunately , I do n't really care enough about the characters to run right out and purchase the next installment either . After all , who knows haw many installments I 'll have to buy to get to the end of the story . Or will this be like a soap opera , and just go on and on and on ? I read this book on my Kindle and did not notice any glaring editing or formatting errors .	-1
I have to admit right off the bat that I deleted this book from my Kindle at 3 % . In that short snippet of reading all I found out was that there were two sisters involved in the story , one of them was dumb enough to think the only way she could support herself was to either win the lottery or collect some reward money for solving a crime , one sister had big boobs that were supposed to help in this crime solving endeavor , and the other sister could get one of her legs up behind her head.That was all I needed to read to know that most likely this book would be full of idiotic back and forth banter . No thanks , I 'll pass .	-1
This book read as if it was written by a high school girl terrified that `` Mom is watching '' . I was several chapters in when it was mentioned that the main character came from a large family ... previously you were under the impression there were only the two girls in the family . Also the reviews that state `` Cara decides to quit her job '' should read `` HAVING quit her job ... . '' as she is unemployed when the book begins . I gave it one star simply because it was only $ 0.99 . However I should have waited until it was offered on Kindle for free ... ..	-1
Too many lazy shortcuts in this book . It seems like the author did n't want to have to think about the characters -- so she picked out a bunch of stereotypes . Item one : two nasty sisters squabbling with each other constantly about who 's hotter . Item two : every member of the large family agreeably leaping into their assigned role , which is even listed in case we 're too stupid to figure it out . Item Three : the Irish mom who reads the minds of her 30-year-old daughters and everyone else . And of course Item Four : `` mysteries '' cropping up that do n't get resolved , probably to sucker you into buying the next installment ( btw : no chance ! ) . If you can get past all that , you arrive at the heart of this book , which is . . . well , I 'm not sure there is a heart.Ugh . I am a fan of light-hearted escapist fiction , but this was more light-headed . As in brainless .	-1
I started to read this and was exctied because its hard to find a series that keeps going . I was so disappointed . The story was so confusing . So much going on that most of the time I was lost .	-1
I like a good Templar story as well as the next person , but this one is n't one of them . The story is uneven , characters with no particular reason to like or care for them , and just an odd collection of 'steps as story ' . Surprise at the end , is , well , not much of a surprise and I did n't really care by that time.Sorry , but a miss .	-1
Just not my style , although the plot did catch & keep my attention . My vision of life and Hell is not that of Dante . I almost changed my mind , and almost began to enjoy the philosophy contained in the story from when Dante in the Inferno was introduced , through to the story 's end , but this story was just too dark and depressing for my taste .	-1
***SPOILERS***The h is the fat girl of her class and is still bitter about never being asked out by the H. She returns to town thinner and ready to rub it in the H face . That lasted about a chapter , maybe 2 . I have really enjoyed the this author 's previous work and was looking forward to a what I thought would be a story about a reluctant h and a remorseful H that had to woo the h back in love with him . Since this never happened , I am not sure why the book had this title . Other than the H carrying a box for the h and giving her a kitten , there really was no wooing at all . They have sex and then he reacts like a total jerk after they are done but instead of apologizing he gives her a lame line of `` what I did was unforgivable so I am not going to ask you to forgive me . '' This was after he has locked her in a jail cell for her to listen to him ( his the sheriff ) . I guess even after what she did I thought that how he acted he needed to get on his knees to beg for forgiveness and really showing remorse instead of acting high handed but he continually doubts and compares the h to the actions of his ex-wife . When the h intervenes between his daughter and him , the H immediate response is `` you told her , '' referring to a secret that the H had shared with the h regarding the daughter . She let 's that go and then later in the book he also questions her honesty regarding a major event which to me was just the last straw . He is just one of those characters that because he had been burned once before and therefore will forever continue to think the worse of all women , the h included . He never once believed the best of the h nor did he really have to ever work for the h love . Instead the H continually took her for granted . The h is just disappointing because throughout the book she stand up to the H just long enough to give lip service just before she lays down to be his doormat . The end was just so unbelievably annoying that I did n't even read the last two pages . Yes , I had two pages to go and I just could not do it . H shows up after continually treating the h like crap and hurting her and in one paragraph all is fine and well , until the next time that life does n't go his way and then somehow that will be the h fault again and I 'm sure she will agree with that as well . The only time he steps up is when someone else wanted her or if it was easy and convenient to him , this to me this a romance does not make . This book was just a huge disappointment especially from such a talented author .	-1
~ 2 Zorn Stars ~Ral & # 8217 ; s Woman is the first book in the sci-fi romance & # 34 ; Zorn Warriors & # 34 ; series . Well I & # 8217 ; ve not read much sci-fi alien romance love stores , so I don & # 8217 ; t have much to compare this too , though I have read other Laurann Dohner works and I must say Ral & # 8217 ; s Woman was poorly done.Ral is a Zorn alien . Him and his people have been cavorted and in slaved by the lizard aliens to mine the astroid/ship . When he meets Ariel he is really curious about her and is eager to learn the ways of pleasing a woman of her species . He & # 8217 ; s very partitive of Ariel : & # 8220 ; She is mine . Don & # 8217 ; t touch her . You touch her . You Die. & # 8221 ; Ariel well first I thought of the little mermaid and had a good laugh , but moving on . Ariel is human and she has been kidnapped from Earth by lizard type aliens who want to breed her . As it turned out she is not compatible to breed with the lizard guys , so instead they give her to the Zorn who they have in slaved to mine their astroid/ship . The Zorn must fight and the winner gets her . Ral wins and takes her to his room caveman style where they have hot sex . Then he starts saying that she is his . & # 8220 ; I think you don not understand . You are mine for life . I claim you . I won you . I will keep you . We will breed often and I am hoping you will take my seed to root. & # 8221 ; It & # 8217 ; s a very simple read , short , not very well done , and predictable . Not much world creation , but maybe in the other books it comes out . The description of sex scenes was poor , character development is nell , and I never felt a connection between Ariel and Ral . Maybe it was supposed to happen when they locked eyes at first meeting , but I felt nothing and as the book progressed I still did not feel that love connection even when they mentioned love .	-1
This story moved really , really fast ; to the point it made me cry & # 34 ; stockholm syndrome & # 34 ; . I generally like this author 's stories but , was very disappointed in this one ! If you can get past the fact that the poor heroine is kidnapped , then used as a reward only to be immediately used sexually and then spouts out the phrase & # 34 ; I love you & # 34 ; to the hero in almost the same chapter then you 'll enjoy this read ; if you 're like me and this is a hard pill for you to swallow , then I would err on the side of caution and skip this one . I did n't find anything I liked about either of the main characters and can only have two positive points about the story and that is that the action scenes and sex scenes were well written .	-1
2.5 out of 5 stars , follow two people who already have a powerful attraction burning between them take on a company who are doing illegal experiments . I liked the relationship between Micah and Rebecca it was hot and sweet . Yet , this novel has a great beginning , an okay middle , but it was the last few chapters at the end that ruined it for me . =0 ( The part that ruined it for me was the way Rebecca handled things between Micah and her once he got out of the lab . In addition , I wished I knew what happened when Micah went back to the lab on his own since it was n't mentioned at all in the novel so it felt like the story was n't finished.I recommend it only to those who are fans of Ms. Austin.Review By : From Me to You ... Book Reviews ( read more of this review and a teaser on my blog )	-1
While I do n't usually expect much from these very inexpensive , formulaic books this one was particuarly stupid.None of the main players made much sense . The story was dumber than most and made little sense and was internally inconsistent.There were tons of misspellings and odd phrasings . A tiny bit of editing would be nice.This book would be overpriced even if it was free .	-1
Somehow this terrible story manages to be both predictable and to leave you wondering how the plot even came together.I got it for free and I felt like I 'd been robbed of my time . I ca n't imagine how annoyed I 'd be if I 'd paid for this thing .	-1
I ca n't say as much as I 'd like to without giving the entire story away . I did n't find the story to be `` cute '' in any way and there were no life lessons to be learned by the children . The entire story was very contrived . The author was trying to make things cute by having the children name the caterpillars things like `` Wormy '' . The end of the story was not a twist , it was a tragedy . I do have to admit I did chuckle a bit at the end but I was actually more relieved than anything that the story was over .	-1
I read books to make me happy , laugh and generally make my day - I do n't like books that make me sad	-1
I have read the author 's other books and liked them . This seems like a first draft where she is trying out what will ultimately become a winning formula . It just did not work.The main female characture is awful , whinny , teary and without any really likeable qualities . Can not fathom why the main male lead would have wanted her from afar particuarly after he got close up to her . The story would have you believe that they spent very little time together over a period of years and yet he wanted her . Odd . What does that make him ? I would not bother with this book Instead , skip to the much better version of this same story `` Her Cinderella Complex '' .This writer is a fun diversion from my regular reading . Her books are fast , light hearted and easy to read . Usually . This one , not so much.Writer has real potential . I am looking forward to a deeper , more complex book with the same light touch .	-1
Tabitha was married to Craig with whom she shares 2 kids with but he was addicted to the Internet chatting he never physically cheated on her but he was emotionally . She ended things but continued to sleep with him while dating other men AND sleeping with them as well . Craig keeps trying to get back with Tabitha she refuses him . Craig meets Grace starts dating her , Tabitha gets mad , he falls in love with a Grace , Tabitha keeps sleeping with him . He wants to finalize the divorce to marry Grace , Tabithat gets superly angry all the while meeting new guys to date and sleeping with them . Tabitha realizes that Craig 's lies and deceit is n't as bad all the losers she 's been dating so she wants to give it another try because she realizes she really does love him . Craig sleeps with her but after they have sex he thinks she 's asleep and receives a text from his Fianc & eacute ; of naked pictures saying she misses him . He responds to the text WHILE laying in the bed with Tabitha saying `` I miss you too and ca n't for you to be Mrs. smith '' she cries herself to sleep and blah blah blah ! Tabitha was a mother of two who did n't know herself or what she wanted . She kept dating LOSER guys and screwing them all ! There was n't ONE guy she went on a date with and did n't screw ! She was childish and immature acting and she made me sick . This book was so not worth the money heck it is n't even worth buying in my opinion . Maybe this book is n't for ppl in my age group Tabithat was 28 but she asked like an 16 yr old child . So this book to me read as that of an 16 yr old high school student who was just lost and needed to find herself . The book even ended horribly to me she did n't learn anything she was still single and still hating on the fact that Grace has taken her place in Craig 's family and she wasnt that special anymore . Tabitha went through all this hell in her dating life to make it to the end of the book and she still had no growth .	-1
This book left me so disappointed , I do n't even know where to begin with my review . First of all I would have given it a 1 star , but I did n't because some parts of the book was very interesting and I could actually vision it . I even laughed at a few parts because of how real the situation was . Now , to begin on my disappointments with this book . For one , I did n't like how each scene ended so abruptly . Soon as a scene started to get good , it cut right off and went straight to the next scene . Then on top of that , when it did , it was either days , a week , weeks , or months later . We did n't get full details about what happened with certain situations , and we did n't get enough details on the characters . Next , there was n't much drama in the book . We were introduced to atleast 2 ghetto chicks , one whom clearly had no problem fighting . The first was dec 's cousin ( forgot his name ) , who was very very ghetto . She was at the mall with the so called gangsta , when some ghetto chick whom he had some type of past with . I mean she stepped to tabitha straight away once she saw her with dude , and not once did a fight break out . In real life a fight would have broke out for sure , smh sad but true . There were a few typos and grammatical errors , which was n't much of a big deal since there were n't many.What put the icing on the cake , tabitha was just so freaking stupid . Yea most of the dudes she dated was n't worth her time , and were so lame . But there were atleast 2 of them which she had no reason at all to complain about . Her husband craig is EVERYTHING any female in her right mind would want . Good father , good sex , good to her , good looks , etc . And this dumb b***h let him go over internet flirting . Are you serious ? some ppl would consider that cheating to , but I 'd rather have my man online just flirting , and not actually out there cheating and screwing the women like most cheaters out here . Her simple a** talking about `` he lied about his online flirting '' . B***h should be lucky that 's all he was doing , like wtf . This s*** got me so freaking heated on how ugrateful this chick is . Then had the nerve to get mad at him for moving on , when SHE is the one to drop him . Sounds to me she wanted things exactly her way , and at the same time have her cake and eat it to . She put all the blame on the dudes , when she got upset over dumb s*** . Then the mysterious `` confused '' guy she met online , that was going through the SAME EXACT S*** AS HER . I mean they were each others double basically , and she even admitted to being able to tell him stuff she could n't talk to her own male best friend about ; And not once did she consider he could be the one . Her male bestfriend was just as dumb as her and clearly bipolar or had split personality ; because one minute he was telling her to have options and do the dating thing . Next minute , he was telling her she needed to try and settle down . He was the one that set her up with his ghetto a** cousin , and saying he was all talk and blah blah blah . Whole time he was 100 % wrong , and was shocked at the last minute when he went stalker on her . It 's very clear dudes do n't know other dudes all to well , and can give a female wrong advice on their own species . The ending had me like `` WTF ... it 's ending just like that ? '' . Huge disappointment . She let 2 guys in this book who was everything she actually wanted , but let them go cause she was obviously bipolar , NOT CONFUSED . Yo If I knew this chick tabitha in real life , I would dig in her s*** so bad , and make her feel like the dumbest person on earth . NO WONDER SHE IS STILL SINGLE , because she do n't know a good man when she see 's one , and got a huge nerve to blame the s*** on them . She is a dumb a** b***h !	-1
Zombie Nights felt more like a writing exercise then an actual completed story . The idea was so interesting and I found the character development intriguing and then ... it unraveled , and it tangled , and it tripped and then it was done . Like an old school zombie , it kept dragging it 's self along- long after its legs were cut out from underneath him .	-1
This book was unreal . The story concept was okay but could have been improved . The character often said stuff people do n't say in a normal conversation . Really when the boyfriend and the brother first meet , that whole exchange was not believable . The sex was like reading the script of bad porn . Who stops periodically while giving oral to make comparisons of the female genital . Let 's not forget about the constant mentioning of their race . O. M. G. Lastly , jumbo shrimp is an oxymoron not hot sex .	-1
This book is terrible . Very predictable , poor story line , just not interesting at all . I love dragons and medeival stories , so I thought I 'd love it , but I was wrong . I would not recommend this to anyone .	-1
blake crouch does it again . beware of quaint little mountain towns.this book reads like a scary movie . i can just about hear the weird music .	-1
I 've read quite a few of these types of menage books and was not pleased with this one at all . I felt no connection to the characters and did n't really understand/believe the attraction between them . If I could , I would go back and not download this book at all . I actually had to re-read Something New , Coming Full Circle and Destiny Calls to remember why I liked this genre in the first place .	-1
Described as `` a collection of short stories told from a different character 's involvement and point of view , '' this is actually a linnear novella in which the POV changes from chapter to chapter . None of it was particularly great . Just a very surface description of some bloody conflict between the seelie and unseelie courts during a fancy ball , with almost no background , engaging characterizations , or engaging dialogue.I acquired this some months ago , and in the meantime Farrell has released a novel based on it , entitled Soul . I believe it was only after the publication of Soul that this shorter work began to be listed as a `` Prequel companion '' , and it 's not exactly that , as the events described in it mirror events that take place in Soul.In my opinion , having now read two novels and two `` short story collections '' ( one of which actually was a short story collection ! ) by Farrell , as well as the first chapter of Soul , perhaps Farrell should stick to novels . The longer format provides the obviously-needed room to develop interesting characters . One Night with the Fae lacks in this area , and pretty much reads like an author 's outline for a longer work .	-1
The print was so small on my Kindle , I was unable to read anything other than the chapter titles . If the print came larger , I would be able to give a review on the book .	-1
To say I am dissapointed in this short story would be a gross understatement ... it 's a baseless and boring storyline premise with a good beginning and pointless ending . No wonder the Kindle edition was free because in addition to the weak story more than half the book is dedicated to a biography of one of America 's true `` wingnut societal philosophers ! ''	-1
i think suspense means you should be wondering who did it ? i found no suspense and found the story just atypical of many others	-1
Essentially it has the same ending as in Ink Exchange.Besides , the dialogue was too sappy often . I prefer wittiness to mushiness .	-1
Up until this book I was enjoying this series . The characters I have come to like have started acting stupid . I barely got through this book . I hope the next one is a lot better !	-1
I will admit that Part 1 of this novella did keep me intrigued enough to want to read Part 2 . However , after reading Part 2 I feel like this story was a letdown.Part 2 was a lot of redundant dialogue without any definitive resolution . I 'm so glad I read both parts of Stopping Time when they were free !	-1
I was unable to stay interested in this book long enough to finish it . I just could n't get into the story .	-1
It passes a couple of hours when you do n't mind reading something just OK , but it does n't really draw one in.Very superficial characters .	-1
My Formerly Hot Life 's funny beginning lured me in on the first page , but by page 4 , my mind was swirling . By page 15 , I had a headache and kept losing my place . I found the writer 's style is impossibly circuitous , overly detailed.Maybe it 's her `` Type-Every-Single-Random-Thought-That-Comes-In-My-Head '' style . ( It 's too much ! ) Or maybe it 's that this book would have been better off left as a blog or a magazine article . Was she just trying to pad her stories with details to fill an entire book ? She has good points to make , but good luck follwing her long winded & meandering paragraphs to get to a gem . I find it especially interesting that Mrs. Dolgoff is an editor , one who would seemingly know better . Ironic.Sadly , I ca n't recommend this book because I did n't even want to finish it .	-1
The temporal vortex is an interesting idea but the story quickly becomes a farce of six or seven different groups running around an island killing each other .	-1
The plot of this story seemed promising , but it was n't executed well . The writing is stunted and dialogue very unrealistic . It may be a novella , but I was expecting some character development . There was none and I could n't connect with the very cliche characters .	-1
If I wanted a lesson on how to completely write a book series that will never be picked up by an agent or publishing house with any sense this is it ! Jessica is a once-wild-child shouldering the ever waffling level of guilt over her father 's ambitions and dedication to others . After his death she comes home and takes care of her two siblings ( apparently experiencing the level of confusion and frustration with picking kids up on time from school and paying bills that my brain damaged cousin would have IF she could drive ) . She now works in the ER at a local hospital.Ben is a the typical Ivy League movie-good-looking guy with a magical talent for people and medicine . His dad was a missionary who spent his life and energy only doing that ; generally acting like a piss poor father figure.I am roughly halfway through the book and there has been NO : discernible conflictstartling situation or event that will change either character 's life permanentlysexchange in how the characters interact with each otherToss in some diamond-in-the-rough street kids ( one called Mario who is evidently a candidate for MENSA but lives a `` fight club '' life ) , a lame set up for Ben 's grief ( a wiped out village in Africa he spent 6 years on a mission to ) and we have the weak tug of war in this book . She gets a bit huffy and leaves a bar about now . I was hoping for her to be hurt , aloof , make him work for it and hit a realization he would have to work through . Wrong ; he brings pizza to her wayward children at the center and she melts all over him . *disappointed sigh*All in all , I skim the pages to find dialogue or skip the page-long introspection that happens about every 3 pages.Crossing my fingers .	-1
If I want sex I know where to go , I wanted a story , sex with four brothers ? Not likely . Ugh	-1
I started reading this book and I just did not find it interesting at all and ended up deleating it on my kindle	-1
Deleted from my kindle after just the first chapter . This was the weirdest , creepiest romance I 've ever read . I can understand one man with multiple wives , but one wife to four brothers . UGH !	-1
Colters ' Wife ( Colter 's Legacy # 1.5 ) by Maya Banks is a sequel to Maya 's most popular book , Colters ' Woman where three brothers all share the same woman and end up `` marrying '' her . I have n't read Colters ' Woman since I 'm not a big fan of siblings involved in a polyamorous incestuous relationship regardless if the siblings are n't sexually attracted to one another . In Colters ' Wife , each Colter brother has one-on-one time with the pregnant heroine , Holly . There 's no threesomes or quartet loving going on here.Colters ' Wife goes as follows : Pregnant woman has sex with three brothers at different times , falls down a ditch , gives birth , The End . The sex was hot but there really was n't much of a plot.When Holly fell down the ditch , I was expecting some Lassie type dog to run and get help . Unfortunately , no lovable dog appeared , and because of this I had to lower the grade because nothing says happily ever after like a woman married to three brothers and a pet dog they can all love and cherish . But then the dog would n't be able to sleep in their bed because there 's no room with three brawny men and one small woman sleeping together.If you 're a fan of Maya 's Coulter series , you 'll enjoy this short . It 's both cheesy and equally disturbing having three brothers sharing one woman . Holly must be exhausted from all the Colter loving she gets . But then again Holly does n't have any complaints because the triple threat Coulter men are too perfect for words and have all the right moves.Katiebabs	-1
Why would this be in the romance category ? ? ? Its a smut book in my opinion , having more than one man is not romantic . Good thing it was a freebie or I would be completely irate , instead of being disgusted knowing this was a total waste of time .	-1
I hope I did n't pay for this I do n't remember . Ok foe a sub sequel . I will definitely not pay for more short stories .	-1
Can any woman imagine anything more horrifying than having to have three husbands at once ? I ca n't . And brothers , at that . Most women I know can barely handle having one husband ; no way would they want more ! This book had no real plot -- just the `` wife '' ( I just finished reading it and already forgot her name -- does that tell you anything ? ) is pregnant and wants to have sex with her THREE `` husbands '' . The men all got along and shared her ( HA ! How unrealistic could it be ? ) and were very tender with her . Yet , the language was coarse and out of place . They all deliver `` their '' baby . That 's it . That 's the whole story . What a waste of time to read ! I read a lot and all kinds of books , but this was not for me . There are too many actual good books out there to waste my time reading stuff like this . Even if you like this type of book , I ca n't imagine liking this because there 's nothing to it . It could have been condensed to one chapter . This is another author who is laughing all the way to the bank .	-1
Ok , so I should have taken the warnings seriously in other reviews . This book was abosolutly horrible . I do enjoy my romance novels that have sex involved , I 'm not an uptight priss that thinks sex is something only thought or spoken of behind closed doors . But really sleeping with 3 brothers and having who knows which ones baby is a little much . And in the mean time while she is close to delivery she is having sex with them all or atleast trying to . Then the way the Author makes all the men gush over her like she is a fallin angle is sickening . They fall over themselves to please her , its unreal . The book only took me about 40 minutes to read and sadly I will never have those 40 minutes of my life returned to me , maybe I can stay awake a little longer tonight to try and make up for it . I hope so . I absolutly DO NOT recommend this book to anyone at all . The only positive thing I can say is that they named the baby Seth and that 's my sons name .	-1
i was not expecting what this book had to offer . This book was just not for me . Was well written	-1
Only got through the first couple chapters , realizing the 'unrealness ' of this book . NOBODY acts like this ... at least in my world ! Animals ! Animal behavior . Actually quite disturbing . A book to throw in the trash ... but burn it first !	-1
The story was unusual . It ended abruptly and it was n't clear how the relationship between the `` heroine '' & the `` heroes '' developed .	-1
I did n't like this book , I have n't read any of the books in this series . I just do n't think this book is for me , however someone else may like it ... ..Maya Banks is a great author .	-1
Three guys and one girl ? What guy would share `` his '' woman with another guy ? The story line was weak and they were just not likeable at all . Do n't waste your time !	-1
I thought I was going to get more of a story than what I got . That was one of the shortest and incomplete books I have ever read . I know the the price is cheap but this book was one of the more disappointing ones from Blake Crouch .	-1
I ca n't tell you exactly why , but this was not my type of story at all . Interestingly enough , I usually love an alpha man and his more delicate counterpart .	-1
This was a DNF for me . I found the laguage stiff & unrealistic . I 'll wait for Cherise Sinclaire 's next offering . Based on this I 'm not a fan of Ms. Bradford .	-1
Okay , this was just funny . The faux-Shakespeare and general voice of the piece is giggle inducing , since I chose to have fun with it . Lesbian Montague/Capulet slash-fiction ? Hell yes , bring it ! I 'm not sure what the appropriate reaction should be , but something this silly should just exist in it 's own subgenre to be appreciated by people who just do n't care.No , I 'm not clicking on the dozen other stories linked after it .	-1
I wanted to like this , but the spark seemed to be missing.Setting aside whether or not something like this really could have led to the feud between the families , this fell short of the intended goal of an erotic story .	-1
I hated this book it had no storyline just sex . A worthless piece of garbage . I want the time I wasted back . Straight up trash . I want my money back NOW	-1
From the first word , book did not hold my interest , causing me to skip ahead . It only got worse . I got the book as free ebook..I guess you get what you pay for .	-1
I would like everyone to note the awesome pictures provided for this product . Then notice that the pictures are not with a Kindle product . So it works well with whatever that ereader is .	-1
My childhood and teenage years were something I have never gotten over . I was in counciling for years , but could never let it go . I am in my sixties and still remember things from when I was seven years old and older .	-1
If you read the book in the series prior to this , this entire book is a teaser at the end . No reason to bother reading it here . It was very good though !	-1
Only after reading OTHER reviews did I find the term `` erotica '' to describe this book , which is much kinder terminology than it deserves . It would be not only prudent but advisable for Amazon to indicate , somewhere in the title , this is not your typical romance book -- perhaps a `` XXX '' before or after the title . This type of material really needs to be in a category other than `` romance '' . Describing it as `` erotica '' is very much a misnomer considering how poorly developed the characters are , how non-existent the story line is and how desperately the writer needs to expand her vocabulary . I was n't looking for sexually explicit material and would have appreciated a clue of some kind . After downloading , I ended up in an area with no wi fi access so I proceeded to ( attempt ) to read the book . Compared to classic erotica , I would rate this at comic book level or less . Fortunately , I had some crossword puzzles with me . If I could return it , I would .	-1
NOTE : Most potential readers would probably assign a higher rating . But for me , certain little and not-so-little things snowballed to the point where cumulatively , it killed whatever good parts there were to the story.MEMORABLE QUOTE : `` To tell the truth of it my lord , are n't all men basically the same under their breeches no matter from whence they hail ? `` A closet fan of ( non-Regency ) historical romances and unfamiliar with Theresa Meyers , I had high hopes for `` The Spellbound Bride '' based on the blurb , the reviews and per the author , `` over two years of research '' . However , after struggling to the finish , I felt as if I had read a book different from some other reviewers . It bothered me on so many levels , I actually felt insulted.Apologies in advance if this review seems harsh but in order to justify the 1-star rating ( a very rare personal rating ) , I have to touch on areas that I generally avoid ( partly to suppress my personal preferences but mostly out of recognition of the hard work writers put into their stories ) . Another personal dislike but ... MINOR SPOILERS ahead . ( 1 ) CHARACTER/PLOT POINTS -- HUH ? I willingly suspend disbelief and critical thinking in order to enjoy fiction but sometimes , certain things are so jarringly wrong that they leap out and smack me in the face . Occur early enough in the the story and my continued reading is forever tainted . Four major `` smack '' moments ( without giving too much away ) : -- heroine 's belief in being `` cursed by some dark deadly poison that dwelt insider [ sic ] her '' ... despite numerous NOTES left behind after incidents ; -- heroine so skilled/knowledgeable , she brewed sleeping potions for her `` da '' ... at AGE 4 ; -- Archibald is the 14-year-old Earl of Argyll yet on a trip , only Ian and Sorcha travel with him ( around a storyline so implausible that I was rolling my eyes ) ; and -- apparent ( lack of ) passage of time in the second half of the book yet the heroine already had a `` slight swell '' ? ? ? ( 2 ) UM , WRITING STYLE ? I can generally look beyond most writing styles but I simply could n't understand the rationale behind splitting the speaker with the person 's dialogue into separate paragraphs ( ie , 1st sentence/paragraph is `` He frowned . '' Next sentence/paragraph is the person 's dialogue ) .Also , the one- or two-sentence narrative paragraphs became annoying . Maybe I 'm old-fashioned but I expect such short paragraphs to be limited to crucial thoughts , information or turning points ; too many and it becomes almost stream of consciousness , lacking cohesion and/or transitional writing skills . ( At first , I though the foregoing was due to formatting/download error but nope , appeared throughout in parts to the end . The wasted space ( resulting in many more pages to turn ) then made me think of `` Kindle abuse '' . ) Lastly , get a little too fancy with imagery and it can lead to output such as : '' ... an edge to his voice that was filled with both unsympathetic cold and hot anger ... '' ( I still ca n't figure this out ) and `` ... concern marring the dark trusting line of her brows ... '' ( what does a trusting browline look like ? ) As a reader , I do n't want to be distracted like this . This is not Nietzsche , for goodness sakes ! ( 3 ) HISTORICAL CONTEXT ? This is the least of my problems with this book . I do n't give a fig about historical accuracy so long as deviating from it serves some purpose ( case in point : love `` Braveheart '' despite its utter trashing of historical facts ) . However , given the author 's long research in contrast to the actual amount of historical background incorporated into the story , I could n't resist looking up the North Berwick witch trials after finishing this book.The story begins in 1593 but the actual witch trials occurred from 1590 to 1592 . Also , King James VI married Princess Anne in 1589 but the story refers to her as a `` new bride '' . I hate to say it but unless there was a typo in the prologue 's dateline , I read nothing in the story that warranted using the later date of 1593 . Such a tiny , simple thing but that alone rendered the historical aspects of the story incongruous.This final point is truly just me and my upbringing . I try to give as much leeway as I can when foreign phrases pop up in books . But sometimes ... FYI , the first known use of the term `` tte- & agrave ; -tte '' was in 1696 . Could it have been in use before that ? Absolutely . 100 years before ? Not likely . Its use in this story , let alone in *dialogue* ... well , you decide .	-1
So not worth the money ... it was much much too short , before you warm yourself up the book ended.I love the first book , at least that was over 300 pages long ( kindle ) .	-1
This book was overall just an eh for me . There were steamy sex scenes but I felt that the characters REALLY lacked development , we could have found out more about Maris childhood , for example . The story was also highly implausible , but other stories are too , again I think this is the lack of character development.Also , Devon seems a bit stalker like and that comes off creepy !	-1
A painfully and tediously predictable story , absolutely everything turns out exactly as you would expect it to.Devon , who is now a billionaire , fell in love with Mari , who was a foster child , at first sight in sixth grade . Years later , he turns up as prince charming to sweep her off her feet . Absolutely nothing is wrong with him , despite the fact that he has apparently held a torch for a girl he hardly interacted with since he was in eight grade ( creeper alert ) .True love is great , but this was just so difficult to buy . We 're swept into a world of his money fixing everything and their love overcoming everything without much work .	-1
The length of the story is part of the problem . Characters and plot did n't have time to fully develop . I did not like the premise that the two main characters were forced to marry because their brothers planned the wedding without telling the fated couple that they were the bride and groom .	-1
Perhaps this book was meant to be a trite sarcastic waste of time umm Yeah . If that was its goal , I guess I need to rethink my rating . But Umm actually the book got two stars as the trite sarcastic writing style did make me laugh . A list of 125 traveling tips not all regarding traveling with a vampire and many just plain simple . I am sorry this was the first taste I have had of this author , but VERY glad this was a freebie .	-1
I do n't know why on earth this book would come up under horror . It contains a silly list of things to do and not do when you travel with a vampire . It is written in what I would guess to be from a young girl 's point of view and the tone is grating . I hate to start a book and not finish it so I did . I did not enjoy this one at all . It is plain silly . I could see a young person liking it but that is about it . Maybe this form of writing just is n't my cup of tea but I found it irritating .	-1
Seemed to be a bad term paper to me , lots of reference books . Also interviews with subjects written poorly and confusing .	-1
2.5 stars.I have a somewhat two-minded opinion about Force of Law.On one hand , it was a nice , light and entertaining enough read . A fun parody -- even though trying too hard at times . Nothing heavy . Nothing that requires much attention/concentration . Nothing breath-taking and outstanding that will be remembered forever , but entertaining , nonetheless.On the other hand , it just was too much , at times -- even though the book is intentionally cliched and over the top : Law is this alpha male of all alpha males . He 's super talented , smart , intelligent , successful , powerful , dominant , rich , handsome , fearleass , brave , honourable , strong-minded . He 's a billionaire . He 's got the world laid out to his feet . Everyting he does or touches turns into gold . He might be a god ... , he certainly feels and behaves like one . He 's awfully arrogant or sure of himself -- however you 'd like to interpret it . When planning a picnic , he 's using his helicopter or jet to get there , flying the thing himself , naturally . When confronted with a gun ( while being unarmed himself ) he fearlessly and single-handedly , and , of course , successfully -- was there ever any doubt ? -- wrestles the gun-holding `` opponent '' for the gun , knocking him out easily while he 's at it . And that 's that . He joined the force and went to Afghanistan for no other reason than to kill Osama Bin Laden himself . While fighting bravely at the front for freedom and against terrorism , he 's running his corporation via satellite ( his private one , of course ) and quite successfully so.In contrast to Law Tom -- although being refered to as tough ( why ? ) -- can only be compared to a damsel in distress , helplessly waiting for the shining knight in armor to save the day or , which would be more appriopriate in Law 's case , to save the world . I do n't really like this kind of dynamic in a relationship , neither straight nor gay.And the rape-but-not-rape scene was n't anything I liked very much , either . Tom was scared to death , waiting for the inevitable while trying to convince himself that it wo n't be all that bad , that it will be OK , and he just realizes that he 's actually turned on as hell the second he feels Law 's *** ( or , to put it nice : member ) up his virgin *** . That was too close for comfort . ( A D/s [ BDSM ] dynamic is fine , even hot , but here it is n't . The thing between Law and Tom is not a D/s thing , not in that way . ) I could n't find anything remotely romantic in that.Yes , this book wants to be a parody , wants to be over the top . And it is working in some parts , but in others it isn't.Sometimes , less is more .	-1
This took all of 10 minutes to read and I paid for it ! It was a prelude at best . I am sure the other reviews are from friends .	-1
I see from the previous one star reveiws that they did not buy the book ( lucky them ) . For some reason I bought it , I am not going to give you a blow by blow when it was already described in the two star reveiw but I will add my two cents about format of the book , it was terrible . I will not buy anything of her again ! ! But I will add that who ever formatted the book should lose there job and the auther needs to go to writing class to . Her flow was off and the way she wrote was like a child . And she seemed obsessed with pricey things ( she decribed them at length ) . If anything if she want to keep writting she at least needs a better editer .	-1
First of all , I have no problem with menage relationships because one of my all time favorite books is `` Their One and Only '' by Trista Ann Michaels which I loved . Surprisingly , my problem with this book was not the length . However , one of my problems was that I thought that four men having one woman was just overkill . Problem number two being that two of the guys swing both ways but they called themselves family . That was just disgusting ! I have no problem with gays , but the fact that one man is being done up his rear by the other while she 's performing oral sex on him was just too much for me . That whole visual killed it for me . These are also the same men she heard getting busy up the hall after the first night they all `` shared '' her , so there was no guessing where his junk had been the night before , but she still eagerly put her mouth on him as if it was no big deal ... I GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT ! If that was not enough , as I previously mentioned , I think four men was way too many for this book . Four people just made the sex scenes more chaotic and scattered to me . It was hard for me to keep up with who was doing what to who , and who was enjoying who , because there was so much going on . Another disappointment , or should I say inconsistency in the story , for me anyway , was after Rayna finally has sex with Jaime for they first time . The two lovebirds actually make a pact that from that point forward he is the only one that will `` get her mouth '' but I guess that only included kissing which I thought was absolutely ludicrous seeing as how later that same day after he has `` claimed her mouth '' the first thing she does is give David , the guy being done by his boyfriend , oral sex . Correct me if I am wrong , but I thought that claiming her mouth would include that as well . So , it was perfectly okay to suck them off , just not kiss them , that makes a lot of sense . THINK ABOUT IT AND GET BACK TO ME ... You add all that up , and the fact that the whole insta-romance between Jaime and Rayna was just not believable in any way to me just made me not like this book at all , and I really wanted to . I could have cared less about Jaime being scarred and maimed . I just did n't believe there was a real connection happening while she was being banged by three other men . There was literally no time for a real relationship to blossom between those two.I guess I 'll just have to count on Ms. Michaels to come save the day again because it seems like she 's the only author that gets these menage relationships right on paper .	-1
The reviews were good so I tagged the whole series - but after reading this one had to delete them all.It was too & # 34 ; saw her , had her , shared her & # 34 ; and oh , better squeeze in a quick danger story.It was n't woody but had a forced quality to it.Sorry , the other books may get better but not going to tag this author as a favourite .	-1
Sweet and tender ? Not ! Try stupid and tedious . I do n't mind menage stories , in fact I love them , but I want the menage to be within a loving , committed relationship . That was not the case with this book . It was more of an `` affair with permission . '' I did n't care at all for the characters , especially a heroine who remains committed to a husband despite overwhelming evidence that he has no respect or care for her . I have deleted this book from my Kindle archive . So much for offering a title free to build good publicity .	-1
I just could not get interested in this book from the start . Did not understand a lot of it fromthe beginning , did not finish reading the book . I read so very many romance books in a month , and hardly ever delete one from my kindle without finishing it .	-1
Although the story line is not bad , this author continuously had Native Americans who could barely speak English , thinking in complex English words and phrases ... I highlighted a few in my kindle as examples ... but one which really sticks out is when when of the native americans was thinking she was feeling queasy ... simply not believable that someone who can barely speak English would think using the word queasy ... I found myself thinking of how the thoughts could have been expressed in simpler English that you would have beleived the characters were thinking ( rather than being caught up in the story ) ... this is throughout the book and really takes away from your enjoyment ... It is clear from the preface that the writer was not going for any authenticity as she has the ceremony described as taking place years after the last ceremony was really performed ( when all it would have taken was for her to change the date on the first page of when this happened -- the date did not affect the story at all ) ... .clearly this writer did not care for the book to sound authentic ... but having the Native Americans `` think '' ( and sometimes speak ) in perfect and complex English was annoying and took away from the story ... Here is one such time copied verbatim from the book ... this is an Indian Girl thinking to herself during childbirth ... but at this point this girl barely speaks English '' It was almost done . One more push and this process would be over ! '' Process ? another '' You need focus on rabbit '' this from an Indian who just knew enough English to trade with the white man ... Focus ? surely not a word someone who barely speaks English would uselater on the Chief says '' We suggest you leave '' Again , just not believable ... There were many many more examples ... but it was only 3/4 ( or more ) of the way through the book it ticked me off enough to decide to write a review ... so I saved a couple of examples that were short ... This book was mildly entertaining , and did have a few unexpected twists , but the language she had the Native Americans who could barely speak English using was simply unforgivable and is really distracting as you are constantly thinking `` An Indian would not have said or thought that '' I suggest this writer put a little more imagination into her writing , especially if she is going to do more books about Native Americans ... simply not believable and ruins the whole book .	-1
The first book in the Infinion series established a good and original premise which had me anticipating the release of this sequel . Book two begins 26 years in the future from the previous book just a few weeks from the approach of the series ' all-important date Nov. 11 , 2011 . It rapidly becomes clear that the Three Eleven Corporation has had an even more profound impact on the world in the last two and a half decades . The beginning of the book offers some answers and builds good anticipation of what is going to happen between several of the central characters . Unfortunately , many of these interactions fall flat . Much was made in the first book of Adya 's ( Dawn 's ) call to motherhood and her extremely high IQ . Although she has the education and experience of a master parent she is portrayed as a terrible mother in this second installment . She seems very distant from her children , especially with the most important one who she neglects throughout the book . I also got an overall impression that fatherhood is treated as inconsequential . Dawn spends a good deal of the book pushing her lover completely out of her life while lamenting his distance . Strange biases creep into the narrative . At one point a character applauds himself thinking of himself as : `` leaving behind typical Caucasian ignorance . '' Not too subtle there . And this guy is supposed to be a good guy , who happens to be Caucasian ! Although the world 's fateful day is approaching , it is hard to determine the passage of time here . People are flying all over the world from this location to that location , often with little purpose or some obscure purpose . It gives a very disjointed feel to the flow of the narrative when the reader is not sure why the characters are heading somewhere or what their next move should be . At one point something happens that it would seem pretty important that the central characters react to but it seems not to be pursued to its natural conclusion at all . During these tumultuous times for the planet , Dawn , the leader of Three Eleven essentially goes AWOL a couple of times during the book simply because she 's upset about things going on . She completely withdraws and provides no confidence to the rest of the Executive . Three Eleven was ominous enough in the first book , but now has become terrifyingly powerful . The corporation has effectively become a world government in the form of global nanny state controlling people 's entertainment , food , money , technology , et cetera . They are still presented as the good guys but they seem to have no redeeming qualities . They keep people from having much junk food , or the latest technology . The average person does n't need the good stuff , right ? They may be trying to save the world but it is no longer a world people are free in . Despite this the vast majority of the populace seems to be enthralled with the unrestricted intrusion of the corporation into most facets of their lives , to the point that many still express a desire to work for them ! The major exceptions to this are a man who blows things up and a crack pot conspiracy theorist.I am disappointed in the plot here . We do learn much more about the plasmid and the threat to Earth and these things have some cool ideas thrown in there . The concept has so much potential and even some new elements with much potential continue to be introduced here to Bell 's credit . But these are not able to overcome the fractured storytelling , deeply flawed characterizations , and scattered plot . The train really flies off the tracks when Dawn goes and visits the buffalo spirits . No , that 's not a joke . I 'm a bit of a completist , so I 'll still read the final installment for closure but it wo n't be with nearly the anticipation of this one .	-1
I 'm sorry to say that this novel just is n't for me . I love vampires , but I honestly had a hard time following the storyline in What Luck ! For me , it seemed to jump around a lot , and while many readers are easily able to follow , and love , stories like this , I tend to struggle a bit comprehending everything that is happening . I thought the novel started out very strong and I was pulled into the story almost immediately , but became confused around the time Margaret Anne transitioned . From there , the story became a little too fast paced for me as the Sinclair 's worked to build their new lives together , ridding the world of evil . While I do love the premise of this novel , and enjoyed having `` grown-up '' vampires as opposed to the young , angsty teenage vampires that make up so many books today , I can personally only give this novel one star .	-1
Having visions of the past since childhood , Annie 's parents institutionalise her believing her to be bi-polar or schizophrenic . After their death there is no way out for Annie until her trust funds run dry and there is no-one to pay the doctors bills . Now alone and on the streets Annie has to find a way to survive . After being attacked she meets Maxwell , a vampire and it 's not long before the reason for her visions is revealed ... ... .I have recently read a couple of short story compilations by Alex and enjoyed her writing style so had high hopes for this book but was sadly let down . The writing style was totally different in this full length novel than it was in the short stories and I could n't get to grips with it . The dialogue was unnatural and it made the characters voice irritate me.The story line was an odd one , initially I was grabbed and I could n't put it down . Annie who had been in a mental institution for years was suddenly on her own on the streets with very little money . Then she is attacked and rescued by a helpful stranger . After being unconscious for a few days she wakes up in a strange bed in a strange house ... ... .Now this is where it began to lose me ... ... ... . She wakes up in a bed and has no idea how she got there , she decides to look around and finds she is alone in a very well furnished but ` looks like it 's not lived-in ' house . She recalls being attacked so surely she would at that point run for the hills before whoever brought her there ( maybe the attacker for all she knows ) comes back ... ... ... ..But no ! ! ! she looks around and decides she 's going to squat there , clean it up and make it her home ! ! ... ... It made no sense to me ... ... why would she do that ? ? ? Another point that made me go ` ugh ' was that the place was filled with antiques and even though she 's been locked up for years and is still quite a young girl ( I ca n't remember her age ) she could spot a ` Queen Anne desk ' and a ` Louis XIV Chaise ' ! I 'm sorry but being able to tell the difference between crystal vases and glass vases or identify antique furniture is not something she could feasibly be able to do from the life she has endured up to now.After that it was a downward spiral for me , I tried my hardest to convince myself the plot was going to improve , I really wanted it to , but it did n't . At the point Annie transformed into Margaret Ann I was lost and only continued to read because I will always finish a book I 'm asked to review . Had the writing flowed better for me I would have rated this higher but I am sorry to say the whole book was a huge let down.Copy supplied for review .	-1
Lyla Sinclair is a terrific author . I have always enjoyed her books immensely . That being said , `` Training Emily '' was a huge disappointment . The character Mark Kendall is an angry college professor whose wife left him five years ago . Emily is his student who is failing his class and who has lusted after him for years . The premise is good one but it falls far short of what it could have been . Mark is a wannabe Dom and a cruel b*****d. What really ticked me off is that Emily kept wondering if she had 'daddy issues ' . Gag me . ( no pun intended ) . If this had been the first book I had ever read by this author I never would have picked up any more . The price is not worth the time or effort that this reader put out .	-1
This was a boring book . There needed to be more of a back story to make it plausible or maybe give it a little meat . Unfortunately , neither the sex nor the premise worked . And of course , the requisite bad grammar . I do n't know why I do n't give up on these amazon ebooks by random authors because they just keep getting worse .	-1
I recieved this book for free and tried reading it but just could not get into the storyline . The author is great though .	-1
Have read many of Foresters books and really enjoyed them hardly could put them down . However the mentor is not one of her best , its soooo slow and elementary do n't think I will finish it . Hope some of her others are not as boring .	-1
I thought the work was boring and a bit repetitive . I also had no connection to the characters and got bored half way through .	-1
Unfortunately I did not care very much for this book . Nothing against the author , I 'm sure they have plenty of fans .	-1
Ca n't write much about this book as I just could n't get into it . Tried to go back several times but nothing about it caught my interest .	-1
The idea behind this book sounded interesting . And I think it still could be . But unfortunately it was not delivered well in this book . There were many times while reading that I thought I missed a paragraph because the writing kept skipping around . It felt really just thrown together . And the conversations between characters were incomplete and blunt . It lacked a direction and background ... it just lacked .	-1
I enjoy reading menages where the parties involved are deeply in love and have usually known each other for years and the heroes are looking for an exclusive committed relationship . This series is just a rutting group of people . Here is the cookie cutter plot for this series : -Hero has been in lust/love with the heroine for years and she has been pushing him away for years ... .Check.-He decides he ca n't wait anymore so he persues ... .Check.-He gets help from her relative or best friend through betrayal of some sort ... .Check.-Hero , best friend or relative all know that the heroine is denying her nature and they know what is best for her ... .Check.-Hero brings in a friend that the heroine has never seen or met before for menage sex ... .Check.-Heroe 's friend does n't even show up in the book until the deed is going to be done ... .Check.-Heroe 's friend gets an easy , free lay with a woman he 's does n't know , does n't even have to wine or dine her ... .Check.-His friend does the deed and takes off immediately after ... .Check.That about says it all . You do n't feel any great love between the H/h , basically just a bunch of people swapping . I did n't even get the impression of any real feelings going on between the person who betrays the heroine and the heroine herself . It was just of a sad kind of event , pathetic really . Hero is definetly not the jealous , possessive type so if your looking for that avoid this series.SAVE your money there are much better menage series out there .	-1
The concept of this book should have made it good , but I found it quite boring . The vampires were interesting , and had some unique aspects , but that really was n't enough to carry the story . I enjoyed the parts that explored him adapting to vampirism , but then backstory dragged down the narrative . The climax was brief and disappointing , very unsatisfactory . I 've already forgotten many sections , and found it to be a waste of time .	-1
This was just plain awful . Downloaded it for free but will be deleting it off my cloud . And apparently this is a series ? Who pays for this stuff ?	-1
This was a very confusing story . I had trouble reading it entirely and even understanding what was going on.The characters did n't seem completely thought out . The story line was broken and all over the place . This has the potential to be a good story if the main problems where fixed . I liked the setting and the type of characters and such , but everything was too scattered to really understand and/or enjoy .	-1
Written for morons . Really . Unbelievable characters , unbelievable plot . Also very short . This should be a free book , so at least you do n't waste your money as well as your time.I liked one of the author 's other books , A Scandalous Season .	-1
Given that our tastes and reading habits change over the years , all I could think about was that I would have found these essays and this humor mildly ( and I mean mildly ) amusing back in the 60s . It reminded me of some of the old short stories in the Reader 's Digest which I 'd read while waiting for the dentist.I 'm sorry I got suckered in , if only for 99 , but it makes me hesitant to buy any more books listed as humor . A buck here and a buck there ...	-1
Jenny Penn is usually an automatic read for me . KANSAS HEAT , however , might have changed my mind.You have Amanda and her three men -- Knox , Cody , and Jace . These three men did their best to offer her comfort , security , and love . And what did they get in return ? Amanda was horrible . She was unlikeable , selfish , and whiney . Her personality , or lack thereof , ruined KANSAS HEAT for me . I wanted all three of these men to find someone else -- anyone else but her . She did n't deserve them in the least.Hopefully Ms. Penn 's next book will be better because goodness knows this one made me tear my hair out.Natalie S .	-1
Dr. Kline experimented on himself and now he is in a state psychiatric hospital for the criminally insane . But he did not mean to kill the researcher , he was experiencing one of the dozens of moods brought on by the experiment . All he has to do is get out and he will find the machine and restart the experiment .	-1
I did n't care for this short story very much . I like stories that get right to the point and this one had way to much description for me . I would not recommend it .	-1
So short I can hardly remember the story . OK for a very short coffee break . Not much going for it .	-1
Did n't know it was short stories . None of them were long enough to satisfy . Whatever . I did n't get the sense of any of them .	-1
As far as mysteries or thrillers go , this was a dud . It lacked any suspense . It was a simple story of a wife 's revenge on her unfaithful husband , a plot that has been done over many times .	-1
A predictable plot that lacked imagination . I struggled to finish this one but kept hoping the story would improve . The final twist did n't do it for me .	-1
Fire creates evidence it does n't destroy it . Proof that the cops can make a thousand mistakes a crook can only make one .	-1
Usually , I love books of all kinds.This one , I could n't even get through the sample it was so tedious.p.s . my favorite book is Deed of Paksenarrion , which takes me a day or two to read . I 'd read that ten times before I 'd look at this sample again .	-1
The characters are easy to forget , the story is easy to forget , and nothing really happens . This book , although only 99 cents on kindle ( bonus point ) is one part of a series that should never have been broken up . I read the first 3 in this series before realizing I no longer cared what happened to the characters and even the 99 cents was not worth the further investment . Easy to read in one sitting , but even easier to forget that you read it .	-1
Sorry , just did n't grab me at all . It had the right ingredients , just did n't come together in a way that I could enjoy it . And I tried . Three times . This will be only the third book I have deleted from my library .	-1
After reading `` A Bid For Love '' which I gave 5 stars , I was very disappointed to read this one in the series . This was a mystery and should not have been represented as a romance . Even though I know it is fiction , I found the whole story to be absurd -- two ordinary people taking on a huge international smuggling ring ? No way . There is basically no romance in this book and I had to force myself to finish it . I personally can not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great romance . Have already purchased the final in the series , so will see how it goes .	-1
Could n't make it past 2 % ; think there 's only been one or two times I have n't been able to give a book at least 10 % . Action did n't engage , found it ridiculous that everything fell apart at start of story when the family had supposedly been hiding out for years . Characters did n't engage , action had no urgency , writing was poor .	-1
Instead of being a story interspersed with sex scenes , this is sex scenes interrupted by occasional plot scenes . It had a promising plot , too , but unfortuately that was n't developed enough . It was decently edited and free .	-1
I have read other things by Ms. McKade and have like them , but this one I could not finish . I felt it was simplistic and boring .	-1
this book is alright . You have to read it to really get what I am talking about . And I do mean read it all .	-1
A man who is suffering and depressed that his lady love has left him , rescues a strange woman from drowning . Then she immediately grab his manhood and asks him to have sex with her.The story is rushed and many important details and scene-building description is lacking . Felt like the story was hurriedly thrown together . The ending was forced and left me wondering what I had just read . Nice idea , but needs more work .	-1
Not to bad for a free read . It was short and not too much to it . Maybe give it a try since its free ...	-1
The story is about a girl who goes to a sex toy party and ends up winning an array of toys . She goes with her friend and ends up getting a ride home by her friend 's brother . Of course he likes her and when they reach her house he goes inside with her . One thing leads to another and they end up using one of the toys . It got 2 stars because I liked the idea of the story . Bu it also only got 2 stars because it was super short and the toy they used was the most boring of the ones she won .	-1
This is a faithful , irony-free transcription of the sort of sexual fantasy one often sees parodied , or at least made a bit more emotionally complex , in these postmodern , metatextual days . Jamilah 's all `` Master , forgive me for my crime ! '' and Zahir 's all `` hah , I caught you , and now I shall 'punish ' you by having sex with you while you are totally helpless to resist and are kind of making a token resistance but we both know this is really what you want is n't it my little desert flower . '' Kind of seventeenth-century as exotic sexual fantasies go , but whatever floats your boat . It 's written in fairly grammatical English , though the highfalutin ' Arabian-played-by-Anne-Baxter-speak ( `` Daughter of your most humble servant '' ) does n't always mesh well with random bits of modern slang and sex talk .	-1
It just was n't good . I 'd say it was written by a teenager after her first lesson of creative writing . And those pitiful sex scenes ! Really not worth reading .	-1
you will have to read this to get what I mean by Hot Love so read it and I know you will not regret it if you do .	-1
Maybe I should not read anymore of this series of naughty nooners because something is lacking and these just are n't doing it for me . They all seem unoriginal.very plain and predictable .	-1
Short paranormal romance that feels like too much too soon . Perhaps if the story was better developed and longer it would had made for a great read .	-1
In this short short uh story ( ? ) a woman is supposedly trying to win a contest and use her winnings eventually for school . While dancing she is 'turned on ' by the handsome man who is entranced by her but for reasons of his own . A sexual fairy tale with a gargoyle who wants to be freed from a curse . Okay . No background about the contest , the girl or the gargoyle and his curse . Great sex under less than pleasant circumstances , 'Love is a many splendid thing ' , I guess . It 's more like a warped beauty and the beast gone wrong . This short story could be remnants of several of the writer 's dreams . You could call it quirky if it had a real beginning but it starts in the middle and ends . It held my interest when it read it , hoping that more would be explained but that did n't happen . Lap Dance is too short in length and many other aspects of a good short story in this or any other genre.Worth the price as is and the 5 minutes it takes to read it . It was free and readable . I think the writer can do better and I hope she does .	-1
The whole premise of this story was pretty far fetched to begin with and the author just could n't seem to get it together . The story felt disjointed and I honestly zoned out for several pages . Not to mention the whole paranormal aspect came out of left field for me , this could have been of course because I zoned out , but still it did n't fit for me . The writing was weak and the character development and story was pretty much non-existent , I get this is a short story but a decent writer can still create a complete story that flows in a limited amount of pages , and this author wrote a longer story than most naught nooners ! Definitely not a story that left any sort of memorable impression , but it is free so read at your own risk .	-1
I wish it was more . It left me high and dry . I was yearning for more and a better ending .	-1
I got the Kindle freebie which was suppose to be `` scintillating samples . '' What a disapointment ! Okay there were several pages of written words but nothing to entice me into wanting more . In fact , I kept wondering if what I was reading was leading me any where . It did n't I do n't expect to pick up another of Rosemary Laurey 's -- at least not intentionally.Waiting at Eros	-1
I normally do n't write reviews , but it personally ticks me off that this story is rated 3+ stars , which is the only reason I downloaded it . This is a complete and utter waste of time and energy . The `` short story '' reads like a back jacket synopsis to a promising book . That 's it . There is completely no insight to anything . There is no past , a lunch time banter for the present and no future . The characters have no real identities . I do n't know how this even takes 30 minutes to read . The story itself takes place in about a 30 minute time frame . It 's useless.It 's great that there is a plethora of free books available , but that does n't mean I ought to be grateful for ANYTHING that is free .	-1
I felt like I had to trudge my way through the first few pages , this being before I knew it actually had ( two ) chapters . And within the first chapter , I literally had to force myself to read it , I fought the temptation to start skimming through it . But I could not offer quality review if I did , so grudgingly , I found chapter two.How the writer managed to cram three , maybe four erotic scenes into the first chapter , is beyond me . The first one was like , & # 34 ; They could have done better & # 34 ; , The second was a bit like the first , and the third was like a combo of the first two . Nothing new stirring the pot for these guys , they are just going through the motions after 500 years.I would imagine these guys just got tired of trying new things , and are just sticking to a routine.The story kicks into gear in the second chapter , finally.If I had known this , I would have skipped directly to chapter two . But even then , it still would have been a waste of time , because the story , at this point began to feel rushed , and there was little information given . So figuring out what was going on was completely lost . And then the next thing you know , it 's over . So much for a story.I ca n't say this was the worst NN I have read ... . Wait a minute . Let me re-phrase that ... . This is not one of the worst , but it definitely is not one of their best . But I guess there is a reason they are offering certain books for free . And it 's clearly not to get you into their collection , in hopes that you 'll want to buy . NN 's are a hit and miss , so I would not be likely to pay for any of them .	-1
First of all , I did n't like neither Danu nor Ragna . They both seemed so artificial . And the language they used was so stiff and official it was hard to believe they knew and loved each other for 500 years . Plus , the story was chaotic and a bit boring . I do n't recommend it .	-1
If you have never read a book that was so far fetched it made you laugh , then I would suggest reading this one.I do n't know about you , but seeing other peoples vapors would actually gross me out more then anything . And being able to use sexual energy to power big machinery ? LMBO ! No , the lack of logic killed the story . But a nice try regardless .	-1
As my fellow reviewers have already pointed out , this is a retelling of the O. Henry classicThe Gift of the Magi . The extreme familiarity of the plot and the lack of tension between the main characters ( they 're married , they 're happy , everything is great ) make this a dull read.For those who like a story with a fuller figured female main ( apparently the cattish aliens prefer big women ) , this may fit the bill .	-1
OMG this story was so dumb ! It had some promise with a new reporter doing an undercover story about an orgy room in a club . Once she gets in it is people having sex with their partners ( not with each other ) and her partner ( the club owner ) does what you expect . After a while she tries to leave , but he stops her . Then he tells her that he knows why she is really there , but it does n't matter cause she would never run the story . Why ? Cause he is really a vampire and then proceeds to bite her .	-1
This was short and I suppose it was erotica , but it really was not even sexy to me . The real problem is that you can not say what genre it belongs in without giving away the ending . Suffice to say , it 's a good thing it was free .	-1
This is a waste of time . Do n't read this unless you are stranded on a desert island with only this book .	-1
this one will leave you wanting more and more . It also too short and will leave you panting in one seen .	-1
~18 and older~Very fast and enjoyable story to read.Lot 's of spicy bits.If your looking for something fast , this one is for you !	-1
this story plot line is a little mess up and to short but a good enough book to read if your just reading to eat up time .	-1
I do n't know , maybe the problem was that I 've never read any other of the Darinthian books before , but I really did n't like this book . I could n't even finish it . Definitely not for me .	-1
Short story full of umm ... Same sex.thought reading something different works be a little more editing.but this was fine . Needed a little something more .	-1
Rina walks into a random room and the door closes behind her and there is this guy who is sitting in the shadows , ( Possibly tenting his fingers and looking like some sort of lunatic ) but Rina only want 's to get out of her shoes . Apparently , they hurt so bad , she does n't give a darn that this man had been sitting there ( Tented fingers ) for what felt like a half hour of dialog about how big of a power player she is.Can he even manage to get up ? For a few pages I thought he may have lost use of his legs , and that he would roll out of the shadows in a wheelchair.Thinking `` Sucks for you , Rina . Looks like you 're doing all the work . `` And OMG ! This guy really needs to shut up ! Seriously , he was like , `` Do n't speak , Slave . I have something to say . '' still has n't gotten up out of the chair . `` I 'm gon na tie you up and then tell you to undress yourself . Because it would be funny to watch you look stupid . `` Yeah , This story did n't play out well in my mind . But do n't let me deter you from reading it ... . It 's free after all .	-1
`` His Voice , His Command '' is pretty apt -- the guy spends most of this erotic short story flapping his jaw instead of actually doing anything . Also , while I 'm not one to demand elaborate backstory for my porn , I spent most of the story with absolutely no idea where this dude and this lady were , why she was submitting to him , and whether it was consensual , which does affect what I find hot and what I do n't . The revelation of all that at the end was decent and resolved some of the feminist issues I 'd been having with the story ( though not all of them ) , but ... yeah , too much jaw-flappin ' about `` take off your high heels , career lady , you exist only for my pleasure '' for my personal tastes.Also , you know what 's not hot ? When a woman yells `` Oh god , kill me ! '' during sex . ( No , I 'm not kidding , she actually says `` Kill me . '' If I were the guy , I would not feel flattered . )	-1
I got this because it was free . Nothing really happens in this book and it could have been written much better even as a short story . This guy pursues this girl for a year and finally she says yes to a date ( although she does n't like him ) and then she gets there and starts kissing . Then suddenly they are having sex but it 's strange because he keeps talking about how he likes it rough but the sex is n't rough . Then suddenly they are proclaiming their love for each other . The end of story . Would I pay for this ? Absolutely no . Would I read it again ? No . If you have about 5 mins to kill , then read it ( that 's how long the story is ) . I would n't recommend it .	-1
Okay , home boy kind of had it going on , in a not really realistic way . But what can you really expect from a book ( HA ! ) like this ? Home girl was in it for the bed sports , and nothing more . She only says that magic words when poked and prodded to . So yeah , I was not feeling it from her end . All she wanted was more & # 34 ; Bow-chicka-bow , bow & # 34 ; , and of course , homey do n't mind that . Might be happy to see the rolls reversed for a change.The story was well written in the way of very litter grammatical errors , but it was not enough to support the cheesy dialog.I wonder if the publishing house of Naughty Nooners is aware that the more bad reads the let escape , the less likely people will be to pay for the ones still in captivity . ( Or with a price tag , to clarify ) Was it worth the 20 minutes spent reading it ? I would say no . Was it worth the price ? Yeah , if you ai n't got nothing better on your plate , or want some cheese with your wine . : - )	-1
Well all I can say is that it was OK. Not great , not awful . I wish it had been better . However , it might do the trick for some short erotica .	-1
Funny I was going to title my review HUH ? ? ? ? but someone else felt the same and used it.I 'd say this was a waste of paper but since none was used I 'd say it was a waste of my time even though it was free.OK so you find out that Minerva had an abusive marriage . Her husband belonged to some group of rufians that they never go in any detail over.Her son married a druid which I still ca n't figure out where that made any difference in the story.Minerva meets Gregory a man interested in the quilt she is working on and becomes a visitor frequently coming for tea.One of her deceased husbands friends from this group he belonged to calls on her to start and abusive relationship with her . Gregory surprises him and stands up to him and just like that the other guy goes running . Gregory admits his feelings for Minerva . I got to the last page and flipped it to the next when I realized that was the ending . Glad now it was n't any longer . Do n't waste your time .	-1
I received this as a freebie on another site a year ago . I quit reading after the first or second chapter . I found it hard to follow as it was part of a series , and there was n't enough detail in the first chapter to give you a lot of groundwork - it seemed to assume you 've read the previous books . By the time I quit reading , things were really just ... not very believable . Not plausible at all , for a woman with an abusive former husband .	-1
The storyline is absolutely ridiculous , and the only thing that saves the day is the erotica , reasonably well written . The characters are not even believable . The heroine was supposed to be a tough woman , a government agent , trained as a soldier , and the first thing she does when taken hostage , she wets her panties ( well , not in the real sense , but still , this is the most laughable scenario I ever came across ) . As for the hero , an assassin , he 's supposed to break her , but instead he turns into a male hooker . Unbelievable.Lucky the story was so short , I was already losing my patience by the time it ended .	-1
I have read other books by this author , and enjoyed them . So when I saw this book , I did n't hesitate to buy it . I only made it about 10 pages in before I was completely disgusted and deleted it off of my Kindle . I do n't mind when writers put graphic sex scenes into books ; but I would prefer them to not be within the first 2 pages of the book , and have disgusting orgy scenes . What little of the book I actually was able to finish had 9 pages of sex to 1 page of actual plotline . This book is also extremely short for the money you spend on it ( not that I made it through the book but could have easily finished it in an hour ) . If you actually enjoy reading novels that have a plot and are well written , do not buy this one .	-1
The book begins when Morgan , a small town doctor , meets Luke , a drifter with a baby . The baby is the result of a random one-night stand with a waitress/prostitute , and has been left in Luke 's care . Morgan , knowing nothing about Luke , invites both he and the baby back to his derelict farm . From there , the author pieced together several random scenes where Morgan and Luke interact , yet there is no character development , and no real sense that these characters are building a connection.Luke is not gay , and Morgan just wanders around the farm ogling him . Basically , Luke just decides to let Morgan kiss/touch him , and boom , they 're messing around . Luke had no real personal dilemma or journey to this conclusion . The sex scenes seemed to be written by someone who does n't actually know how gay men have sex.Overall , this `` novel '' was so poorly crafted - all I can say is DO N'T WASTE YOUR MONEY .	-1
... Well maybe not let down as much as disillusioned . I have read about open relationships in other books and have not had a big problem with it ... not really my flavour but if it is set up right then it 's fine . I think what threw me is it the book opens with Angelo and Cole having sex with Zach going , sure whatever you want . Now , I had just read their book , Angelo and Zach 's and there was nothing in that book that sets up the relationship as moving in that direction ... If anything it is the opposite . So , overall while I think the book was technically well done I am just feeling disappointed in their relationship now . I think that if the author had prepared the way in the first book it wound not have been so bad , ,but that did n't happen . so this whole open relationship , one sided by the way ( Angelo only ) , just ended them in a sour note for me .	-1
I 've read several Mary Calmes books and loved them , this one not so much ... This book starts out good but then just looses it , its kinda like this is the rough draft and the book just never got finished . Such a shame , the story sounded kinda cool , I would really liked to have read a better written version.Save your money and buy : Change of Heart , Timing or frog all of them are so much better !	-1
Okay , not an interesting story . Tami whines too much about being a women with curves and a virgin . She just lets Marcus have his way , even after she finds out that he kept her from having a boyfriend her whole life and she does n't even think about the fact that it 's incest since he 's her uncle ... .Besides the storyline , the story itself is n't written in a way to hold your attention . After a few sentences i was n't interested anymore and I skipped through most of this , hoping that there still would be something interesting to find , but no such luck ... ...	-1
If I had realized this was a religious book , I would not have downloaded it even for free . Please post accurate descriptions of your books.added 05/14/2012 - Book description now includes the fact that it is religious fiction .	-1
Oh my gosh was n't this one boring . There 's the premise about the Endeavour blowing up , but the first three and a bit chapters were totally unrelated . I found myself getting progressively more and more bored as I read . When were they getting to what was detailed in the book 's introduction ? Not till chapter 4 . Seriously , if you read this piece of rubbish , do yourself a favour and just read the prelude and then skip those 4 chapters . It is chapter 4 when things start to happen . But even then it is n't that exciting . And yes , it becomes a religious tome.I do n't know what the writer was thinking with this one . Lure people in with a promise of a great sci-fi drama and then give them a boring religious book.Again , not my cup of tea regarding the religion , but even if it was , I still get the impression I 'd find this one boring .	-1
The plot of the beginning was not bad . But when the author tried to justify breaking into a research lab and the characters said to stop eating meat and animal tests were only for money , the book became propaganda instead of a story .	-1
Called it quits at page 33 out of 127 on my eReader . The writing seemed so basic and could n't see anything special about the main character , Dani . Dani finds out that her biological father is a famous action hero , Mark Ocean . At first her dad did n't want anything to do with her , but when he realized he can use Dani to make him look better in the eyes of the public , he reaches out Dani.I stopped reading around there . This story seems so predictable and the storytelling is n't that great . Do n't read.See my profile 's website for link to more of my reviews .	-1
It is unlikely this author ever did more than read articles online and then vomited up what he learned . There is no copyright protection for facts , only for how information is presented , and he presents the facts so poorly as to make reading this a waste of time . By contrast , read free online articles from experienced authorities.I began to suspect this author was a fraud when I saw not one footnote , not one end note , nor any references . He quotes people without referring to the source of the quote . Did he use online quote sources ? I doubt he ever read anything about trials or jury selection , other than quickie articles available on the 'net . Add to the lack of credibility is that this author has yet to learn the rules of punctuation ( i.e. , when quoting someone , the period is placed before the end quote , not after the end quote ) .	-1
It is quite shocking that I did n't like this book because I read all the reviews before I bought it . I thought it was far too predictable and rather pendantic . So if I were you I would purchase something else .	-1
This story seemed more like several stories shoved together than one , coherent story . The author introduced several plots but then went nowhere with them . I found this book really tiring .	-1
I love the Jeff Resnick mysteries but Bah ! HUMBUG was n't even long enough to be called a short story . It would have made a good story too .	-1
It 's rare for me not to finish reading a book , even if I do have to skip through the last few chapters . Unfortunately in this case I could n't get past the first third of the novel . I downloaded the book for free , and I certainly would have been most disappointed if I had purchased the novel.. The whole writing style is most immature and I could find nothing appealing in the heroine . Maybe a younger reader would enjoy but I would n't recommend to mature readers .	-1
The description says it was published in Horse Fantastic . It does not say it is also the opening to Exile 's Honor . Do n't bother . Read the Exile duology instead .	-1
I could n't get into this book ( short story ) . My main complaint was if Dana felt enough about her brother to take him in why not try to protect him when a stranger shows up who obviously has an unhealthy , sometimes hostile relationship with this 17 year old boy . She just allows him move in to her house , invites him to sleep with her brother then has fantasies of a guy that she ca n't say for sure is n't having a sexual relationship with her underage brother . The only thing I liked was the cover .	-1
Do n't bother with this series . I just read this one book but it told me all I needed to know ... that I should n't read another . Implausible situations , poor character development ; there 's too many good books out there to waste time on this series , I fear . Sorry , Ms. Lambert .	-1
Not the worst book I 've read but really not great . J P Bowie has another book , sort of ghost story called Time after Time - I thought really enjoyable so I got this one.Suffice to say , check out his other books and do n't worry about this one .	-1
I will learn to look at and to pay attention to page counts at some point : ( I really do n't like novellas . They are a waste of time and money . I wish Amazon could stop me with a little reminder of & # 34 ; No wait , dear , it 's a short story. & # 34 ; This one in particular ended so abruptly that I felt like I was being booted out the door like a smelly house guest.I enjoy Cartwright 's books ( books , not short stories ) . She develops the story line and characters very well . And even in this short story she did the same ... ..But it did n't tie together for me .	-1
Poorly written . Good story . Needs editor . Rambles . I would avoid the work -- but give the author another chance should he try again .	-1
Too short . Felt like a bad snapshot or excerpt of what was intended to be a real story . Taking it off my kindle	-1
I really wanted to like this story but I could n't . It was an okay book but definitely not worth re-reading . It took forever for the plot to hit its stride and then when it did it kinda fizzled away . Do n't waste your money on it . Move on to another author .	-1
In the author 's defense , this was one of those `` bridge '' short stories . However , if the idea was to get me hooked to buy and read more ... I just felt too in the dark and did n't make enough connection with any of the characters . After reading other 's reviews it sounds like if I 'd read the other books , I would n't feel this way . Do n't know if I 'll ever find out . Sex was hot , but even that felt a bit ridiculous to me -- '' I 'm jealous , but I 'm not really and it is ok this time because you wo n't do it again , so go ahead and say goodbye '' ( I do n't always get men sharing a woman , so read this with that in mind )	-1
People who are turned into angels , but keep acting like people with sexual drives , who would take part in a m & eacute ; nage & agrave ; trois . Basically , this was the story -- nothing else . If someone is going to play with the ideal of angels , the author could at least have presented some background to establish common ground with the reader .	-1
I am not sure if I like the fallen angel idea for romance so the jury is still out on that one . If this snippet was designed to get me interested enough to purchase the book ... it did not . I never learned to share some things well so the double bro-mance is definately off my list things to read . ( ICK ! )	-1
This is a snippet of a story about angels or fairy tale characters ( I could n't really tell what they were or what actual powers they had , other than one of them was an `` empath '' ) who perform unspecified tasks to fight evil . The lack of context was a real problem in getting into this story . I understand that it was meant to be a bridge between books one and two in a series , but maybe a more detailed preface explaining who these people are or what sort of powers they have would help those of us who have n't read the first book.Instead , all we got was a preface explaining that Ren was n't going to have a happy ending in this story - a rather unnecessary spoiler , I thought.Anyway , Ren is very jealous of his ex-girlfriend or ex-something 's happiness ( the nature of their relationship was n't clear - I could n't tell if they 'd been having sex for the last hundred years or if they 'd had sex once in a hundred years of unrequited love ) so he goes to her house and has a threesome with her and her new boyfriend . And that is pretty much it.All other action ( they fight demons or something ? ) takes place out of sight . Weak characters , unnecessary amounts of angst , too much pointless moodiness , and unclear setting make this one that I would n't recommend .	-1
This ebook was not my cup of tea . It was a little much for me . I did n't read the first book , but I did n't think I would like it . The ebook was well written .	-1
Filthy , sick , disgusting porn . Nothing else to say . I was induced to download this on the understand it was a retelling of a traditional fairytale , as `` Grimms circle '' suggests . I can not believe Amazon lets this sort of rubbish be sold without a warning on the cover , there should be something to warn those of us who do n't want to read sick filth .	-1
Bought all three books together without reading any of them . They were all short and stupid . Hated them , but read them anyways because I spent the money on them .	-1
This book only went from the bed to the hot tub and back to bed . Other customer reviews did n't help in this case . I was unfamiliar with this author or I never would have bought it . I 'm not a prude and a good lusty sex scene is good , but this was not even a good book .	-1
Well I only downloaded it to read what is was about . But to be frank my not even my 5 year old sister found this enjoyable . No offence it 's just my opinion but this book needs to get a lot of upgrades to the 24th century before getting any good reviews .	-1
This is a short story that ends very abruptly leaving you wondering where the rest of the story is . Not worth $ 3.47 ! The story is about a woman and a man that meets casually once or twice a year at trade shows . The woman has been fantasizing about the guy for 2 years and finally hits on him in the bar - telling him she is extremely bored and he should spank her and fxxk her . She has heard rumors he is a Dom and while she has played a time or two , is interested in learning more . The Dom starts to dominate her in the bar and takes her back to his room for the evening . At the end of their interlude , he annouces he is transfering to be near her so they can be together . End of story . No kidding . Save your money .	-1
Patterson , author ofThe Craigslist Killer ( A Digital Short ) , has turned in another uneven short story with `` 19 . `` Misleadingly described as a medical thriller ( just because a character suffers health problems does n't mean the resulting story will appeal to readers of that genre ) , this story suffers from a meandering plot , unresolved details , and awkward framing.A man ( nearing the end of his life ? We 're just told his grey hair indicates he is older than fifty ) receives a letter from an old flame . They were actually engaged at one point , but the engagement ended . Why ? We 're told he never knew why.Okay . Maybe those questions will be answered in the manuscript that his ex encloses.Nope . It 's a totally different story , starting at her childhood and then skipping forward to middle-age . There 's a little too much detail at the beginning ( for example : her material grandparents did n't want her parents to get married , telling her to stay away from `` Polls '' [ sic ] ) , as if Patterson initially set out to write a longer story and then lost his resolve . So after setting the scene , we 're skipped ahead decades.The plot itself , we 're told , is based on a true story . It 's one of those things that you might hear of happening to a friend of a friend of a friend -- a woman smells roses if somebody in her family is about to die . But this was n't enough and we get two other supernatural elements that are played out in great detail and then never explained.It 's less thrilling than it is sophoric . The reader keeps waiting for details to be explained or come together to create a cohesive whole , but it never happens .	-1
This could of been a great book but I was so mad as the book only had a few pages.I would really want to get what I paid for this book back	-1
From the other reviews I read before buying this novella I thought this was going to be a really hot story.The hero said he was the devil & was going to show the heroine how to be really bad , so I assumed there would be some kink.But I got ta say I 've read hotter stories . Yes the bottle was different but there was no spanking , bondage , role play or back door action . Was there even any dirty talk ? I do n't recall & I only read this book a couple of weeks ago . ( not a good sign ) If you 're looking for a hot read try Enjoying the Show by Marie Harte or if you 're after something with a bit of kink ( but not hardcore ) try Burn List by Julia Devlin both books took me by surprise whereas Carnal Ecstacy I felt like I was waiting for the fireworks that fizzled	-1
This book only has 114 pages . knowing this , I wouldn , t buy the book . Nor would I buy Book One knowing I might get interested enough to want Book Two . $ 5.00 is Too Much To PAY For a SHORT STORY .	-1
I HAVE N'T READ THIS BOOK . I did anticipate it with excitement , though . I read the first two in this series and thoroughly enjoyed them . I really like sequels and the peeks into the lives of the former characters . It makes the proceeding books seem like continued chapters of the first story . The first book begged for sequels for each of the Grayhawk brothers and I was excited that Ms. Lee would write more about them . I usually read the description of a book and then drop down to read the reviews . I take them with a grain of salt , depending on the viewpoint of the writer , my interest in the description and my affection for the author . Unfortunately , the reviews I read were very disappointing ; so much so that I do not want to purchase this book . There were a couple of suggestions for Ms. Lee , including making the next books more true to the characters and the theme of the previous books . My suggestion -- which may seem a bit farfetched -- is for Ms. Lee to rewrite the third book . The readers and lovers of the first two books , I am sure , would be forgiving if Ms. Lee were to rewrite the third book and keep Peyton true and believable . I , for one , would be glad to purchase it and would heartfully await the stories of the other brothers with baited breath . Ms. Lee , please consider it . I would love to move forward in this series . Thank you .	-1
I should have read the reviews to this story prior to reading it , because this is not the Peyton that I 've come to love . The heroine is a nasty slut ! Who has sex with one man , takes a bath , then has sex with another man thirty minutes later ? A PROSTITUTE ! ! ! ! Avantae did not have the characteristics I admire in a heroine , her type of woman is the he man stealing slut that a true heroine would have a come to Jesus talk with.This story went over the edge to the point that it had nothing in common with the first two Grayhawk stories . I loved , loved , loved Peyton and Marilyn Lee just destroyed him . I will do myself a favor and forget this story was every written . Marilyn Lee deserved every bad review she received for this story .	-1
So different from books 1 & 2 that i had to put my Kindle down and just count it as a $ 7 loss . First off , what happened to the Grayhawk honor . I mean really Peyton . This seemed to be too much about sex . It 's almost like the author forgot that this character was developed in previous books . sigh	-1
Just want to warn all the readers if you want all the answers you 'll need to buy book 2 , well NOT ME ... . I could not careless , the detective Richard is a whimp and I did n't connect with him at all , his wife Bree either.Either this book was full of typos or the way this author put a sentence together is like no others I have seen , allot of them just do not make much sense . Left me shaking my head saying `` What ? `` Sorry , I do n't recommend this book ... .Happy reading Ya 'll ... ... ...	-1
this book is so schock full of filler material ( the Frankish part is absolutely unbearable in its lack of interest ) , the story line is so flat and the charachters so devoid of depth and interest that I find it very hard to believe that this book was written by the Author of Lost Civilizations.If you are not familiar with Heppner 's work , please do n't start with this book . you will loose interest in an author who deserves to be read .	-1
This series continues its downward spin in this poorly written book . The grammar continues to be subpar as is the plot and the story development .	-1
I have read a few horribly written books and I rank this one among the top 5 . I felt that had it been offered for free it would have still been overpriced . This book took hours from my life that I wo n't ever get back . I will be wary of reading anything else by this author .	-1
Sarah Jamison is done being patient . She has waited long enough for her lover to finally break up with his girlfriend . Jeffrey has been promising to break up with Moira for ages , but keeps citing business reasons to wait , as Jeffrey and Moira are partners in their network marketing business . Sarah decides to get proactive , enlisting best friend Monica to help devise a plan to break up Jeffrey and Moira for good . Monica thinks adding the dashing Mike Connor to the mix is the right idea . But instead of breaking up Jeffrey and Moira , the plan begins to backfire on Sarah . Along with the help of Sarah 's internet hacker mother , Rosepurple , Sarah finds the true identity of Jeffrey , and realizes her relationship with him was never meant to be.I wanted to like The Other Boyfriend by Sylvia Massara . But it was hard to . While I thought the plot could have gone a lot of different ways , it turned out to be exhaustingly predicable and one-dimensional . The business that Sarah , Jeffrey , and Moira are in is a big part of the story , but it was never explained . I had no idea what they were doing , and each time business was talked about , I just became confused . And the book should have been run through an editor . I got tired of reading about Mike 's `` sea-green eyes '' for every description . It was a fast read , but too predictable for me to recommend .	-1
Wow , I 'm glad I only paid 0.99 for this one . I was only able to make it half way through the book . So many words with so little to say . It got to the point where I just did n't care who did what to whom . I wont read any more of this series . I do have a book from another of Patricia Ryan 's series that I will try . Some of her stuff I like . This one just did n't go anywhere .	-1
This story takes place far in the future but jumps back to farther in the past without warning . It is at times , hard to follow and has a low character development . It can ramble a lot with chapters that really have no meaning to the story . Missing words , wrong words , words I had to look up . Paragraphs were so long that I had to re-read them to remember what I was reading.In it self , the story would have made interesting reading if one does not get distracted . I would suggest a fair bit of editing , and less over description when writing.A Place of Rest	-1
Despite what the blurb would have you believe , this story does not tell of a flirtation or romance that occurred before Maxon 's Selection . There is a very brief beginning in which a young French royal friend of Maxon 's ( what ? I thought he had no friends ? Whatever . ) sort of throws herself at Maxon and he declines . The story immediately moves to the beginning of the Selection and into familiar territory . All we really read is Maxon 's perspective of that familiar story and his interaction with the girls . The only interesting bit in my opinion was getting to see why he sent some of the girl 's home during the breakfast ceremony . We also see his first interactions with Kriss , and I guess that was kinda interesting . I still ca n't give it three stars because I feel that the blurb was very misleading and teased the buyer with something it did n't deliver . Asking us to pay a few more dollars for basically the same exact story told through Maxon 's eyes felt cheap and disrespectful . I had planned to buy The Queen but if it is really just a retelling of The One through Queen Amberly 's eyes then I might read it , but I sure wo n't pay for it.Buyer Beware .	-1
I was so disappointed in this book , not only was the main character needed she did n't have a backbone . 90 % of the book was in her thoughts which was very annoying . A waste of my money for sure .	-1
Why does anal s*x have to be in or play a part of almost everything considered erotic . I researched this book through reviews and the publisher 's website . I was so disappointed by this . It is so hard to find great authors of this type of fiction . I 'm going to stick with Aliyah Burke and Zena Wynn . You can create great erotic stories without anal s*x . Because I do n't want to waste my money on something I ca n't read . I need a disclaimer or warning . So I 've decided to do what I wish someone had done for me . Consider yourself warned .	-1
I was fairly surprised at the level of raunchiness in this one . Maybe I should have read the reviews , because the synopsis is misleading . This book goes beyond kinky . However , if you are into the BDSM genre , then this book is for you . I wo n't say that the love scenes were n't interesting , but it just was n't my taste .	-1
This isnot a novel to be taken lightly ... This is Reno 's chance to nail the woman he 's been lusting over for years .

Reno is n't and the uber Alpha male that he is , he takes over with nearly a wham bam thank-you ma'am style.But never fear they do get their happily ever after.Be aware that this book has numerous mistakes with the Navy/SEAL lingo and will not be pleasant for women and men who have loved ones in the Navy .	-1
Hold is a Science Fiction Romance by author Zannie Adams and tells the story of Riana who has been convicted of a minor crime and is sentenced to life imprisonment on the prison plant Genus 6 . The Hold as it is known is a prison located under the poisonous sea of Genus 6 where no one escapes from . The Hold is a mixed gender open prison with very few lockable cells . The prisoners are thrown together and fight amongst themselves for food . The guards to nothing to help the prisoners it is a free for all where fighting , rape and stealing are a daily occurance . Upon entering the prison Riana is advised by one of the guards to find the strongest man there and give herself to him as payment for his protection.So from the description of the book I was very keen and excited to read this . It looked like an interesting plot , a women trying to survive in a dangerous futuristic prison and obviously there was going to be a guy and some romance going on , I thought it was going to be a good book from other reviews that I had read . I could n't have been more wrong . The start was good and the story was very bleak and dark , just my kind of thing , then Riana meets Cain the imprisoned guy she gives herself to for protection and the story turns into some kind or porn with the plot as a side story . I was fed up reading about all the times they had sex and in what position and who was watching . I was looking forward to one or two hot sex scenes after being teased into a frenzy by the author but this just was n't the case . I also did n't like the language Ms Adams used . Do n't get me wrong I am not against swearing in fact I have a bad potty mouth myself but I felt it was inappropriate . I also did n't think this language fitted with the type of character that Riana was being portrayed as . I so wanted Ms Adams to concentrate on the promising plot rather than how good Cain was at thrusting . There was very little Sci-Fi in this book and I nearly gave up on it a couple of times . I really do n't like giving a negative review for a book , and please note that this is my honest opinion , as I mentioned earlier I have seen a lot of reviews for this book where people really liked it , however it just was n't for me . I am going to give this book 1 star out of 5 .	-1
I 'm not a fan of journal styled writing and this is no exception . The story could had been fun if done in a better style .	-1
What if the old TV show , Topper were rated X ? Now add a PI ? Sorry even when I finished reading it I could n't feel ... anything . Seemed like it had promise . I did like the cover.I only read it because the wind was blustering outside and I could n't sleep with the racket . Did n't help .	-1
I really liked the premise for this book , but I refuse to read something that relies so heavily on foul language . I stopped reading after the first couple pages and deleted it from my Kindle . Its really to bad , I had looked forward to reading it .	-1
Just like i said it was okay and entertaining to read it at least so popular papa Philip die da	-1
This book just did n't do it for me . I do n't mind the F-bomb but not when it 's used every second word . I 'm not sure whether the author was doing it to shock or not but any intended effect was lost on me . It was just distracting after awhile . Note that the author did warn about the bad language , which I 'm glad about.I would say that I liked the premise and did laugh at some of the awful things Linda does to Mike but not enough to warrant anything more than 2 stars .	-1
In the hands of a gifted writer , this original ghost story could have been hilariously entertaining . With this writer , not so much . As other reviewers have said , this reads like a very sketchy description of a book , rather than the book itself . None of the characters are believable or relatable , the plot lurches along without much sense or description and , oh yeah , there is a lot of gratuitous vulgar language . I am very glad that I downloaded this for free from Amazon 's lineup and did not spend actual money on it . Thankfully , this was a a short read ; but it really is not worth the effort .	-1
This story is typed very similar to a cable TV show called Dead Like Me '' with a little variation so as not to be a rip off of the show . I do n't watch TV for last 4/5 years - but I remember seeing a few episodes of that late night 4 am.The issue I have with the book is NOT the F bomb usage . It is the fact that the characters all have the same or similar enough `` voice '' that there is no variety of substance . If there were not names on chapters to establish POV - the Linda character and the Mike character sound almost identical.A few of Linda 's pranks were cute - but not enough fleshing out of characters or development of story arc to make the one or two chuckles worth the time spent reading this.Christine	-1
Not the best book I 've ever read but it is completely funny this book had me rolling on floor laughing .	-1
Well , this is a short cute story . Linda is dead , Mike is being haunted by her , their neighbors are hiding something , and the poor detective does n't know where to start . We follow the story to find out why Linda is haunting Mike and making his life a living hell . It 's hilarious what all she does to him . By the end , Mike gets his upcoming , the neighbors find peace , and Linda finds her way to the afterlife . It 's cute , funny , and you might scratch your head a little at themystery shrouding Linda 's body whereabouts . My only drawback is that I think f @ # k appears more than the or a does . It was a little excessive that almost all descriptive words were that , but still it was an ok short read that is out of the ordinary in plots .	-1
I suppose if you like this type of writing , this would be the book for you , but I could n't get into it at all ... I 'd recommend you read a page or two before downloading it . Maybe I 'm just the wrong audience ... .	-1
even an for an aussie this is garbage dont bother at all if i had the paperback i would have throw it in the bin followed by petrol then a lit match , that about sums it up	-1
Yes the storyline was good for such a short piece . But the writing and consistancy was horrible . I am so glad it was free , I would have hated to had paid for this crap . Neadless to say I will not be buying or reading anymore from this author .	-1
While the format of having each character write a paragraph in the book is interesting that is the only thing I found that held my interest . I read 67 % but could n't force myself to waste the time to finish it . Doing laundry was more entertaining . SO glad it was free.The gutter language seemed to be used in place of real substance for the characters . Then you have the alternative physical laws of a ghost who can manipulate physical things at times but ca n't at other times . Continuity counts when reading a mystery.I 'm sure other readers will love this little book but I regret wasting the time I spent trying to get through the 67 % that I did read .	-1
This book/story is a bit odd . I have no clue who these characters are . There is no real character development . They all ( besides the 2 neighbors ) sound exactly the same , like one character.It is slightly entertaining for the short amount of time it took me to read it . But it left me annoyed with its abrupt and incomplete ending.I am glad it was free ! I do n't really recommend this to anyone .	-1
I enjoyed this collection of short stories . I would n't say they are all funny but you can tell that they come from the heart . I like the way the collection was set up . Each guy was unique and by far not perfect . Finding a soul mate is not easy and these stories show us this . I think the message of not giving up is clear . Keep on trucking . Keep looking for you man and while you are searching you could always use your personal `` utopia '' : )	-1
Slow moving , silly waste of time . The entire story is poorly written and childishly plotted . No surprises here and I surely wo n't look for more from this author .	-1
It is hard to believe this book was written by an adult . The premise was a good one . The mother of an autistic child , Kelly , is supposed to be 28 years old . Her sole term to describe the teacher she is falling in love with is `` adorable '' . I counted that adjective at least 8 times.Her ex-husband is painted as evil , and he is sterotypically and unbelievable so . Kelly is rarely brave , mostly self pitying and spends more time worrying about her possible future relationship with a man than with her child . How sad , that she goes home from work everyday and takes care of her child . I thought that was what parenting was.She is rescued by the teacher , and his FBI friends , how convenient . He fell in love with her when he met her , having just been ditched by his platonic girlfriend of several years . Several years of cohabitating platonically ? The views of dating , sex , love and parenthood seem to be written by someone who has never experienced any of those conditions , perhaps a 14 year old . Do n't or waste your time or money .	-1
I managed to read about 10 pages and then could not take the puns on names of movies used in every other line of writing . Am glad I got this one for free -- that is all is it worth . I really hate the cutesey use of movie names -- the title should have tipped me off , but guess I needed another cup of joe when I came across this one .	-1
I tried really hard to get through this book . The fact it was supposed to be disturbing , gory , all that , was n't the problem . It just did nothing for me . I like to feel a little connected to any of the characters but I could n't .	-1
total crap . It was written as if the characters have the IQ and maturity of 14 year olds given a mission of supreme importance and using technology giving them limitless possibilities and power . And the whole book continues on like that ... this book has nothing to provoke either thought or excitement . There is no real drama to any of the relationships , and when something does happen ... they just handle it simple and quick with no problems . Yea right .	-1
I tried reading this on my android there was no video , then my windows pc , again no video , but you did get pictures . Maybe it only works on a kindle . I kept feeling I must be missing stuff , so I gave up . The book is about 913 locations .	-1
Not my cup of tea as I 'm not much on the far-fetched . I did n't care at all for it and curtailed reading it at less than the half-way point .	-1
How in the world can you read this stuff to your children . This is beyond gory . I mean this would scare the hell out of the poor kids . And if you want to scare your child to potty training.just read the poem about going to the loo ... .	-1
The book was a very short read and it was for the most part decent until the end . ( For starters , the story is an interracial read BW/WM ) Nila parents insurance runs out which would negate them from being able to stay in a rather expensive retirement home . In order to help make ends meet , she gives up her full time job as a writer to take on a position at one of her friends businesses . The business , Naughty Girls Inc , would provide men would live-in and paid service for a women without any strings attached . No commitment , no love , just sex.Nila meets Josh , a blind wealthy bachelor , and commits to him with her services ( and his $ ) until she spots his best friend Richard and find herself falling for him . Nila is then torn between two men who both have become quite fund of her . The decision she makes will no doubt leave two best friends relationship shattered.The plot was good . It 's somewhat of a cliche but the author added a bit of twist here and there.However , the end was just pathetically written . I could not believe how the author just ended it after being hit with some interesting information . I understand this was a short read but it should have not taken away from the conclusion which was absolutely one of the worst ending I 've read . I can not be any more disappointed.I would give this book a 2.5 stars if I could . Again , plot was decent but the ending was bad and I did n't feel any connection with any of the characters.If you 're looking for a book that is strictly sexual filled with graphic details , then you might get more out of the book then I did . I was looking for more substance , a back ground story and romance . None of that existed in this book.It was cheap and an easy read so I 'm not going to complain too much but Marilyn Lee has written better material then this by a mile . Much better .	-1
How many times is author going to get Amazon to delete this or add comments about alleged conspiracies of people out to get him ? Is he f*in delusional ? My review : I have to agree with a few previous reviewers . The author does n't know the basic mechanics of writing , so how in the world is this or any other he 's written full stars ? There 's not a page that is n't filled with grammar problems . The story itself suffers the same problems from the author 's inattention to detail . Characters are inconsistent in their actions . It 's like they 're interchangeable pegs on a board the author puts into places when he needs them .	-1
The author seems to have serious issues . Getting Amazon to delete honest reviews is wrong . Blaming others because I did n't like your book is wrong . I ca n't help that you book sucks , it does . Man up . It 's because of books like yours that I stopped reviewing things for the longest time . I ran across so much junk , like this . This was so poorly done I must have erased the memory of reading it from my mind . I almost was sucked into buying it again when Amazon reminded my I already bought it . Sure enough there it was on my kindle . I started reading again and remembered why I scraped it out of my brain.If there 's a bottom of the bad barrel , this one 's sitting at the very bottom . In a land where characters are named March and Brendley and Jenka De Swasso ( no not making that one up ) , no one says anything they hiss words , they jest words , they plead words , they mumble words , they shrug words , they sigh words , they scold words , they instruct words , and they even look around words.I wish I was making it up , but apparently the author does n't realize characters ca n't shrug words or look around words . And as far as ending dialogue properly goes , that 's the least of the big misses . So how in the hell is this or anything the author 's written rated so highly ?	-1
This is one of the most ridiculous books that I have ever read . It does n't seem as if the author understood very much about the way the world works at all . One of the main characters became a lawyer right after graduating college ( it does n't seem as if the author knows about the existence of law school ) and another main character is given full scholarships and acceptance letters from two different colleges from a high school teacher without even applying to either college . The mechanics of adoption are also presented really fuzzily . There are open adoptions available -- it does n't have to be the way the author presented it . You also just ca n't terminate a father 's parental rights without giving a child up for adoption -- but I guess a lawyer who did n't go to law school ca n't be expected to challenge that.Aside from the facepalm-worthy factual errors , this book is just tedious to read . Shawna is so thoughtless and dumb that she brings the vast majority of her problems upon herself . The other characters are just like cardboard cutouts surrounding her . Conrad and his mother are too evil to be believed and the various friends that Shawna makes along the way are just too good to be true while also inexplicably falling by the wayside when she actually needs help.Nobody really talks or acts like a real person . It was unclear why Conrad wanted a family so much and why he had to have a sixteen-year-old as his girlfriend . It was also unclear why Shawna would go along with this when she love him so little that she fell for the first guy who asked her out on a lunch date.Everything about this book is purely ridiculous . Even if the editing issues were fixed , it is n't like reading a book set in the real world . I would only recommend this for hardcore readers of woe-is-me fiction who will accept a massively unrealistic tacked-on happy ending . Everyone else should avoid .	-1
It was complicate to follow the path of the plot , really have n't finished it yet ... total waste of space on my kindle	-1
I downloaded this e-book for free for my Kindle , and in the beginning , it was promising . But as the book went on I found it difficult to relate to any characters . The plot was alright , and I did not think it was intriguing enough . I finished the novella , and did not want to know more about the ultimate fate of the characters . It was boring .	-1
I read a lot of romance novels - I 've read a lot of bad romance novels , but I usually finish whatever I am reading . This book was so tiresome and boring that I started randomly skipping pages around the middle of the book . For whatever reason , I wanted some sort of resolution so I skimmed my way to the end . But what a tiresome read ... .I thought Roxy was ridiculous and over the top . Reading the constant descriptions of her clothing and how over the top it was , made me wonder why she did n't call in Dolly Parton to model for her . I did n't like Roxy , her mother or Zayne 's mother . Zayne was tolerable but really ? A modern day tomoato farmer living 10 minutes from Nashville ? I had a hard time accepting any of this book ... .	-1
Oh for heavens sake . I did my best to finish this book , I could not do it . Halfway into it I quit . Page after page of what people were wearing and what the furniture was like and what the pictures on the walls looked like . Life is to short to try and get through this book . Find something better to do .	-1
I DID mange to finish The Home , but it was such a slog for me . I think it was only my stubborness that kept me reading , the feeling you get when you 're in a competition of some sort and you want to quit but you tell yourself that you 're going to make it to the end no matter what . The characters were fine - although her hero was too fixated on Clint Eastwood for me - and the underlying premise was interesting , but I just found it painfully slow and the ending was unsatisfying to me . Many people liked it more than I , so I hope that if you try it , your experience is closer to theirs than to mine .	-1
I was reading it ... and reading it ... put it down for a while ... went back to it . Put it down and downloaded two other books and have read and finished them while this one is still waiting to be finished . Perhaps as a whole when and if I get back to it , will be a good read . But for now it was pretty slow and did n't really make me want to keep reading it . A little disappointed in that regard but I have n't written it off yet . So fair warning , you may have to force yourself to continue .	-1
This book and Book one could have been done in one book and also been done in a small book . I guess the idea of the plot was good but oh my oh my did we go through way too many endless tunnels , doorways , etc etc etc . There were also so many times that the main character would learn something or receive something that you thought would be important later in the story to only have that whole chapter become non relevant later . Tedious I guess is the word . Sorry , Brian . BTW this is Linda and not Carlisle who read the first book and only half of this one .	-1
I just have a really hard time reading about a timid character that immediately turns bossy . Maybe I 'll try to finish later .	-1
I MUST NOT HAVE READ THE SAME BOOK OTHERS DID I FELT THIS BOOK MOVED SLOWLY THEN , HAD A LITTLE BURST AND THEN WENT TO A VERY SLOW PACE AGAIN I WAS SO BORED I QUITE AT 65 % AND I NEVER DO THAT !	-1
I read the first book in this series of books . The first one had a bit of sexual descriptions , by the thoughts of Hatshepsut about some characters . It was as if she was having fantasies about different men and graghics descriptions of about buildings and statues was worse than the first book . I was hoping it would n't get worse than the first book , but was worse . These could be good books if the author was less graphic . Other authors have done a great job with her life without all the sexual stuff .	-1
What 's that suppose to be ? Terrible spare your time do n't waste it on these couple of pages . Sorry written ...	-1
This `` book '' was the biggest waste . It reads like a bad word vomit stream of consiousness that is on whatever charlie sheen is on . > disgusted & lt ;	-1
This short story did n't have a purpose . I would n't recommend reading unless you are extremely bored . I gave it a 2 because I did n't find any grammatical errors like some books I have read .	-1
This story was about a sixteen year girl , Hailey Trosclair , who did n't seem to have much direction in life . She basically hung out with your older Brother Cyrus , and another girl named Meridian . She was a product of depressed mother and wayward father , so they did not pay much attention to her nor guide her . She eventually tries to get attention by trying to act older than she was and making some foolish decisions.I ca n't say that I enjoyed this book . Usually after I read a book , something stays with me in a form of a theme , message or just event . In this book , I am unclear of what the main objective was . I feel that the title does not connected with the actually story nor the characters . The writing style was okay for the most part , but the ending felt really rushed.This book did not provide a sense of closure for me . There did not seem to be a real resolution for the main characters . I would have liked a little more development/explanation for setup by Moses , and why he picked Cyrus as his avenger.In the end , this book left me feeling frustrated and let down . I did not get what the author was trying to communicate with his story . Maybe if I read it again , I will see the big picture .	-1
Not exactly the kind of book I usually read . It was very gritty , very dark . If it had been a bit longer more could have been developed in terms of characters , plots - just some tying-up of loose details maybe . While I did n't particularly enjoy it as much as I enjoy most books , it was n't bad , but the warning ( on smashwords ) was very correct - this is not a book for young people . It seemed quite realistic in terms of characters reacting to their situation and difficult circumstances - not the picture of perfection or someone you 'd want to be like but very real in desperation . I liked the title .	-1
I found this book to be so far fetched it was n't funny ! I prefer to read stories which are plausible . I also think that the heroine was as thick as two short planks !	-1
The book was good at first and I do like her others but mutilating animals and blatant cruelty I do not want to hear descriptions of or have it so detailed as to which were strays and which were house pets . Gruesome .	-1
Not my cup of tea , plus the idea of Christian angels being bewitched by witches twists all my beliefs , the book centred too much on the desires of the characters than on an actual plot .	-1
The female character annoyed me so I did n't finish it . Not worth finishing . Wish I had n't got it . On to the next .	-1
Well , maybe not even that long , since when the Kindle hit around 84 % it ended , and the rest was a preview of the next book . That 's OK , though -- since I 'd had enough sex scenes by then . Do n't get me wrong , the sex scenes were the good parts . Although the writing style was pretty good , the story was just shallow , sorry to say . ( Spoiler ) Not so good parts : No real plot . Of all the reasons why a Dark Angel is called to dole out vengeance , enabling a woman to get even with a cheating ex-boyfriend does n't seem quite important enough . But maybe that 's just me.No real character development . She 's supposed to be a powerful Witch in her own right , so why should she need an Angel to help her get even with her Ex ? He 's an Angel who is bored sitting around the Underworld waiting for the Devil to give him an assignment . So , of course , he 's thrilled when a sad Witch needs his help . And what does he do to to give her the revenge that she craves ? He beats the guy up . Yep , I 'm not kidding.No real world building . Witches , Angels , Devil ... ..but no background on any hows or whys of the rules in regard to humanity . If it 's that easy to get your hands on a sexy winged hunk , there should have been a lot of happy women in that world.So the Witch and the Dark Angel end up falling in love and having lots of sex . The Witch gives the Angel a more permanent assignment by wishing that he stay with her forever . Done . End of story . Now you do n't have to read it . You 're welcome .	-1
Apollyon , the angel of death , has been guarding the bottomless pit of Hell for so long that he feels forgotten ; that is until a beautiful woman summoned him . Serenity is n't just another woman , but a witch . She did n't mean to summon someone so powerful . It was supposed to be a simple vengeance spell that called to him . Even though the attraction is immediate , she does n't believe an angel could be attracted to a simple human , at least not sexually . Surprise.As Apollyon exacts revenge on Serenity 's ex-boyfriend , the two become lovers . Problem is , when his mission is up , will she be able to summon him again or will he have to go back to the gates of Hell ? When it comes to reviewing books , I feel the rating and opinion is subjective . Some books , hit home . With `` Her Dark Angel , '' I did n't feel a connection with the characters or the story . Surprising , since I love this subgenre . I 'd like to try another series by this author though . Maybe I 'll find the connection I 'm looking for .	-1
There is a lot of sexy scenes and some story . I found it semi boring and predictable . Sorry it was lacking .	-1
After reading Ms. Heaton 's Vampire Realm series ( at least to the 5th book ) I thought I would try her `` Angel '' series . I must say , I 'm glad I only spent .99 on this waste of 2.5 hours of my time . There was absolutely no rhyme or reason to how things began with the main characters . ( Again , I do NOT summarize what I 've read in order for those who are reading reviews to get the whole story in a summary , which is actually kind of hard to do in this case ! ) The story line is so weak and has gaping holes it , I was left scratching my head asking myself what the heck was going on since there was n't much explanation for anything ! There was no conflict , there was no climax , there was no reason left to even WANT to read a second book in this series . The book itself was short enough to be a short story , and in my opinion , if they 're all this short , they should be grouped together in one book and sold that way . I will NOT be continuing on with this series as this book just did n't check even half my boxes . Sorry Ms. Heaton , I 've read better from you . Total disappointment .	-1
I do not know exactly why , but I was n't hooked by this book and it was sort of flat . The story was predictable and there was a lack of action .	-1
Fast , lack of plausibility , flat , unemotional characters from which I got little . All around , not thrilled . Very glad I did not spend money on this , and not recommending it to anyone . Unless that someone wants no plot , no reality , and a bit of mindless smut .	-1
I do not like this kind of book either . At least I am expanding my reading . I have a different views of what I think angels are and do and this certainly is n't one of my views . Although I 'm not a prude I thought there was a little too much lust and sex for this to be a really good story.Sorry , I did try to like it .	-1
There was no real story . She calls to him , he is an angel in Hell she 's a witch . Then they have sex , again and again , etc , he beats up an old boyfriend , they have sex , more sex , etc , that 's it.The end . I will not continue series .	-1
Though this was a free download which purported to be perfect for fairy tale lovers , it turns out to be a kind of sickening representation of Rumpelstiltskin and some woman of ill repute . I just could n't get interested , so quit reading in the middle of the second chapter . Perhaps I should have read on further , but I felt like I was wasting time on a not so happily ever after tale .	-1
Slow read . Very slow . Only for Elvis fanatics . This book mainly refers to a what if situation concerning Elvis . It is not a mystery .	-1
This book has some very good bones , so to speak . It however , is too short to allow the reader to develope a vested interest in the two parties involved . Carson is just so sure of things , and one minute Ruby is not staying and next she is ... . And then she is staying and all is well . Did I miss something ... .	-1
Based on the excellent reviews , I decided to get this book . The beginning was promising , although shallow . But , shortly into the story in turned into someone 's erotic , but sadistic fantasy . I was not sure , so skipped ahead and did not get any better . I was so offended by the tenet in the writing , that I has to stop reading . I am not a prude and have read erotic novels , but the sadistic allusions were just beyond me .	-1
This free short story just did n't do it for me . I found it rather awkward actually and it shows that guys think more with their lower head than the one on top of their shoulders . It was written well enough , but I think the author could have done a little bit more with it . If there was a second book , I would understand . But there is n't , so I just do n't know what to think.Ryan , a single man , divorced twice , is lacking some love in his life . That is until he finds a note on his car , receives a Facebook message and a creepy phone call from some random girl named ` M. ' They end up having phone sex . I ca n't imagine what kind of guy would do that with someone he does n't even know . Then he decides to meet up with her and have sex in a pitch black room . I shook my head when the guy showed up to the sleazy motel . I thought this was going to be a good erotica gone bad . Sort of like a praying mantis taking off her mates head while they have sex . But that did n't happen . I think the book would have been better if that happened - just saying.This story is basically phone sex , then crappy real sex . Would I recommend you ask ? No . That 's all .	-1
This was the most benign/dull menage story I 've read . With menage as the premise , you sort of expect a minimum level of titillation , do n't you ? Perhaps this is menage for the faint of heart . That seems a contradiction but it 's the only explanation that occurs to me .	-1
Reading the description of this book , I felt it had great promise , but unfortunately it fell flat . There was so much that could have been done better , so much more I would have loved to have known about the unique situation the heroine found herself in . The cheesy , campy language of the heros made this story anything but erotic romance . Way too many `` yehaws '' and `` wooweees '' made the book more ridiculous than anything else . I honestly ca n't recommend this book to anyone . The only reason it got 2 stars from me was because there were very few typos and editorial mistakes than in other books I 've read .	-1
I started reading it but quit because I really did n't like it . I guess it just was n't my cup of tea .	-1
There were a lot of interesting characters , in fact maybe too many . The ancillary characters were given a little too much significance , causing the need to bring too many pieces into the final closure . Just as a movie would n't seem real without the `` extras '' , neither would a good book . However , when a clerk in a convenience store says , '' May I help you ? '' in a movie , the director does n't bring the clerks history into the movie . Ms Outroggeg gives far too much background on each person introduced and it leaves you rather confused at times . It also calls for some unbelievable endings to the assorted storylines . the main story was really good , but all the clutter sort of ruined the book for me .	-1
While this book had some redeeming qualities , the best being the friendship between Jasmine and Wiley/Rihlia , I just can not get past the fact that ( slight spoiler ) the male protagonist/love interest feels that it is all right to restrain and touch the heroine in a sexual manner even though she is furious and telling him no . Sorry , but that 's rape . Even if she gets turned on , it 's still a form of sexual assault . And we 're supposed to root for them after that ? It left a sick feeling in my stomach .	-1
I did n't exactly like this book but I did n't hate it either . It is very long without any real story going on . The Character 's are n't consistent and neither is the plot . Here are my problems with it:1 . Jasmine ( the heroine ) she starts off seeming strong and independent . Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky . Then she 's back to acting strong again . She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2 . Keilan ( her love interest ) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning . He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so . He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again . It 's very confusing who these people are and what they are about . There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre did n't seem to fit what was actually in the book . Yes there is some romance , there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book . I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one . She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene does n't always feel like the same book . Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book . I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel . Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book . Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4 . OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities ( can seduce shifter men with her scent basically ) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess . Why should we , as the reader , care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself ? I 'm not sure about that answer . Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense . Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning , is suddenly forgotten after the first & # 34 ; molesting scene & # 34 ; then she 's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants . What was the point of that ? ? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just did n't fit in . But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think ? ? I 'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this . Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell , there were things about it I liked . Things I did n't like and things that just did n't make sense to me . There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it . I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it more structure . She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing . I will not be following the series but I enjoyed most of the journey in this book .	-1
Damn . I bought this after really enjoying the Spark series.Big mistake.I stopped after the first escape attempt was followed by the first episode of sexual degradation.Writing like this perpetuates and reinforces the notion that women like to be kidnapped and raped.What answer would you get from the latest escapees in Cleveland , among so many other unfortunate women who have been kidnapped into sex slavery ? You should be ashamed of yourself , Ms Dawn - especially as you can write much , much better than to use this cheapest of cheap tricks for so-called `` romance '' .I wo n't buy any more of your books .	-1
Very dissapointed . Let me start by saying , that I really like this author . I love the darklands , the Golden Bell not so much , but the rest I really enjoyed . So despite the fact , that I usually do not like Sci-fi spaceadventures I took a chance ... .. and wasted my money . And it is not because of the setting . I finished the book but skipped parts here and there to get it over with . Skye and Jaide are really not likeable , there is hardly any tangible tension between them and the great dialogues seen in the Charmer is noticeably missing . And why does all the women have to be impregnated in the books and in such an offensive manner in this book ? I am sorry , but it is not realistic at all , that a woman would just shrug her shoulders by being impregnated against her will . Add to that the fact that all seem to be lying to Jaide and she at some point apologises for having trust issues with Skye because of his and the others ' lies is really beyond me . Also a lot of her actions seems to stem from something I can not pick up . Is i supposed to be stubborness ? I do like the dominant male characters and I can be very forgiving of their previous actions as long as there is some growth and change in the characters that makes a happy end believable . This was not the case in this book I am sorry to say .	-1
I like sentences with a subject and a verb -- in fact , those are the two essential ingredients for a string of words to be called a sentence . I do n't mind chopped up bits in dialogue , but this book contains too many narrative passages with phrases passing as sentences . & # 34 ; White chocolate eyes with dark chocolate irises. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Set him down and started another. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; Perfect. & # 34 ; These are not sentences , and every time I came across one of these it jerked me out of the story and made me wonder what sort of editing the book had received.I found the book 's premise implausible as well . Mysteries create a puzzle that must be solved with the clues that the author hides in the story . A magic box and special powers belong in fantasy writing , not in a mystery set in modern America , unless you wish to create a magic world existing alongside or within our normal , non-magical one -- like the Harry Potter books . The author gives no rationale for magic of any kind , and it throws off the whole equation -- it 's a cheap way to cheat . I did n't finish the book .	-1
This novel seems to have gone unedited - not even an MSWord grammar check . Inconsistencies abound ( slides a clip into a revolver ; buys some fries and then tosses the empty donut bag into the trash , et al. ) . Hyperbolic prose that REALLY needs trimming . I will give the rough outline of the plot a decent score but in the telling , it gets muddled . Too many Nancy Drew moments for grown-up fiction . Also , the general tone is a `` dark and stormy night . '' A theme - small towns have bad things going on under the otherwise placid surface - is not a bad way to go , but elements of the story ( the porn , Bobby Lee , et al . ) get introduced and then go unresolved . For 99 cents , fine .	-1
Trite story , poorly edited . Before you write anything about firearms most people would do some basic research . An experienced police officer would never give a family member a small caliber like an.25 . Smith and Wesson never made a .25 cal revolver . A revolver loads by a cylinder . A semi-automatic loads by a clip .	-1
A middle aged fool drinks and oggles young women . He has a problem with making decisions . He rakes the women with his eyes . He drinks some more . This goes on endlessly . Nothing else happens except toward the end the ground tilts.It is supposed to be funny . I never cracked a smile . If I am very bad , I suspect that in the afterlife I will be condemned to read nothing but novels like this one , endlessly . I better be good.I do n't understand the five star reviews . I could say maybe it 's me , but I do n't really think so.The writing is smooth and professional . Two stars for that .	-1
I received this as a free book offer on BookBub . I probably would n't have purchased without that offer . Nothing spectacular .	-1
I liked the change of not being a skinny girl but the story is rather short and only has one major love piece . The story is different but still cliche .	-1
As another reviewer said , I was expecting some heartwarming stories and these were n't . There were one or two but the rest of the stories that I read ( I did n't finish the book ) I found to be written by whiny people who were n't thankful they had a place to go on Thanksgiving and never thought about hosting Thanksgiving either .	-1
I have read his other books - Samantha Moon series etc . - and I ca n't believe this is written by the same author . The story seems to start promisingly but quickly unravels . The characters are one dimensional and the description of their adventures seems fantastical and not credible at all . I labored to finish this book .	-1
My first and last Rain book . I did find the subject matter interesting . However the writing style was tough to take .	-1
I have been enjoying Mr . Rain 's books but this one is the exception . The first half was OK and had me suitably captured . Then I ran into , what I consider to be , a fatal flaw . Mr . Rain did a drastic POV change . As with all his other books , this one started out in first person . Half way through the book he started sections of third person POV in order to follow Faye , the heroine/love interest . Further along he split again to Farid '' s POV in order to show the fight between Farid and Kaseem . I 'm sorry , but I just felt that this was poor writing practice . There is nothing wrong with changing POV as such , but going from first to third along with that -- -not good ! I also had trouble suspending disbelief on some of the mountaineering in this book . I do n't think Mr . Rain knows or cares about such realities as hypothermia . I also found the helicopter sequence unbelievable . A helicopter is much more complicated to fly than a fixed wing . Having the girl just hold the cyclic does n't cut it.The character of Sam Ward seemed like a very watered down version of Jim Knighthorse . I did n't feel like Sam was his own character , so to speak.Hopefully , Mr . Rain will continue to write books about his Vampire Detective and Jim Knighthorse . Those I look forward to .	-1
It was available for free on kindle so I just bought the book . The book has two many words that make no sense at all . The story seems complicated and going nowhere . I felt a bit disappointed . Not recommended .	-1
This is the story of a post ( and continuing ) apocalyptic planet with space stations as places people live to escape the planet Earth . Great idea overall.There are action bits , bombs , running , killing , evil plots and good people . So , there is a lot to the story . Too much in fact . The insertion of everything imaginable ( life , death , human engineering , enhanced people , natural people , alien types , mystical types , mutants , ghosts , goddesses , men plotting overthrow of government , Marshall law , love story , sex , nuclear war , space travel and fights , supernatural events and so on ) . Due to so many plot devices , the story flow was rushed , overdone in some spots , incomplete in others . And led to a lot of jumping around in tale that really ( while ended ) did not flow in cohesive /cogent manner with regard to story arc development overall.The contridictions of characters was just conveniently explained away without direction . Just plopped into story via a tell vehicle when needed as was not in keeping with initial characterizations at onset of meeting character . Or , not explained at all ( why not all girls or women who met the goddess did not have hair color change - just two ? Why only one of those two branded with tattoo ? Those type inconsistencies never addressed . We just need accept them ... ) . The guy was pretty accepting of kiss without real reason behind it . `` No reason honey ? Oh , well then , okay . Come on over and kiss me now . '' ( Um , not so much believable ) . There were many such contrived bits that seemed like author started something and just was unable to come up with continuation or plausible conflict resolution.I think many will forgive the stilted pacing and the contrived conveniences due to novelty of premise . I am not induced to purchase further installemnts as the writing ( while interesting premise ) was really not that good . A run through for correcting errors related to grammar and punctuation would be beneficial.Christine	-1
What a pat on the back for homosexuality ! The main theme of this book is repeated many times. `` There is nothing wrong with being gay '' . Tell that to Jesus but He ai n't buying it !	-1
This is an OK story for the teenager market , but I got the feeling that the author was writing for adults . That is kind of sad.The story is entirely unremarkable , and very un-Stephen King in the approach . There is no psychological drama , there is no suspense , there is really nothing . The characters are stereotypical and flat ; lots more development could make the story more interesting.This is not adult fiction but might fit well into the teen horror group .	-1
Short story that I probably would have enjoyed if it had focused more on suspense and a lot less on senseless acts of violence . Story was n't very logical either , like another reviewer stated , it made no sense to me for the park ranger to urge people to go stay in the cabin when the rumblin ' started , especially since he knew what the rumblin ' brought out in people .	-1
I have read the Bubba books and the Mascara books and rated them 5 stars . C. L. Bevell ( or should I say Lt. Cupcake ) writes an autobiography of her time in the service . I did time in the service . I did time in wal-mart . I did time as a university professor . They were all pretty much the same . `` Sometimes everyone around me appears to be crazy except me and thee , and sometimes I wonder about thee '' . I found it boring . She did the best to do character development . Some of them were pretty good . Dr Goodspeed was good . He was my office partner five years ago . Capt . Roy was good he was really Col. Muffett from my long ago army experience . Lt. Cupcake has to be C.L Bevell .	-1
I can handle far-fetched , and I love most vampire stories that I read , but this story along with its prequel , fell terribly short . While it was a short story , it felt painfully slow to get through and at times made very little sense . The characters are copies of other popular vampires and fairy stories like Twilight and the Sookie Stackhouse series , and then the author overdoes it with the religious aspects . In one paragraph the concept of `` being Christian '' was mentioned about 4 times , and I just do n't see how it added anything to the story . In fact it took away for me , because I got tired of the characters dilemma with religion when the premise of fairies and vampires are somewhat the opposite of religious , it just got to a point of annoyance for me . The explanation was never given for why the religion was so integral to the story , and the writing was so terrible that I skim read the prequel because I could n't stand the grammatical errors and ridiculous religious connotations . I know this is a series so hopefully the author will improve , or include some clarification , I just wo n't be reading any further in this series to find out.Reviewed by Gabi for Book Sake .	-1
This books is about 4,000 words . A nice love story with ups and downs , but I feel that it started and ended way to quickly .	-1
None of the characters seemed believable to me or frankly , even very likable . Also , having two thirty-something people constantly reiterate how terrified they were of the mother was just ridiculous . I also could n't understand how the main goal in the mother 's life was to get her daughters married ; it just did n't ring true . Also , the bride 's hysterical behavior , which everyone indulges , added to the unbelievability of the story . I do n't want to point out what I found wrong about the villain because that would spoil the plot . Another big detractor to the story was the very poor editing which really hindered the flow of the story . I did manage to finish the story but I would n't recommend it to anyone else .	-1
I told a friend I would read this author . I 've been told this is one of her first books and her writing gets better . My problem with this book is that I ca n't read past the poor editing . It takes me out of the story and I find myself highlighting problems instead of great quotes .	-1
MATE SET by Laurann Dohner.STORY BRIEF : Most humans are unaware that werewolves are living in their community . Mika is a human who was adopted by Omar 's sister . She knows Omar is a werewolf and keeps the secret . She lives in California but visits Omar for a few weeks a year . Omar loves her and is protective of her . This year she unknowingly visits during werewolf mating season . Large numbers of werewolves visit the area and will rape her if they get the chance . Omar asks Grady to live with Mika for two weeks to protect her from the males . Grady is sexually drawn to Mika but wo n't touch her because of her uncle 's threats . A rival clan member wants Mika and tells Grady he will take her unless she is marked by Grady . To avoid a werewolf war and save Mika , Grady is forced to mark her . Now that she is marked he must have frequent sex with her or go insane . She likes it.REVIEWER 'S OPINION : This was pretty good at the start . I liked the following conversation ( at 380 ) . Omar 's girlfriend Minnie is talking . `` I was mated when I was younger and it sucked . Being mated pretty much makes you a damn slave that a mated man thinks he owns lock , stock , and barrel . He orders you around and treats you like property because you are his . It 's in their damn blood when they mate to take it to the extreme . '' I also liked a cute scene in which Omar is going to assign a guard to Mika based on which man looks at her body the least . Mika did n't want a guard so she dressed as sexy as possible . This caused some gaping expressions.But as the story progressed I became more and more disappointed . The main conflicts between the two were based on inaccurate assumptions and vague communication . Mika was falling in love with Grady , but he did n't reciprocate . Mika felt rejected because she knew he wanted a werewolf for a mate . She was angry at Grady for various `` assumed '' reasons . The major conflict causing her to leave was based on hearing Grady talk about someone else and thinking he was talking about her . When Grady tried to explain she refused to listen . In fact she threatened him with something if he even talked to her . Thus he was forced to be quiet and not explain anything . This was such a cheap device to extend the conflict I was angry . It overshadowed the good writing from earlier in the book and I had to lower the stars . There was an odd scene near the end with Grady 's brother wanting Mika . I was n't sure if this was true or if he was trying to make Grady jealous . That felt thrown in and not developed enough by the author.I would have preferred the author show how Grady 's feelings change during the book . We do n't see how or why he fell in love with Mika . We do know he did n't want her in the beginning - other than for sex.The sex scenes were pretty good . There were a lot of them.DATA : Ebook story length : about 3 hours . Kindle count story length : 3587 ( 309 KB ) . Swearing language : strong . Sexual language : strong . Number of sex scenes : 15 . Setting : current day city of Bartock . Copyright : 2010 . Genre : paranormal romance .	-1
Mika goes every year to visit her uncle , he and most of the town happen to be shifter . She ends up going during the mating season get attacked and saved by Grady . Her uncle assigns him to guard her and he ends up marking her . This forces them to stay together during the mating season and they end up falling for each other . This book is an erotica book ; it lives up to that title and is good in that aspect . That being said I had problems with the girl , she does some pretty idiotic things and I just wanted to smack her . She knows it 's mating season and yet she still goes out at night and is surprised when she is attacked . She throws a fit about getting out of the house and forces Grady to mark her , and then she gets mad that he did it . I thought that Mika acted like a spoiled brat the entire book . Grady had the emotional maturity of a turnip . I wanted more of a story line from this book than was provided . However since erotica books are not about the story line , I have to give the author props . She did write steamy sex scenes and she did try to have a plot , the plot just sort of fell flat to me .	-1
I love Ms. Dohner 's other series , so I decided to try this one and was seriously disappointed.The heroine ( human ) comes to a were town while the mating heat season is in full swing . She 's unaware such thing happens so makes mistake , gets into trouble ( attempted gang rape ) and is saved by the hero . So far so good . Then being her uncle 's apple of the eye , she get 's a bodyguard , ta-dam , the same poor guy . He 's ordered to protect her and not to touch under the threat of being castrated.However , the heroine suddenly decides she wants to get in bed with him , even though she knows about her uncle 's orders , threats and character in general . When she does n't get what she wants , she starts behaving like a spoilt 5-year old brat trying to provoke the hero but gets into near-rape situation again . Then he has to mark her in order to get her out of this mess and she 's not happy the guy is n't over the moon about it.I 'm all for independent strong-willed assertive heroine but these qualities do not equal stupid stubbornness and creating mess all around you just to get what you want.Will try the second book in the series to see if it improves , probably , or will just wait for next New Species book .	-1
I was really enjoying the story until suddenly the human girls are not human at all . This shift happened so suddenly that I really felt the author got to a dead end , didnt know where to go , so she made the girls non-humans to wrap it up . Maybe if the witch at the beginning had given as speach welcoming everyone and warning them that life as they know it was about to drastically change ; their beliefs about themselves and their very nature , would never be the same ... At least I would know that the story was not just slapped together . I would actually be trying to figure out what was going to change . I will not be continuing with this series .	-1
My question is , what happened ? ? The incident with the connection and trying to find her I was like holy cow this is getting gd even thou it took some time to get the book going and then it was blah . How ? You were going so gd ! I stopped at 32 % in hopes that it would pick up again but I just could n't continue . I might pick it up in the future because so many people could n't be so hooked when I seem to have slipped off ... Oh well , I guess it was n't my cup of tea . Wo n't discourage anyone and come on..it 's FREE . Gd read for those that want anything mildly interesting to read .	-1
Veiled eyes was just not what I wanted it to be . The beginning started off strong but , progressively went down hill . The romance that I needed to make the story really come together was n't there . The author by just tells you that they are in each other 's head and now they love each other . I wanted to like it but I did n't , sorry .	-1
This book supposedly has all the answers but is not for anyone but a pc expert . I need a book to tell me what this book says.If you are not computer savvy do n't buy this book .	-1
. NO SPOILERS or plot summaries . Recommendations included.HIGH LEVEL : Book 2 in the Wicked series that starts withWicked Sexy : Wicked , Book 1that is set in a world of witches ( Magians ) who mate into threesomes . A fun premise from a talented author , I 'm excited to see where the series goes ... but not thrilled so far . This book was a disappointment all around . If this was another author , perhaps a new author , I might give it 3 stars , but because it 's Alexander I 'm giving it 2 because we all know she can do better in her sleep . If you are n't familiar with her work yet- PLEASE do n't start here ! I would n't want you to get the wrong idea ! Maybe her Children of the Goddess series linked below.PLOT : There really was n't any coherent plot- just a series of unfortunate events . The pacing was choppy . There was no build up of of tension- sexual or otherwise . Kidnapping is a tough angle to work into a romance . It takes skill to create an opportunity for a girl to forgive that kind of thing , but here there was no compelling reason for Harrison to do so . ( Kresley Cole and Gena Showalter are two authors who excel at turning that kind of thing around . ) I 'm not even sure I understood what the hell happened during the resolution of the main conflict . Harrison 's extreme need for independence was never properly embraced . It was as if this was merely a ploy to get the story started and then turned into a trivial event- perhaps even a childish one . I was really disappointed in that aspect.ROMANCE : There was no development along these lines either . Three attractive people ... some hot , but quick sex ... a few paragraphs of back story to give them each a little history ... then BAM , all of a sudden happily ever after ? No working together , no winning each other over , no endearing moments ? Nope , not feeling it- which is a real shame because I usually love the threesome set up . This had potential over book 1 because unlike book 1 , the men here were romantically involved with each other.CHARACTERS : What characters ? Were there characters , because I might have missed that ... Sarcasm aside , our girl Harrison had a lot of potential and I felt like the lack of plot stomped all over her . Jacob and Ric were little more than spoiled , arrogant underwear models with magic . Not even sure if either of them had jobs or hobbies.BOTTOM LINE : This was n't offensive , but barely worth reading . There are still some fun moments here , but overall a disappointment . If you are a fan of Alexander , then I recommend just reading it because I STILL have faith this series will get better.RECOMMENDATIONS:1 . R.G . Alexander 's steamy vampire/were/witch romance series : Regina in the Sun ( Children of the Goddess ) 2 . Moira Rogers ' magically diverse romance seriesCrux : Southern Arcana , Book 13 . Anya Bast'sWitch Fire ( Elemental Witches , Book 1 ) - sweet , sexy para-romance with witches , demons and more4 . Dana Marie Bell'sDare to Believe ( The Gray Court ) - sexy para-romance with all manner of fae : Sidhe , dragons , leprechauns , vampires and more.5 . Kresley Cole 's adventurous and intricate magical romance series ( never mind the ridiculous title ) : A Hunger Like No Other ( Immortals After Dark , Book 1 ) 6 . Jacquelyn Frank'sJacob ( The Nightwalkers , Book 1 ) - demons , were , vamps and other fae finding their better halves in races that should be the enemy7 . Larissa Ione'sPleasure Unbound ( Demonica , Book 1 ) - demon centric romance series that sets up a demon-run hospital under a human city . Not as well written as the others.8 . Sherrilyn Kenyon'sFantasy Lover- Dark Hunter series with shifters , vamps and Greek gods . The first book is not as good as the rest- it just gets better and better.9 . J.R. Ward'sDark Lover ( Black Dagger Brotherhood , Book 1 ) - also darker , more violent and incredibly intense vampire romance series . Vampires protect the world from evil . Vivid glimpses into the evil perspective as well.10 . Lara Adrian 's Kiss of Midnight ( The Midnight Breed , Book 1 ) - also darker , more violent , but incredibly intense . Vampires protect the world from their evil brethren .	-1
I 'm so disappointed in this book ! I like Lori Brighton , and her characters but the story telling in this book was way off . I liked the characters but I did n't ... I do not recommend this book at all , along with the heroine Ashley you 're confused because no one is telling her the information she is supposed to know . I did n't even finish reading the book because I just could n't take the story line anymore , and at more than 50 % read I had already invested too much time in a disappointing story line .	-1
I have to agree with many other reviewers that the leading lady was a complete idiot . She was so annoying that I could n't tolerate more nonsense after reading 27 % of the book . If it had n't been free , I 'd be angry . Even though it did n't cost me anything more than time , I 'm sorry I wasted that !	-1
Very rare do I find myself not finishing a book . Unfortunately I decided that this one just did n't hold my attention . I did however do my best and read up to 92 % but while searching Amazon I found that there was other books I 'd rather read , so I put this one down & have decided I 'm in no hurry to pick it back up and finish that last 8 % anytime soon.There was allot of pages that were filled with just ... ... .useless story telling . a few little stories all in there that just did n't mesh together . Like she had 100 different ideas and used them all but had no real thought to why they should go together . You can try and put chemistry and romance in a book but for a reader to actually feel it ... .well Lori missed it on this on ! !	-1
Too much unnecessary dialogue that does n't move the story along . No real plot . Flat , unlike able characters across the board . A little bit of lust but fleeting and forgotten among the confusion and no build up for romance by 80 % . And the heroine still does n't know her true role in the events to come . Too drawn out and boring to be entertaining for me . I gave up with the impression it was not going to get better .	-1
As I read I kept hoping it would get better and I would get hooked but I finally had to put it down about 1/4 of the way through . I could n't finish reading - I just did n't like it . It was too modern for me .	-1
I suspect J.R . Rain is a nom de plume for 20 creative writing graduate students who knock out the different series attributed to J. R. Rain . The output and shallowness of content indicate a text factory of some kind.Jim Knighthorse series was OK . I might read the next in that series.The Vampire with the Dragon Tattoo was just stupid . The main character sounds like he was put together using a random list of attributes . None of the characters really breathed . I wo n't be buying any more of those.I also suspect if Kindle did n't exist neither would J.R . Rain .	-1
A little over the top . The characters seem shallow . I did n't think it was that great . It just stopped abruptly at the end .	-1
This was a horrible book . Every character , even the ones that did n't matter , was described in excessive detail . The main characters never really interact . The book suddenly ends after taking a very bizarre turn . Do not waste your time reading this .	-1
I confess that I did not get very far into this story before I deleted it from my Kindle.In this day and age , there is absolutley no excuse whatsoever for bad spelling and atrocious grammar in ANY written work . There is no reason to have a hy-phenated word in the middle of a line ... see that example . Things like that annoy me no end ( I should have been a proof-reader ... I know that I would have done a much , much better job ) , and to that end , I just pushed the button.Honestly , I think the story could have been good ... I would n't have bought it otherwise.If I had to give it a mark out of 10 ? The answer would be a 2 . Frankly , I 'm embarrassed for the author . Shame ! !	-1
Not sure what to say about this book . For me , it was certainly and totally not believable . No one could have so `` narrow misses '' . It stretched the imagination way too far . A woman has to be fairly naive or stupid to travel to Guatemala alone .	-1
Made me incredibly uncomfortable . Was not a romance . Was more like a thriller where the protagonist is captured . Starved until he has no choice but to submit to his sociopathic ex . Because he & # 34 ; needs & # 34 ; to be obedient and submissive to be & # 34 ; true & # 34 ; to himself . This is a mindfrack fantasy for every psycho ex who is sure they know whats best for someone else . Creepy . Non consensual . Not even in the fun way . Made me want to throw up actually . People writing like this give BDSM a bad name . Its not BDSM if you have to force someone into anything . Ugh . Seriously making me ill .	-1
Come on , too much of a good thing is not a good thing . Just cause someone strikes a hit with one genre , other authors try to cash in on the idea instead of being creative themselves .	-1
I love books with Native Americans as lead characters , but after reading a third of this book , I still did not feel engaged in the story . The prose is simplistic , there is little or no time spent on describing the place or characters and the plot did n't draw me in . I decided not to finish the story and moved on to something else . Some might find it worth the small price , but for me there are too many great books out there to continue with one that feels like a chore to get through .	-1
I did not understand this book from the cover it looks like ok ready grab your wine get in a corner and release your self will it did n't do it for me I was sooooooooo lost reading this that I could not even finish it	-1
AM NOT A READER OF FANTASY AND THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT NOW I KNOW THIS GENRE IS NOT FOR ME	-1
I just could not finish this book . In fact I read about 10 % of the book abd got so creeped out that I had to stop . Perhaps the out of body experience would have been interesting but when I started to read about the murderers I just got the chills and had to stop reading . This was just awful !	-1
I only read part of this book . I just could n't get into this story . Maybe you will ? I guess I just was n't in the mood to read a story like this when I got it .	-1
Jennifer Saints cobbled together a series of sex scenes and called it a romantic mystery.Thirty minutes before her wedding , the heroine is given a set of pictures showing her groom-to-be engaging in sex with a group of women . Naturally , she calls the wedding off , and as she is fleeing the scene , still wearing her wedding dress , who should appear but her teenage crush . She has n't seen him for twelve years , but he whisks her away , and they proceed to have sex as often as possible , preferably nude and outdoors on the deck of the hero 's beach house . It goes without saying that every time they have sex , it 's better than the last time . Unfortunately , there 's nothing there that we have n't read before , dozens of times , and that scene with the melted chocolate has been done so many times it was embarrassing to read it again.The book could also do with a good copy editor . It 's riddled with mistakes like `` daring-do '' for `` derring-do '' , `` me and you '' instead of `` you and I '' , and the hero wanting the heroine `` bad '' not badly . They are a real distraction from what little plot there is.Ms . Saints has done her homework , and manages to include almost all of the cliches for this genre . The heroine 's family is rich and evil . The hero 's is poor and good . His mother is a Wise Woman who rules her family of wild men with the iron hand in the velvet glove . Unfortunately , she has a lot of children , so this series can run on for a long time.Evidently , the paperback edition has some photographs in it that are supposed to enhance the story ( such as it is ) . They are n't in the Kindle Fire version , so I ca n't say anything about them.I got this book as a freebie , and it was over-priced . I would only recommend it to someone who is desperate .	-1
I guess I 'm in the minority here , that does n't really happen often but oh well ... I definitely liked the idea behind the story and I do like a little suspense with my romance . The lov'in was absolutely hot but there was too much of it ... I found for me the story seamed choppy and it did n't really flow all that well . This caused issues for me and I just could get on board and enjoy it : (	-1
first off , a castle in Alaska ? really ? I lived in Alaska for 7 years , believe me there are NO castles there.second , grandmother at 57. ok . I 've met some young grandmothers , those who had children really young . but lets not paint 57 as OLD ! third , I never got to the third , stopped reading .	-1
This book reads like a madlib ! Too many details , and the characters are generic and unrelatable . I would not recommend this book to anyone .	-1
I have read many books with in this genre . They seem to fall into two categories . Either they are well written , well thought out love stories that just happen to have more than one partner in the mix . ( Note : Maya Bank 's Colters ' series . ) Or the stories are like this book : The Perfect Union . Too quick with the declaration of love . Too quick agreeing to a relationship like the men were proposing , and too quick with the sex . Even the acceptance from friends and family seemed to be automatic , as if this type of relationship happened every day.It is obvious to me that the writer wanted to get the three together so that their sexual attraction can be written . I am a writer as well , so I believe I understand the motivation . She probably had a series of ideas she wanted to accomplish with the book . But I believe she rushed through them , as if doing so off of a check list . Situations have to be worked through carefully and slowly if they are to be believable.Finding love , especially after the death of someone that meant a lot to a person , is n't easy . Sure , there are those times when the sparks fly , but the widow or widower often feels squeamish about having another relationship . Add children to the mix and , I 'm sorry , they do n't have sex on the kitchen floor when their children are due home any minute . A mother will do what she can to shield her children and reassure them that they are what is most important to her.The way Rick and Conor are accepted by the children is believable , do n't get me wrong . They were in the boys ' lives since they were infants . The children never knew their father so having them around was normal to them . But I am only half way through the book , and no where did Calleigh wonder what their father would think bringing someone else ( or two someones ) into their lives as a father figure.I do n't understand Calleigh 's spouting of their relationship to strangers either . And the storyline about the coworker who thought he was her boyfriend was so unbelievable , especially since he was n't mentioned since the only date they had months before.As I said , I have only read half of this book . I have n't gotten to the part where Kevin 's parents show up , but I 'm sure it will be as the rest of the book is . Contrite and off of the same checklist.The prose is choppy . The conversations are more than choppy . I do n't feel that this story is anything more than a poor version of what can be found on one of the erotic story sites . I 'm sure that Ms. Lane had good intentions , but I feel that this story could have been so much more if it did n't seem as though it was rushed , and if it had more feelings in it . I guess what I am trying to say is that this story 'tells ' us what is happening . We do n't 'feel ' it . Just because it is written down , does n't mean that it is so . The reader has to feel the events unfold before she can believe that they are happening.I gave it one star instead of none because the sex scenes were believable , not contrived positions that only the author would see . I felt no passion between the three lovers , no angst , no real love and affection . All I have seen so far is sex.Yes , the sex is good . I will give it that . But please ... Nothing else is believable .	-1
I enjoy time travel tales , but not in the literary company of an annoyingly bitchy , clueless heroine whom we expect to be somewhat intelligent or perceptive about people . She 's a friggin ' psychologist by profession ! But she understands less than nothing about human behavior in either the present or past , and seems incapable of understanding this skill no matter how many times she 's slammed in the face with a learning experience . The hero from the past is sweet , but in a century where he would have been far more `` worldly '' about the opposite sex , he 's unbelievably clueless about his sexual allure . Aside from that , the story is too disjointed to hold together or tie together , and the sex is so random and unaffectionate that it 's hard to believe it would happen at all . The single star is based on hope : I 'd like to believe the author 's skills improved in later books .	-1
A short story . It is well written , yet lacks essence . The idea of a space colony and sleeper ships is not new , so it requires a really good plot to keep me interested . The plot is not very original . [ [ SPOILER ALERT ] ] Spaceship has been traveling for a long time because earth is over polluted ( this has been done before ) , they send a scout ship to find a landing spot for the colony ( not a new idea ) , { epic science fail for not sending a probe ahead to measure the density of the atmosphere } , atmosphere is too dense so scout ship crashes ( ships always seem to crash ) , everyone but the protagonist dies ( how new ... ) . Oh yeah , and then there is the fact that the scout ship needs an engineer in the engine room , that the engines have to open up for firing , and a whole other range of things that are not at all founded upon science , such as the simple fact that the spaceship should have been decelerating prior to the arrival at the planet . [ [ END SPOILER ALERT ] ] This story seems to be like most science fiction that is being written today , almost worthless.Story neither interesting nor innovative enough to get me to buy the other three novels in the trilogy ... And a word on the cover art . It is professionally designed , but it seems like the cover art of a horror novel , not a science fiction one.Overall a very disappointing novel , I would expect more from an author who has taught creative writing at Oxford .	-1
While I loved ( LOVED ! ) the Chaos Walking trilogy , I did n't like this story at all . The Viola in this story is more of a `` typical teenager '' than she is in the books -- all she did was whine , mope about , not appreciate what her parents and others did for her , and whine . Did I mention whine ? Because she sure did whine.Maybe younger folks are interested in reading about characters like that , but older ones might want to skip this ( even though it 's free ) .It is a YA book/story , so I 'm not blaming Ness for making her a realistic teenager , I 'm just saying that as an adult , it was no fun at all to read .	-1
This book had great potential . The writer seemed to point out a lot of legitimate problems with IR relationships . What went wrong with the book is it had too many issues . First , the lead lady Shauna was a woman who just could not make up her friggin ' mind about whether she was ashamed of being seen with Miles or not . And when they argued about it , never really set the issue straight as to where it would n't be thrown in her face again . Second , there so much negativity the relationship between Miles and Shauna could go no where but down . Shauna and Miles were constantly at war with each other except when it came to sex and that had been her main issue all along . If the two could n't make it a week without verbally sparring , then why be together ? And his off the side , eager Rita -- personally that character had me applauding only because she did n't care about anything but getting laid . IMO Miles was more reasonable than Shauna , who the reader is lead to believe is the more practical one . I felt there were too many details on the innerworkings of cable companies , too much on the white/black issue that was n't resolved between the couple , too much sex and bickering over indecisiveness along with a lack of development between Miles getting to know her daughter , Shauna dealing with finalizing her relationship with Mr . I'm-Too-Sexy-For-Myself Clarance and Celeste , who was n't supportive despite how the writer seemed to state otherwise . If I brought a man to meet a friend and she went off on him like Celeste did , no matter what color he was , she would have been on my bad side for a very long time . And the ending was done poorly . Why stop with Miles being attacked by dogs , Shauna searching and not finding him until reaching home where he 's sitting on the stoop waiting for her at which point everything is sunshine and lemonade between the two , the end . Huh ?	-1
This is not a cogent tale . In deecription it states this is a short to get rid of someone so that Elizabeth can go on with her life unencumbered with Devlin near . Then , stating one always ends up where they belong . Well , not really then - not if one character has to be rid of for the other to be with another . It felt like the author had the attachment to Devlin , not Elizabeth . Which allowed more sense to tale overall than the thoughts within.Devlin 's monologues were confusing at best in trying to convey the process to Elizabeth . He never succeeded fully and her decision was not made in full knowledge - even though it brought resolution for her . Though the resolution was a dissatisfacory conclusion overall . For , it is unclear he fulfilled his wish . And , rebirth would not disencumber the soul mate factor ( of reincarnation ) - rather it merely sets up a new generation of life of searching for missing piece . Many believing in reincarnatiin will be dissatisfied with the solution given here as sever as the souls are what is connected and reincarnated - not the bodies . I realize Devlin is a ghost and is found in a dream - however , that connect is as strong as merely feeling a presence ( unseen ) around a person.I can not say whether Elizabeth 's story outside this short finds resolution or not as I have not read the full the author alludes to . However , this short is a confusing and implausible resolution to author quandary of Devlin character as it stands for this piece she calls a stand alone.There were a number of errors that should not be found in a piece this short . It should be scrubbed free of punctuation and grammar errors.Christine	-1
Do n't bother reading this . The beginning is tedious with its repetition of the word dark which does n't accomplish an ominous tone . Instead it serves to make you want to skip the extra and unnecessary `` darks '' as you read . Just when you think the story finally gets going the writer ends it and then includes a social commentary about child abuse . Indeed an important issue but save yourself some time ... skip this story and donate to a child abuse prevention charity instead . ( I am giving this 2 stars for that reason only . Otherwise- it would be 1 . )	-1
this books works a little backwards ... they are already dating and then it works into how Hanna got to this time ... this was again ... over the top , he is badly disfigured with all the battle scars on his face and is willing to get his face fixed bcuse he loves her so much and think that she deserves a handsome man..she loves him so much that she is willing to cut up her own face to be with him ? ? ? uh ! ! who does that ... and this coming from the chick who thinks she is the ish ! ! ... just over the top ... again .	-1
As you already know , the text is from the King James Bible , not the Geneva.For example , in this ebook Romans 5:12 & 13 reads : Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin ; and so death passed upon all men , for that all have sinned : ( For until the law sin was in the world : but sin is not imputed when there is no lawThe real Geneva text of Romans 5:12 & 13 is : Wherefore , as by one man sinne entred ( sic ) into ye world & death by sinne , and so death went ouer all men : in who all men haue sinned . For vnto the time of the Law was sinne in the worlde , but sinne is not inputed while there is no lawe.No interactive table of contents by chapter or direct verse jump .	-1
I found this in the nonfiction section and expected a memoir . This has to be a novel , an attempt at literary fiction , and not a very good one . In all fairness , I must say , probably a great writer could n't pull off pages and pages about barbecuing an oversized wiener . The book smacks of college level or maybe graduate school prose . Sucks .	-1
THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE WORST PIECES OF WRITING IN THIS GENRE . THERE IS NO CHARACTER THAT IS AT ALL BELIEVABLE.CHRISTIAN IS JUST A BRAT ! LUCCA SILLY ! THE TWO UNCLES ARE THE WORST . THE PLOT KEPT CONTRADICTING ITSELF.I WOULD SUGGEST TO ANY READER DONT ! ! ! !	-1
I felt like I was watching a cheap , low budget soap opera , and stopped reading this book before I finished it , because , frankly , I could care less what happens with this woman 's love life . The characters were all 1 dimensional , and that may be too high of a complement.This book hops around . One minute you are reading about the lead character in present day , and then suddenly , for no reason , it hops back to a time when she was in college helping the guy she is currently in love with to study for finals , with no apparent reason for this flashback . Other books , when they have a flashback , it 's to recall an earlier crisis or introduce HOW two characters met , etc . This just seemed like someone had mixed up all the pages of the book and put this section in out of order.And then there is a scene referring to a character who is this teenager out walking with his girlfriend and he asks her to marry him . We have never even been introduced to this girlfriend before , and it is n't even really clear who this teen is who is out walking with his girlfriend . He is referred to by the same name as the local landscaper 's son , so I am assuming that it is supposed to be him , but I just could n't see WHY they had to throw in this kid , who had only had a small part up till then ( doing landscaping scenes ) , suddenly proposing to a previously un-introduced girlfriend.And then the lead character has a friend , who in an effort to console her after her attempt to get the old college friend to declare his love for her does n't work , this male friend suddenly announces , `` hey , let 's try it out and see if we can be a couple '' .	-1
But , I wrote this before I finished the book . I gave it two stars because I could not ABIDE the female lead character . I disliked her so much , it made it hard to read the book . I intend to finish it , and I am hoping that whatever happened in D.C. will be enough to justify her behavior and attitude . If it is , then I wish it would have been completely explained earlier in the book . Cambria was so consistent irritating that I was surprised . I 'm at 72 % of the book now . ********************Ok , I finished the book . I think I missed something . I know Cambria 's secret had to do with Tony and his lies , but I 'm not sure what it was specifically.Boone did n't seem to be controlling as much as he seemed to be sad , lonely , and in pain . At least with Boone , I understood why he behaved the way he did . Maybe the intent for Cambria was to hint at her past.It also felt like everything came together so quickly at the end of the book . The resolution of the issues involving Cambria , Boone , Pete , the relationships , etc.Like I said , I feel like I missed something . If it was fully explained in the book about Cambria 's past in D.C. , then I apologize to people that read this review .	-1
I think the writer has talent , and the premise of this story sounded promising , but I started skimming before I even reached the halfway point . The male main character was likeable , but the female main character was not . At all . She was abrupt and abrasive and used one bad relationship as an excuse to be rude at every turn , to a very nice person . Time for her to grow up - her attitude ruined the whole story for me . I wo n't be continuing on with this series .	-1
It was an interesting read , however , for those of you who do n't like the bad language , you 'll need to skip this one .	-1
I really could n't get into this book . Plot was not interesting at all . Characters were not colorful . I did n't even finish this book . Just could n't get interested in storyline	-1
This is a book of short stories that do n't seem to have any real value . I did n't even finish it .	-1
I personally have a problem when people in authority take the role of Dom in BDSM relationships . I know these make for steamy story lines but it gets a bit too close to 'abuse of power ' for me . Emotionally vulnerable people are not in the right head-space to make safe , sane , consensual decisions . With this in mind , I felt uncomfortable with the premise of the story which detracted from my enjoyment . If you do n't have my issues then you will probably enjoy this too-brief story .	-1
The plot , or what I thought was a plot , was interesting , and it was a good price so I thought I would check this out while waiting for some new books to come out in other various series I am reading . Anyway , this book is basically all sex , and sex , and more sex . Not much of a story in between . I like some erotic scenes , but I am saying this book was just ALL those kind of scenes . It was just too much sex , and not enough story . Not at all realistic as far as how things ended up either . Skip this one !	-1
The story felt weak and a bit phoned-in.You 've got your cookie-cutter detectives solving an unusual , but not very interesting , crime . The story lacks the descriptions ( What do the detectives look like ? How old are they ? ) that would allow you to really get into the story and the characters are n't really developed . The mystery is solved easily . All in all , I was disappointed .	-1
I wo n't be buying any more of this author 's offerings . I wonder if some of the authors of the almost free Kindle books write according to a template : horrific violence lipsmackingly detailed , sexual details which would have shocked even Kinsey , jibes at the Catholic Church and a bit of detection thrown in almost as an afterthought . As someone who had read detective stories by e.g . Agatha Christie , Dorothy Sayers , Ngaio Marsh etc most of my life this new stuff I am accidentally discovering on Kindle really should be flagged `` graphic violence and sexual details '' . If I wanted to read erotica or horrific violence with women and children as perpetual victims I would seek out books within those categories . I would ask the Amazon editors to flag these new books so that I do n't waste my money purchasing them .	-1
In the Dark Lands , a virus killed all possibilities of female offsprings . In their search for wives and families of their own , the Beasts have created a pathway between their world and Earth and proceeded to kidnap suitable brides.The plot could have been fine and the typos can be overlooked . The gradual adaptation of the women to a new world and the heroine falling in love could have made for a great story if it had been treated with subtlety.What irked me is the blatant sexism and homophobia that permeated the story . The brides have to be pure ( meaning virgins ) , they are mostly very young ( sixteen ) and deemed old enough to marry men twice their age . They 're kidnapped and kept prisoners until they agree to marry . Those who try to flee back to Earth are punished ( worse , the author even makes them like their punishment ) . There are many references to the fact that the men must be dominant and the women trained to obey and follow . Once kissed , they seem to loose what little reason they were born with and are enthralled with their kidnappers . The only things they require to stay are a ) clothes and nice apartments and b ) marriage and the wedding night.Homosexual practices are deemed against nature and disgusting.Now , I understand that this might be the view of some readers and I respect that the author has the right to her own beliefs . Unfortunately , it goes against my own beliefs of equality between the sexes and acceptance of all mankind , even those with different taste in their bedroom partners . I finished the book , would not recommend it to anyone and will avoid this author in the future .	-1
Pretty sure all the people who gave 4 and 5 stars read a different book than me . The 'romance ' was horrendous , the writing was stilted , the sex scene was not good at all . It lacked the level of intimacy that made it believable . As for the abuse the heroine suffered , the writing was unsympathetic to the cause and it borderlined insulting to those who have endured such horrible transgressions . A tiny blurb mentioning an abuse website at the end of the book is not a pardon for poor writing lacking compassion and respect . And please , for the love of God , get a proper editor .	-1
If there was ever a case for book classification this one makes it as it would certainly rate an adult classification . I am not sure if the author set out to shock or thought that the graphic descriptions aided the story . However this is not the reason that I am giving it 2 stars there was virtually no character development and the plot had glaring gaps in it perhaps as the author tries to put too much into the story . I am not sure if there is a book before this , which may have given more background , or there is going to be a `` prequel '' as the story starts with the reader being thrown in at the deep end.One example of plot deficiencies is where the police want to prevent a remotely controlled bomb exploding so they decide to block all wireless frequencies , easier said than done , however they seem to manage that and I wondered how they were going to get over their mobile phones not working , no problem they just kept working . There were many examples where the plot fell down which made it all very unbelievable . Had it been believable together with the graphic adult themes and violence it would have been a gripping but frightening book . Unfortunately it failed.The book ends at a point where there is obviously going to be a sequel , it is called `` Final Justice '' I will not be reading it .	-1
Very disappointed with this book as I thought it would show actual pictures of foods and how they went right or wrong in the photo shoot . Since I am an avid cook and am learning how to more professionally take a food photo shot , I thought this book may help . After reading it , I realized that this book is a NO GO and waste of time.Glad that it was FREE the day I purchased it.So I am giving it a generous score of 1.5 stars as the author did her best ... Therefore , I do not recommend this book !	-1
This book had the potential to be good , but I do n't know what happened.Abby was once married to a famous artist named Benedict who died at a young age . The day after he died , Abby meets and sleeps with Ryan who she happens to get pregnant by . She decides to pass the child ( Trish ) off as her late husbands because no one knows about Ryan.At a gallery showing for her late husbands artwork , Abby is bombarded with questions and comments from all of these pretentious and fake people trying to keep Ben 's memory alive . One of the worse ones is Hans Bunian . Hans is also an artist that her late husband Ben admired and that she made the Godfather to her daughter.Hans convinces Abby that her daughter should become a artist and has her taking art lessons and creating art . Hans is also a Bully , who acts more like the child is his instead of hers . Abby does n't seem to have a backbone and allows Hans not only to bully her but , also her daughter.10 years after their first encounter , Abby sees Ryan again at the Gallery and immediately tried to avoid him because she does n't want him to find out about his daughter . After a few encounters , Ryan figures out that Trish is his daughter and decides that he is n't going to allow Hans to continue to Bully his daughter or Abby.Ryan is a refreshing part of the book , the only part that I really liked.This story was so unrealistic , I mean who allows not only them self but , also their own child to be bullied by someone when all that they have to do is break all contact with them ?	-1

20 % into the book and I 'm skipping ahead looking for the story . Too much internal dialog about nothing ( apparently ) important.Lots of arcane dialog with `` thee '' and `` thy '' , it 's overdone and in places done wrong . It 's also inconsistent , in a world where people talk like that they would n't have an internal dialog like `` ... borderline racists , but that was purely fight talk . Taunts did not signify an actual meme '' .Not enough going on in the story to continue with the book on the off chance there is a plot hiding somewhere there .	-1

The action in the story takes place over way too short a time to be believable . The heroine feels justified in committing illegal acts to further her ends , and she 's the star of a Christian romance ? I found it preposterous that she and the hero would fall in love . The Christian aspects seemed really forced : she does n't seem to have much faith , and they 're constantly praying for miracles , which BOOM arrive right on schedule . The hero seems to exist to be her human ATM , funding her search for her biological sister , and the pray/miracle seems to make God into some sort of vending machine . Then there were plot holes : how did the villain get a copy of a picture of the heroine that had to have been taken years before she met the villain ? Why does the hero so readily believe a stranger who accuses his father of a crime ? If the author had had the couple meet in a conventional way ( easily done ) and have a loving trusting relationship prior to the events of the book , it might have been believable , but the story was like being dropped into the front car of a roller coaster as it 's cresting the first hill . You 're off and running before you have a chance to say 'Wait a minute , how did THIS happen ? '	-1
I tried to read it and finish it but I just could n't ! ! ! This book was awful ! The lead character was not interesting..too whiny & pathetic . I did n't like the plot it was sooo weird ! ! ! I did n't read the reviews before I purchased it because I was in a hurry ... .Never again ! ! !	-1
I 'm a fan of Terri Reid 's Mary O'Reily books , but this was just awful . Pure bad Harlequin Romance claptrap , very little plot . Do n't bother .	-1
A little confusing foe me , much less my grand kids ! Not really a child 's book . Not sure why it was listed as one . Maybe meant for old children.DisappointedMary P.Chicago	-1
Seven pages , Three Things One Must Know : 1 ) Never Was a Book , 2 ) Is Not Now a Book 3 ) Will Never Be a BookI snagged it for free for a project I am working on . I am not sure if people think they will get rich quick just by `` publishing '' something orif they really believe that people will pay $ 10 for a 7 page laundry list that appears to be , as one commenter duly noted , nothing more thana re-publish of some safety card , probably from the Government Printing Office . Amazon is correct , I believe , to allow this kind of thing as it isup to the market ( us ) to weed out the charlatans , quacks , frauds and ignorant.TIP : The book entitled THE KINDLE EXPERT , which I recommend , states that 30 pages is a fair minimum for .99 cent e-book . I agree , if those 30 pages deliverquality information . TKE and I agree that 60 pages really is the BEST number of pages for a short e-book priced .99 cents . But even if this sevenpager was handed down to Moses from God on concrete tablets $ 9.99 is asking for trouble . It is unreasonable , reeks of scam and will surely cause charge-backs when peoplebuy without reading the notes and realize they just paid $ 10 for some prepper 's book report outline .	-1
This covered very well the basic moves of chess . I was very disagreeable to the missing rules . Somewhere the more advanced rules should have been mentioned . So many basic , less advanced , players shout , that 's not a legal move if you castle or en passant . There you have it , my review of the book .	-1
The story is set in England , along the Dorset coast . Our main character , Martin , is out in a boat one day and encounters a pair of dolphins ( who knew there were dolphins in England ? ? ) . Some days later when a storm blows up unexpectedly , the dolphins come to Martin 's aid when his boat engine fails.It turns out , the dolphins are a rare strain of shifters , who are born dolphin but can assume the form of a human . The pair - George and Patrick - have come to like and trust Martin and they eventually share their secret with him . For the dolphins , some abilities carry through each form , such as echolocation , and various quirky mating habits . The latter comes up when the pair proposition Martin and he is n't shy about taking them up on the offer . This is n't strictly m & eacute ; nage sex ; for the trio , it 's generally two of the guys , then two others in succession . And after the first day , the sex very much moves into the background of the story.Because then , the story turns to Martin 's interest in an abandoned house along the coastline , and we follow along - in detail - as he talks with the owner , and arranges to lease and fix up the place . We spend WAAAAAY too much time pursuing cellar passageways , and cleaning windows , and checking wiring . Chapters are spent describing arranging for a surveyor to come out , and inspection of the septic tank , and buying appliances . This degenerated into a DIY project that went on forEVER . This was a long book - more than 4000 location - but the middle 2000 was about fixing up this house.And then , there 's the bestiality subplot that brings sex back in towards the end of the story . See , the dolphin guys would be keen to have sex with Martin while they are in dolphin form , even though that would require Martin being underwater during the whole thing , and potentially harmful penetration by a dolphin-sized penis . Martin is VERY not comfortable with the idea , and it takes quite awhile to work up to things . Even the dolphins are concerned about harming Martin - it 's mentioned that the activity could even prove fatal if things went badly - but that does n't dissuade anyone . When they eventually Do the Deed , it is REALLY not sexy or erotic and I spent most of the time trying to avert my eyes , simply because of how the whole thing was written.Ultimately , this is a very `` English '' book . Rather straight-laced English characters , English dialogue , very conservatively-paced proper storytelling . In a word , it was boring . Not bad , just too much time spent on stilted conversations and detailed home repair . In the end , Martin and George and Patrick have rather decided to pursue a relationship of three , though it 's never much discussed , and there are no declarations of strong feelings - let alone love ! The story kind of pans away at the end and a lot of things are just left unresolved . But hopefully not to leave room for a sequel , because I - at least - would not be buying that !	-1
Although the writing in the novel was bearable , the ending was abrupt . This feels more like the beginning of a novel and not a complete story . The story lacks conflict . I 'm not sure the good writing is enough to forgive poor plot .	-1
let down . Did not think it was worth the money spent at all . Nothing in it seemed of real value .	-1
It starts out quite nicely : An SF quasi-dystopia with a Roman-Republic style governance , terrorists a la the Gunpowder Plot , and very clear laws about machine/human blends.Then it goes somewhere I wo n't : a viewpoint character being forced to enjoy unwanted sexuality . It 's the & # 34 ; forced to enjoy & # 34 ; part that burns bridges for me . And I did n't see it coming . If the viewpoint had stayed with the controller , I would have kept reading . But when the target narrated the sequence . No . Put it down .	-1
Definitely one for believers and ONLY believers.Basically a religious tract masquerading as a short story , with the usual quota of painfully inept and sophomoric `` philosophical arguments '' aimed wholly and solely at confirming the pre-existing beliefs of Christians . The `` learned discussion '' between the protagonist and her `` mentor '' is unintentionally hilarious in its ineptitude . Neither of those `` academics '' would have made it past their first semester in college - it is that bad.This is best described as `` faith-enabling '' . If you know why that is a bad thing , avoid this rubbish like the plague . I could n't get past the first few pages.Seriously , why do people who do n't understand the basics of logic or philosophy try to write academic characters ? It 's just painful.There is a section called Christian Fiction for a reason . I do n't know how the author imagined this belonged anywhere else . Vanity ?	-1
While this story maintains credibility due to the writer 's embrace of the true faith ; it still lacks something that it needs to be good .	-1
i was not impressed with this short story . it was very much like the exorcist ( different victim , different 'priest ' ) . this story is simply shorter and very , very shallow.the accidental poltergeist was a much better story , which i recommend reading to your family a christmas . if you are not christian , i still recommend it as it is a story of family , forgiveness , and love.this story is a vanity piece for the author 's beliefs ( which is fine ... but it should be labeled as christian fiction ) .	-1
A okay read . I gave this book one stars based on how it engages my emotions . I really enjoyed the beginning and really enjoyed the ending . The middle was very boring . Thanks and you are welcome !	-1
This story began with a lot of fluffy unnecessary detail . When it finally got down to the action , things felt a bit rushed . I really did n't need to know all those details about the airport and her college friends presented in a big lump like that .	-1
Nothing against the author or the book itself . I just could n't get into the storyline . I do prefer other genres , so this was me trying to step out of my genre	-1
Ok . So I 've seen this book for a while now and I could n't decide whether I wanted to read it or not . Now I wish I went with the latter choice . I do n't think I made it past five chapters before giving up . The main character is completely stupid . Why go running in the forest you know has demons in it and then when you meet the demon what do you do ? Make out with him . Yea so believable . Not to much the writer writes like she has adhd . I read a review where the girl said she had to re-read paragraphs to really get what was going on . I had to re-read pages . It was too much . Not even worth the free price .	-1
There are a few issues I have with this book , and a few questions too.First , after reading the synopsis I thought the idea of the story interesting enough to give it a go . The $ 0.00 price was a help in making that decision too . I 've had a run of bad luck with some of the self-published books on amazon as far as their depth , intelligence , and attention to grammar and punctuation , so being free was a big Plus.In the first chapter , actually within the first few pages , some of the most intentionally unintelligent comments are made by the main character that made me instantly close-out of my Kindle for PC and go hunting for a different book to read . The part where the protag does something that no human should be able to do , but then attributes this strange ability to a weird `` coincidental gift from the universe '' , or something just completely crushed any hope I had for the story . And then shortly after , when seeing something mysterious in a place she is not supposed to be and that poses great danger to her , she chases after it , I had to take deep calming breaths . Where 's the underline in here ? She CHASES it.But after a fruitless and halfhearted search for a different book , I returned to this one , determined to give its author the benefit of the doubt . I 'm not about to go into further detail because it would only make me look like I was unhappy with how the story unfolded , and that 's not the case at all . There were just so many inconsistencies and random acts of emotion and awkward mannerisms and social interactions it was frustrating at every turn.I found there to be multiple places throughout the story where the characters would say or do something totally alien to the set mood , or completely confusing to me . Reading this story was like looking into the mind of a mood swinging ADD spaz with wings and super powers . Her attention seemed to jump from one thing to the next so fast and sometimes seemingly so random I wanted to tell the character to sit still and be quiet for a minute . There 's no continuous focus of one thing at a time , there 's no consistency to the moods or attitudes of the characters , and above all- the action scenes were down right confusing . I 'm not an accomplished writer , and no , I have not published anything I 've written , but I do know a good fight scene , or action scene when I read one , and those in this story had me more confused than before the scene happened.Also , the dynamics between characters was hard to follow . Each time Breandan and Devlin were in the scene , all I kept thinking was `` WHY is he leaving her with Devlin when we all KNOW Devlin has bad intentions for Rae ? ? ? '' or `` WHY did he just turn his back on an enemy after a supposedly vicious sword fight ? '' There were so many `` Why ? ! '' thoughts after each scene containing the three characters I had to take breaks just to calm myself down from the frustration I was experiencing over it.The concept of the story is fascinating , and the characters individually are interesting and ( evil personalities aside ) are likable . But the conflicts of what the characters say versus what they actually do , and sometimes the mood swings they express are just confounding . There 's no other way I can describe it without going into a full rant . I really wished this story were better because I think the world the writer had created is fun and it definitely sets my imagination whirling but the incongruity of the characters just ruined it for me .	-1
Oh my gosh , this is the totally awesome story of how I found out I was a demon ( well , actually a beautiful fairy ) with super-cool powers who is actually the key to the future of fairies and maybe the world ! I was in school to learn how to fight demons , but fortunately I did n't pay much attention , so everybody I meet in the fairy world has to spend tons of time explaining fairy powers and society to me . And I get my very own fairy-boy ! We 're like , fated , to be together . . . at least until I get my vampire-boy ! Now that I 'm a fairy , I 'll do whatever I want ! I 'll sneak vampires into my dorm room despite the fact that they eat humans and I totally live with a bunch of humans ! I 'll make out with my fairy-boy and then I 'll make out with my vampire-boy . There 's a whole fairy society and stuff , but that does n't matter , because I make my own rules ! Rules are for losers who are n't very important fairies.Did I mention that I 'm beautiful and I have tons of powers that nobody else has and I am in love with a fairy AND a vampire ? In case you did n't get it , I 'll refer to my fairy-boy and my vampire-boy a few more times . Check out the sequels where I 'm sure to break some more rules , uncover more unprecedented powers that only I have , and be with two guys while I try to figure out which one of them I really want - the fairy-boy I have an inexplicable , instant , and powerful bond with or the vampire-boy I have an inexplicable , instant , and powerful bond with !	-1
I was very disappointed when I finished reading this book . It truly was way too short . It felt like as soon as I started reading the book , it was over . The story was n't really developed and could have made more sense . I definitely wo n't be buying anything from this author again . Huge disappointment !	-1
This is the story of Conner and Faelan . Conner gives his girlfriend of six months a promise ring and Faelan starts itching and her skin turns silvery after she 's been wearing it . It also gives her some other feeling of need , which I wo n't go into in my review . I wo n't spoil the whole story by telling any more.This really did read like the opening to what could have been a novel had it been developed a little better . There is one explicit scene between Conner and Faelan that just seems much too frantic & needy . The story just ends all of a sudden . I would have given this 2.5 stars because it has a lot of potential.At the time I downloaded this to my kindle it was being offered free in the kindle book store , which in no way affected my review of this short story .	-1
so cheesy I 'm thinking I do n't even want to continue with the rest of the series ... .. It seems like she 's trying to make it different , but nah , sorry ! ! : (	-1
This is Great beginner writer boring , but if you like short very teen or pre teen romance this is for you ...	-1
The story was like so many shifter stories , predictable and common . Maybe if it were longer in order to get to know the characters but who knows .	-1
I was n't able to finish reading this . It has a decent plotline but the language is contrived and forced and some of what could be interesting twists just turn absurd . This could be much better with some heavy editing .	-1
Story started of good but writing became very mediocre batteries few chapters . The flow of story was rushed and made story become rather predictable .	-1
This & # 34 ; novel & # 34 ; ( and I shudder to call it that ) is like the difference between a documentary and a movie . The characters have little depth and it felt like it was just a narration of what the real novel was about .	-1
Was n't bad , was n't good . It was free so I ca n't complain . There was a good story line but it was n't very well written .	-1
Ok the first review with a two star rating had nothing to do with the story so let me tell you why I am giving this book a two star rating . First there isnt enough of a character development for me . Also the usage of sighs and giggls along with the word methinks got annoying . The characters were always sighing for this or sighing for that ; it was in every chapter as well as giggling at the wrong moments and methinks were used way too much . Also as that reason sounded a little bit redundant so did some of the story when the characters would explain something they sometimes do it twice but worded it slightly different as if the authors forgot they already had it in the story causing the story to drag . Also the actions of the characters did n't make since to me either ... ..spoil alert ... . the parents of the heroine jump to conclusions and do n't believe her when she had been forced upon by her cousins intended calling her a whore . Also she is seen unchaperoned by multiple people with the hero when they were hiding their relationship where I might add there was no romance development ... anyways she was seen and even recognized by the king himself but never becomes ruined even when her father finds out . Instead he beats her in the street for all to see and apologizes later in the story like he is n't a bad guy and she accepts his apology ! ! ! ! Oh and when they run off to elope it takes a while for it to happen instead of eloping right away ? ? There were just way too many issues with this book for me . I do n't recommend it .	-1
The best word I can use to sum this one up is trite . Historical romance is not known to be the deepest of genres . Telling this story as a novella stripped it down to the barest essentials , and it ended up trying too hard .	-1
I have read the other reviews and clearly am in the minority when I say this story sucked . A former werewolf bounty hunter , who was the progeny of a werewolf bounty hunter , becomes a werewolf himself . The story never mentions gramps trying to kill hus grandson so it was just odd that the author kept mentioning his lineage . Lucy made my teeth hurt . One minute she was a vixen and the next a victim running from a werewolf through the woods . Justina 's ex being a werewolf was a totally random an unecessary plot twist . The author could have informed the reader about Oz being an assassin a different way . All in all it was a waste of mo ey for me .	-1
I think I 'm going to need a Prozac after this book.I prefer to feel good when I read a book . Everyone 's life has dramas , but I 'm not one to wallow in them.This book was not for me , and I found it highly depressing.Now to locate a good comedy , to get this sour taste out of my mouth .	-1
Short story that includes a sad twist . I enjoyed it and was hopeful at the end . A few steamy scenes to tantalize you .	-1
Unfortunately this is just a lackluster `` haunted '' version of her other books . I suppose if you like one you 'll probably like them all.I guess I was hoping for something more than the same silly , shallow , steroeotypical bimbo I 've met before . Next ...	-1
Oh how the ads for this book got my hopes up ! I thought that with the title , The forest of Adventures , this story had to be a adventure ! Oh dear , could I 've been more wrong ? There 's no pretty way to say it . This story is booring ! It is a long , long whine of a teenager , and it never gets down to action ! It just prattles on about feelings and thoughts . And those is n't even logical.. Okay , feelings are n't logical , but theese do n't even follow a pattern , they swing from one point to another midsentence ... This simply is not an coherent and welltold story.I 'm sorry , but I ca n't recommend this to anyone . Especially not to people like myself , who ' looking for a good read to pass av quiet evening . Sorry .	-1
I thought this was a real book that would give me great advice on marketing my book . When I finished reading what I thought was the Foreword or introduction , I realized I had just completed the entire book . Advice given was common sense , and I did n't learn anything . Besides , the format , grammar , and spelling is not what I would call top-notch for someone in the business .	-1
bought this book by mistake so i didnt read it maybe i should looks like it could be some good	-1
While I enjoyed the series I do n't see that this added any significant value . If a reader is following the series then we already know that Zane is more than likely going to pay for his choices . Glad it was free . If not I do n't think I would have been too happy considering it 's not all that insightful as to the story of Zane .	-1
I did n't care for it because I am not into vampires and evil creatures so I give it a thumbs down .	-1
I could n't find anything to like about this book . I did n't like the characters and found the background story on the main characters was n't developed enough for me to care . I think the author did herself a disservice because this first novel felt very rushed and incomplete . We were immediately thrown into the action with characters we had not yet had a chance to get to know and care about . Then again , what was there to like about the ignorant , money-grubbing Daisy , cunning and crafty Aiden or Peter the Lunk Head ? I was appalled when Aiden admired Daisy 's intelligence when she was going on about her business plan talking about `` those people '' ( Koreans ) so ignorantly I actually winced while reading . She did n't sound smart ; she sounded like a bigot and a hick and someone too young and experienced to have a clue about the world outside of Hollow Creek , KY ... which I guess is what she was . Aiden was so outrageously conniving it was almost comical . All he needed was a long mustache to twist while laughing maniacally over Daisy tied to a railroad track and the image would have been complete . Peter was such a chest-thumping , keep-the-woman-barefoot-and-pregnant caveman that the moments where he was supposed to be breaking down and showing his softer side almost did n't make sense . Also , when Daisy 's big ( and obvious ) secret was finally revealed in a dramatic ( and predictable ) fashion to Peter ; I did n't feel sorry for either character . I was actually very happy that this little bit of drama had finally come to its predictable conclusion.On a side note : I found it extremely annoying that Daisy and Peter kept referring to Jessiemae but we never met her . Here was a character that sounded like she might have a little bit of complexity and she never makes an appearance in the story ! ! Anyway , I downloaded the second novel , Daisy 's Choice , right after completing this bit of fluff and it immediately became apparent that the author tried to make up for what was lacking in the first novel by giving more background on these characters . But at this point , I find these characters so revolting and unendearing that I no longer care to see them get to , what I suspect , is just another predictable happily ever after . I returned the second novel and am certian I wo n't ever reread Aiden 's Game . This is not to say that I am finished with this author because I know she can do better than this trio of stereoptyped , two-dimensional characters .	-1
This book had a strong beginning but slowly went downhill . Hard to believe the little girl that u rooted for in the start was a monster .	-1
A fast-paced British thriller ? I had to read this.Unfortunately there are some issues which bring the book down badly and that 's why I 've only given it two stars . SPOILERS ALERT.Firstly , the plot is really nonsensical . We 've two senior police officers with a ) nothing else to do and b ) an easygoing attitude towards letting interested members of the public see what 's going on behind the scenes . Apart from the sheer unlikeliness of it , there 's also the question of verbal evidence contamination , breaches of privacy and so on.Secondly , the point of view chops and changes so much that , if this were a film , it 'd be quite unwatchable . There were times when I knew things that I did n't know because I was still inside the head of the character whose eyes I 'd been seeing through a few sentences prior.Thirdly , the characters are very thin and cardboard cut-out-like . The women are gorgeous , the men are good or bad and the whole thing more than a bit contrived.I 'm really pleased to say that there were some good points . The story itself has a fascinating premise ( I liked that a lot ) , there was some light relief at times ( liked that , too ) and the setting stayed reasonably steady ( some books can turn into travelogues ) until the ending when it really lost the plot ( pun intended ) bigtime.British crime thrillers like this benefit from being gritty and realistic - this ( very sadly ) was n't .	-1
Opinions are like tastes - everybody has one ! and mine is not this - a thriller more than a mystery .	-1
I have never read this authors work before and will not read another one.I too found some of the facts wrong . I also had trouble keeping the characters straight.Finally finished the book but it was a struggle .	-1
Being the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic , this seemed a good book to try . I only got a couple of chapters into it , but it became obvious that the central idea of this book is that a bacterium or an alien or something came out of the ground with the iron ore that was used to build the ship , and that 's why the ship sank . I just could n't finish it , even though I love novels set in a defined historic setting .	-1
The author , Cannon , somewhat succeeded in creating solely two of her characters . Harper , the main character and her primary love interest , Jackson who both pushed me to prevail . However , their short-lived relationship was the only part of the novel that I had enjoyed , aside from the ending ( since the book was finally over ) .Even with what I like about the two characters , they still had more than their fair share of flaws as I only favoured the two with a lack of a better option . Jackson incessantly refused to explain the situation to Harper , as also leaving me in the dark to what the actual conflict is . As for Harper , she was oblivious to her surroundings . This was especially frustrating as her `` amnesia '' caused her to forget the start of her relationship with Jackson , which was one of my highlights of the book . Not only did she develop `` mysterious '' amnesia , she immediately chose to conform to society as a cheerleader , something which she previously claimed had no appeal when it was out of her reach . The other supporting roles were also incapable of peaking my interest , such as Harper 's closest friend , Agnes and her `` shocking '' secrets and sealed fate.Cannon only succeeded in writing a story centred upon a quintessential high school hierarchy and a self-absorbed sophomore who is incapable of staying conscious for more than a couple of days . Personally , this does not suit my taste , in spite of the regular action and romance that I often find appealing . Only if this sounds intriguing to other readers would I recommend this novel , because in the least , Cannon ' s writing style was not as shocking as what plot points consisted in `` Beautiful Demons '' .	-1
No my cup of tea . Not much plot or character development . Oh well , sometimes you do get what you paid for .	-1
Actually pretty good . Not a usual plot for a romance . It works though . But i Could n't give it three stars	-1
I found this story long and drawn out . Do n't recommend for anyone looking for an exciting love story - this one falls short - poor character development , sappy story and predictable ending . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Updated from March 12 , 2012 to fix typos in review.Let me start this review with a brief synopsis of the plot as that is lacking in the description.The heroine , Catherine is in a miserable marriage . She is married to a baron who , based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive . Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues . She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over . The hero , Adam is an Earl who is `` lured '' to the castle for a pair of twin horses . He meets Catherine and based on her looks , falls instantly in love with her . The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married ? Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom ? As I read this book , I find several things incredulous . First , this `` love '' between Catherine and Adam is n't really that well developed . I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time , and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband . He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion . However , based on what was told in this story , I am at a loss regarding Adam 's love . Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman ( think , Helen of Troy , Cleopatra , etc. ) . I do n't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband , but never directly to Adam . Additionally , there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine 's favors ( she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any ) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next . I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story , Catherine 's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told . I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right , perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall , I ca n't really recommend this novel unless someone does n't care about infidelity . I found this novel to be weak , the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine . Yes , I finished it because frankly , I wanted to know more about the husband and , was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels . Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together , the ending left a lot to be desired as well . I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author .	-1
I purchased this story after reading such positive reviews and was very disappointed . No character development , misunderstandings that led to big nothing blow-ups , the storyline jumped all over the place and many grammatical errors , it was a chore just getting through it .	-1
Basically the title of three star reviewer sums it up perfectly for me why I hated this book . I can enjoy `` Daddy kink '' in the bedroom , really depends on how it was written , but for me eighteen year old Angel acted as if he was extremely young child and it was a massive turn off for me . The story is well written , but I could not deal with it .	-1
A cute idea ... however I 'm not sure I was too in love with the story or any of the characters . I found myself wanting to skip ahead just to see if I 'd really miss anything ... I did skip many of the longer poems , and I really do n't feel like I missed anything at all.Overall I found this story really boring .	-1
It was also one of the least romantic romances I 've ever read.This is not one of her better books IMO . It seemed quite stagnant to me . Although the story did manage to get from the start to the end , it was all very flat , no twists or turns , no heroes and the closest you get to a villain is his manipulative father.He 's the eldest son of an Earl . His father claims to be dying and pressures him into marrying a daughter of his best friend before he dies.She thinks she is too mousy and timid for a model of perfection such as he , to be worthy of marrying him . Of course all of society whispers their agreement with her assessment.He is still madly in love with a woman who jilted him 9 months earlier , and moans and whines about his love for her throughout 99 % of the book . Lamenting her lack in comparison the perfection that was his lost love.She 's as dull as a dish cloth , and only shows a drop of spark a couple of times throughout the whole book.All in all , I 'm not going to complain too much , it was only 99 cents on kindle , but it really is n't one I 'd bother to read again .	-1
The story line of this book had the potential of being a dark thriller . Instead , it was a third rate novel with poorly thought out development and pedantic dialogue . With a mix of a serial killer seeking revenge , conspiracy by respected members of society , and a lack of authenticity as far as the criminal and legal justice systems work the result is a novel lacking any degree of actual thought . The author slips into very formal language at times , and the use of words and phrases that are more Great Britain then the U.S shows there was little research not only into the books ' subject matter , but the setting as well .	-1
Being married to a Brit I 'm fairly used to the slang and what we American 's call poor grammar , but this book took the cake . There were so many grammatical errors , misused words , misspelled words , and British slang being used by LA detectives , it took the readability right out of it . I might recommend this book to some of my 'illiterate ' friends only because I know they 'll never read it . It got 1 star because there is potential with the story-maybe a complete rewrite and relocate it to London . Police procedures-not even close . And when Patton finally takes on Caldwell , he fails miserably and his backup , while only mildly wounded , does n't even get a shot off or see where the suspect disappears to ? Also , going back to the beginning , if they found the first 2 victim 's bodies , why were n't the forensics people able to figure out at that point what Sarah 's clues meant ? I could go on and on , but suffice it to say that I wo n't be reading any more by this author unless he learns to proof , edit , and research his material beforehand . Sorry Simon , but this is the type of work that gives self-publishing a bad reputation , and I do n't say that lightly .	-1
This is a short , virtually plotless , tale . It 's hard to imagine a child young enough to find the text interesting would be okay with a story devoid of pictures . Like at least one other reviewer , it makes you wonder who the target audience is for this story .	-1
I feel that this author used a thesaurus simply because another reviewer suggested it . Not all uses of a thesaurus are needed.. the misuse of the word concertino I think was just to much . The book is poorly edited and just reading what one wrote could have fixed many of the problems.Next I 'd like to add that I do n't care how much of a hymen a women has left by the time she is in her twenties hell even as a teenager you CAN NOT tell if she is a virgin by a `` popping '' or how hard it was to press pass something . Inexperience in the woman 's body and in sex really gets to me . If you are not grown up enough to know about this subject do n't write about it . Hell as a freshman in high school we were taught in our health class exactly how a woman 's hymen works.. If one is female they should know this , if one is male and not old enough to know this they should n't be writing sex scenes.Next the in such a short book the sex scene should not span 12 % of the book , for one scene . Either write supernatural fantasy fiction , or write smut.. not very many authors can do this.. This is just another case of how in a short story people fall desperately in love with each other at first sight.. and the name.. really.. people should stay away from the name Isabella or Bella in werewolf or vampire books right now.. gives people a bad taste of the Twilight books , which were NOT good books .	-1
... to the other reviews . They were n't kidding . This is bad . Really bad . Thankfully , it 's also very short and , best of all , it was free . If I 'd paid money for it , I 'd be really upset.The author seems to be aiming for the fantasy-romance genre , but it reads like a clunky `` Letter to Penthouse , '' if that letter was written by a high school sophomore with a pocketful of cliches . If you need a primer on how NOT to write a story , this one is your best example .	-1
This was an interesting short story with no point . It was about a librarian that was changed into a werecat , and fought against the werewolfs . The whole book was really a cover for the author to write a vivid sexual encounter . I have read Bubba books and I really liked the character development and the plots in them . Both character development and plot were lacking in this story . I would suggest that Devill write stories about the small southern towns and the people that live in them and not waste her time writing fantasy .	-1
Want to know what I hate more than insta-love ? No character development AND insta-love . Granted I suppose I was kind of asking for it by reading a novella that includes romance but still it 's something that just makes me cringe.The author does have a fairly nice writing style and the idea overall is decent . I think if Bevill had spent more time developing the story and exploring the characters this could have been a pretty good read , but as is ... it 's just a rushed romance with a side of whimsy . In fact it 's mostly romance after the two main characters meet , and some of it just came off as `` I 'm confessing my love the second I meet you to progress the storyline quickly . `` It 's okay if you are looking for a short read and nothing deep but do n't go into expecting too much . I 'll only read the second if I ever need a quick read to fill time .	-1
Wow , what a disappointment . I was expecting much more . This should be in the naughty nooner section . I agree with the other 1 , 2 star reviewers , lack of plot , lack of character development , lack of meaningful dialogue . And besides what virgin gives up her virginity that quickly if she has held out until she is in her twenties ? ? ? Unbelievable ! Made me want to throw up . I ca n't even imagine what books 2 and 3 could possibly be about .	-1
I missed the note about `` explicit content '' so I was quite shocked when I started reading . It starts out with very sadistic descriptions and grossly described sexual situations . Plus , it is deliberately written with no capitalization which is very hard to read . I have no idea how this book ended up on the Top 100 Free Books in Science Fiction . Sorry to say , but this book looks like the product of a sick mind . I wo n't be reading it .	-1
I guess there are those that would enjoy this writing . I am not one . I read the entire book on my own throne as that seemed most appropriate .	-1
I hate giving a bad review . I tried to read this book and could n't . Then I gave it a poor review . After leaving the review posted a short time , I deleted my comments.Amazon keeps suggesting I read another book in this series , something that I wo n't even consider doing . Partly for that reason , I have decided to post this review . I use other readers ' reviews to help me choose books . I always read the best and the worst that is written before making a purchase . I normally find that after reading a book , I do n't agree with the negative reviews . In this case I do agree.I really disliked this book . I did not find the humor humorous , and the story just seemed to plod along . I 'm not sure the main character is intelligent enough to solve a mystery . After two or three chapters , I really did n't care if the mystery was solved or not.There are many types of humor , and I am sure that this style will appeal to some readers . I also look for a plot that really catches my attention in the first chapter , or an appealing character . I did not find either in this book . Since I read for enjoyment , I was n't interested in seeing if the pace of the story picked up later in the book.If you are looking for mysteries set in the medieval period , read Ellis Peters ' Cadfael series . They were written some time ago and the author is deceased , but the books are still great . I was greatly disappointed in the television production of her books . The role of the sheriff was badly miscast after the first actor in the role left the series . I also did not like how they scripted the episodes . I would keep purchasing the books if there were still being written .	-1
Book is to short ... . waste of time . Just when it starts to get good it ends ! ! ! !	-1
I will now we know the story this book told . It had the F word and relied on other to grafic descriptions for my tast . So I read about 35 percent of the story and could n't take it any more , so I stopped reading it . To me that is not romance . My husband and I do n't talk that way and I sure do n't enjoy reading it if an author has to rely on too much description and foul words to sell a book , the story probably is n't that good . Do n't wast your time .	-1
I was disappointed I did not like it . I did not like it . Again I did not like it . period .	-1
Short and not very good ! There was nothing to this NO reality , no excitement ! No I wo n't be reading anything else you write !	-1
Slow Ride ( Rough Riders ) This book was not for me . I got it free from Amazon for my Kindle Fire . This is n't a romance ... it 's pure eroticism . It 's an okay book but I was bored .	-1
honestly i felt as if the book was leading me on to believe that something interesting was going to happen and it never did , I didnt get into the characters and found myself skipping pages before abandoning it completely	-1
I just could not get into reading this book , I did not finish it . . maybe I will try it again at another time . Maybe at a later time I will try this again .	-1
I hated it . So long since I started reading it , and hated it that I 've forgotten what it was all about . I 'd have to be desperate to try reading any more of it , in fact I think I sent it back	-1
I deleted my last review after the author , and some of her friends/fans quickly/harshly left comments to say I was being unkind . So , I 'll say again , in a kinder fashion , I did not enjoy this book . I love fantasy ( that 's why I read Stephen King , etc ) but fiction I like with some believability . This book , in my opinion , had little . Dialogue was weak , boring and amateurish ... in my opinion . I also ( foolishly ) downloaded her 2nd book before reading this one , but could only read about 10 pages before giving up . I was told , within the onslaught of not-very-nice-either comments to my last review , that this was the author 's first book and they do get better .	-1
Could n't believe how the father revealed his past to his daughter . Every convicted criminal pleads & # 34 ; not guilty & # 34 ; and never owns up to the truth , even if it was caught on film . A far stretch of the imagination .	-1
This book is what I 'd call a woman 's brand-name-dropping , combination bodice-ripper mystery/thriller . Rather short on the mystery /thriller part.Beautiful , successful young woman ( BSYW ) with a fiance who wears Amani suits and Burbury coats and picks her up in a stretch limo returns to her hometown to care for an ailing parent and solve anold mystery . ( stop me if you 've heard this one . ) BSYW stays at a B & B ; decorated in Laura Ashley and Ralph Lauren and meets her new BFF . Of course there is the obligatory , handsome , rude , mysterious , brooding stranger . We know where this is going.The assorted characters sit around in their brand-name , designer clothes , on brand-name furniture sipping their brand-name vintage wines from Baccarat glasses . There is the usual sophisticated picnic with french bread , cheese and a vintage brand-name wine . Just once I 'd like someone to show up for a picnic with peanut-butter sandwiches and a thermos of koolaid.The book did have two surprises for me . I expected the cat to end up hanging in the closet or gutted out on the front step . And I thought the fraternal twin sister would turn out to be a Russian orphan raised by the saintly murdered mother so you could say the book was full of two surprises for me.If you get the book free , or pay $ 2.99 as I did , you will probably get your money 's worth .	-1
I am really trying to finish this book . But I keep finding myself losing interest . Maybe one of these days when I am snowed in and the internet is down and find myself completely bored I will finish it !	-1
This book is scrambled and keeps repeating its self . I can not read it but I bet there will be no problem paying for it ! Trash !	-1
While I managed to finish this book , I found that the more I read it the more I disliked it . The hero is a rapist , and the heroine a weak-willed , simpering idiot . Ugh ! No thanks .	-1
I was not fond of the way the story was told . Like I was on the outside looking in . The reader gets told how each character feels . It got tedious for me . The first half of the story wasnt that bad , but somewhere around the 50 % mark it started to get really bizzare.Plot : Basically this is a story about 2 people who are wildly attracted to each other each with their own hang ups . She has a fiance out of state whom she `` thinks she will grow to love in time . '' He has a dead fiancee and a sister that dies mid story . The title made me think I might get porn , while the cover art suggested romance so I gave it a try . The writing- with its God references peppered through out- made me think this might be an `` undercover '' Christian book . You know the kind where the author is out to prove that a story can be secular , but still clean enough for the prude reader ? It wasnt.Characters : Trevor is a 25 year old fashion designer and he 's not gay ? Panzina is 21 with the life experience of a thirty year old . She has raised her fiances 4 year old son since birth- despite the fact that said fiance seems pretty absent . And when she gives up the son to the biological mother- there is no sadness or loss beyond one paragraph . And if the story is chronological- she doesnt see the son more than once in 6 months after giving him up.I know absolutely nothing about the author , but I am inclined to say that Patterson is quite a few decades past 21 and 25 . Her characters have experiences and world views far beyond the typical 20 something . Also her 25 year old millionaire came from a very poor family- he made his fortune pretty fast and he 's still pretty grounded . Normally- he would still be in the drugs , alcohol , and models stage if he was a real guy.Writing : there are times when I thought Patterson 's first language wasnt english . There were several phrases that no young person would say , we arent raised to be stilted and formal . Ex ) `` What do you have a taste for ? `` Her writing is flowery and over the top at times ; `` It meant that he desired her company , craved it more than the delicious sushi , which he described . '' Or `` She was such a passionate woman that incidents like this could permanently mark her heart . '' Or `` his eyes appraised her figure with admiration . '' Patterson tells us how her characters feel constantly using the most creative language she can find : `` She felt dreary as she walked up the front steps '' and `` her emotions churned in turmoil . `` What I mean by bizzare : Panzina is engaged , yet she hardly thinks about Telvin . She has no problems holding hands , kissing and fondling Trevor , yet she plans on being a virgin on her wedding night . Yeah , Patterson over plays the pure , good girl thing . Then in a really weird twist , she gives herself as balm when Trevor 's sister dies and her needs `` comfort '' saying , `` She forgot about her fears , reservations and promises made . Trevor had been there for her when she neeeded someone desperately . It was only right to be there for him in his time of need . She wouldnt be a virgin on her wedding night , but at least her first time would be with a man whom she truly loved . `` Also- Patterson couldnt keep track of her own world . Trevor 's `` penthouse '' has a driveway , patio , and full sized pool . Characters can walk up to the door . Forgive me , but I have always been taught that the penthouse is the top of a highrise or appartment building . And Trevor hates coffee yet he orders it . How do I know he hates coffee ? Because Patterson has her characters have a several paragraph conversation about how he wont drink it because it tastes like dirt.But the icing on the cake of bizarre for me is when Panzina has the epiphany , `` Trevor might like me if I finally break off my engagement . '' Yeah , she was a total ditz . I have zero respect for Panzina . She was the kind of woman that I ridicule on a regular basis.Would I recommend it : No , not unless you are super into drama and soap opera style characters are your thing . Personally , I like rational characters that I might befriend if they were a real person .	-1
Its bout some sex crazy highschool kids that should n't even been thinkin bout sex , how teachers will get on that level wit their students , it had some good parts but nothing Iwould tell others to read	-1
I DID NOT GET READ THIS BOOK YET I DID NOT READ THIS BOOK YET I JUST PURCHASED BUT DID N'T GET AROUND TO READING YET	-1
This is one of those instances that I should have read the reviews before purchasing this book ; even if the book was free . I agree with other reviewers that this is not an appropriate book for teens . This is the first book with teenage characters that I have ever read and will probably be the last . Free does not always mean quality . The racial undertones , profanity and disgusting sex scenes are horrible . Of course , you can take your chances and read it for yourself but beware . Thankfully the book is short ( 127 pages ) so the pain of reading it does not go on and on . Good Luck !	-1
This book was poorly written and stupid ! Do not get this book free or not ! It is a waste of time !	-1
When I say this was hard to read , I mean that I had to push myself to finish reading the book . It did pick up as it went on , but the beginning was dragging . I figured that as long as I paid for the book I was going to finish reading it . If I try to read another one of his books , I will get it from the library for free .	-1
I purchased this book because of the five star review . By 3 % of the total I realized this would be a difficult read because it was impossible to follow the story line . The sentences are constructed in a simplistic way which made it choppy . The prologue starts off with a battle between a character and a mythical creature , however , the author fails to describe this creature called a Matwau , and fails to identify its nature . I read a great deal of science fiction and paranormal fiction and enjoy both genres when the creatures are brought to life . This one was not .	-1
It was too short to believe it . could have had a better plot.I think it a good mystery would be longer.More than what was written .	-1
I thought a book was more than 10 pages long . At best this was a interesting short story . I guess I had better check more closely before ordering , what I expected to be , a book . I 'm almost afraid to order Beyond Justice .	-1
Bait to buy ? This `` book/short '' is really just a full blown ad for his other book.Chapter one starts 10 % into the `` book '' - after 10 % of reviews for Beyond Justice . Then this `` tale '' goes to the 49 % mark . With the last 50 % dedicated to an excerpt os BJ . Well , after a brief word from the `` sponser '' ( author ) .The meager 39 % dedicated to the `` hero '' is a TELL - nothing shown . Though with the length I suppose there was no alternative for the writer.When I got this a while ago , it was not listed in Christian . The one sentence description says `` redemption '' - but in a mystery /thriller ( which this is listed under genre wise ) that could hold meaning other than someone finding God . It is not uncommon for teasers and word play - rather than literal intrepretation in such genre . So , I was not expecting such a Christian heavy work . That said , it was fine once I realized the case . However , that is precicely what ruined the book as it became predictably obvious after the first Bible verse . It is unfortunate as mysteries /thriller 's should have some - well - mystery OR thrill . None of either found here.But , the thing most frustrating is that this work was really just an offering to push another ( more pricey ) book . While authors often push other works in some other novel - they do NOT devote 60 % to that other book.There are a few punctuation errors and a couple word use issues - but was well edited.I wo n't try another from this author as I can buy a magazine if I want to read ads.Christine	-1
Sorry , I did n't feel up to reading about penitentiary inmates . So I did n't go past 10 pages when I decided I would not like the read .	-1
Not believable for the hitman to go from super bad guy to born again christian , there just was not enough depth of character to make this story believable or remotely entertaining . Even though this was a short story , it felt like it was much too long . Same ole plot.I felt like it was written for a grade school reader , not an adult.I believe that a lot of the religious readers , read a religious book , and automatically give it a 5 star rating , whether it deserves it or not , just because it has some sort of religion in it .	-1
I 've read other works by Joshua Graham , so I knew what to expect before I opened this story . I made it through his other stories , but this was far too preachy for me . When I want a sermon , I 'll go to church .	-1
Again , this does not belong in Christian book list . Has bad language . so did n't even read on . Take it out for those of us who only want Christian books . Thank you	-1
There are books when you get past the first few pages you want to keep going but , with the hero you could n't get past the first page and never made it to the end of the chapter . Waste of money .	-1
I was so loving this book , but 41 pages left it unended . If this happens often I will be reluctant to order more	-1
Ok I was really getting into the story and then it stopped ! The description did n't say it was a sample ... ... am I missing something ? ?	-1
A come to Jesus , ( Damascus type conversion ) story of a hit man turned preacher . The writer 's best trick is to tell the story from the view point of another death row inmate . If it sounds line two stars is an act of charity - it is .	-1
Do n't waste your time . This is nit one of his best . I was not at all challenged by the story .	-1
Editor needed ! I found the first third of the this book to have a good story but rapidly lost interest as it went on ... and on ... and on . I do n't mind a long book ( The Stand By Stephen King is a great example ) if it goes somewhere but here I lost interest . I skipped ahead and struggled thru the last couple chapters of the hundred ( ! ) or so in this book . Too bad , with a good editor this could have been a really great read .	-1
I kept trying , I really did . I liked some of the characters , which is why it gets 2 stars and not 1 . I found the use of exclamation points that were liberally interspersed did n't add any excitement . This is the first time in a long time I 've not finished a book , but this one just could n't keep me interested . I kept hoping since I was halfway through it would get better but alas , I do n't have the willpower to try and find out .	-1
I wish that I had read the information about this very short story more carefully . This tells a tale about a hit man who horribly murders those who need it . Do n't think I 'd read any more about him or his partner .	-1
I know this book is pretty hot right now , and it 's an interesting premise for a book , but it does n't really work . It makes sense that a government program would n't work , but it also seems that if marriages were `` made '' by the government , people would just choose not to marry . I do n't understand why Rainy applies for marriage when she 's fresh out of college and just starting a career . She tries to blame it on her father 's position , but the explanation does n't really make sense . I do n't understand why she keeps going along with it when she decides she does n't want to marry the guy . And , to be honest , I just did n't like her -- or her friends , or her boyfriend . I agree with the reviewer about the need for proofreading too ! I 've seen worse , but this was was pretty bad and , I agree , distracting . So was the constant , constant use of the F word -- come on people , is this really necessary ? The ending was so , so predictable , but also pretty incomplete . We never do find out what happens with the organization she has founded , or with the rest of the people in the story . And come on , she 's always drunk . She bores me . I just finished it to see if I had the ending right , and I pretty much did .	-1
Guy : What are you reading ? Me : It 's this book about a woman who is on the run from a hit man . She leaves her entire life to hide in Key West.Guy : Why does he want to kill her ? Me : She saw him kill somebody , testified against him during the trial , and then the verdict was thrown out . He thinks that if he kills her , she wo n't be able to testify against him at the retrial.Guy : But if you kill a witness , their testimony from previous trials still goes on the record . So that would n't even work . Why was the verdict thrown out ? Me : Apparently a juror knew the victim 's widow - they went to nursery school together.Guy : That 's all ? I do n't think they 'd throw out a verdict for a nursery school connection . Why do n't the cops help her ? Me : The hit man had a cop he bought off and that cop happened to be the one assigned to track his movements . Also , she hired a bodyguard - she had enough money to do that - but she did n't like feeling watched . It made her uncomfortable.Guy : Yeah , it 's so much better just to abandon your life , job , and home than to feel uncomfortable.Me : Anyway , she marries a total stranger so she can change her name.Guy : But a name change like that leaves a record . She 'd be easy to find then . Why would a total stranger marry her ? Me : He wants a judge to give him custody of his niece so he has to marry a respectable woman to impress the judge.Guy : So she did n't even tell him that a hit man was after her ? Me : No , she did.Guy : And he lets her around his niece ? That 's crazy.Me : Yeah , there are lots of holes . I do n't even know why I 'm still reading it.Guy : Let me guess - they fall in love and overcome danger.Me : I have n't finished it yet , but probably . Probably .	-1
( Spoiler Alert ) Ten years ago the h caught the H in bed with her best friend . Because of this , the h leaves town and starts a singing career . After becoming a huge success as a country singer , she returns to her home town and comes face to face with the H and his daughter . They greet each other and act as though they were good friend separated by distance and time , not a huge betrayal . As a reader you rationalize that the child was there and so were other people so maybe that was why the lack of emotion but this same lack of anger continues throughout the book . When they meet again , the H informs the h that he had actually ended up marrying the OW but she died a few years back . The h then cries about what an awful friend she was for not being there for her best friend and how sorry she was that she was dead and unable to apologize to her for all the hurtful things that she had said to her . WHAT ? ! ! ! So ... the best friend sleeps with the H and the h is apologizing ? The story continues pretty much with the same tone . IMO , the H did nothing to win the h back or to build trust again , it just happens as though it was a given : the h will take the H back . The reconciliation was too easy and the H was completely unimpressive . All his actions spoke of a man with little passion or action . For example , the h sees him in bed with her best friend but he wo n't go after her because he believes she should go . He thought that the OW might have been lying about the paternity of the baby after they had sex but he marries her anyway . The OW had a miscarriage , the reason he married her , but he stays married . This H sucks ! Worse of all , the entire story they kept talking about the OW as though she was not a huge source of betrayal among them . Things like `` your house is beautiful , she must have really loved it '' and while skating mentioning how the OW went skating with the daughter all the time or what a wonderful mother the OW was.The comment that the h said to the H mom towards the end of the book pretty much sums up the book : `` I should have stayed and fought for him . '' Really ? Because in my book I would fight to get rid of a man who would sleep with my best friend , made no effort to make amends and then complained about how hard HIS life was because everyone knew he cheated on her . I have read brilliantly written stories about reconciliations before ; this one is simply not one of them .	-1
Delia has a very distant relationship with her father , but that does n't mean she is n't devastated when her childhood home , Steward House burns in a fire . Her father is left in a coma as a result . Not having much money , and knowing she will have substantial medical bills in the near future for her father , she decides to sell Steward House to Grant Wolverton . She has had a crush on Grant since childhood , but he does n't remember her . Very wealthy , Grant who deals in antiques and art , offers to restore Steward House , and Delia reluctantly hands over the deed for a great sum of money.Delia herself is a stone conservator - but that is not where her special abilities end . She can also communicate with the stone statues . They keep her company but they have also made her the town outcast . Stories have been swirling about her odd behavior in the small town she is from . Now that she is back in that small town , gossip starts again . Afraid to let Steward House go completely , she offers to take over the remodel . Grant agrees - and neither can quite let go of the attraction that is building between them . But the question of who set the fire is still unsolved and there is another woman in town who has her eyes set on Steward House and Grant.Stone Kissed is an odd little book . I say that because it is different - and I really wanted to like it . But I had some problems . It starts off rough and the first third of the book I had a really hard time with . The sentences and changes from scene to scene were jerky and not smooth . I did n't understand Grant and had a hard time with the intense attraction Delia feels for him . About halfway through things start to settle down and I became more immersed in the story . It is a dark book . Delia has an awful relationship with her father who is now comatose so she has guilt in that area . She had to give up her home which she feels a great connection to , and she has to figure out these intense feelings for Grant . I had a hard time buying into the romance . The actual sex scenes are very sensual , but I did n't get Grant 's love for Delia . Delia herself has had a crush on Grant for years , so her side makes more sense . But for most of the book , Grant thinks Delia is delusional for her claim to talk to statues and he thinks she is a thief for taking his statues from him . Yet he still falls in love ? I buy into the fact he lusted after her and likes her in his bed , but not love.I liked the statue aspect and how they interacted with Delia . I also think the villain in this story is well done - nothing is held back in terms of the evil emanating from her . But the overall tone of the book is so dark and depressing . I tend to like darker books , but there was n't anything to grasp onto as we waded through the serious stuff . I never quite understood Delia and Grant . And when I do n't believe in the love between the hero and heroine , I ca n't be satisfied by the story .	-1
NO SPOILERS or plot summaries . I do refer to some events that occur , but nothing I would call a spoiler . Recommendations for alternative reading included.HIGH LEVEL : This shining example of a train-wreck plot is either a standalone book or potentially the beginning of a new series from the talented Ms. Arend . More erotic than her other books , this paranormal romance is full of hot encounters in unlikely places . Unfortunately , while it has its fun moments , this is a real mess of a story and very far away from the level of her other work . Atmosphere is light and very playful and some of the erotica well done , but the storyline is convoluted and forced and the characters are wooden.PLOT : Awkward and stilted- these two characters are thrown together under bizarre circumstances that make no sense whatsoever- even to them . Supposedly both are competent law enforcement officers of some kind , but seem to lack skill in actually solving their own mystery . Very strange connections are made between characters and then abandoned . The criminal investigation that exists as a subplot to the romance is never clarified and ends up getting resolved in a flash of confusion.Random events occur here and there that serve no purpose at all- El 's parents ' inexplicable living situation wherein they suddenly live in a mansion ( not kidding- it sprang up out of nowhere while El was busy avoiding home for no reason ) , the arrival of high profile guests at her parents ' home when they are supposed to be just your average furry Americans , El having to give up her beloved motorcycle to an ex-beau ... I was left wondering WHY many of the scenes were written.CHARACTERS : Shallow and undeveloped . Kyle 's entire character summed up in one word : SEX . In fact , for the first third of the book I do n't think he has a single non-sex related thought . Do n't get me wrong- I LOVE erotica , but he just seemed to be a caricature instead of a character . When he finally showed interest in his work the only investigating he undertook was on the internet . El was a little better , but she was confusing . She represses her `` cat side '' to fit in at work , but the book opens with her seducing Kyle in a public changing room ? Supposedly there was some tension between herself and her family , but it never materialized in the story- there was just no reason for her to not have stayed in touch with her family and they never fought , no tension , nothing . She has issues with marriage for no apparent reason . No other characters even make an impact on the story , really.ROMANCE : No thrill in the chase here , guys . No playing hard to get and no real deepening of emotion either . The second half of the book was better than the first , as there seemed to be some genuine affection between the two , but by that point it was clear to me that this was just a silly trip down the yellow brick road . There was precious little development along the romance side of things . They went from 60 to zero back to 60 overnight and stayed there . Essentially : seduction , capture , refusal to have sex , mindless capitulation and then bunnies all over the place . I mean really- just because they were forced to stay in the same room they had NO CHOICE but to sleep in the same bed ? Even that silly Sandra Bullock/Ryan Reynolds movie was able to work around that issue . There was no compelling reason , not even a SEXY reason , for them to have to give in to their attraction . The end did n't find them escalating their relationship any more than they already had . It was a sweet ending , but honestly anti-climactic and since so much of the rest of the story had not been explained it was a little like exchanging gifts in a burning building.BOTTOM LINE : Do n't bother with this one . Terrible example of Ms. Arend 's work . Her characters are usually sweet and sexy and here they were just crude and flat . No real thought went into this story- it was just a complete mess . The romance was unromantic , the mystery was n't mysterious , the larger world had potential but any tendril of plot that had potential to paint a bigger picture faded into nothing.RECOMMENDATIONS:1 .

This was definitely not my favorite of all of this series . One star off for just the amount of translations I had to interpret . This definitely takes way more away from the story line than it ever adds ! Another star off for the poor story line . It was just too disjointed for me . When I noticed I started to skip more and more instead of reading it all , I knew it was not a well written story line . When Leo went chasing after Li'a , it just never went right for me . Here is a savvy man who is going after someone who just never adds up . Then when the ending is like it was , with the entire reason for the book , the chase for the stock coupons , not mattering anyway to their owner , it just fell too flat . Too many deaths with too little justification . Definitely not my favorite . Sex is in here , but not as explicit as it could get . Still , all in all , it was not anything I can recommend to anyone to buy nor read . The last star off for just not even an average book with such a disjointed story line .	-1
I love short stories ; I love the wow factor of them . But a short story must be tightly written ; each word must serve a purpose . This story failed to deliver . The little twist at the end seemed to me to be self-serving , a cheap trick , and no reason is given for the main character 's demise . No , not everything has to be explained , but there needs to be logic , especially in a short story , or the suspension of disbelief never occurs .	-1
Trisha Robinson was rookie cop on her first training ride when she and her partner are called to investigate a routine prowler report . They stumble into a hostage situation with her partner being killed and herself locked in the truck of a car that was dumped into a lake . Managing to escape from the car is just the beginning of Robinson 's ordeal . She is able to help Ally , one of the hostages escape and together they begin an ordeal of escape , capture and flight from their captives.From that point on the story is one event after the other ; physical and mental tasks that just do n't end . There are too many ordeals , too many death defying escapes and experiences . There are near drownings , spelunking experiences , wilderness adventures , killings , recaptures and recalls of childhood traumas . So many that you lose track of the original story and you just become tired of the multitude of improbable eventsHowever , the epilogue made it clear . This book was an earlier work , written under a pseudonym of Brian Harper . That provided an insight into the stark difference in writing styles between this book and other works of Mr. Prescott . I am relieved .	-1
The elf child does something wrong and instead of owning up to it , runs away , and hides in what turns out to be Santa 's sack . The elf 'redeems ' himself by saving Santa from a snowman with a karate kick to the snow man . The disobeying and then running away plot is overused in a lot of self-published children 's books . The whole first part of the story about the toys being manufactured factory-style instead of hand-made by elves was dull to my grandkids . Hard to get them to make it to the end of the story . I thought the karate kick to the snow man was ridiculous but it was funny to them and actually the only part of the book they responded to .	-1
Although the story is modern and quite imaginative , I find it lacking in the true spirit of Christmas which I believe is peace and love . It could do without the high-tech references and the karate chop . Would n't present to my young grandchildren .	-1
This had potential ; the premise is silly but I can go along with that for good sex . This was not . Cliched writing and awkward sex scenes . And 'the blond ' and 'the brunet ' ... I wo n't even read free slash that uses those nouns to refer to the characters . What was the editor of this book thinking ? The writing overall is reasonable , outside of the awful 'blond ' and 'brunet ' references , but the sex scenes lacked realism .	-1
I only got about halfway through this book before giving up . The character development was poor , and the storyline boring .	-1
This sounded like an interesting work , but instead reading it was just work . Maybe a good editor could have turned this one around . Not a keeper .	-1
Can not say..as every time try to read it , I just can't.Maybe its just not the book for me at this time . Maybe can do so at another time .	-1
Faricy 's other books are for the most part entertaining , but this is just disgusting . I bought it based on his others and regret I spent my 99 cents .	-1
Not sure if I express this understandably but this books just had too many unneccessary words . It just did not flow in parts . I ended up skipping many pages to get to the point . Ending was a bit unclear .	-1
I wanted this book to work out , but it kept getting wordier and wordier with the mental illness issue and the drug abuse issue . There was not one character who had any redeeming characteristics . Everyone in the story had issues from their lives that caught up to them at the time of the story . The author hit on child abuse , drug abuse , teenage pregnancy , mental illness , abuse of women times two , the issue of a gay teenager coming out of the closet , police stupidity , a protagonist who was an idiot , and an antagonist so far out in left field that he was the least believable character . Then there was the endless talking with nothing to say . Each character pointed their finger at some other cause for their dilemma without one ounce of responsibility , a murder mystery with no mystery as to the killer . The ending was stupid . The idea that the father and son could help the mother through rehab . All in all a poor excuse for a murder mystery . Rob Cornell will not get me to second novel .	-1
the story line was interesting but charavters are very inconsistant . not a fan of his writing style . surely a math teacher would not swear like that .	-1
I could not make it through these books . Each one was worse than the other . I like this kind of genre but these were poorly written and not worth the money I paid to read them .	-1
Although both stories appeared promising , neither was complete and were not interesting enough to cause me to search for the endings . Do not download . Unlike most free books on kindle , this one is a promise unfulfilled !	-1
To be fair , the first 'story ' or part of the book ( am not sure how to classify it ) is quite gripping . I kept reading thinking it would have continued on for a bit more but I was disappointed . Personally , I think it could have been developed into a longer short story . I really wanted to know how things ended.The other 'story ' is pretty much along the same lines . Very little development . Am wondering if it 's an idea that the author was working on and decided to throw out there . Fortunately the copy I have is free so no love lost.The third part is and interview and to be totally honest , I skipped it.I gave it two stars because the stories grabbed my attention so I do n't hate the book but I certainly do n't like it in its current format at least .	-1
Lucidity : A Ghost of a Love Story is a paranormal romance novel in the Gothic tradition . Grace Moran is a widow and an agoraphobic . She 's in the hospital about to undergo surgery . She 's terrified because she fears she will lose her spiritual connection with her dead husband if she has the surgery . He was murdered and Lukas , his killer , is undergoing treatment for his mental condition in the same hospital to which Grace was admitted . The narrative is rounded out by two other patients also undergoing intense medical treatment . Lukas and Grace are intertwined in both the past and present through Jimmy 's murder and his returning spirit.In order to flesh out this connection between murderer and survivor , Lyons shifts time in the narrative . We jump from past to present and back as Lyons draws a more complete picture of the history that led us to this point . Unfortunately , the myriad of details thrust upon us do not always make direct connections to the present . The details often felt superfluous and pointless . Just as we were digging our way out of Jack the Ripper , we 're thrust into a debate on the right to die issue . And then there 's that sex with a ghost thing ... the narrative began to feel like a maze with each turn taking a more bizarre angle.This was my first novel from CJ Lyons . I 've read a lot of praise for her work , but this one failed to impress me . Bizarre , disjointed , and far from paranormal , I was never sure what Lyons wanted me to be reading . What was the point here ? Was this a medical thriller ? A paranormal romance ? A ghost story ? The novel just never came together entirely .	-1
I have n't used this much ; but did read it . It seems to be written for a different person than me .	-1
This book was boring and drawn out and there was n't anyone tolike in the book . Glad when it ended .	-1
Just could not read this . Maybe if I could have stuck it out past the first few flips it would have settled down and actually told the story rather than having everything described in strange metaphors . This is the second book I 've read where I 've had to stop because the attempt to be descriptive overwhelms everything else to the point where it 's hard for me to figure out what the author is even trying to say . After about the fourth time of having to re-read a sentence because six or more words [ sometimes correctly hyphenated , sometimes not ] were used instead of the one perfect adjective , I stopped.Seemed like the characters might have been interesting and likeable but I could n't get far enough into the story to comment on much else .	-1
Eva Marie Everson 's solo books are great but the Potluck Series was on the fluffy side . In a moment of weakness and a desire to read clean stuff , I took this one ( out of turn - that 's not the problem ) from the Catering series . We should challenge our Christian brothers and sisters to better writing . I call myself old fashioned , but corny is the word best describing this story . Note to authors : use of `` the good Lord '' by characters under age 80 sounds cheesy and fake . The `` mystery '' was too easy , the Christian elements mostly consisted of updating a church , and the book ended too abruptly- like the word count had been reached and Boom .	-1
So short it would n't fill a coffee break and was spoilt by the author telling the reader the twist in the second paragraph .	-1
This is the most frustrating book I have read in a long time . The blurb sounded great but the moment I started reading I regretted it . I found myself skimming more than reading because the story was too confusing to do anything else . In the story , the heroine , Tammy , use of words/language was jolting throughout the story . She seemed to speak as though she was out of touch with reality , then again , maybe she was . The story timeline is so off that I had a hard time distinguishing how much time had passed . The sex scenes seemed forced and only added in because the author had to make this a romance somehow . It has been a long time since I felt like I have wasted my money on a book and I have to say this was one . I think this author has potential but it definitely was n't reached here . I ca n't recommend this book .	-1
Started out with an interesting story , but once the characters became intimate , the language turned vulgar and totally ruined it for me . Descriptions can be creative , they do n't have to be crude .	-1
the plot dragged along way too slow . I gave up around 60 % through and paged to the end to see & # 34 ; who done it & # 34 ; because I was too curious to not know .	-1
This is not great literature . There were grammatical errors that I thought were really errors , but some of the weird sentences seemed to be the author 's attempt to talk like a Texan . Or maybe not.I actually liked the characters . The names did n't bother me . ( My new son-in-law is a Bubba . ) And I laughed at the humor . I really thought it was funny . I liked the storyline , for the most part.But the reason I 'm giving it one star is the profanity . If profanity bothers you , you will hate this book . Some of the bad language is not bad at all , and in fact adds to the humor , but when the author gets profane , he/she really gets profane . So be forewarned .	-1
I got to 65 % and gave up . It just did n't hold my interest . The idea seemed good , but the execution was lacking . This book was boring , including the romance . Nothing resonated with me ; I could n't have cared less about the characters and what happened to them . Very disappointing .	-1
I did n't finish reading the book so I ca n't fully give it any rates . It started off okay have to finish it when I get a chance .	-1
All i can say is i am glad this was a free book . It has been 2 months and i can not finish this book . It 's very slow . I can not get pass chapter five . I would no pay for this book..	-1
I love , LOVE Peter Pan stories . I always wondered about his beginnings and what happened after the Darlings went home from Neverland . This book tries to tackle the story of what happened after the Darlings left , but I do n't think it quite worked . First off when the original story of Peter Pan was told the story was set in England probably in the early 1900 's ? When there was no electricity nor cars . This story is supposedly 5 years later when the Darlings came home from Neverland and all of a sudden they are in the 21st century . HUH ? Do n't get why the author had to change the time period . I was hoping this story would be more like the series I had read by Barry/Pearson starting with `` Peter and the StarCatchers '' . This series starts out before Peter became Peter Pan ! Great imagination on what made Peter Peter Pan . It even tells us how Peter met Tinkerbell ! ! ! ! And you wo n't believe what Tinkerbell really is ! There 's also another book by a different author about Capt . Hook . It was also a wonderful story of what made James Hook become Hook . The name of the book is called , `` HOOK '' . These are some great stories about the characters that were from the original Peter Pan novel . Check them out they are a better read than this one .	-1
I read the book because of all the good reviews , but it does not own up . The book is just not good . The story is boring and predictable . The main character likes a good fight ... ok , now what ? Seriously I feel like I got ripped off by purchasing the book and then I wasted my time reading it . You can check out my other reviews , I do n't hardly ever say anything negative about a book , but this one irks me .	-1
The reactions and emotions of the characters just did n't ring true . I found myself skipping sections just to finish and did n't like the ending .	-1
I got this book because I picked it up for free . Stupid me even read the rest of the series when I was able to get them for free as well hoping that the main character grew . It was like reading the diary of hormone-raging 14 year old boy ! Really , at times I wondered if that was n't what the author was . I would have at least thought the sex scenes would be better , not glossed over and left out . Ugh .	-1
I needed a quick , in-between books , book to read , and this fit the bill . MMA fighter Josiah inadvertantly gets himself mixed up with a gang of vampires . He has two love interests - one a vampire , the other seemingly human.There 's nothing particularly original here . I think some other reviewer likened the book to The Lost Boys , and that 's exactly what it reminds me of , only not as good . I found the characters to be likeable , but forgettable . Nothing really happens until about 3/4 through the book , when Josiah learns one of his love interests may be in danger.There were a lot of spelling and grammar errors in the book , which might bother some readers.If you 're looking for an UF book , there are definitely much better ones out there . But there 's some potential here , so if you have nothing better to read , for 2.99 it might be worth a shot . I 'd recommend reading the sample first .	-1
Fighting may be the author 's passion or it may just be the passion he decided to give his character , but it was n't really enough to carry the entire book for me.Josiah is a young MMA fighter who , mid-training run , stumbles into the hidden world of vampires -- oh , I 'm sorry -- `` mani '' that surrounds him . He is quickly sucked into their orbit . The love story seemed a bit tangential to the story and most of the plot is conveyed during a pillow talk info dump towards the end of the book , making it difficult for me to care.The book is n't the worst written self-published paranormal out there , but there is certainly some room for improvement.Overall , the author 's world is n't really one that appeals to me that much . The details about the carni and the mani and the triat just seemed obviously contrived , as did the ending .	-1
I love this genre , but just could n't get into this book at all . In fact , I ended up giving up & just skimming it before deleting it . I got it free & I 'm glad - I would have been irriated if I had actually paid for this.Boring & completely ignorable . jmho ...	-1
As an American who lives in Latin America , I had no trouble with the many untranslated Spanish words in this short prequil . However , I do wonder how many people know what a `` Bruja '' is ? Also , aside from the making of tamales on Christmas Eve , what was Christmasy about this story ? I do n't think I will be buying any of this series . No substance ! ! !	-1
I am not often irritated by a main character but Ava Delaney has issues and I do n't believe they added to the story . i kept hoping that she would begin to embrace her role as a & # 34 ; daywalker & # 34 ; and become a strong character but I just did n't see it happening . I selected this book because I was looking for some new authors ( from the $ 0.99 or less books ) and while it has its moments , I just do n't think I can continue on with the series .	-1
I just could n't do it . This book was just too boring for me . I could n't get past the first couple chapters .	-1
Brad is in lust with his only friend , a guy who lives off of him and plays video games all day and insists he is n't gay . In fact , Brad was horribly bullied in school by the group of guys who this friend hangs out with . Brad has n't completed school as a result and barely can find the worst kind of jobs . He needs to pay the rent and goes to two old guys who run a strip-o-gram and porn business.Now , the reviewers here seem to find what happens very erotic , but I did n't find any of it erotic at all . I guess tastes really vary . I also did n't care much for Brad , who is just very sad , really . He obviously has the self-esteem of a slug . That 's not the bad part ... the thing is , he does n't change . The whole business he gets drawn into has the ugly realism of sleazy low-budget porn videos -- not to mention the whole stripper-gram thing . There is absolutely nothing the least bit romantic in this short tale . And the characters were all people I would n't want to spend a second of time with ( in fact , they all make me feel disgustingly dirty -- if that 's your idea of erotic , well , then ! ) . Again , maybe it 's just me , but I really did n't see any up-side to this story at all . I usually do n't bother to review things I do n't like ( and I like nearly everything , so this is a rare case ) , but I thought I should warn people who might not think like the other reviewers do ...	-1
I did not like this book at all . Poor Bradley ia misused and abused by everyone . He has horrible memories of high school , a roommate who is a total jerk , and his attempts to enter the gay porn industry are just disasterous . I felt really bad for him . I would not recommend this book to anyone , and be assured that I will not buy another work by this author .	-1
The main character of this book spoiled the entire story for me . She was selfish , self-absorbed and totally underserving of the hero of the novel . She was not likable at all . Because of her character 's personality , the book just never seemed to end ... .. I was ready for it to be over long before the final credits . Do something else with your time - do n't read this book . I 'll give Ms. James another try but I hope her other books are more pleasant to read .	-1
The characters in the begin sounded great , well written and what not . The plot of the book was there but at the end , I got the feeling the author just wanted to end the book fast . The end of the killed it for me . I hated how the two main characters kept fighting and fighting and making everyone unhappy . The ending kinda sucked for me they finally got together then because the both didnt want to hurt their pride went their separate ways for awhile . I 'm a picky reader so I did n't care for the book but maybe some out there will like this kind of book . Good luck .	-1
The story line was interesting enough to keep me reading to the conclusion . My initial interest was due to the location . I have personally lived through several Panhandle Blizzards , also near Amarillo , TX . However , the amount and quality of the sex was way overboard and really turned the entire book into more science fiction than anything else .	-1
I purchased this book because it came to me under the heading of being a thriller . That was far from the truth . It should have been labled soft porn or erotica perhaps . It starts out ok but then goes for chapter after chapter of nothing but sex . Oh , I guess if you want to learn how to feed a longhorn bull apples or to make chicken and dumplings it would be ok.I really did n't understand one review that said they read the book in one night , but then after I skipped over page after page trying to find something interesting , I understand .	-1
With so much potential , this book was a crushing let down . I read about 20 % to give it a fair shake , but the dialog was stilted and characters flat . It might be a decent read for a kid in the 5th or 6th grade ... the syntax was about on that level . I was very disappointed and deleted it from my Kindle .	-1
I thought this story was pretty boring but a quick read and free . I didnt see what the purpose of having a grandfather telling the kids this story which really had nothing to do with Christmas in my opinion .	-1
A very poorly written book ! I felt it was just written to capitalize on Christmas and the story line was very weak .	-1
Think i got this book for free , thank God because if i would have paid even $ .99 i would have been mad ! I agree with another reviewer that it seemed like several authors put this together , it was all over the place . One of the worst stories I 've read in years . And did anyone else think that Paul was pissed with Dale was because he wanted Dale for himself ? I was so sure that they were going to end up together or in a threesome with Janet . Either way this booked sucked .	-1
Nope sucked sorry ! So I rarely ( almost never ! ! ! ) do n't want read a book that i buy . I did finish this book and even bought the next wondering if the author would make it less flighty , likable and maybe i could try to see what the hell i was reading and if it was just me ... NOT ? ! I do n't like to wright negative reviews because i know its my opinion and the author probably worked hard and THOUGHT it was a good book but i could n't like it and believe buying the first and then forcing myself to get through it i gave up half way through the second realizing this just sucked ! So here 's what i can say ... .I did n't find Txema in ANY way relatable , her fake relationship with her boyfriend Peter was weird . I love when a author tries to take us travelling but not in this book , i almost felt it was written in Hindu or some India 's primary langues and translated poorly ( yes that sounds odd but im not sure how else to word it , which is NEVER a problem for me ? ! ) . The supporting characters made no sense and i could n't get it , a vamp cousin , a vamp to protect her , his friend and a council whose job it is to protect her , and way more that just seemed to fill the pages but not make sense . I wont give anything away ( not that i completely could convey it ? ? ? ) because everyone should get to see what they see , do n't waste the $ and if you read my other recommendations and find that they are true or similar to your taste i would say simply do n't waste your time ... ... ... ... sorry !	-1
I do believe I am in the minority here , but I thought this very , very , very short work of fiction was rather pointless . I like Marliss Melton , but this had zero romance and the intrigue was minimal as well ...	-1
A great title , but this book is certainly not for everyone . If you & # 8217 ; re not interested in the problems of mental illness or if being in a psychiatric hospital bothers you , then get a different book . If such topics intrigue you , then keep reading.Author Tara Allred has a good grasp of the basics of mental disorder , but her descriptions are often awkward . Her conversations are stilted and overly detailed . Maybe that & # 8217 ; s the way her & # 8220 ; philosopher/psychologist father and artist mother & # 8221 ; talked at home , but the lengthy , detailed conversations between the psychotherapist and his patient were quite unreal , more like a classroom discussion , which frequently made me question if I was reading a novel or a psychology textbook . Certainly these conversations were not like the crisp , blunt dialogue I have encountered in psychiatric hospitals.Even so , Tara has adequately painted a word-portrait of the mental health professional who realizes that such work is more art than science and is always and ever & # 8220 ; practicing & # 8221 ; a healing ministry . Credit Tara for her insights into the mind of the psychologist , for her main character , psychologist John Sanders , is typical of many who enter such work as a spin-off from their own struggle for self-understanding.On the other hand , dating the story is confusing . The diagnosis of one patient was done through DSM-II ( there have been at least 2 revisions published since DSM-II ) . Then another patient was diagnosed with & # 8220 ; bipolar disorder & # 8221 ; ( but DSM-II did not use that term , and any professional using the DSM-II would instead have used the term & # 8220 ; manic-depressive illness & # 8221 ; ) .There were typical grammatical problems , like & # 8220 ; I & # 8217 ; m different & # 8216 ; than & # 8217 ; the rest. & # 8230 ; & # 8221 ; Anyone with as much education as the main character had would know the correct expression is & # 8220 ; different & # 8216 ; from & # 8217 ; & # 8230 ; . & # 8221 ; And the author relied too much on her computer & # 8217 ; s spell-checker , as in using & # 8220 ; patience & # 8221 ; instead of & # 8220 ; patients. & # 8221 ; I really would like to give the book a better rating , because the author as obviously worked hard at presenting a meaningful story about a critically important topic , but it needs a dose of reality to make it work.I give it 2 stars .	-1
The grammatical errors , for an author who minored in English , were appalling . That was so distracting to me , I could n't finish the book . It seems many self published authors could either hire a good copy editor , OR learn proper verb tense and correct pronoun usage . I mean , it 's really not that difficult .	-1
CONTAINS SPOILERS -- -Boring , repetitive nonsense . My favorite was his comparing his month-long email porn with a person he NEVER met IRL , that he was subsequently dumped by ( no surprise there as George is mind numbingly self absorbed ) , to a real extra marital affair his wife had and saying that he is in love with both women ! This fake relationship he brings up over and over again ... almost like he 's bragging . Add to that he tries to get with extra marital affair guy 's wife . What on earth ? ? Really ? I guess that is what a 20+ marriage is currently worth . ( In a two decade marriage and have no idea where the heck he 's coming from ! ) I was not impressed and worse yet , bored at the same time.Edited to add : I know that some people found his writing style profound . It 's not . This is the same type of wondering thoughts that go through our minds when we ca n't sleep ie . Did I feed the dog ? Wonder if I paid the vet bill ? or the electric ? Hmm , I 'm kinda hungry ... .OH ! Did I feed the dog . UGH ! ! Not for me . Sorry	-1
Endless chatter . Unresolved plot points . Not remotely entertaining . The rambling narrative was annoying and served no purpose other than to make it a challenge to finish the story .	-1
What can I say that my title has n't already said ? This book is a long , rambling diatribe concerning marriage , fidelity ( or the lack thereof ) and open marriage . It is written in a stream of consciousness style , so it jumps around from thought to thought , sometimes maddeningly so . The premise : man married 24 years , does n't get enough so he is trying to get his wife to open up ( so to speak ) to the idea of an open marriage . Throughout the book he claims to love her yet he complains endlessly about her . When his newlywed neighbor 's wife comes over and drops the bomb that her husband and his wife are having an affair , his mind goes into action trying to work the situation to his advantage . He has , by his own admission , had an online affair which started with a misleading ad he placed on Craig 's List . He is overjoyed by the thought of his wife with another man , or men , as he feels this gives him the right to step out on her . I guess the only saving grace in his deluded thinking is that if both partners are willing to participate in sex beyond the confines of marriage , then nobody is being unfaithful because it 's all out in the open . He seems to think he has tapped into what he explains as `` the other side of jealousy '' , where you move beyond the rage and find titilation in your partner 's infidelity . I know there are others who think along these lines and practice this lifestyle , but for me this book felt like a giant sales pitch for open marriage . Perhaps that 's your cup of tea , but it 's not mine.The book had enough errors and omissions to be distracting and rambled on and on as the author presented his sales pitch ... Sorry , I ai n't buyin ' it .	-1
My revelation ? I do n't have a hair/ bald head fetish.Who would have known ? I could have gotten past that if the story had something else interesting in it . A little boring .	-1
Story was too confusing and disjointed to enjoy . Not very enjoyable for me . Maybe others . I had a hard time following the characters .	-1
Review by Jen : When I accepted this book for review , I knew it was a novella . In fact , I was looking for a short story . But I did n't expect the book to be only 20 pages . And therein lies the problem with this book . It is very bare bones . The book felt more like a plot outline of a longer story than the full book . In fact , the story was n't bad ... there was a lot of promise . As I came to the last page , I found myself wishing that we 'd learned more about the characters , spent more time with them , saw more action.I looked up Dawn 's website when I saw this was the first book in a series . I wanted to see if the next book followed Alex and Sylvia , because then maybe it would n't be so bad that this tale was so short . But , the other two books are about new couples ... all of them revolving around lighthouse keepers . And they are all about 7,000 words long . I think it would be best to either expand on these stories or package them as an anthology as it 's not worth $ 1.99 each .	-1
Contains some spoilers ... This story rates between a 1 and a 1.5 . It was very unique ... but in an peculiar way . It was kind of like Twilight meets I Am Legend.If you do not like the YA genre , then this is not the book for you . With that said , I am not a fan of the YA so I struggled reading this book . The premise of the story seems a bit too immature for an adult audience . Starla and her friend Jordan become vampires so that they can be wealthy and glamorous but the story opens with the two friends standing outside of Jordan former childhood home ; now kicked out and homeless because of her new vampiric state . The two Blood Sisters resign themselves to their new status and go looking for their first `` meal '' as vampires . They stumble upon a house with a former classmate who was reviled by Jordan because he used her sexually and then threw her away . A midnight snack and revenge at the same time ... two birds , one stone . Perfect , right ? Wrong , the girls ' effort is thwarted by a usurper . He stole their meal and drained their first meal dry ... taking away the opportunity for a meal and revenge . Darn ! Poor girls ... now , what are they gon na do , it 's not like they can pick up blood in aisle thirteen at their local grocer . Nope , they have to figure out another food source . They continue their hunting and wind up at a local nightclub . They target a young girl , a doppelg & auml ; nger for Starla according to Jordan , as their victim . The girls have their first food fight , literally , as the battle over who will win the quarry . Their first attempt of food acquiry ends in an epic failure . Their young victim escapes them while they are fighting each other over who gets to draw first blood . Starla 's `` twin '' runs back into the club shrieking and the girls end up hungry ... still.Pitiful humans turned into pathetic vampires ... not a pretty picture at all . After their failed attempt to secure food , the girls find themselves at the playground where they were turned into vampires . Their arrival at the playground commences a sequence of events that change their vampiric lives forever.I say that this book reminds me of I am Legend because the vampires were described as completely hairless ( even the females ) with a gray skintone.The story struck me as disjointed . I could see where the pieces were supposed to connect but they were done so haphazardly . It was as if puzzle pieces of the story were dumped on the floor and the reader had to put the picture together . Mystery or suspense novel provide the reader with pieces or clues so that they can put together the final picture to figure outwho done it , why 'd they do it , or what happened . However , since this book fit into neither genre it was not a particularly enjoyable experience piecing together the why 's and what 's of the story.The characters were just too juvenille to have broader appeal to an adult audience . The primary character ages were about sixteen or seventeen . Starla and Jordan were very scatterbrained ( per impulsive descision to become a vampire without thinking through the ramifications ) ; shallow ( Starla vandalized and robbed a store to get a leather coat , boots , and sunglasses ) ; and whiny ( Starla did n't want to drink blood which made her weak ... human ... but raged and moaned when someone refered to her as such ) . Such a spastic trichotomy.Then there was the whole storyline of Mercer 's grandfather being able to purify Starla 's blood since she had n't drank human blood . They were going to perform a dialysis of sorts and remove her blood , purify it , and put it back into her body and voila the vampire demon would be excised from her body turning her into a half-human , like Mercer . Dialysis ... hmmm ... really ? ! ? ! The description of the entire process was just too pedestrian . The story definately could have been made more if that storyline and process had been fleshed out a bit more.My feelings on the book are neutral ; I did not totally hate it but , most likely , will not read it again . The book began with automatic strike for me because it was a YA which I do not typically read . However , in spite of my non-YA book policy , I have read one or two others and actually enjoyed them because they appealed to me on an intellectual level . The stories were mature in a way that elminiated the teen fiction novel feel . Unfortunately , this book was just too teenyboppery for me to really enjoy .	-1
I received this e-book for review from Bewitching Book Tours as part of the author 's virtual book tour . I did not receive any compensation for my review , and the views expressed herein are my own.A book with both vampires AND werewolves ? What could be better ? The book cover of the female vampire biting into the male is very eye-catching and appealing . The book trailer is equally appealing . I should have loved this book ... I wanted to love this book ... but there are two reasons primarily why this did n't happen and both can be remedied.I actually think the plot of the story is pretty good : A vampire is hired to hunt down a werewolf . I think that the book could potentially be very good with more character development which , perhaps , could be achieved by extending the length of the novella . It is fun to enjoy a bad-ass protagonist like Rose , but I think she could be even better ! I particularly liked the character of Bobbie , the fire witch.Unfortunately , the review copy that I was given is fraught with grammatical and spelling errors , which made it difficult to read and interfered with my enjoyment of the book.With a good editor and more character depth , the book could be improved.MY RATING : 1 star	-1
There was no romance . The story got set up for him to get paid to pretend to court her so that fortune hunters left her alone but then you were told that they spent time together . One second they are saying goodbye at her family function on their first outing and then it is weeks later and they are n love . Also , the author apparently does not know what last name she wanted for the heroines family . It was Barnswell , Barnes , Barnard , and I think a couple more which is ridiculous in a 25 page story . How can you not remember your characters ' names ? ? ? Also there are proofreading issues . It was just a waste of money and time !	-1
I 've enjoyed some of Jacqueline Diamond 's books - I know they are n't blockbusters but they are entertaining . This one really was n't good at all . The H & h were not particularly well drawn and so I never got a strong feeling for either one of them or really understood why they were doing the things they did - nor did I care . There was a very unnecessary scene with a secondary character that really should not have been in the book . SPOILER ... One of the male characters attempts to rape the heroine when he thinks she is just an orphaned governess ( not a & # 34 ; lady & # 34 ; ) . A female character interrupts the attempt and scolds him but proceeds to marry him later in the book . Why does she marry a would-be rapist ? Well , she 's unattractive and a little overweight so despite her money she ca n't really get a man who is n't poverty stricken and is completely lacking in morals . Poorly done .	-1
I read all the reviews before I got this book so was so disappointed I did n't even finish it . The wife wanted her own way always and her mother was incredibly mean . The father was a total jerk and the husband was a wimp . What 's to like here ?	-1
Always had a secret desire to be a spy ? Unknowingly the son of a spy finds that he needs to be more than he thought possible . Although , not a teenager myself this story took me back to a time when I used many of the techniques that spy 's use to keep out of trouble in a troubled land . I enjoyed the book and would like to see more . This is more likely to appeal the mid-teens , rather than the almost adults .	-1
This is the first time I have ever given a book a one star rating but it was terrible , I found myself skipping pages hoping I would finally find a part where it started to improve . I could not believe this author is supposed to be an established writer as it read as if it was the first attempt by a hopeful teenaged writer.I was left with the impression that the author wanted to make it as `` exciting '' as possible and thus threw in event after event without wasting time on such details as good character development . Descriptions were horrendous such as `` ... she was happy with her cheerleader-like looks and athletic body '' for the description of the main character , Jessica , in the book.There were also jarring word usages that did not fit in with what little characterization we were given . For example , a policeman who up until this point in the book has spoken in fairly standard English suddenly tells Jessica , `` You might be heroes , '' Patterson frowned , `` but I 'm still angry at how you disrespected me . `` As a further example of how the dialogue in this book progresses , Patterson then complains about how much paperwork he will have because of Jessica . Jessica looks out the window and replies `` Sorry . Please do n't take it personally . '' There is a lot of that snippiness in the book from the main characters who we are apparently supposed to respect for their tenacity in keeping going when everyone else is going into hysterics and making false accusations.Then there is the fact that perhaps it would have been easier to suspend disbelief and accept such things as the `` coincidence '' that leads Jessica to find out about the job in Salem and the willingness of her parents to allow her to accept a job that she was hired for over the phone without the person hiring her knowing anything about her other than she was an almost 18 year old girl who lived two states away . Or the fact that once there , Jessica meets two girls who behave questionably and yet almost immediately considers them to be trustworthy friends and thus is willing to go into a cemetary crypt at night with them after knowing them less than one day . Jessica is repeatedly talked out of calling the police for help when one of the new friends disappears by the other new friend who appears less than stable ( to put it mildly . ) Yes , Jessica , who repeatedly shows a lack of judgement and whose only growth in the story is a willingness to accept that the supernatural actually is real is the main character of the story . I was never able to identify with her or any other character in this story . The only emotions this story caused in me were shock that this was not written by a brand new writer and relief when I reached the end.I do not recommend this book at all .	-1
Book is O.K.I am reviewing because this comes up under `` Childrens Stories '' ? I believe Amazon should have an age setting ( my daughter is 6 ) to make this catagory more appropriate .	-1
This was basically just a short teaser to get you interested in buying other books . To be honest it 's hard to judge whether the books will be good or not because this snippet is so short . I 'm giving it two stars partially because I find it annoying when they offer these free chapters as if they 're giving you a book or novella with an actual story and it turns out to be only a few pages with no real point . If I want to see a chapter or whatever of a book they usually have the option to read a paragraph or page so there 's no point to the free downloads like this one.If you 're going to give me a novella or something make it a little longer and give me something with more story that will hook me into your books .	-1
This short story ( really short ) started off really good . Then when I turn to the next page thinking it was more of the story , it goes into a preview , I was more than a bit disappointed . Even though it was free , if I had known it was this short , I would n't have even bothered . It took me about as long to read the story as it did to download it .	-1
This is more like a chapter than even a novella . There 's no plot , no sex , no animals , ... I do n't get it- it must be a `` preview '' , though I do n't remember seeing that in the description . I would n't buy the book , either , if this is a preview . It 's a high school-drama book .	-1
Her stories had a good foundation to build on -- but the stories felt incomplete - often important information only having a few sentences in between utter rubbish- some of it was quite silly-I felt there was to much going on in all of her stories- Between all three stories I felt little to no connection with the lead characters in the book.Book one was my least favorite . While the story could of been great I felt that somethings did n't match up- or were poorly executed.Book 2 - was n't as bad as the other 2 - Still had a feeling of it being incomplete-book 3- Felt like an ongoing tug of war- At the end I did n't care what outcome it would have -- Yes , I finished all three books and why- well I am not sure .	-1
After reading the synopsis , this really did look like a good read . Then I started to read it . From the very get go , Alice comes off as an immature , whiney , brat . Yes we 've all got dreams of finding true love but here 's was almost an obsession . ( Remember that would for later ) . Gabriel was just as bad when his character came off as heartless , rude , and condescending . Then again I guess that was the only way to tolerate Alice.The story itself was all over the place but the one detail that stood out was Alice was practically stalking Gabriel . The girl just could n't take a hint . Over and over and over and over he tried pushing her away . Even if he did n't want to , he still did it . But she refused to budge . Yes , persistence can be beneficial if it 's done correctly but Alice was almost in need of psychiatric help . Then after , basically , forcing him to have sex with her ( which was obsolete in the book ) she would settle for friends with benefits even though she 's in love with him ? Wtf ? I 'm not really sure what the author was thinking when she wrote the book but it could 've used a bit more thought . Sorry Miss Quinn .	-1
An awful , rushed , careless cowboy imitation of The Clans of Kalquor , a much better series . *SPOILERS*The brothers practically jumped on her at first sight , groping and dominating her within hours without any consideration to her feelings at all . They take her virginity without even slowing down or preparing her , *all* of her virginity . They find out how old she was , almost a hundred years ago , and *gasp* she 's suddenly jailbait . `` Oh ick , we do n't want you any more , and we do n't care about your safety either '' There was nothing redeemable about this book at all . I read almost everything else by this author and loved it all . That makes this one just that much more a slap in the face .	-1
Again with the BDSM . Not much of a story . Characters cartoonish . The only reason for writing this dreck is to show how a woman should be punished during sex , and the 17 year old virgin is supposed to like it ! A four way sex scene would be difficult to manage , and that 's not what bothers me . Using someone and calling it love bothers me . If you like books that describe sex as a violation , then you will like this .	-1
I 'm sorry , but there is just no way you can tell a decent love story in 8,000 words . The plot was so far-fetched and absurb , seriously they have sex less than ten minutes after they meet , and in a car no less , come on . The writing was n't bad , but there was just no way I could get an honest feel for the characters or get into the story in such a short time . If you 're only going to write 8,000 words , why bother ? Yes it was free , but still , I ca n't give it more than a two star .	-1
it was free but i was not a big fan . felt like author was just trying to write something to fill a quota	-1
Wow , this is not for the faint of heart..when they mean explicit and graphic ... it really does n't even begin to cover it ! The vampire theme was n't played up as I thought it would be and lacked romance . This was just pure sex . If you 're looking for `` that '' type of book , this is for you . I do n't mind the descriptive nature of some books , but this was overkill . Author could be great and story could have been great ... if there had been more `` story '' to it . Hope the author takes things to a different level . Will check back on her later .	-1
Look I like erotica as much as the next healthy female , but there is a thin line between tastefully done erotica and quite frankly XX PORN . And that is what this is . Story line is little more than raunchy sex scenes . And the first 3 books in the series should have a warning label to that effect . So if you like the loads of sex and little or no story that makes you care for the characters , well this is for you . If you want a story , stay way from this series .	-1
I loved Tina ' s Scanguard books so thought I would love this . It is beyond vulgar . It 's not sexy or even enthralling . The vamp is nothing more than a voyeuristic pig . He uses every vulgar word to his `` love '' , and treats her worse than a filthy pig . Not for me .	-1
the sex in this was hot and erotic but it does not match the story . The language was very modern and at times I found myself lost trying to figure out the era . I am a Tina Folsom fan and I like book 2 of this series but I would have been ok to never read this one .	-1
Do n't give up on this author based on this book . Her `` Seared by Desire '' and `` Whilrwind '' are great stories . This book unfortunately has a TSTL heroine and so many holes in the world of believability that I ca n't believe it 's the same author . Also , there are needed details on the world building.Here 's the list of what went wrong for me while reading this story : - the heroine has way too many bad things happen to her . She is too much the victim at the age of almost 21 . You never figure out why her mother allowed her husband to beat her almost to death and was nothing but abusive and certainly never a provider . When the behavior of the father is so callous , yet the mother and the heroine stick around for it , you need a better reason other than that for the mother `` she loved him '' ( what total lack of self esteem was she facing ? ) and for the heroine ( she tried to run away but he convinced the authorities he cared - hello , she 's an adult , he has no legal hold over her and the law would have been on her side , not to mention shelters to help her get on her feet ) .- the school bully . Really ? As another reviewer noted , this is junior high behavior , not university . It was another unnecessary enemy added to force the reader to feel sorry for the heroine.- the heroine has zero friends because of her awful home life . Uhh , if she is that traumatized , no way is she ready to become queen of a society she knows nothing about . If anyone had as lousy of a life as she had , then serious counseling would be needed - no way could she have turned out okay without assistance/support over a long period of time.- when she finds out that there are such things as werewolves and she is a witch , there is very little to almost zero curiosity on her part . Her first thoughts should be Holy Shxxxt ! You 're a werewolf , what does that mean ? I 'm a witch ? What are my powers ? etc . Instead , the author wastes story time on long drawn out dialogues on whether the father should be killed.- where is the world building for the werewolf society ? Where is this `` kingdom '' in the US ? How do they live under the radar and exactly how do they make their money ? - over use of the statement : `` I should kill you '' That threat is issued for something as small as an advisor suggesting that the hero should throw in the towel on waiting for his true mate to everything else .	-1
Benny is not a story I would recommend and as others have said , it is NOT a child 's book . While parts were engaging , overall I did not like the story . The ending was confusing . I went back through to see a description to find out why it ended the way it did and it did n't help that the author changed Milo 's color from purple and yellow ( when he was 1st introduced ) to purple and orange at the end . As another reviewer said , some of the story was almost creepy . Unlike others , I found the book almost `` dark '' instead of uplifting or sweet .	-1
I hate that I did n't enjoy this book . The plot was OK , I just found the character to be sort of flat and uninteresting . It took me a while to complete the book as I would pick it up , get bored , and not come back to for weeks . I hope to check out some of the author 's other work , but ca n't say I would recommend this book to anyone .	-1
The title is very accurate on the content . It is the very basics on sewing with photos . If you know nothing about sewing ( and I do mean NOTHING ) and you are curious about sewing , then this will explain what sewing is about . If you wish to learn how to sew , you should skip this book since other sewing books will provide this information and a whole lot more .	-1
I was really disappointed by this book . From the description and some of the reviews , I thought it sounded like a great story . It really could have been a good book , if there was actually a story to read . There was no substance to this book , just an idea and some sex scenes thrown together . There were some parts in the book where the author tried to pull some history/ alternative characters into the book , but it ended up just being confusing , b/c there was n't enough information about any one character or ANYTHING to give even a base knowledge about ANYTHING ! There was one part in particular where it went straight from the Heroine getting ready to climax , to something completely different ! The sex scenes were completely unbelievable and ridiculous . There were several times where I got confused and had to go back a re-read several parts in the book , b/c they just did n't make sense ! Everything felt very rushed from one sex scene to the next . I really wanted to like this book , but there was just nothing to the book to like . I think if the book was longer , more detail about locations , characters , and history then it could be a good book . As is , I think this book was totally overpriced for what you get and I wo n't be making any further purchases from this author .	-1
I did n't expect this to be such a short read . Luckily I have free books to compensate for the price of this one . It 's difficult for me to buy the fact that the hero stayed celebate for 2 year ( in that era ! ) from the moment he saw & started lusting for the heroine ... .not too convincing . If you like quick short read filled with lusty lovemaking scenes this is the book for you . Not that there 's anything wrong with that in romance novels but I prefer it to be surrounded with some level of intrigue & adventure . I felt the story did n't really allow me to sink in for any gratification out of it . I have read some short stories with a little more meat in it .	-1
I did n't like this at all . It was n't at all what I was expecting to read.Nothing else to say about it . I would n't recommend this to anyone.It is a waste of money .	-1
Another one I did n't care for . My granddaughter chose it and I just did n't care for it at all . She thought it would be interesting but it was n't to my taste .	-1
Started stong ... ..but left me cold . The story had a promising plot . I did n't read the reviews because I 've read this author before and I liked her books . After investing my time to read this book I wish I had . I liked Ted and all the guys at the beginning . They seemed to have a special friendship . Everything was going well until Ted looses his grandmother . His whole attitude towards Caroline was disgusting . After profesing his undying love , making her his wife and promising to be with her no matter what . What does he do ? ... . Closes her out and then outright leaves her ? ? ? ? After she gave everything up for him ? ? After the second wedding when she gave him an OUT ! She moved for him and was willing to follow him where ever he chose to go . He uproots himself and changes his whole life and when she asks him what she 's supposed to do he pretty much tells her he does n't care . He gets himself a new life . But what totally disgusted me was that he took off his ring..for him the marriage was over . When Smitty sends him the invitation he goes running to see him ! ? ! ? Really ? ! ? ! After not even wanting his wife 's own name mentioned ? ? ? ? At Smity 's party he 's fine sitting next to Caroline ( who he has n't seen in two months ) . After he is forgiven by his friends he even toasts him but does not mention his wife . Only after she leaves does he even think of apologising to her ( after he has the approval from everyone-he could n't handle going against the world for her -- - His grandmother would 've been so disappointed in him ) .. I liked Caroline throughout the story . However , when he left she did not get control of her life and did something she said she would n't do again -- -loose herself to a man . -- -- She was going to wait for him to come back to her ? ! ? ! ? Really ? ! ? ? After the way he left her ? ! ? ! And all the things he said to her ? ! ? ! But what frustrated me the most was that she let him come back without any consequence to his actions.Really ? ! ? ! They never really discussed it and just because he wanted to come back she welcomed him with open arms ? ! ? ! REALLY ? ! ? ! ! ! ! ! I was disappointed to say the least ! !	-1
NOTE : THIS REVIEW IS FILLED WITH SPOILERS ****************There are many things that are objectionable in this story so let me start with the positive side : I did n't throw it across the room AND I did think a lot about the plot and how characters might react to this type of situation . It takes a certain level of writing to create a story that stays with you ; unlike so many other romances , I will remember this one . Hence two stars instead of one.Unfortunately , this does n't begin to outweigh the minuses of this book . I 'll only mention the most egregious.First I was n't even vaguely convinced of Ted and Caroline 's overwhelming love for each other . It was definitely tell do n't show . But let 's say we accept the overwhelming strength of this love , it made it was still unbelievable that he knowingly threw away his closest friendships after only knowing her a week and knowing NOTHING about her . This in turn led to one of the biggest inconsistencies of the book : if Ted 's love was so great , why on earth did he leave his beloved new wife when he realized the consequences of his actions ? After all , she was all he had left . None of that made sense and just made you dislike Ted -- he is a self-indulgent jerk.Also , I usually greatly enjoy books that also include the other friendships of hero and heroine , but in this book the men all behaved like teenage girls ( and I do n't only mean that they cried a lot ) . Also , the light look into the romances of Ted 's friends was all a bit strange : you get part of their stories but not enough to make you care.As for Caroline : after reading the entire book , I still know nothing of HER backstory ( I knew more about Ted 's friend Smitty who is a secondary character ! ) I did n't know what made her tick at all and felt that she was just a cardboard figure moving through the book . It would have helped to know a bit more about her to help explain her willingness to take Ted back ! There were lots of other questions that arose : like how could Ted 's mother have sided with his friend over her son ? ? ? Or how is it conceivable that Smitty , who had been Ted 's closest friend for over 20 years , never once confronted Ted about his taking Caroline ? Instead he goes off to live in Australia ? ? When he did n't even live in the same town as Ted to start with ? Finally , the denouement : the reception where Smitty forgives Ted and tells everyone present about his background ( oh , and he had n't told his best friend in the world this background in over 20 years ? ? ) and suddenly all problems are solved . This was too neat a way to wrap things up in a hurry . I did n't believe this scene for one minute.These are just a few of the many inexplicable things that occur in this story . It had an interesting premise but that is about the only good thing to say about this book .	-1
This could be a good book and a good series but one simple thing is preventing this from happening . I do n't know if the problem is caused by the author , her typist or Amazon but someone needs to learn to hit the tab key at the start of a paragraph and at the end of the paragraph place a period . Then hit the return key one time only and hit the tab key for the next paragraph . No indention and the mutiple blank lines make this book appear to have been written by a child who knows nothing about writing . It is almost as if multiple blank lines were inserted to take up space so the page count would be higher . Some proof reading instead of relying on a spell checker would also be advised .	-1
Unfortunately I gave up reading this book in the first couple of chapters.It just did n't hold my interest at all . I really thought it sounded good by the description . I know it has a lot of 5 star reviews so read those too.Maybe you will like it ?	-1
I am a huge RL Mathewson fan of her Neighbors from Hell series , especially loving Perfection . They make me laugh and are a quick fun read . A HUMBLE HEART was not for me . I found it to be disjointed and the characters unrealistic ( and not in the good romance fiction way ) . I struggled to finish it . If this had been the first book I had ever read by RL Mathewson , I would not have read another . I see from the reviews some really enjoyed this but I do n't think it was her best , or even her top ten . Sorry RL .	-1
Amazing ! I thought her & # 34 ; nieghbor & # 34 ; books were light frothy 3am books and looked for the same in this . No this was almost embrassingly rediculous but I plowed through because I had to see how she would wrap it up and it was 3 am ! Do n't waste your precious reading time on ( or $ ) on this .	-1
I just could not get into this book.I all ways read a book when I start it This one I could not .	-1
This book has great potential ... .and for most of it , I was a happy reader , but it unravels about 3/4 of the way though the book and I personally found the ending very unsatisfactory . But , I will give you that it is -- an original story , mostly a good read and a clever plot . Ca n't quite put my finger on what made me not really want to sing its praises ... ..try it , you might like it more than I did and it is a pleasant read . Would like to see more from this author as he develops .	-1
This is the third of Ms. Druga 's EOTWAWKI books I 've read . 'Dust ' was okay-ish , 'Sealed In ' was real good , but this one reads like a first draft . It has major editing , sentence structure , missing word , wrong word ( I stopped counting at 15 ) , research , continuity , and suspension of disbelief issues . These problems become more and more pronounced as the story progresses.To a greater or lesser extent , this seems to be a recurring problem with all of Ms. Druga 's literary efforts.The story opens with the main protagonist Jen using a scope mounted rifle to shoot an infected . Later on , when this same event is described , she uses a shotgun.The character Mack , a supposed expert 'gun maker and repairman ' ( the term for which , by the way , is 'gunsmith ' ) , instead talks like an author who has no real grasp of firearms and firearms technology . Later on in the story , Mack builds 'an anti-aircraft gun ' and shoots down two ground attack aircraft with it . 'Anti-aircraft gun ' is all the description given ; no clue as to caliber , system of operation , or any other detail.I found the author 's woefully inadequate grasp of military terms , tactics , equipment and operations particularly annoying . It 's just as easy to do a little research and get this stuff right as it is to just make stuff up based on what you think you know.And the same caveat with the fancy words - it 's not a bad idea to make sure you actually know what they mean before you use them.Handled differently and given more ( any ) fact-checking , editing , and attention to detail , this could have been a hell of a read . As it stands now , it did n't quite make me want to gouge my eyeballs out , but it did come close . I 'd strongly suggest that you pass this one by .	-1

The writing in this book would normally get it a higher rating - if not for the main character . As far as being someone who draws you into the story , this character is a spineless and imagination-challenged loser . Is it possible the writer is a delicate and overly sensitive female ?	-1
I purchased this through the Amazon app for my phone , after reading the description on PixelofInk.com . Nowhere did I read that this was a short , 46 page story in the description . Could be that I just did n't scroll down far enough , but still.I liked the characters and empathized with Elise as she was dealing with her ex moving on , but I felt like the story had just gotten started when it ended . The story is well-rounded and the groundwork or background for characters well-established ... I just wish there was more to read about Elise ! I 'm glad I picked this one up when it was free on Amazon . I would be incredibly disappointed if I had paid $ .99 for this !	-1
This book waas a waste of time . It seemed to be written for the YA market . They deserve better and so do I .	-1
The Story was Ok , but it was too short of a story , I think they could have expanded it more . Thats why I was disappointed .	-1
This book had promise . It 's got themes that could be explored -- aging , widowhood , manic behavior , budding authorship -- but it fell flat fast and never recovered . There are many unnecessary events , no clues to speak of , giant leaps to conclusions told to us rather than unfolding in the story , and totally unexplained how/why regarding at least one of the murders . I knew about a third of the way into the book , I was n't enjoying it , but hoped there 'd be a payoff . I just do n't get it ... why are there more books in this series ? ( Almost hate to give it the one star required )	-1
You know the one where the mates/friends are joined by someone they do n't know . Who appears harmless and really is n't - he 's a nasty blast from their past , intent on revenge and playing for keeps . Being the nice guy he is , he invites all five victims ( they do n't know it ) to some out of the way place where if they screamed , no one would hear them . Natch , enter one of the mates/friends who is suspicious , does n't go and finds out the truth . Back at the ranch , all is not going well for the mates/friends and the harmless guy is showing his true colors . The suspicious mate/friend acts like Scatman Carruthers in The Shining to save those in danger . Will that be enough to stop the evil and the `` redrum '' ? Tempted as I am to reveal the deplorable ending , it shall remain a secret for you to discover.Why the two stars ? One : the predictability of the Grade B horror movie . Two , the author leans too much on dialogue at certain times when those moments could have been fleshed out . Leans too much on directing our attention when he could sucked us into the action . Certain details could have been mentioned earlier and heightened the horror instead of being blithely mentioned at convenient moments where we would care less . And three : the villian 's ability at different faces is ludicrous or at least I hope so.Pass this one by if you want a good story . Sorry , Alistair , I can not recommend Damon to anyone .	-1
This book was enjoyable , yet I rated it low because is so inconclusive , it ties no ends and most of the details of the story end having no purpose , sometimes there are books that end in a somewhat `` chopped '' way , sometimes it works , in this case it really does n't , and it make it seem like the author run out of ideas as to explain the plot , I was pissed when the book ended cause it seemed like such a waste of time to get so worked up about the story to then have no conclusion . I 'm glad it was free , I would have hate to pay for this .	-1
Loopy main characters . One of the few books that I have started but neverfinished . The good part is that I will avoid the author in the future .	-1
While it had a promising concept , The Watchers was too scatterbrained to really pull it off . The characters are nowhere near as well developed as they needed to be to make me care about the drama that was unfolding in the huge time gaps , and , more importantly , nowhere near developed enough to be particularly memorable to the point that some scenes , with their influx of new names , are just downright confusing . It feels like the story picks up halfway through the actual narrative , with the Watchers already having been discovered and revealed to the world , and as a result I felt like I missed out on a lot of what would have been scarier , more important scenes than what follows in the story itself . The time jumps , however , are ultimately what ruins this story ; Watchers needed to be a full-fledged novel to really carry off the sort of story it 's going for here , and when the story keeps jumping days at a time ahead with little warning , it 's hard to remain invested in what feels like a bare bones narrative as it is.While it needed an editor and more time to develop , Watchers still has a lot of promise and is something I 'd like to see more developed in virtually every way . As it stands , however , it 's too confusing , haphazard , and skeletal to really engage .	-1
Ford created an interesting situation ( woman trapped inside her mind ) , but the layout of the story did n't always effectively move the story forward . There was times when I was questioning what was happening ( she saw people in her mind , but were they alive or dead ) or facts seemed contradictory ( if she had a keyboard to communicate , why did she think of the & # 34 ; mind cafe & # 34 ; as the only way for her to relate to people ? ) .	-1
Review : Raine is just a 'misfit ' trying to fit in , she does n't like what all the other kids like , she loves the goth type look and vampires . Lonely she hopes to find love someday and in walks in the mysterious Tristan and from that moment on her world is turned upside down.As excited as I was to read this book because after all I am such a vampire , lore fanatic . This book left me disappointed . I did n't feel the connection with the characters like I felt I should have.What I did like : I loved the premise-love triangle , fight bad guy . The fighting scenes and training was well done those I could visualize and root for the good guy so to speak and lastly it was a fairly fast read.What I did n't like : As I mentioned above and this is a biggy for me I just could n't feel the emotions of the characters it felt flat . I wanted to but I just could n't . But the downside for it being fast read is that I was left confused as we kept jumping along in the story- nothing really felt wrapped up.That being said would I recommend this book , well I think I will leave that up to you to decide . While it might not have been my cup of tea , it just might be yours.My ratiing is a 2 stars out of 5I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review .	-1
The cover is the reason I wanted to read this book but it was just boring . So I would say it 's just ok .	-1
I just finished reading this book and I 'm ... Hmmm , disappointed . Is this a young adult novel ? It reads like one . I just could n't believe that supposed mature , confident women would respond the way these characters did . The storytelling is good , it was n't too painful to read , but the reactions and story development was ... bland . There were times when there was just too much detail and times when the details made no sense . This story felt like it came from a writer in the infancy of their career ? Ability ? Either way , I 'm not bothering to buy the other books . These kindle free books are getting so annoying with the continuations . I think that 's why most of them are so bad . The only book that I can recall that was sensationally good and worth the investment of the 2nd book was by Olivia Cunning , Backstage Pass . However , I will say this , at least I was able to finish this book . I could n't even get through 100 pages of the first Twilight book .	-1
huh i do n't know what everyone else here is reading but this book was not that good for me ... i gave it two stars because it had enough for me to finish it and it was for free ... but if i had paid for this book i would have been very upset ... .everyone knows this kind of book it is the kind where the writer stalls just so he/she can get a second book out of the deal ... .my point is more than proven when you reach the end and the book stops in the middle of the one and only important seen in the entire book ... .oh , man what a waste ! ! ! !	-1
This wo n't be a long review , because there is very little I have to say about this book.Despite the fact that the story of this book was actually pretty great , I could not get over the many , many , many POV changes that occured during every chapter . It 's quite hard to read a book that shifts it 's POV from one paragraph to the other . Constantly switching First POV to Third POV.I think personally , the book would have been much better if the author had either stuck to one POV or at least used one POV change per chapter , that would have been nicer to read.Also it was a bit annoying to read the constant lengthy descriptions whenever one of the girls changed clothes . And it was n't easy remembering their names or the many nicknames , especially when the boys came into play and all the other characters . It just felt a bit too much at times.So , unfortunately for all these reasons I could n't award this book more then 2 stars . I 'm sure however that other people will enjoy it , but this one just was n't for me .	-1
I only made it to Chapter Four before giving up.I 'm not talking the occasional spelling or grammatical error here . The book switches between first and third person narrative - in the same paragraph ! You ca n't tell which character is talking or who they 're talking to . The same thing with the tenses , mixing present and past - in the same sentence . It was PAINFUL.The truth is , there was some promise here . It 's why I stuck around as far as I did . The characters were portrayed as being interested and involved in their own lives , with lots of hobbies . It makes a change from this type of alternate world scenario , where most characters are introduced as lonely , unfulfilled , etc . In other words , just waiting for the rescue . I would have liked to spend more time with this type of character instead , but I just could n't stand it.I hope MacDonald gets some help from a friend willing to read this and offer instruction and suggestion in BASIC English . If she reformats this book , I would be willing to try again . As is , however , it is n't worth your time .	-1
Very lord of the rings but not enough emphasis on each character , was ok to pass a day or two ; )	-1
It was kind of silly to me . Might like it , it is SyFy butI did not care for the story line . I am persistantbut even though I tried 2-3 Chapters just was n't myidea of a good book .	-1
A thriller suggests a page-turning suspense-filled experience . Though here the author gives us some accurate Cape Cod locations , nothing else is satisfying . This is a boring thriller . More talk than action . No real suspense . Major disappointment .	-1
Another wast of time from this author . I used to like Joyee but I 'm getting disappointed . It was so predictable . It seemed a bit like it was just a chapter of a novel or something . In fact , there is a character interaction that is unresolved and suggest that a sequel is coming . This really feels like I 'm being thrown one chapter at a time and if I want the whole story , I have to buy the parts ... probably making more money for the author along the way .	-1
I had really high hopes for this story . The premise sounded like a good read that my book group would enjoy , but I ca n't recommend it . It would have been a more plausible story if it would have been written for teenagers . It is just beyond imagination and ridiculous that adults would conduct their lives as if they were children . A Promise is important , but not when it is detrimental to the person you made the promise to . People grow up and change .	-1
Definitely not what I expected . Cut to the chase quickly . A little romance , male bonding , tear jerked , happily ever after kind of story .	-1
`` Checking It Twice '' is far too short , even for a Kindle freebie , and reads like something written for a high school English class . As an opening chapter , or a teaser for a longer story , it might have worked , but as a standalone story it fails miserably . The characters are entirely plastic and immenently forgettable.I 'm not going to comment on the previews the writer included , because I could n't bring myself to read them . However , if they 're the same caliber as `` Checking It Twice '' I doubt I 'm missing anything.Take my advice and give this freebie a pass .	-1
blah blah i read this in 10 minutes , and it really sucked . Wish I could get my time back ... oh well at least it was free	-1
Maybe I was not in the moment to understand the prose , or language in which it was written , because I find ' understand the story , so with me bot understand ing after reading it over 5 times , was not for me ... ...	-1
As the other reviewers stated this was a very SHORT story . At this length there is no way it could be worth the price even if written by the worlds greatest author . The initial set up was promising but there was barely enough time to meet the characters , let alone start to care about them . Also , you could clearly tell when the author changed interupting the flow of the story.Anyone who is not an ardent fan of BOTH authors should avoid this story .	-1
I chose this rating because even though the book was good it was n't for me it was to short plus it did n't end right	-1
Nothing really new here , boy works with girl , both are attracted to eachother , both are married to someone else , but a loving marriage from what I could tell ... . so basically they both have their cake at home and also want to eat it too with eachother when they are away from their spouses ... . was expecting something more .	-1
was ok but I think it 's missing something . It sort of felt rushed at the end . I think I want to read more by this author to see if it 's just this story .	-1
I read two or three books a day and do n't review very often . I tend to review the ones I really like or the ones that are just so bad that I feel like I have to warn others away . Just pass this one by . I 've never requested a refund on an e-book but if this had n't been free I would be calling Amazon for my money back.There is a note that this is a re-release of a previous version and that this one has been updated and corrected . The first thought that crossed my mind was , `` You mean it was worse before ? ''	-1
This book had so many things wrong with it that I really do n't know where to begin . ***SPOILERS***Poor grammar , spelling and sentence structure.A single woman in the 1800 's `` clubbing '' ? ? ? Seriously ? ? ? The dialog was stiff and very simple . It was connect-the-dots conversations . B-O-R-I-N-G ! We had an emotionally unstable/abusive hero . Several times during the story he went from normal conversation to raging , ( usually at our heroine ) and back again in the space of moments all the while physically abusing our poor heroine.Our heroine was a rather simplistic person ... and very flat emotionally ... which was a good thing since she did n't seem to mind ( or even notice ) the abuse.The author could n't keep track of her own plot . First our hero knows all the heroine 's secrets ... she tells him point blank ... and he does n't care , he just loves our heroine ! ( ahh ) Then , he 's stunned ( and raging [ Seeing a pattern ? ] ) to learn those same secrets later in the book.Story/plot is jerky and does n't flow , jumping from point to point . I think we could see how much the author wrote in one day by the plot jumps , she seemed to loose track of where she was going halfway through a scene.I just could n't get myself to care about any of the characters . They are all so one dimensional and flat . Their personalities , their conversations , their emotions ( even when raging ) were just so ... flat.The author had no understanding about 1800 's medical practices . A *Duchess* going to the doctor 's office ( ! ? ) and waiting in a waiting room ( ! ? ! ) and then our hero in a rage ( you MUST see the pattern by now ! ) and barging into the exam room ( ! ? ! ? ! ) . [ And unless the doctor is blind and deaf and the exam room is the size of a football stadium I ca n't believe he would n't notice the hero 'slamming and yelling ' as he raged . ] And , our villain . You could tell where the author was trying to go and the sense of dread she was trying to create ... I just wish she would have followed through and delivered it ... but alas , our villain was flat and unimaginative and ... well stupid . I kept expecting her to stomp her foot and hold her breath to get her own way.All in all , if this book had n't been free I would have demanded my money back . As it is , I wish I could demand my time back . What I do n't understand is the 4 and 5 star reviews . This was so poorly written I can only implore the author to take a few English classes , take several writing classes , buy some good history books and learn how to plot out a book . It was a cute idea and could have been good , unfortunately it fell far short of even 'Meh'.Side note : Amazon , have you ever considered a negative star system for the rating of a book ?	-1
This story was way too short and needed to be longer for character development . Despite having , hot steamy scenes , the way the men talked `` cajun '' just made them sound like they were dumb . Not a series that I will continue with .	-1
In fact not worth reading . Longwinded , autistic , not credible , not the Irish humour I expected . Excellent to fall asleep over .	-1
An Irish flight attendant babbles about serving travellers , living with her parents , and the screenplay she wants to write some day.I do n't know what is with this `` author '' because she does n't write stories . If you want to listen to an endless stream of self-pitying drivel , you 'll love this book . If you look for an actual story , better skip it . I finished the 10 % sample out of sheer determination , and had no interest whatsoever in reading any more .	-1
This book has some good ideas , many that are mostly common-sense . However , I could do without the anti-corporation philosophy and `` NO '' , I do n't think that my local tap-water is poisoned with chlorine.I liked the book `` Living Well on a Shoestring '' better for a large amount of money saving ideas . It was better written and not so judgemental .	-1
Very short and completely unrealistic . The story might have been more believable if it had more time to develop . It was impossible to believe that a happily married woman would accept a major lifestyle change like that in a matter of days , especially during that era .	-1
I did n't understand the last book it was all over the place . Adam was the enemy . Going around shooting @ people . They were trying 2 kill him . I did n't like book . If I could get my money back 4 this book I would .	-1
Love all Lee Driver books . Just can not put them down once I start reading each and every one . Great author .	-1
This story has to be one of the worst I have read this year . The story is short and boring . The characters were not developed and the author was all of the place with the story . There where too many characters to follow and I 'm still trying to figure out what was the point of the book .	-1
The author has the bones of a good plot , but the execution is terribly lacking . The main characters are introduced with a giant dump of information -- instead of letting the details of their lives emerge throughout the story , he simply tells us everything about them . It 's hard to figure out why we should care about the details of their childhood before we even know who they are or what type of story it is going to be . The dialogue is also problematic -- it seems the author was going for a witty and breezy feel , but it 's hard to ignore the fact that most people just do n't talk that way . For example , a woman introduces a man to a collection of childhood friends ( and her father ) and tells them that she is n't having sex with him . Okay . It 's also distracting that actions that take place during dialogue are set in italics.The plot itself is n't terrible , it 's just naive . There 's the ragtag group of people who can carry out a complex investigation , the investigative journalist who builds a military-style defense system in his barely furnished cabin ( complete with mines in the driveway ) , the mobster with a heart-of-gold who hates the idea of drugs being sold , etc . Everything felt very immature .	-1
Unfortunately I can only echo what so many other reviewers have said about this book : although the premise is good , the execution of the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired . While the opening page and a half of the book is reasonable in terms of grabbing attention - setting up questions in the reader 's mind , the following three pages of blatant exposition quickly cools whatever interest was roused for the plight of the two women stuck in the Nevada desert looking for the illegal horse round-up.The book would have benefitted much from an editor 's eye being run over the text , followed by a good deal of hard thinking about what to keep in , and what to remove . The dialogue feels forced and stilted , and in some places kept in merely for the sake of having dialogue , and the recurring instances of exposition - of telling , rather than showing - what is happening do not help to improve the overall impression of the story , of nor the authors skill at telling it.It is a shame , because it could have been such a good book if handled properly .	-1
I read to relax and do n't want to waste my time ( finishing ) reading a book that is peppered with gratuitous `` bad '' language and repulsive images . For example , the main character seems to be a lackluster drunk that ca n't accurately aim his urine into his own toilet , then fails to clean up his own mess repeatedly , even when a houseguest complains about it . If this amuses you , you 'll enjoy the book . I 'm deleting it .	-1
As far as a story , it was fine . However , there was no mention anywhere that this was so short . I would n't even call it a novella , it 's a short-short story and as such is not worth the price .	-1
After seeing a number of books on self publishing and formatting for 99 cents , I figured that one priced at $ 2.99 would offer more . I was wrong . While concise and clear in its instructions it simply did n't work . At the end of Mr. Canyon 's process I had a manuscript that would read on Kindle ( or Mobi reader ) just fine . All the paragraphs were indented , the chapter headers were in place with page breaks , and even the quotes at the beginning of chapters were well enough in place that I could live with it . The major problem was that all of my italicized text had been formatted to standard . You know , the text that denotes thought and proper names of things like spaceships . Gone . There were some instructions on how to insert the code for italics in each individual case , which for me would have meant several hundred insertions by hand . So basically I wasted several nights of frustration in my busy schedule accomplishing nothing .	-1
Hard to follow , and not a very good read . May be very popular in other countres , but not in my home . My son read it also ( 10 yrs ) , and he got nothing from it .	-1
I read the first book and I really enjoyed it . I enjoyed it so much I bought the 5 volume collection . But then the book went down this absurd path about homosexuality between animals and became sick and disgusting.I could n't even read it anymore because I got sick of the parts about the animals making love and all the talk about the difference between cat penises , dog penis , a fox penis and so on.If you 're not into gay beastieality animal porn then do n't read it .	-1
I love Blake Crouch . This story was no exception . I was riveted until the end.Unfortunately , that took all of twenty minutes.The biggest downfall to Blake Crouch ( and other authors , including J.A . Konrath , I 'm talking to you ) is their annoying habit of padding their short stories with tiresome interviews . Sure , he has clever answers . He 's a clever guy . But that kind of inane banter is well more suited to a blog post . The other `` padding '' trick is to throw a bunch of `` previews '' of books on the end to try to seduce me into reading your other material . If you tell a good story , then I 'll probably check it out on my own.This story , while delightfully written in that creepy manner that we expect of Mr. Crouch , was certainly not worth $ 3 . It is actually so short , do n't expect to see a `` sample '' of it at the end of any other Crouch stories either - being so short , the sample of the story would have to only be 3 lines long .	-1
While the story has promise it was a difficult read . The author needs to work on the craft of writing . Many rookie grammar , spelling and storytelling mistakes were distracting . While in some cases the characters were hundreds of years old they did n't seem to have evolved beyond the consciousness of high schoolers . Characterizations were also a bit inconsistent . Political intrigue is not very sophisticated and the ways characters stow away and otherwise sneak around to avoid detection stretches credulity . I also did n't appreciate descriptions such as `` The Latina woman '' , `` the Asian '' , or `` the dark man '' to describe every character who was n't White . In the meantime , what I assume are white characters had not such descriptions . I appreciate the attempt but the author needs training .	-1
This story seemed to start well but became bogged down . I began skimming the material to advance quickly . As a start to the series , it could have used some editing to improve the pace and better define the players and stage .	-1
Poorly edited and executed story and then when I saw there are more books ... Characters are irritating beyond reason . One example being Kim 's a police officer acting like a 13 year old who wo n't stfu ! I just could n't take it anymore after going through a quarter of this travesty . Why , just why ?	-1
I got 5 books from this series when they were free for the kindle . I will not be buying any more . I 've read 5 books and while I enjoyed the first 2 , they are fast going down hill . The plot is repetitive ; save Maria , find shelter , and no progress is ever made . The characters keep having the same arguments and making the same bad decisions again and again . The sentence structure is awful with words missing or misplaced as well as lots of wrong word choices ( passed instead of past , they 're instead of their ) . It is also confusing trying to figure out which book goes first . Chronologically speaking , it seems like `` Villains of the Apocalypse '' should be first . It appears to follow the scientists as they are creating the OZ `` zombie '' virus . The Secret Journal has a part 1 and 2 while the other books are numbered 1 through 4 . Maybe the author wrote a prequel and found out they were addictive and just kept writing one more prequel ? It does n't help when most of the books start with a scene and then go back to tell you how they got in this sticky situation.The description on Amazon is a bit vague . Here 's another one.Three scientists have developed a virus intended for use as a weapon . They are testing it on various groups that no one should really miss ( refugees , terrorists and people smugglers for example ) . There is a containment breach in the Australian Outback and in a short period of time , the country is overrun with zombies . A media blackout meant to control panic and prevent the story from getting out also keeps most of the world ignorant of the disaster . Most of the story is told from Rebecca 's point of view , she is an average 16 yr old girl . Other main characters are : Maria Marsh ( another teen with an immunity to the virus ) , Jack ( Maria 's boyfriend ) , Kim ( Jack 's older sister and a police officer in Sydney ) and Kenji Yoshido ( Rebecca 's 19 yr old boyfriend and a marine sniper ) . The entire focus of the series is getting Maria Marsh out of Australia to the doctors who will hopefully create a cure.There is a lot of running around Syndey and the Outback trying to escape monsters , looking for transportation , shelter , food and water . You also have religious fanatics sacrificing women and children to the zombies , mutant animals , giant zombies , and rogue nanobots that are animating machinery . I almost forgot , Kenji can see and talk to dead people .	-1
This is really not my thing . I can see how less than a page horror shorts work for some people and the author does an excellent job of revealing the inner-id of a great many psychopaths in less than 100 words or so but these are more & # 34 ; pop out and scare you & # 34 ; than the long suspense and horror I prefer .	-1
As exciting as the hockey was , the rest of this story was just way too pat for my liking . Perhaps if it had been longer and more fleshed out it would have worked . However , I just felt that none of the story or characters came close to being real .	-1
I already wrote a review under one of the other novella 's in the series so check that out ... First of all , calling these novella 's is just a way to get people to pay more for a serialized version of a regular book.. imagine paying 99 cents a chapter ... . because that is what you are doing ... I think he 's up to 5 or 6 now..Then of course there is the basic story line ... as he explains in a forward in a novella one only bothers to really develp 2 main characters ... . so there is no character development other than these two ... and I would argue there is very little of that as well.. Further , there are very poor relationships between not only these two characters but also the other characters in teh story . the wife is non existent . the daughter is a monster.. there are no friendships ... the second character follows the 'prince ' apparently out of fear and a hope ... that he will eventually get to fixing their lands main problem ... very very dark dreary stuff here ... bodies dead and alive and re awakened from the dead and re killed all over the place ... . if I was a person in this land I would leave there as soon as possible and fight on the other side ... .these people are not rationally motivated ... none of them	-1
This book had me hooked from the beginning . Then the story line changed to disgusting . This was the beginning of a beautiful love story but was changed in the middle of the book to pornography I thought the rest of the book was disgusting and I will not read another book by this author .	-1
I had so many issues with this kindle book that I almost do n't know where to start.The very first thing I noticed was the formatting . One of things I love about my kindle is the ability to choose the font type . This book as formatted some odd way that you can only view it in blocky font that ca n't be changed . You can change the size but you are stuck with this obnoxious font . I almost quit reading at that point but decided it was my own stupid fault for not reading a sample so I kept going.I am quite frankly amazed I finished it . This book could have done with some major overhauling by a halfway decent editor . I found multiple incidents of spelling errors ( liberarian instead of librarian is a good example ) . The descriptive detail in the book was repetitive and distracting . Here is a good example `` We have waited and watched , we thought they had left and then this . Who ever it is , they had waited and watched '' or `` Quin returned to his office and went to his office '' There is also the poor sentence construction through out the story . It is a toss up if I noticed more run on sentences or fragments in this book . Poor syntax and improper use of punctuation also constantly distracted me and ruined the reading experience . At one point I was reminded of a high school English test I had where the teacher had deliberately made multiple errors in a story and the students were expected to find and correct all errors.As to the story line , it had potential but I just could n't enjoy it . The few times I was able to ignore everything I just mentioned , I found the writing stilted and boring . Real people just do n't talk like the ones in this book . The writing was very juvenile sounding and this could only be compared to a high school students class project . If my teenager turned in this book for a writing class , I would expect it to come back with a C - at the very best along with a note suggesting the student resubmit it after spending more time on it.Because of all the problems I have just mentioned , this was only the second time in two years I have found myself requesting a refund for a book from amazon . Considering the other time I asked for a refund was because I quit reading the second a pair of twin brothers started having sex with each other , that says a lot ! Even though I only paid $ 2 for this book , I felt ripped off and left with no choice but to ask for a refund . Do yourself a favor and do not read this book unless you need a good example of how not to write a book .	-1

Several things annoyed me about this book . First-anything related to the wooden box . I 'm not going to write a spoiler but this is not something I am into or want to read about at all . Second-way too much detail regarding the baking . Its one thing to weave it into the mystery , it 's another to have half the book related to how busy she is and describing exactly what pastries are in the oven . Skip this unless you are bored and it 's free .	-1
Getting this downloaded is what happens after to much to drink and you get bored and have nothing to do .	-1
The word `` puzzle '' was used way to much . I 'm not sure who was what and why . I wo n't be coming back to these stories .	-1
Sean Collins is happy working at the family pub and sharing a house with the woman of his dreams . He and Lauren are equals in every way , including in bed , where they burn the sheets . Life is good . Lauren is madly in love with Sean . They share everything -- almost . She ca n't deny sensing ... something . A certain feeling when she , Sean and their friend Chad are all together . In a house filled with secrets , Chad 's are doozies.When an opportunity arises to explore their deep desires , the trio plunges into a sex-filled , emotionally charged m & eacute ; nage . Long-buried feelings are revealed , changing their lives irrevocably . Whether for better or worse , only Sean , Chad and Lauren can decide.The book started out great , wrapping up the Collins family saga but then went south very quickly . Jumped from secret desires to all out BDSM menage . Sean was nothing but a bully with control issues and a taste for sadism while Lauren went from a strong and confident woman to sex-slave . And Chad was such a non-entity.Very disappointed .	-1
I struggled with this book at first and only continued on since so many of the reviews were so good , thought I must be missing something . The first chapter read like it was going to be a quick hook-up book but yet there was so much left . Elizabeth Brooks has been cheated on by her boyfriend , not just once and not just with women , her mother is cold and controlling and she 's just quit her job after being set up to take the fall for a mess that was n't hers . She throws a dart into a map of Texas and finds herself in the small town of Wilder , deciding a complete change is in order she 's now Liza and dressed to the nines walks into the only bar in town . There she locks eyes with the Devil in blue jeans bartender Jack , the attraction is hot and instant . Now this could have been in my opinion a much better book , there 's the makings of a good story , the reverend and his wife are applying religious pressure on anything they do n't like hence why there 's now only one bar in town and that 's not doing too well . It had some interesting characters that we discover as Liza finds her way around and starts to make friends and whats the deal with Jack and Lydia the reverends wife , this I must admit is the main reason I kept reading . Now what I did n't like , I felt we should have had a bit more history , what made Jack in particular the man he is today , he does n't date anyone in Wilder and never has but what about school he must have dated someone and just how did the reverend and his wife get such a hold on the town , with businesses closing and struggling its hard to imagine it would have gotten so far without more fuss , was there a catalyst that started the ball rolling . To be fair I did n't pay for this book it was free on allromance I did n't know the price until I went to review I just assumed it would have been round the two or three pound mark so I shocked that it 's over five and in my opinion not worth the money .	-1
This was an ok read . Some parts were rather slower to read and others were a little more interesting to read .	-1
I really appreciate Heather Webber 's style of romance - sexy but not explicit , staying to the sweeter side of the genre . This work , however , went from sweetly steamy to syrupy putrescence . There is no suspense , nothing even close to tension , in the plot , and the characters are boringly cliche . Some of the lines actually made me cringe , they were so overly profuse and scripted . This book is a light read , and has a moment or two of shining humour , but mostly it felt like being stuck inside the head of a woman with too many fantasies and not enough real-life loving . Try Webber 's Valentine Inc series , instead . Or Gemma Halliday 's High Heels Mysteries . Meg Cabot 's got some decent ones . Or check out Shannon Hale 's Austenland . All are better than this !	-1
I agree 100 % with the other reviewers that this story had WAY too many details , to the point of just dumb . We do n't need to know that the character opened the door with his left hand by turning the knob to the right and then closing the door behind him by using the handle to push it closed . And the use of `` and then '' , `` and then '' , `` and then '' all the way through became quite tedious . I was really hoping for a strong ghost story in a short story but ended up being bored . Plus it needed a little editing . Glad this was free !	-1
I liked the story idea . A good old fashioned ghost story that did n't involved demons or things that rip , murder or suck blood.. all the crap you see out now.However , like many others have mentioned , it needs some editing . Unlike most stories that need editing , this one needs some longer drawn out sentences instead of the short bullet statements made here..ie : He opened the door . He stepped out of the car . He turned . He closed the door . All true perhaps , but it should have been one sentence instead of 4 or 5 , maybe more . The sentences are that compact at times.I 'll give it 2 stars because the story was different than the usual . Let 's hope the author takes these critiques to heart and gets some help in laying his story lines out . I keep looking at his other books , and all the reviews say the same thing basically . Which , uh , I just said again . Anyway , this could have easily been a nice 4 star story with some help.I think the point is that people would not , as a rule , bother to leave a poor review to be mean but in the hopes that the author will see a trend and take it as it was meant.. For me , I mean this : you have promise , but should seek some guidance in the construction of details . Those details are what help people to place themselves inside a story . The beauty of reading is the reader constructs their own little visualization of what 's going on in the story . And short bullet statements make it hard for a reader to stay in the mode that the story is creating .	-1
This is the first book I have read by Ms. Hale , and I ca n't say much about it . The characters were weak . The story was boring , but then I thought 'this is the first of the series , maybe I 'll like the next one better ' . NOT ! ! Do n't waste your money .	-1
I am not sure what everyone else read but this was not all that great . It had a good synopsis and had potential it just did not hit the mark . They knew each other 2 days and the book was 70 % through . It was then told to you that a week passed and all of a sudden they are getting remarried and having their first kiss at 74 % . They then go away for a week where the hero is distant and cold outside of the bedroom and they get in a fight and he leaves ... for 7 weeks ! ! ! ! She finds out she is pregnant during this time and calls him . Only after an earthquake does the hero go to find the heroine . He says he loves her but was unsure of how to go about showing it because he was taught to hide his emotions by his dad . His dad was sweet and showed how he was feeling so I am not sure why the king would advise his children to hide their feelings away . I can not see them in love . I mean , 2 days where they spent every second trying to get out of their marriage with her thinking he was in love with Jules and then a week where we do not read any interaction but are told that he was supportive of her during this time . This is all followed by a week of distance by the hero who treated her like a leper and then 7 weeks of nothing but they love each other ? ? I can not see it , AT ALL ! ! ! He called her a grease monkey and continued to tell her she needed to act like Jules even on their honeymoon . He wanted to change her all the way up until the day he went back to her . He NEVER excepted her how she was the entire time they were together so I can not even see how I am supposed to think he even liked her let alone loved her . I did like how she retaliated in the pond for his comments about how Jules would have handle the village situation better . It was funny and a well deserved thing to do to the hero ! ! ! I did not like him AT ALL but I did like the heroine . She was spunky and could have done SO MUCH BETTER than the hero . I would not wish him on any of the females in this book . They all deserve to be who they are and not belittled for being true to themselves ! ! !	-1
If I had actually paid money for this novella , I 'd have wanted a refund . I got through it quickly , but it was very unsatisfying - no real suspense , simplistic plot and language , and one-dimensional characters . It 's intended for much younger readers than I , but I liked more depth in my chosen reads even in my teenage years . Skip this one .	-1
The story was really good until nothing really happend ! Like a balloon , ready to pop ... then the air is just let out .	-1
This book was a sequel to & # 34 ; An Urban Drama. & # 34 ; The author wasted to many pages flashbacking verbatim from the previous book . The ending was ridiculous . I dont think I 'll purchase from this author again . Very Disappointing !	-1
to the Matt Damon movie , but was the inspiration and like the movie I could n't tie up the loose ends and make sense of the stories . So I would not recommend .	-1
I was very frustrated by this book . For one , it was hard to handle that this girl who has spent years not caring much about her appearance can undergo a makeover in one day and come out looking so stunning - it 's talked about all the time , how hot she ends up . Also , the whole `` Bachelor '' -esque TV show just got hard to read about and the writing was very choppy . I ended up reading until about 50 % and then skipping to the end as it was that annoying for me .	-1
This cookbook has a few very basic recipes , none of which inspire me to make then . We have a vegetarian visiting soon and I was hoping to find something interesting to cook for her . This book did not deliver . The bottom line : this is not a very good cookbook .	-1
Not my new favorite cookbook too many recipes that do not sound goo to me . Would not get this again .	-1
I really like the idea of this book , especially this time of year when I 'm expecting to be doing some entertaining for friends , family , and even coworkers . However , this book falls short on the execution for me . Perhaps my expectations were invalid because I was unfamiliar with `` Instructables '' before downloading this freebie.There are 18 recipes in this `` book '' , but if you 've ever been to a wedding , a dinner party , or seen either of the two on TV , I 'd say you 're already aware of most everything in here . The only faintly unique thing I saw was in the `` Simple and Elegant Wedding Appetizers '' section . I do n't need two recipes for baked brie and two for bruschetta ... just give me a `` variations '' section on those recipes . There are no servings on the recipes so you can only guestimate how much you 're going to end up with , though some are obvious ( i.e . 12 crackers = 12 servings ) .There are no chapters ( that you can use the 5-way to click to ) , but there is a Table of Contents at the back of the book with linked chapters that you can use to click to specific sections . Why is the TOC at the end of the book ? Is that so I do n't see that I already know these recipes when I download the sample , or is there another reason ? ( Honestly , I 'd be curious to know . ) If you are expecting anything more than some recipes , do n't . I thought there might be a few tips about how to organize a table or trays to deal with warm and cold appetizers ... you know , how to keep from having traffic jams at the buffet table , how to keep warm appetizers warm so the cheese stays melty , how to fix it so people can get one serving of an item without having their fingers all over 6 other servings , etc . There 's also no advice on prepping things ( i.e . like the day before so you do n't have to run around like a madman to get everything ready at once ) or about estimating the number of appetizers or the different types ( i.e . dairy free , meat free , warm , cold , pork free , etc . ) to have per guest . Again , my expectations for this book were off.As a note , if you have a dairy or gluten allergy , you 're about 85.675 % screwed with this book.On the plus side , the recipes are relatively simple so it probably would n't take you too long if you did use something from this `` book '' at your party . Each recipe has links to `` related '' recipes if you 're looking for something else , but still in the same vein . Also , the pictures are relatively easy to decipher while being viewed on a Kindle.Maybe this recipe collection would be helpful to you , but it was useless to me . I 'll stick with allrecipes.P.S . - In case it helps , I would call myself an intermediate level cook . I wo n't be making my own phyllo dough , but I 'm pretty darn capable in the kitchen .	-1
It 's not . There are 2 or 3 - brownies and cake . It 's readable in a couple minutes , little interesting , but should certainly not be something you pay for .	-1
Fun for those with the know-how , resources , and time.Looked like a fun cookbook but turns out to be more of a built your self some coolstuff guide.Great for engineers and creative people alike	-1
The only good part of putting this book on my Kindle is that I did it when it was free . I was looking for quick fun things to make to EAT in the microwave and instead found a book suggesting things I consider DANGEROUS to the continued good health of my microwave . I do NOT recommend this book to anyone !	-1
I thought this would have recipes and fun activities to do with kids i the microwave . I 'm glad I did n't pay for it . I skimmed through then deleted it .	-1
I know this is supposed to be a short story , but it was very short . Took less than an hour to read . Story itself was just okay . Glad it was free .	-1
I received this book for free , like everyone else , and because it was free I was n't expecting much , truth be told ... but I was shocked at the pace that everything went , I was surprised at the quickness of the story , and not pleasantly so . The story seemed to go well enough , a captive in a Scottish castle , but then it begins to just go in a very weird direction where the woman falls in love with her captor out of nothing in particular he did , then he lets her go ... and then finds her again . The entire story was just a blink and then done , and not very well explained . It 's a quick read , and an adequate way to pass a half hour , but for me the story was just too unbelievable .	-1
Took me ten minutes to read . I never listen to reviews but I hope you do . Waste of time and money.OK , SPOILER ALERT : It goes like this : enemy daughter chick gets captured on a cattle raid . Sexy laird falls in love with her and her small breasts . They have sex . She leaves . He lets her . She comes back . He gets aroused . They are to get married . The end .	-1
A silly little romance if you feel like reading a clich & eacute ; d fling . This definitely is n't one of the best books I 've ever read , however I do like the authors writing style ... that 's about it from there .	-1
Why in the world did I download this weird little short story ? Do n't do it ! Buy a real book , instead !	-1
Did n't have enough information to read the book was starting out great but it just was missing something in the end .	-1
Amazing cakes I do n't think so I think there should be more girl cakes and less boy cakes that is why I gave it 1star	-1
This book is worthless . It gives the reader little to no information on anything and only a couple designs . Too bad ZERO STARS is not an option ! DELETED .	-1
Carlee was the whiniest so and so that i 've ever come across . She is pissed at Trey because he does n't remember the past lives they shared . She takes this to mean that he does n't care about even though he insists that he wants to have a relationship with her . She also sites the 2 hour distance between them as a reason why the relationship would n't work . Uh ... ok ... all the while he begs her to give him a chance . She refuses and demands that he leave her alone . He does , but only because of a family tragedy . She is understandably ( NOT ) upset that he does in fact leave her alone like she requested and decides to sleep with an ex without protection ( her demand ) . She ends up pregnant and again says she is the wronged party since Trey is n't immediately understanding that she spread her legs for her ex and got pregnant . UGH ... this book pissed me off so much I had to stop and delete it from my kindle and I NEVER delete books . Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one .	-1
Too many sexual events and not enough letting you know what is actually going on in connection with the plot .	-1
Very interesting plot lines but too much details regarding sexual situations especially when the men are taking care of themselves !	-1
this is n't put together in a manageable way . There are a few decent projects but you have to scroll through a million pages to find the very few good projects . I was hoping to get some ideas for duct tape projects . might as well just do a search on the internet for exactly what you want .	-1
I picked this up for free , and did n't realize it was put together from Instructables . Anybody who does DIY projects is aware of this site , one I do n't really frequent because the vast majority of the projects posted there are poor quality , with even poorer instructions and photography.They put out several others , different titles and subjects , all are equally horrible in quality.This & # 34 ; book & # 34 ; is simply a compliation of projects from the site , which includes frequent advertising for the website . The directions are complete with typos , nothing is edited and the projects shown are those only suitable for children .	-1
This book was absolutely terrible there was incorrect grammar and spelling you should not waste your money on this book	-1
Scanned the book , did n't find anything worth a darn . Done with that in half an hour . Products from duct tape , c'mon ! ! !	-1
I read , carefully , the description of this Kindle Leather Cover , before buying to make sure it was leather as my first cover ( which also said leather ) was a thin red film over foam . Have had the product for 3 weeks now & am not sure what it is made of ; but a small area at one corner has already had the 'shine ' worn off , revealing what appears to be black fibrous paper . This I blame on AMAZON : unless the product is 100 % leather , as in from a cow , pig , goat , sheep or lamb AND not from a dead dinosaur lying under the earth 's surface & recently pumped up by Exxon etc. , the product should not be labelled leather . Fake leather , imitation leather , PVC leather-grained : all are acceptable , as long as there is no attempt made to fool the consumer into thinking its leather , REAL leather , as in long-wearing , tuff , durable , etc . The cover on this updated design is stiff , not supple & will probably not last as long as my old one .	-1
Its a quick read a who done it mystery . Theres really not much to the story . The characters are n't interesting and you get an ides pretty quick of who did it . Not worth the price .	-1
The Reluctant Nude by Meg Maguire was one I thought I 'd really enjoy from all the buzz and raving reviews behind it . Halfway through , this story stalled for me . The major reason was the underdevelopment of the heroine , Fallon Frost . We 're told she has some deep seated issues and does n't seem comfortable with affection . I really could n't see it at all because of not showing and using the good old fall back device of telling to get a point across . Fallon is too one-dimensional and flat . I did n't believe at any point the chemistry and passion world-renowned classical sculptor , Max Emery has for Fallon . Meg tries to make a good case why Max is attracted to Fallon and wants to break down those self-imposed walls she has placed around her , but the way it 's shown does n't have enough reasoning to back it up.Fallon is trying to save her house from an evil , rich man , who we only see in passing through phone calls Fallon has with him . Fallon will be able to keep her house if she poses nude and has a sculptor made into her likeness by Max . With no other choice , Fallon accepts and will spend the three months it will take Max to create this work of art . He thinks Fallon is doing this for her fianc & eacute ; and since he 's been given a great deal of money for the commission , he has no qualms about doing it . Right from the beginning he figures out Fallon is hiding something and he 'll get to the bottom of it . Max has a way of taunting Fallon into opening up , which slowly evolves into an interesting friendship between them that leads into the bedroom . As Fallon puts her heart on the line , she 'll eventually have to leave Max for her life she has put on hold , as well as try and tell him the truth about the why she 's being sculpted into stone.I found Max to be very appealing as a playful , hermit like Frenchman who loves to eat and drink wine . Fallon is just too weakly written to keep up with him and carry along the story and the growing sexual tension between them . Max 's courting of Fallon is very slow until it builds up and explodes . The love scenes were tastefully done , but again because I could n't believe the bond Fallon and Max have created , I was n't involved emotionally . The writing is n't bad , but I was n't swept up in what should have been a grand and all-consuming romance.Katiebabs	-1
This was to short . I will not be telling my friends bout it . I did not like the topic of the story .	-1
Granted this was a freebie , but the heat factor of this story was not very high , thus I 'll not be keeping it for future reading .	-1
No , not my type . I love ghost stories , but did not enjoy this book . However , someone else may enjoy it . I never let other peoples ' opinion put me off from trying a book that looks interesting . As I said , this is just not MY kind of story .	-1
This might be good if all you 're looking for is graphic descriptions of hardcore sex , including variations that might bother some people.But if you 're looking for erotica , for any kind of real story , for an inkling of romance , even something at adult level , this is n't it . I deleted it from my device after reading the first few pages .	-1
There are so many loose ends in this book that I do n't know where to start , so I wo n't list them . The initial business about artifact smuggling does not connect well to the rest of the book . The correct term is `` waist '' not `` waste '' if one is going to buckle something around it . Buckling armor or sword or whatever around one 's waste is rather a dreadful image . The book was nearly a waste of time , or is that `` waist '' ? Having said all that , it makes for a nearly good read . The premise is interesting . The price is right . I do n't think I will be seeking this author out in the future , though . I was able to finish it so it gets two stars .	-1
The heroine in this story is going to die but is saved by the blue alien who is supposed to mate but doesn ` t want to . But they are attracted to one another after a remarkable short time considering he doesn ` t want to mate and she is abducted to a foreign planet . Then she does some incredibly stupid things and is saved again by the hero and dum-dum-dum they end up together.I do wish Eve Langlais would write longer books because when I ` m having problems with her stories ( and that is definitely not always ) it ` s usually because the stories are too short to give us a credible build-up . In this book her characters meet , have sex and fall in love in two seconds flat and it ` s just boring . I don ` t necessarily need many layers of story but I do wish to read books that don ` t have me sighing in annoyance .	-1
I was n't drawn into this short story . It was strange and entirely out of my type of fiction to read .	-1
I am not real sure about this book just seemed weird from the get go glad it was .99 cents	-1
This article starts out well but quickly devolves into a tedious lay down of what makes us really happy . It contains an awful bunch of data that just plain makes it boring , hard to read and ultimately unhappy !	-1
Ugh - the tired trope of moms being awesome . I mean , moms are awesome ( especially mine ) , but the whole `` moms can beat anybody ! '' thing is hardly a basis for a realistic short story . It 's a one-joke , one-note story .	-1
Yeah , not what I expected . I could n't finish it . I do n't think breast milk and sex mix . Milking someone is not a turn in ...	-1
While I was aware that lactation fetishes existed , this is the first story I 've read on the subject . I think I could have set aside my feelings about the nature of the kink in this story ( reading this tale confirmed my intuition that I do not have a lactation fetish ) if the author had brought a touch of realism to the scene . But for a story with such an out-there theme , everything else felt stale . . . the woman who somehow has a picture perfect body even though she 's got an infant , a guy who is willing to turn off his morals and his brains just to have a shot at doing it with his wife 's best friend , the routine couplings ( routine except for the fact that they 're sprinkled in breast milk ) . By the time I reached the implausible twist ending , I was disappointed .	-1
I really had a hard time getting into this book . I usually love this kind of books but it could n't hold my interest . Some of you might like it but I thought this was way to predictable and I like feeling like I am in the the story and not being told a story . Know what I mean ?	-1
This is the kind of review I hoped I would not have to write but I 'm afraid this novel defeated me . Giving the author the benefit of the doubt , English is not his first language , something has been lost in translation . I tried very hard to find rhythm and depth in the writing but was unsuccessful and the dialogue was stilted and nave ( but not in a good way ) . I 'm afraid I could n't warm to the characters either as they were unbelievable and verging on caricatures ' , particularly the women . There may be a premise of a solid story in there but I could n't wade through to the end to discover it and I really did try.I received this free in exchange for an honest review .	-1
While the descriptions were vivid , the story lacked any interesting characters . I also find referring to zombies as & # 34 ; deaders & # 34 ; quite obnoxious . Just because & # 34 ; The Walking Dead & # 34 ; came up with a succinct way to describe them does n't mean you can just throw words out there and assume they 'll work .	-1
This was just terrible ! I 'm not even sure if you can call this a story ! It 's just a series of events that when you string them together , they vaguely resemble a story.There is little to no dialogue in this book and what little dialogue there is does nothing to add to the story . Not to mention only two of the characters have names in this story , and those characters are already dead when the story starts ! I can see why this guy is just a letterer for DC Comics , because he ca n't write to save his life ! Do n't waste your time !	-1
I just could n't get into this book . I 'd expected it to be funny , but I just do n't seem to get Zia 's sense of humor .	-1
Not much to this book except sex scenes with a thin plot wrapped around them . Still enjoyable at times . Just very predictable and boilerplate in the writing . Sex scenes were fine and formed the framework for this slight book .	-1
Unfortunately I lost interest in this book and ended up leaving it in the middle . I guess I have been too spoiled with certain very seasoned writers and found the writing style and story line lacking a bit .	-1
Level of confidence . It is as though a EFL 1st year student wrote this . PASS IT UP.Seriously , the sentence patterns are so elementary it is insulting to read . 20 words ? That is more than any sentence you see in this book .	-1
I decided to go with GoodReads two-star rating of `` it was ok '' . I guess Parker just rubbed me the wrong way . One character in the book described it well by saying she had an `` ugly personality '' . The reason I kept reading was because it seemed like she genuinely did n't know how she was coming off and really did want to make some changes and become a nicer person . She lost her dad and had put up some pretty big walls , but I thought she came across as just as mean , if not meaner , than the `` mean girls '' that she so desperately despised . But , at the same time there was something likable about her , maybe it was the fact that she was trying to change and does make progress . The ending wrapped up too quickly ( and she ended up with someone I did n't expect ) , and one of the girls she hated throughout the book becomes a good friend . I would n't mind that storyline , but it seemed to come out of nowhere.I do n't know why YA authors write leading characters that do n't match up with the story . In this book for example , Parker starts off a loner with only one friend . Claims she is n't pretty and dresses like a tomboy . By the end of the book she 's the prettiest girl on campus ( and every guy has always thought so ) , wins homecoming queen and scores a super hot boyfriend . I guess it 's to show that maybe we see ourselves differently than the people around us . I just do n't see why we ca n't have a normal lead for once . Someone who has normal amount of friends , is nice , has a good personality , is n't afraid to admit their cute and ends up with someone who fits well with them . Can anyone recommend a book like that ? Anyway , if you like story 's with a high school setting than you might enjoy this.Content : Lots of swearing ( I would have given it another star if it was n't for the language ) , but otherwise clean .	-1
I enjoy great mysteries , thrillers , espionage . This book is heavy on action , weak on story , characters , and meaningful connections . I rarely quit on a book but this was too painful to go forward . I read on for awhile thinking something would begin to be interesting and create empathy for some character . It did n't happen for me.I can not recommend the book .	-1
This was like a 2 star book for me . I liked the hero and heroine very much and the story flowed pretty well except I can not get pass -- -spoilers.Both the H and his brother slept with the heroine . The H married the 16 year old heroine because his younger brother had compromised her . He marries her and then sends her to one of his estates in the countryside . Five years later the h shows up at the H 's sister party as her invited guest . The H is there and is immediately attracted to her , but does not recognize her until his friend points out that she is his wife . The beginning was good . No cat and mouse game leading to her true identity . The H starts to fall in love and looks back with regret as to how poorly he treated her five years ago . The H shows a lot of vulnerability when he questions if his wife can love him with their the age difference ( 16 years ) and if he can compete against the other men who are drawn to her beauty and kindness.I was already put off with both brothers bedding her , so the references to her and his brother 's indiscretion in bed brought up numerous times throughout the book by her and the H , by the H and his brother , and by her and the brother , turn me off even more so . At one point the brother tells the H that he knew his wife was not a virgin when he bedded her . That is the run of the mill topic everyone has at a family function . On another occasion when the H and h are having their first night together , the h tells the H that his brother 's chest is the only other one she had seen . Blech . It was too much all in the family.The heroine 's family was in desperate need of therapy so I did have sympathy for her . Her family background was straight out of All My Children . The father killed her sister by shaking her , her brother raped her , and the heroine spent time in an orphanage.I would have rated this book higher but I can not imagine a hea when two brothers have carnal knowledge of the same woman who happens to be a wife to one of them . To me , it 's one degree from incest . I can not believe the H 's brother aka the jerk gets his own sequel .	-1
This was a messy book with distracting storylines , an unnessesary plot twist and too many characters . Most importantly , the `` hero '' was truly immoral-nothing charming about him . I was tempted to stop reading but I did complete it . I wish I had followed my instincts .	-1
This book is almost useless . It does not even attempt to give the most useful phrases , and is in some cases misleading . I see that those familiar with languages have uniformly the same complaints as I . For example , the Turkish section does not even use the Turkish characters , meaning that the pronunciations will be wrong.There are a number of online translators and travel sites that would be much more helpful.I think this is overpriced when offered for `` free '' , since it is a waste of time and effort .	-1
This was , for me , time wasted . Not typical Baldacchi and not expected . It was a good thing it was free or I would have wasted my money as well .	-1
Just when I started to get interested the book ended without making any rime or reason.Do n't waste your time with this	-1
Have enjoyed many David Baldacci books in the past but not overly into short stories and this one did nothing to make me consider one again .	-1
I have absolutely loved Baldacci 's stories in the past . I was shocked to be unhappy with this one . Maybe because it was a short story .	-1
The cover , title and blurb led me to believe this was going to be a true romance with an HEA . Unfortunately , there was very , very little romance and nothing in the way of what I would consider an HEA . This book left a depressing , bitter taste in my mouth . It would be nearly impossible to give a summary without spoiling it , so I wont do that here . I wouldnt recommend this book , but since its a freebie , it may give you a taste for the author 's writing style .	-1
This story is not badly written and I think the author has the capability to write a decent novel . That would however require a lot more work on the characters and the plot.A few examples regarding the characters : The main charachter , Kim , is `` notorious for spending it as I made it '' - yet she has so much stashed away that she can spend thousands of dollars on a lawyer and on DNA analyses ? ? It does n't add up . A helicopter pilot that drinks champagne ( and just not any bubbly but Dom Perignon ! ) when he is on call with a pager on his hip ? Kim is 28 and her mother wants her to get married and have children , but there is `` disappointment on Mom 's face '' when she learns that the guy Kim is dating is n't a doctor , but a pilot ? These characters do n't ring true ! About the plot : The story starts with Kim finding a human finger in a tin of dog food . Kim , a nurse , decides she has to find out whose finger it is and how it got there so she sets off to Florida where the dog food is manufactured . This is rather weird , but that goes for a lot of stories in this genre , so why not ? But then the story loses all credibility : There , on her first night , she just happens to go to a club where she finds out about a person that 's missing , and then she just happens to catch the licence plate numbers of some people of interest , she just happens to find the magazines where letters for an anonomous letter were cut out , she just happens to find an old journal and so on , and so on . All these coincidences that kept ocurring made it all so unrealistic that I completely lost interest in the story . Not to mention all the crazy things she does , a dog autopsy , trespassing , stealing the above mentioned journal etc.I believe that in the days of paper novels this book , had it been sent to a publisher , never would have been printed , but that the publisher would have seen potential in this author and recommended another try with more effort put into making the characters consistent and the plot more credible .	-1
If you 're a fan of Twilight and other books like that , you 'll probably love this book . It is basically twilight with different roles . The disappointing thing is that the story has a really great idea behind it but its unfortunately watered down into pile of garbage . The main character is predictable , her cohort is a stereotypical character that does virtually nothing of note . I was really disappointed because I thought this book would be really good . I have the second book and hopefully its not so watered down .	-1
Jump around , an see if you get everything in , that 's what this author seems to do . Just ca n't see people acting like they do as the author presents these characters . Author needs a good friend to read his work and help with story line as well as situation presentation . I know this could have written better , and I believe author has what it takes to do just that .	-1
If you like a cute 6-year-old who loves and worries about her daddy , an obsessive stalker , amnesia , a successful architects who draws using pads of paper and ca n't leave his private island , two main characters who do n't communicate their basic thoughts regarding what they think/feel , then this book is for you . Unfortunately it was not for me . The sample was pretty good and I liked the setup , but it quickly went downhill fast , then began racing to totally unbelievable . There were gaps in the logic of the drug-dealing brother of the main character , which I think were just used to further the & # 34 ; plot & # 34 ; ( which was quite horrific at that point ) . I assume there was a happily ever after -- I just quit reading after one of the characters got his memory back . I had suffered enough and had to move on .	-1
I enjoyed the previous book , Broken Wings , and got this book as well . I had said that Broken Wings was n't really a romance novel but felt like a prequel to a romance novel . This is supposed to be the romance novel of Rio and her soulmate Tajan/Eddie . They are both FBI agents and partners . Rio is being threatened and they are working on a case involving a poker tournament . We meet supporting characters ( mainly other FBI agents and Rio 's dad and her best friend ) .I never felt invested in any of these people . The writing in this book was not nearly as strong as the previous book . I kept thinking that maybe the author had spent a lot of time writing and re-writing and editing Broken Wings ( her first book ) and then rushed through this one . Additionally , and most annoyingly , Rio was a totally different person . Suppposedly , she is a competent , well-regarded FBI agent . She was certainly competent in the first book and I liked her a lot there . However , in this book everyone treats her like she ca n't handle some trouble and she goes along with it . It felt like she was a civilian rather than an FBI agent ! I could POSSIBILY see her father treating her like this ( he may be worried about his daughter ) ; however , for other FBI agents to treat her like this and for her to accept it just seemed stupid . The author ended up falling into a stereotype that Rio needed Eddie to constantly `` save '' her and it just annoyed the heck out of me !	-1
Unfortuntely this story had so many contrived conveniences and unanswered plot points . The man has a fortress he has erected due to his work . And he works from home . Thus he knew the bridge was there . Yet ... nothing ... just all of a sudden the bridge is an issue and life threatening . Okay - say we let that go ( perhaps the aliens can only rip through time once every so many centuries or what not ) . That is a relatively small suspension of belief issue ( given genre ) . The others ? Not so much . This fellow has a mere 3 hours to save himself ( and others according to himself on phone ) . When talking to himself he hears backrround noise of several people . How come when he neared the last minutes ( if truly was self on phone ) there were no others to make the situation as was related from future Nathan dude ? The arms and convenient destructive abilities of the fortress would seem plausible had the information NOT been provided only when exactly needed for a specific scene saves . Just too contrived to make the length work for author . Had the story gone to novel or novella length the details could have been relayed during story arc development and provided depth to tale and scene structure . This was is just a guy who encounters a bunch of `` Hail Mary '' saves to make the story work for writer brilliantly . But falling far short of mystery or thrill for a reader . It became a - `` well what is gon na get tossed in to save this guy this time ... '' The character was fairly well fleshed out and is likely to be encountered in future works by author . At least it seems so from the ending . Which was open ended with some aliens lurking about.I have another from this author . I am hoping that one is a plot with more depth.Christine	-1
I read this book several months ago and have needed some time to let my thoughts on it percolate . There are a number of things I liked about this story , but there are numerous challenges as well.First , I enjoyed the setting a lot . I grew up in the KC area and could easily visualize the streets and school setting . The book starts slow , maybe too slow . Some people were disturbed by the descriptions of torture right up front and that bothered me a bit as well . But I think I would have been less disturbed if there had been some kind of well-defined reason or payback for it . The world building is inventive and intriguing . I am also fascinated by the possibly scientific explanation for the magic , but this is something that needs more development . I wish I could say as much for the characters . Aside from John Lyon , the main character who is transported to a different world via an access under the stairs in his new , supposedly haunted , home , none of the characters had any redeeming qualities to be seen . Except for maybe his friends in this world , but their roles are pitifully minor.Although an editor is credited , it is clear that his degree was not English . Just because you are a professor does n't mean you have mad grammar skills . For example : `` Three , threatening shadows '' , `` livered servants ( Were they wearing liver ? Or just had intact livers ? ) '' , `` hot , berry pies '' , `` then hads of cities '' , extraneous exclamation points and other questionable punctuation choices , etc.There 's promise here , but it needs some more work . 2.5 stars .	-1
So -- - I saw all of the wonderful reviews and decided to try out Jaclyn 's Ghost for myself.I mean what could go wrong with a woman killed coming back as a ghost and given time to figure out who killed her and try to make it to haven with the help of another ghost and a medium . YUCK ! This book was so not with my time to read and as each chapter continued I had to laugh at the silliness of the plot . Nothing against the author 's writing- but the plot and the story line just did n't make any sense after the third chapter.And then to get to the end of the book and ... . I swear the ending made me want to return the book even though it was free .	-1
The story seemed very simple minded at times , going on in cliches and nonsense.Characters are n't really believable , and the plot was ridiculous .	-1
Thought this was okay summertime fluff . The kind of reading you enjoy on a hot summer day with a tall glass of iced tea because it 's too hot for any serious reading . The story is about Grace whose very , long-term boyfriend has told her he wants them to have a baby . Grace must decide if she really wants a relationship with her fiancee , enough that is to make the baby	-1
I wish there were an option to give zero stars . This book was so painful that I stopped trying to force myself to read it . Thankfully I got it for free or I would have returned it . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Unlikely , in imaginative , uninteresting come to mind when I think of this ..book . It must have been a struggle for the author as well . So much time and so little content	-1
I must not have read the same book as everyone else . This book had much potential but very little character development Android interpersonal relationships were non existant . Cat was boring Android temperamental Android judgemental . Tegan deserved a better mate . Secondary cast of characters if developed for more than a sentence could have been ok . But Cat made the book awful .	-1
Reviewed for Read Your Writes Book Reviews [ ... ] As the description explains this is the first story in the Emily Castles mystery series by Helen Smith . Three Sisters is actually a small novella which sets up and introduces Emily . Three Sisters was a hard book for me to read , even though it 's only about 44 pages long . I attempted to read the book three times before I actually finished it.The story takes place in London on what I believe is the equivalent to Halloween . Emily and her neighbors go to a party located at the end of her street , put on by what appears to be a traveling performance organization similar to a carnival . In essence , it 's like dinner theater , where people who come to see the show bring potluck dishes.The whole premise of the book is that Emily is the only person who sees a murder and no one believes her . More than half of the book is about the set up of the storyline and characters . For me , I did n't get into the book until about 44 % of the way in and even then I was n't totally sure I even liked the book . I did n't start to enjoy it until about 70 % of the way.I 'm not going to say it was easy to determine who the murderer was because there were several possibilities . I will say the murder itself and the events leading to the capture of the murderer were interesting . Could the story have been better ? Most definitely.Source : Blog Tour Host	-1
This book is n't well written and the whole story line was n't very interesting . I know it 's inexpensive , but I 'd encourage readers to look for something else .	-1
Every sex scene had to do with some taking it anally..and while I 'm no prude it just seemed that the writer really really enjoys that aspect of sex ... nou for me	-1
this book started out great for a couple of chapters and went downhill fast . the plot seemed like a Stephen king book I have read in reverse and could have been a great story . but none of the characters are likable . I did not even care if the women were killed and the main character was so whiny I just wanted him to shut up . the author is way too wordy and repetitious . an editor was badly needed for this book to streamline it and to correct the incorrect English usage . spoiler alert : if you plead guilty to a crime there is no jury . the author needs to get his facts straight .	-1
I love a good mystery , but this book was extremely slow . Considering that the length of the book is short , it was extremely draggy . I was expecting more and was left with nothing . Very predictable from the beginning . Also , many things left without answers .	-1
I read the reviews for this book and thought that the story line was intriguing and different from many romances . The hero has a broken leg and is trying to rescue a girl caught in the storm . Well that was the only thing interesting about this book . It was so unrealistic and the heroine was so whiney and old fashioned . I felt like this was a victorian commentary about women 's lib issues . I do n't know how the author believes this would be interesting to a woman of today 's day and age . A woman out to buy her own business and create an independent life with a card store ? Really ? And at every chance she has to mention about how she has to be an independent business woman ... ok lady , you are on your own exploring the country looking for a place to settle down and you are suddenly not independent ? I do n't get this book at all . There was no connection for me between the hero and heroine , the love scenes were barely worth reading . The dialogue was childish . I am surprised I gave this one 2 stars ... which was probably only for the preface of the story and the dramatic ending . Other than that , it was n't worth the read .	-1
I mean , I get it in that I understand everything that happens in this story . . . I just do n't understand how it comes together to be a funny story or even a particularly interesting one . It 's more like a collection of implausbilities piled on top of each other in the hopes something will stick .	-1
I was not impressed with this book . I thought it was cheaply written and very tasteless . Would not read any more in the series	-1
I 'm sorry but this book was not worth the time I spent reading it . The characters were shallow and there was so many gaps in the story . It was like a Disney story with the happy ending . There was no depth , no angst . It started off with such promise , but then failed . Do n't waste your time or money .	-1
Ya know ... I am tired of sci-fi being about men , war , and politics . I think that was why I was so excited with Patty Jansen 's Watcher 's Web . It was all the things I want in sci-fi : space travel , new and different beings , planets , a woman who has a mind of her own.But , I should have known , HIS Name in Lights would n't give me anything but what has already been written about . Please ! Ok , Her Majesty was there lighting the lights , so to speak , but ... more human emotion . More depth of character . Maybe a longer book would have allowed an insight to the main characters ' souls .	-1
I bought this book because the reviews were ok , sounded good enough , & to tell the truth I loved the cover . I was reading it on my Kindle . The first 7 % of the book I was ready to trash it , but thought i 'll keep going , at 17 % of the book that was the end of the line . I do n't like Reality shows that much . I ca n't stand women who act like 14 year olds , but my biggest pet peeve of them all is a writer who can not write a teenager so they make them smart mouth hateful brats { most teenagers are not like this and it ticks me off that people write them like this } . Were I drew the line and said no more this book is n't worth my time , is when she made a vulgar remark about her teenaged daughter . I never once in my life said or thought anything vulgar about my own . Made me sick . Dee DeTarsio was trying for a cheap laugh I guess . And all she did was make herself look cheap .	-1
First let me state I did not read this entire book . I do n't understand the high marks in this book 's reviews . It 's just not much of a way to spend your time . For a better perspective read something by M.Connelly or V. Flynn . Mr. Leverone needs to develop that special talent good authors have that lets the reader get into the action as though they were there .	-1
This was my first purchase of a book or anthology featuring Stephanie James and company and it will be my last . Usually I try to finish a book , even when it 's not great , but I had to skip through most of this one . This is supposed to be romance , but I felt none ... and no connection to the characters whatsoever . Very disappointing .	-1
This lady wishes the book had made a bit more sense . Nine years ago Nikolas Acton and Lady Patricia Morgan spent one day in each other 's company , without revealing to each other their identities . They agree to meet again the next day but miss each other by just ... this ... much . And then both go on to live separate lives while still being obsessed with each other to the point of overkill.Patricia is forced to marry a man she does n't love , who is cold and seemingly indifferent to her except for uninspired sex and the procreation of two sons . Nikolas goes on to become a heroic and famous sea captain in the Napoleonic Wars , who has sexual encounters but never romantic ones.Nine years later they accidentally meet again , learn each other 's identities and eventually manage their HEA . ( This because her husband was kind enough to be killed in the war . ) Along the way to the HEA , we have some secondary characters to `` entertain '' us ( although no character in the book is very well drawn ) , an `` adventure '' involving finding an unspecified treasure , and we readers find out towards the end who the `` deus ex machina '' is who has arranged this chance encounter of the two star-crossed lovers.If you are of the romantic nature which accepts that a 1-day anonymous bonding session ( just talking and kissing , no actual sex ) will keep two people obsessed with each other for almost a decade , to the absolute exclusion of romantic feelings for anyone else ever again , this is the novella for you . It is also part of Ashe 's `` Rogues of the Sea '' series , so in that respect it may be interesting to you .	-1
I was liking this story very much . I enjoyed the way Flynn and Gable met , how they worked together and the sexual tension between the two . I even liked the fact Flynn and Gable started singing 'I love you 's ' way too soon . I liked Flynn and his need to have a permanent home and how he just wanted to take care of Gable . I liked Gable because he was so confused on why Flynn was staying with him and even how self-conscious and how low his self-worth really was.However , while I liked the story in the beginning , it kind of took a wrong turn somewhere for me . I did n't enjoy how Gable essentially was using Flynn as a f***-toy/housekeeper when it was clear Flynn wanted an actual relationship with feelings . Gable would be lovey dovey one moment then all but running from the room and cold as ice the next . It was like he was bi-polar and his actions towards Flynn when he was pissed frustrated me.I did n't like the direction the story went in . I 'm not overly fond of ex-lovers being in a story ( Grant is in almost the whole last half of the book ) and I do n't enjoy female characters that much either ( the best friend , Calley ) . Really , I did n't like how big a part Calley and her pregnancy played in the last half of the story . It felt wrong and inconsistent with the beginning . Honestly , I felt like it took away from my enjoyment especially when I felt like Calley was kind of manipulating Gable into being the babies daddy ( while not actually having to be a daddy ) . It just felt wrong to me and like she was dumping all her problems on Gable and expected him to fix them for her so she could be happy and him and Flynn could be miserable instead . Okay , I may be over exaggerating on the miserable part but it still felt like she dumped all her problems on Gable and expected him to fix them.The story was also very inconsistent in general . Flynn would say one thing and then end up doing something different . Gable said he 'd never donate sperm unless he could physically be the kid 's dad then ends up donating sperm . There was also the fact that the things mentioned in the beginning ended up being something different in the end ( Flynn says Gable and him never cuddled in the beginning of their relationship which is inaccurate as they did cuddle , how they never slept close together before the accident when , in fact , they did ) and other things like that.I also felt like the second half of the story was a whole setup for the sequel ( featuring Hunter and Grant ) . A lot of the scenes in the story were also unnecessary and just seemed like a filler . The timeline around the events had me questioning whether it was accurate or not . I also felt like the writing ranged between stunted and choppy . It made reading a bit difficult especially when it seemed to drag a bit.With that said , I did like the story to some extent . I liked the characters enough and I liked the conflict regarding Gable 's leg . I found that interesting although I had a problem coping with Gable 's semi-easy acceptance of its loss considering he was so anti-amputation.All in all , this was an okay story . I liked the beginning but I was n't so fond of the rest . I liked Flynn even if what he said was counteracting other things he said and did . I think this will be a hit or miss with others , though , so I encourage people to still try reading it and make up your own mind whether you liked the story or not .	-1
Did not like this one at all . I tried , really I did but the two main characters were too ... Non-masculine for me to accept . Not effeminate , that I could handle but more like women with male physical parts . This definitely was not written for male readers . Save your buck and go elsewhere .	-1
I know that this book is old so I guess it does n't matter , but here goes : REALLY ? ! ! I felt cheated as I loved the first two . The hero of the book was intelligent and quick on his feet . He dodged just about everything that they could throw at him and survive ... .. only to have his stupidity kick in at this last one ? ! Not to mentioned that this last book was quick and in a hurry to end ; so I 'm done with the Luther Kite books . I 'll be keeping away from anymore of ( any ) series that he has out ... .	-1
There were too many characters and twists and that the romance got lost in the crowd . Typically , I begin reading a new book and hoping I will want to continue reading ... . Unfortunately , this book never reached that point . Why do n't I finish it ? Simply because I got bored .	-1
This book did n't have much plot , especially during the last half of the book . It seems that the author was too busy indulging in her fantasies to actually think about anything like a plot .	-1
one sick excuse for a book..filthy words galore . what makes some authors think that they need all this gutter talk to write a good book ?	-1
I expected more than this book delivered . One or two sentences about an important event in history is not a viable option . There could have been more about how events impacted history.Timeline of World History	-1
I read this book in just a few minutes and could not figure out why it was even written . Why would you write a story like this with no point ? Great possibilities with no substance . It was like reading a diary with no end.I would not recommend this one to anyone .	-1
Not a good book , could not even finish reading the first story , way to graphic ! Would not recommend this book !	-1
I had just hope for this book . I found many , many similarities with the series LOST , even some names . True , I did n't finish the book because I am not interested in talking dinosaurs .	-1
i love the idea of fallen angels and the demons and stuff . this book was a disappointment to me . i have read other books like this one and they were amazing . this one was not well written and the plot was hard to follow	-1
Okay so earth was attacked by an alien force called the & # 34 ; Scourge & # 34 ; but they were thwarted by another alien species of warriors called the Kindred . In trade for their protection and continuing sacrifice in the war against the & # 34 ; Scourge & # 34 ; earth must provide brides to the 96 % male dominated Kindred population . Single women within a certain age range are registered into a draft involuntarily . Now I agree with the over reviewers who say it becomes an annoying broken record with the heroine fighting , denying , and rejecting the Kindred warrior that has initiated the draft to claim her , but I understand why she does it . She has a family , a new career , and life on earth that she basically has to throw away forever against her will . Really it 's a caveman hitting her over the head and dragging her away by the hair analogy , but its the authors fault that it becomes so ridiculously frustrating . She needed to either let the girl leave or make her get over it somehow . I get that the hero is mated to her as his & # 34 ; one true mate & # 34 ; so he has no choice and refuses to give up , but it reduces his character to a punching bag that 's in tatters on the floor but keeps getting up for more . It had promise but the storyline just was n't strong enough to carry it.The steamy scenes are decent the language is very crude just to warn you although they do n't truly come together until the last chapter of the book . The action struggles of the book are explained after the fact without a lot of detail so really you could care less . I gave it two stars because the author is a decent writer and I want to give her the benefit of the doubt . Maybe the second book is better ? If anyone has read it and can comment that would be appreciated .	-1
The beginning was funny . I enjoyed some of the dialogue characters . The H is very sweet , romantic , wonderful . The h ... not so much . 50 % through the book , I started skimming . The h was annoying me , because she was just so freaking stupid . The sexual tension was just too much . I like cool h 's that I can relate to ... Olivia was not . I Do n't think I 'll be reading anymore of this series . I read some reviews of Sofia and Kat 's and they sound like the same big annoying tease ... just different names . I 'm giving this book 2 stars , because it made me at least laugh .	-1
Like several others who have rated this story below a 3 , I found the main female character , Liv , to be increasingly annoying as the story wore on . Yes , I understood her dismay at being taken from her life with no say , but Baird was beyond patient and loving to her . It got tiresome - the love scenes that she would take so far , then call out & # 34 ; No & # 34 ; ! By the third week , I was actually wanting Baird to send her back and say enough . Liv was whiny , belligerent , and downright selfish - she was unable to see any viewpoint but her own . In addition , she was supposed to be smart , but she was beyond stupid to leave their quarters when Baird had to be gone , then to use the communication device when she knew she was n't supposed to.I wish there would have been some actual communication between them instead of all the sex . Baird was supposed to know her because of the mind-sharing , but if that were true , he should have suggested she work in the medical bay on the ship . And gone before the council to allow her to see her sister more often . Too many inconsistencies in what could have been a good story.The saving grace of this story was the descriptions of the alien vessel and all of the different things on board . That part at least kept my interest ... too bad the rest of the story could n't as well .	-1
I read this book a while back and review it on goodreads , but just realized I forgot to review it here ... I went into this `` sci-fi-rotica '' with low expectations . In a way , I was pleasantly surprised , as Evangeline Anderson is actually quite good at writing sex scenes and foreplay . And because that was a large part of why I bought the book , I actually enjoyed it a fair amount . The dirty talk was hot and I enjoyed the sex for the most part . I also think she occasionally has good creative ideas ( like the genetic trading thing ) that could be expanded on a lot further . Even the idea of the Kindred and Scourge if they were re-written or re-imagined to be just slightly more believable , could be awesome That said ... The one part of the story that bothered me the most was actually the premise . For some reason , I just could n't get passed it . I mean , the main heroine is essentially ordered for thirty days to be wooed by a massive musclebound Kindred `` warrior '' ( on to that later , lol ) and if she gives in , they have passionate bonding sex , they are then essentially married and the bride has to leave behind her entire life on Earth . This is the price paid by the chosen women of Earth , for being saved from the Scourge , another race of aliens with Kindred blood ... they are genetic traders , after all.Naturally , our heroine Olivia , is quite reluctant to relinquish all she knows and loves , in spite of the promises of sexual fulfillment and life of love and pampering from a monstrous dude she hardly knows . This premise is what creates the long and drawn-out conflict in the story , between her and Baird ( the hero ) . Olivia hence forth becomes almost unbearably irritating . She 's intensely attracted to our hottie hero Baird yet constantly feigns resistance , fearing never to see her twin sister Sophia again ( who is the main character in the second book btw ) . In a way , I ca n't blame her . Baird is portrayed as absurdly possessive , as he is a Beast Kindred and as such thinks women are pets to be loved , cared for , and given a good rogering now and ... now . But after the millionth `` Mine ... she 's mine '' ( growled softly of course ) it just gets kind of tiresome . Baird is also goodhearted , in spite of his innate badassness and never tries to force himself on his new bride . Supposedly he fell in love with Olivia before even meeting her , through their dream sharing . Why that is though , I ca n't say , as Olivia reveals herself to have few redeeming qualities . She bitches , she moans , she makes `` humorous '' social faux pas on alien planets , but she rarely if ever does anything deserving of the praise and admiration Baird gives her . Common sense would tell most of us that she is undeserving of such devotion , and that 's another problem I have with this story . The heroine does not deserve the hero . Not even remotely . And the fact that the hero wants to love and possess the heroine foreverrrr and everrr inspite of this , makes me dislike him as well . I just had a hard time respecting Baird because his feelings were just too unbelievable . Also , the whole mating fist thing=ICKY ! Yuck yuck yuck Evangeline . Please do n't . *Also , the pheremones/mating scent thing kind of weirds me out a little . It strikes me as throwing a little bit of non-con into the mix , which I ca n't really understand . If these guys need to drug women with their scent in order to suck them in , then I ca n't really respect that.I personally , also find the `` Gentle/Loving Warrior '' archetype really lame . A massive killer warrior that 's maimed , destroyed and done awful things to other living beings is n't going to be unconditionally devoted to a whiny b*tch when there are plenty of other women in the universe . Sorry . Totally unable to suspend my disbelief on that one . Another reviewer pointed out that the society Anderson has created is very matriarchal in spite of the fact that these huge `` warriors '' are living amongst a 95 % male population . The men exist only to serve the women or give them pleasure and do n't seem to expect anything in return for that . It 's like step-ford wives but with men . Kinda creepy , now that I think about it in that light .	-1
It was n't very interesting in the beginning , when they left the party to have sex , but it got even worse in the end , when they suddenly fell in love with each other . Boring .	-1
So they are in love . But he 's a vampire and she 's dying . Oh and he ca n't turn her . But she could become a were of some kind . Biting her is hot , but as a were he ca n't bite her . The End.Not interesting , not compelling , and for as short as it was I actually had to struggle to finish it . It was boring , predictable , and I did n't feel like anything was accomplished	-1
I usually read reviews before purchasing a book ( even before downloading free ones ) for just this reason . However , I was in a hurry , liked the blurb and downloaded it . Thank goodness it was free or I 'd be screaming for my money back . This book is complete waste of time if you expect an ending and I do . It 's very confusing in places . You do n't know if what is happening is real , a hallucination , or a dream sequence as one flows into the other without any transition . I wo n't say it did n't have any good parts , because it did . Had it actually ended satisfactorily I probably would have given it 3 stars . However , this is NOT A STANDALONE book . It just ends in the middle of everything with a `` to be continued . '' What the heck ? I am so tired of authors thinking they can force you to buy their next book by not giving the first one an ending . All this does is tick me off for wasting my time . Had it been a good book , with a real ending and stood alone , I would have purchased the next in the series . I usually do . What this author has done has made me add him to my black list of NEVER TO BUY AGAIN authors . I will never trust this author ( or anyone else who does this ) to provide an enjoyable reading experience . If it 's intended to be a serial with no conclusion of each book then the author needs to state that in the description . Just saying Book One does n't cut it . There are great series of books out there that each have their own ending .	-1
1 1/2 STARS ROUNDED UP TO TWO FOR THIS ONE.I wanted to like this book . The premise was a good one for me - woman has abduction fantasies , needs them to be realistic , locked in car 's toolbox which is picked up by repo man who appears he may be able to work with her fantasies in a more authentic fashion . One of my complaints is that hetero books often take a softly , softly approach because readers will be offended with things that happen to a female . This book promised to take things to a place that I sometimes want to go , but it failed to deliver.What I did n't like -1 ) Ember is way too trusting for BDSM with a man she 's just met . Like ridiculously , dangerously trusting with a guy who is very strange and conflicted himself . She is co-dependent and sets subs and , in particular , women back 40 years . 2 ) Lucas is not particularly likeable or stable as a man , let alone as a supposed Dom . In my opinion he is n't a decent Dom , just a man releasing his pent-up frustrations by bossing people around . I would n't go near him with a 20 foot barge pole . 3 ) The brother , Matthew , was an annoying distraction , who went from bratty nutjob to ( kind of ) OK in 0-60 seconds . 4 ) Even the dog was obnoxious , down Daisy you stink . AND 5 ) Learning to Drown wins the worst editing of the decade award . I am not a writer , an editor or paid critic but the errors in this book were glaringly obvious to me . There were typos , grammatical errors and poorly formatted pages absolutely everywhere . It thoroughly slaughtered the flow of the book.What I liked -Hmmm . 1 ) The sex was n't too bad . 2 ) The premise was good and , with better execution , could have been a very interesting book . 3 ) There is promise for dark works oustide of the standard hetero box with Sommer Marsden . 4 ) The cover was very appealing.Overall , Learning to Drown was a disappointing book . I do n't know whether her other books are better ... .but an editor would bloody well help .	-1
Cute enough story lines ( all three books ) but expletives become tiring . Very wordy . I found myself skipping pages to get back to the conversation . Ca n't complain too much at $ .99 . Over all , just ok .	-1
I would n't have purchased this book , but I did try and read it because it was free . I was disappointed . I 'd already read Without Mercy , and pretty much knew what happened . I think this book was unnecessary because it did n't bring any real new information . In general I love Lisa . Jackson . This is the only thing she 's published so far that I have n't liked	-1
I just could not get into this book , but it may be the best book in the world to you . Read the summary and decide for yourself .	-1
I was disappointed in this book . While the male love interest ( vampire ) is hot as all get out the heroine 's personality and convictions were conflicting and very dull for me . The story line was ok but weak and seemed a bit piece milled . It was anticlimactic ( not talking sex scenes here ) . When it was over I was n't sad nor satisfied , it just ended . Its a quick , mindless sort of read and definitely would n't pay more that a few bucks for it .	-1
I sent it back . I thought it was terrible.Spoiler ! ! **Four people land , one dies , best friend offers use of wife to buddy . All get rescued buddy and wife are crap for having sex .	-1
What the ... . ? Anything can be dangerous does n't have a scary page in it ! ! What a real waste of my time !	-1
My review is based solely on the first short story as I could not force myself to read the rest . Three words : killer plastic bags . I kid you not . That 's what the first story is about . I do n't think the author intended for the story to be funny , but I could n't stop laughing . The idea is so completely ridiculous , it amazes me that it even got published . Maybe the other stories in the book are better , but I 'm never going to know b/c I 've already deleted the book from my kindle .	-1
I usually find m & eacute ; nage stories engaging , but this one was so crude and poorly written that I was extremely disappointed . Too bad , as the plot had some potential .	-1
& lt ; a href= '' http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00657ZEW6/ '' target= '' blank '' > The Science Fiction Megapack & lt ; /a > Even at 99 cents , it 's not a bargain . Now ; even though I 'm critical of this first in a five-book series , I want you to know that the other four are pretty good and are definitely worth the buck that each one costs . Just skip this one and get the others.Frankly , while there are a couple of good stories in this first volume , most are just old , musty , public-domain relics that can be had for nothing on other sites , that is if you 're really into the archeological roots of science fiction . It 's difficult to take stories written 70-years-ago seriously about races of Venus and Mars and so on . We know too much here in 2013 to even suspend our disbelief to read them.Again , the following four volumes in the Megapack series are much better . . . than this one .	-1
As noted by others , it 's really , really short . Shorter than you think . Shorter than it should be for the price .	-1
The writer tries hard , and the price is right , but this cliched story tries way too hard to be clever and , at its heart , there really is n't a plot to speak of . Reminds me a little bit of the stream of novels Ron Goulart published in the 70s at a rate of about one per month , except that Goulart was funnier , and hidden in his farces were some pretty good science fiction ideas . Not a hopeless case , however . The writer should try again .	-1
& # 34 ; Humorous Mystery & # 34 ; ? ? ? I do n't think so . There was absolutely nothing humorous about it . In fact , it was so boring I could n't ( would n't ) bother to finish it . This was a waste of time .	-1
I was n't able to finish reading this book . I tried to like it , but I found myself confused half the time . You would go from you one scene in one location , to thee next scene in a different location , with little to no explanation as to how Alec and Samuel got their . I also did n't understand how Samuel seemed to know so much about Egypt and the languages of small African tribes . I mean come on . What English Lord would know how to speak a language spoken by only small tribe in Africa that Europe probably did n't even know existed ? It did n't make sense , and no explantation was given . I do n't think I made it more than a quarter of the way through the book before I moved on to another of the hundreds of novels on my Kindle app .	-1
I bought this book because I love Sylvia Days other books . I quit reading it about a fourth of the way through . It just was n't like the others and I was disappointed .	-1
Scott and Penny are firefighting partners . Each has come to realize that they romantically care for the other but have reasons to resist the attraction . When Penny sprains her ankle , Scott moves into her house to help her out.This book felt like there was a prequel that I was missing . First , at several points it was mentioned that Scott 's sister had had been kidnapped by a serial arsonist who she helped to catch with her drawings . The story mentioned people that I felt like I was supposed to know ( Millie ... who now had a renewed sense of purpose when Abby had her babysit her daughter several weeks ago ) . Okay - so I felt like I was dropped into the middle of this story . The character 's backstories also were n't discussed . I THINK that Penny is just a volunteer firefighter . It was mentioned that she had worked at a bank and was now a medic . However , this was a throwaway line a few chapters into the book . We know Penny is a widow and married to Jim . However , we are never given information about when Jim died or anything about their life together . Maybe it comes later in the book -- however , I would expect to know this by the 30 % mark . At this point , I know that Scott was married with a bad divorce ; Penny was widowed . However , I do n't know their backstory . I just ca n't feel for characters who I know nothing about.A second problem I had was that Penny seemed like two different people . Half the time , Penny seemed to be coming on to Scott and wanted to kiss him and have a relationship with him . And , at other times , she could n't betray Jim ( her dead husband ) and she felt like dating someone would be like cheating on Jim . And , we did n't get this behavior of `` oh I just kissed him and I do n't know if I 'm ready to move on '' . Instead , in some chapters ( like by the car accident ) she wanted to make out with Scott . Then , when they move to her house , she does n't want anything to happen because of her dead husband . At least Scott was consistently torn ... he wanted to be romantically involved but did n't trust love because of his bad marriage ( which we never really learned about what was so bad ) . A lot of the book is them dwelling on their relationship ( or lack thereof ) .The good of the book ( why it is two stars ) is that at least the grammar and spelling were fine . Also , the author obviously knows something about firefighting . This was both a strength and a weakness . The author used firefighting terms which I had no clue what them meant ( what is a `` Probie '' ? What is the `` alpha side of the house '' ? What are `` turnouts '' -- from the context , it is something they wear ? ) .All in all , I gave up 30 % into the book as I was just so confused and I just did n't care for the characters or the constant thinking/talking about their relationship .	-1
Talk about whirlwind romance ! Everything happened too fast for me to believe . I could not understand why the heroine picked the location she was moving to , made my eyes roll . Found the beginning good but then it spiraled downward for me . Persevered to finish but kept rolling my eyes throughout the story so immediately deleted after reading .	-1
There were too many twists in this story to be likable . I do n't even feel like I connected with the main character at all . It just really felt unrealistic that the main character , who is female , could do all the things that this author had her do in the story . It was almost like he mimicked James Bond and all of those other action movies . It did n't feel original at all . Also , I just had a hard time reading the writing style . Chalked full of overly dramatic scenes with far too much description of Boston . It was like Mr. Sweeney was proving to the readers that he knew the city . I felt like it really bogged the storyline down . I have learned that a good author is one who is n't so wordy and can eliminate unnecessary things . Hopefully he can learn to do this to tighten up his writing a tad bit better.I really had a hard time getting through the book . I 'm glad it was a freebie . I doubt I will be checking out his other stuff .	-1
A witch in Elizabethan England ? When witches were burned ? A self-described witch who has no realistic fears for her life despite the `` enemies '' who know of her witch-ness ? And , to make it duller , a witch who does n't seem to have very many interesting powers or abilities , and who basically does n't use the powers she has : protagonist may as well have been a shopgirl and nothing else . Nothing in the book 's details would place it in London or England , even , let alone Elizabethan England , which is one of my favorite historical periods and the major reason I downloaded the book . The Mystery aspect of this too-predictable Romance is convoluted and dreadfully drawn out , while the Romance itself is just dryer than tinder and repetitious beyond endurance . An experienced editor would have been a boon to this book . Uninteresting , unbelievable characters hampered by a wooden writing style and a convoluted , repetitious plot .	-1
I 've never hated a hero more and he just ruins what could have been a good story.Sarah Montgomery , widowed from the Civil War responses to an ad for a mail order bride for Lucas Chandler in Colorado . When she arrives , he 's not at the train station so she has a driver take her out to his spread.Bitter , alcoholic Luke is nursing his nightly hangover when Sarah arrives . After having his foot amputated during the war , he 's surly and withdrawn . His interfering brother Matt and his wife do n't want him to be lonely anymore so they write to Sarah deceiving her into think it was Luke writing to her and wanting her as his wife.Luke 's piece of scum self lets it CLEARLY known that all he wants is a lover and not a wife and if Sarah gets on her knees for him he 'll marry her . This dude TELLS her this people ! After realizing that Luke is treating her like a whore Sarah leaves and intends to get a teaching job in town . But no one will hire her after she spent the night at Luke 's house . Of course it was innocent with her sleeping in the guest room , everyone assumes she and Luke had sex and she 's the new town whore . Sarah 's pride prevents her from seeking Luke out for help so she gets a job at the saloon which is only the first step to becoming a whore.Luke after hearing of Sarah 's bad fortune brings her back to his house . I cried for Sarah because of Luke 's treatment of her but she 's nothing to write home about . This `` spitfire '' Southern/slave holding Sarah does n't have too much pride . Luke lets her live with him and basically screws the hell out of her all day every day with NO intention of marrying her.Historical bad boy rakes are BETTER than Luke . He 's the scuzziest , scummiest , hero , man I 've ever read of in a book that 's suppose to be the hero . This book is pure sex with him basically contorting her into every Kama Sutra position he can think of . Then he parades her in town like it 's no big deal . He KNOWS she 's a nice person yet he does care . Boo hoo for his stumpy foot . He 's an awful man and only marries her when reality FINALLY hits him over the head and goes `` Well , gosh darn it I have to marry her because I have been treating her like a prostitute have n't I ? `` He 's cruel , disgusting and does n't deserve to be the hero in this book . Too bad he only made it out of the war with a missing foot . He 's not a nice person . Not a nice man.You feel bad for Sarah but not that bad because she lets him treat her worst than a prostitute . At least those women at the saloons get paid for their troubles.I WOULD N'T recommend this book to ANYONE . Yuck ! Just say NO and pass it on by !	-1
is this really a book ? i thought it was like somebody 's camping diary that they kept writing in after drinking some fermented kool-aid .	-1
Let me sum it up quickly . This book was not good . I love paranormal/ghost stories -- -but I did n't see either in this book . Maybe I missed something .	-1
Typical story that was poorly written . It was entirely unoriginal and the response of the characters were ridiculous . In one paragraph she will not date the boss , the next she lets him kiss her and contemplates doing him in the parking lot . Really ? So dumb thank God it was free .	-1
Did not enjoy at all ... .. Poor writing skills . An Asian heroine made the story even worse ... . I do n't understand how this book got 4 stars .	-1
Starting with the first chapter I found myself skipping ahead trying to find something interesting enough to hold my attention . Finally I just gave up . I could n't get into the story and there was nothing that held my attention . Disappointed because I have read this author before and from all the reviews it 's supposedly a good book . Maybe it is but it just was n't for me .	-1
This story was interesting but I did not know it was just a teaser . Sorry but I do not like to read teaser books . To me the author or publisher is just trying to get people to buy a full length novel that usually is not worth buying . Granted this story was interesting and might be something I would read but I will not be buying the full length novel .	-1
do n't care for it , will be deleting it	-1
Also known as stinky noodles . UckIntentional probs even with tiny portionSave ur money . . . . L .	-1
Very disjointed . Jumps from one thing to another could not get the plot . deleted it from my kindle . Would not recommend it .	-1
I have read many many of Gemma Halliday 's books . This was definitely the worst . I actually really like her others . I was very disappointed and ended up not even finishing .	-1
It was ok even though I knew it was a short read wanted more of an story line . thank goodness it was free . I wonder what will happen to the sister . Do n't think I will pay for the next part of this series . I will keep a look out maybe it will be free or come as a box set , and in the borrowed section . Then I will read the series .	-1
i felt this book was written poorly . i 'm usually pretty easy to please but i felt that these two charictors were written horribly and inconsistant . i also didnt like the forced part , it all felt like the one was forcing himself to much , i would have cried rape really , i felt it was to strong up in your face and deal with it attitude . and the supposid love they had was n't earned , i did n't feel it in the least . there were some promising aspects but badly done and a bad taste left .	-1
Though I am a big werewolf fan , I was a little surprised at thisStory . Line . Would n't ' recommend this to.my book club . : )	-1
A short story leaves little time for character and plot development . This story was not successful on either front . Grammar errors . Poor descriptive phrasing . Not worth your time .	-1
To echo another reviewer 's comment , this short story had an incredibly predictable ending . Scribner is a real fan of placing characters in traps that they must resolve -- he returns to this theme again and again in his fiction . The issue with this story is that the setting is bizarre and there is never an explanation offered for how the two men arrived there.The editing is rough .	-1
Terrible , terrible , terrible . This was the second book I purchased by this author , her first one was ok and I tought I would give it a chance . She uses thousands of useless , meaningless page filling words to get absolutely nowhere in her story . I never thought the British police were so incompetent . She either has no police experience or was the worst cop on the force . DO NOT and I repeat DO NOT waste you time or money on this author . Her main character is a slut that bangs for anything in pants and her endless dialogue on nothing is one of the most boring authors I have had the misfortune of reading . Zero on the recommendation scale .	-1
I was very disappointed in this book . The dialogue was unbelievable , the characters ' responses to the situations were even less believable , and the author 's reliance on exclamation points was irritating . Sentence after sentence ending with exclamation points ! Even for unimportant facts ! Will not be buying any more of this author 's books !	-1
I really tried to give this book the benefit of the doubt , but stopped halfway through it . My goodness , this was as boring as it gets , and I could n't fathom why the hero was even attracted to Allie . She was drawn to Slade even tho she was convinced that he wanted to 'steal ' her daughter . Really ? ! The plot meandered and the conversations were unrealistic , especially when Slade addressed her as 'Woman ' . I gave this book 2 stars because it was a free download at the time .	-1
I hate to be a dream squasher , but if the author wants to have any success , she is going to need to take some grammar and writing classes . The writing was just terrible and does not seem to be written by an educated person . Mistakes such as using `` there '' instead of `` their '' are very irritating and someone should tell her that willpower and forearm are spelled as one word , not two . I have never seen so many short , choppy sentences . The book was full of editing mistakes , which is bad enough , but the entire book was so boring and repetitive that at about 88 % I finally just had to start skimming to get to the end . How many times do we need to know that his hands feel like sandpaper and she tucks her hair behind her ears ? In one scene , Michael 's gun is a Taurus and in the next it is a Glock . We read all this crap about the gun and him carrying it , but when he could really use it , he does n't even think about it . Why even mention it if it does not have anything to do with anything . About 85 % of the book did nothing to set the scene , advance the plot , or give insight to the characters . They started off likable and interesting and just became more and more stupid and irritating . She wants a relationship with him , but does not want a relationship with a firefighter , but she likes him a lot , but she does not know , but she does want to be with him , but she is not sure about it , but she thinks they could be good together , but she just does not know ... ... blah blah you get the idea . And that was just in one paragraph , which was repeated several times throughout the book . The author obviously did not do any research on fire departments , police departments , drugs , alcoholism or illegal gambling . It sounds like it was written by someone in high school . The plot could have made a great book , but it was ruined by absurdities and errors throughout . Definitely a waste of time . I feel like I need to apologize for being so mean , but it really was that bad . I dont know how anyone could give it 5 stars .	-1
I 'm a voracious reader of many fiction genres . Historical romance is a favorite of mine , and a touch of the paranormal in the heroine 's prescience seemed like it would add to the fun . Sadly , I found the lengthy flashbacks and stutteringly interrupting flashes of insight so irritating that I abandoned the book just a quarter of the way through . I can appreciate the author 's intent to build a rich background for the characters and plot , but the pace and style were less illuminating than ineffective .	-1
Did not like this author 's writing . From the start felt the story was missing parts , hard to follow . Only read a quarter of this book . Read many native American stories , enjoyed many of them . Did not like this one at all .	-1
Attitudes and motivation of characters not easily understood . Gave up trying to understand or like main characters and removed from my kindle	-1
Too many unanswered questions and too many loose ends for me to enjoy this one . I kept trying to get through it because of the Native American mystical parts because I thought it 'd be an interesting story.If I 'm reading a book and it gets so confusing and frustrating that I have to re-read sections to figure it out , it 's time to put it down and move on . That 's what I did .	-1
Another limp attempt at erotica , honestly , look at my other erotic reviews for a web address where better erotica can be found .	-1
I expected a lo more from this book and clearly I was wrong in doing so . I gave two stars for effort but this book was a bit disappointing . Actually , for me , it was quite disappointing . It never really held my interest and found myself becoming distracted and complacent . I wanted to like the book , I really did but just could not . The writing was mediocre , the thought process was a bit unorganized , and some phrases and scenes were lame and corny . And the heat ... non existent . I thought the premises for the book could have been great if it would have been executed but it fell short ... really short . I , unfortunately , did n't even make it halfway through the entire book before deciding to just stop , refocus , and delete . I have another book that I downloaded by the same author and hoping it will prove to MUCH better than this one . We 'll see ...	-1
Out of 18 stories , you 'd think some would be good . Not so ! Do n't waste your time . It seems like they put together a bunch of failures to create a book .	-1
I 'm always looking for new recipes for my slow cooker and anticipated finding at least something..at least ONE decent recipe in this . Well , it 's free . You get what you pay for in this case.These `` recipes '' might be good for starving students but not good for families or people who need to watch their sodium , cholesterol , or other special diet needs . It 's true that nearly every recipe calls for processed cheese . That alone counts me out.I am no stranger to substitution -- I have food allergies including chicken , wheat , milk and oranges and corn ... .but there 's not a single recipe in this book I could even adapt . There is not a single processed commercial soup I can eat . I have yet to find any that does not contain corn or wheat . I cook from scratch and that 's what I want recipes to help me do.If this book were marketed for the NON-cook ... .it might find its niche .	-1
This was a waste of money . The writing was horrible , the story was disjointed , silly , and forgettabkle . I wish I could get my $ 4 back because the book was JUNK .	-1
it was a waste of money . i did not like the hero or the heroine . the plot was boring .	-1
I did not care for this book . At each headwind under the title the sentences have words that break at the end of the space and the word then continues on the nest line . Not very well written . The first part of the book is about one thing and the last part about another .	-1
Sorry . Even a short story needs to be a story . This might stand as a scene in a chapter . But as a story FAIL .	-1
This story reads as if it were based on one of the author 's dreams . It had vague portents of fear , such as in a dream that scares you , but does n't make sense when you go to retell it . You remember how it made you feel , but in the light of day , there is no true basis for the fear.Did the author have a weird dream and decided to build a story on it , trying desperately to link events in the dream and make it more than it was ? That 's how it came across to me . It is by far the dumbest story I 've ever downloaded onto my Kindle and will be deleted from the device and the archives pronto .	-1
I love this author 's style but I wish he 'd just write one book that left off the graphic gore . He is so talented . I know gore sells . I know people love disturbing images but I wish just once that an author with this much talent would write just a scary ghostly book without sending his readers to their therapist 's couch . Why are American readers so addicted to violence and more to the point , why are talented writers feeding this morbid addiction ?	-1
I received a complimentary copy of this book and I must admit I was not too thrilled reading it . There are several short stories , some are good and some are quite senseless.I enjoyed a few but not many . The few I did happen to like a little bit , left me hanging and waiting to hear the full story , I felt as if he left me at the altar wanting to know if there is a story there , and then some were senseless as I said before.He writes as if he is in a hurry and then he repeats himself a few times just to fill out the page .I was glad when I finished the 10 short stories and really did n't want to read any more from this author.Sorry ... but that 's how he left me.It is not often that I will read a book in its entirety when I do n't like the first few chapters , but I stayed with this book and read it all the way through only because I felt I should give him a chance . Others reviewed it with positive effects but I just did not care for it at all .	-1
It 's rare that I feel as if finishing a book is like pulling teeth , but that 's exactly how I felt with this book . Let 's begin with the writing : there 's no developed style of writing ... I just could n't get into this story . It did n't pull me in and hold my attention . Next , the characters were so flat -- -there was no depth to the characters . I certainly did n't feel like I was getting to see the personalities of Jamilla or Tony . It was clear that Letta was a little crazy , but beyond that , there was no depth to her character , either ! She was just weird making strange suggestions for Jamilla . Finally , the story was just silly -- -too many unbelievable twists in the story : the wives , the twins , etc . There 's only so much silliness I can allow as a reader before the novel becomes unacceptable . This novel met that threshold ! To top that off , the book was so rushed at the end , particularly the unexpected marriages ! Sadly , the best part of the book was the first few pages , involving the sex scenes with Max and Jeanette . The rest of the sex scenes were a bit blah ... nothing very interesting . This book was a big disappointment for me and will probably cause me to avoid any of this writer 's future works .	-1
i tried the sample and then bought the book . it started out ok , but it turned wierd . im not saying it was a bad book , but it wasnt for me . they sprayed zombies with different fruit cents and studied how the zombie would behave . i didnt read the entire book because i lost interest . it may have been an excellent book but i just couldnt get into it .	-1
Short but sweet , it definitely left me wanting more . I love the idea of the kidnapping and them spending time alone to work on their marriage	-1
It just starts out with much sex . The beginning not too good . Ending was easy to figure out before hand .	-1
The only wish l have is for it to be longer . A little more substance to the story line and it would be more enjoyable .	-1
You can get any LDS material free at : ldskindlemobi.blogspot.comUnlike the other review , the church does n't actually support mobi on materials EXCEPT scriptures/gc.They have preformatted everything for kindle.Hope this helps !	-1
To be honest I did enjoy the story until the sex scenes popped up ! If you are looking for a Christian Romance do not buy this book . While Karen is a good writer , I personally will not be buying anymore of her books .	-1
I do n't believe this book should be included in the christian catalogue . It has a lot of sexuality in it and does not relate to the christian life at all .	-1
Like others , I was a bit confused as to why this is listed as Christian fiction . I 've figured it out.There are two books with the same title . One of them IS a Christian novel . This one is not.If you 're looking for the Christian one , the author is ARLENE JAMES . I read it last night . It 's a cute book - I 'd recommend it .	-1
Sorry , but the word 'quicksand ' was a great name for this book . I was ok with the first 50 pages or so but the word quicksand came up way too often , at the drop of any problem the characters had to face along with the actual description of quicksand . That kind of irritated me but the mystery that came near the end of the book proves once again , Mrs. Adams is not a mystery writer . The whole mystery hinged on too many people 's involvement and there were way too many little happenings that leaves one scratching her head to figure out where they fit . The whole mystery situation was resolved in the last 4 pages of the book ... to fast , too contrived . It was like , & # 34 ; How the heck could anyone begin to get an idea of what was going to happen ? & # 34 ; Even the CHRISTIAN element did n't feel sincere . I think I just read my last Diane Adams book .	-1
The previous reviews must have been written by the author 's friends and/or family . Did n't like the main characters or even her nutter mother . Poorly written with lots of typos , terrible grammar and badly edited . Her categorizing was ( a ) redundant ( b ) not helpful and ( c ) boring . I did not like this book . Was n't worth the $ 2.99 I paid for it . Wo n't be reading the next book .	-1
I was very disappointed with this one . I have all the others but this was my least favorite . I was really excited to be getting Matt 's story . He seemed , from the last book , like the strong manly type but throughout this book he was written as tongue tied and nervous.One thing that really ruined this one for me was Savannah . She came across to me as a bit of a ( bad word deleted ) . Too much casual sex before she gets together with Matt . *Spoiler* i also hated hearing the H tell the h that he loved her after watching his friend have sex with her . He did n't seem comfortable with it either so it did n't make for a hot twist in the relationship.Finally , I like there to be a bit of wholesome-ness to my heroines and she was completely lacking in it . She was written as too easy ( IMO ) and there was nothing that we found out about her that gave her character depth or made me see her as anything more than an easy lay ( sorry for the less than pretty term . ) The only thing that gave it 2 stars for me was just having Matt in the story .	-1
Allison is leaves home to start her residency , while there she becomes friends with her roommate . She also starts to have feelings for her Brody , her mentor . Allison has the ability to help save people who are dying , later she find out that Brody does as well . Together they try to find out how to stay safe from people who want them dead . I thought the beginning of the book was really interesting , but the book was really slow . Most of the book seemed to lag and it was only at the end that we got some answers but not enough . I did n't know that this was supposed to be a Christian romance ; I felt like the author was trying to push her beliefs on me and that pretty much ruined it for me .	-1
I do n't have words for this book , so I 'll just fill up space here . The characters were pathetic . This is another read by Me of Ms. Lee , s books . Please get an editor and have your stories read before it , s printed .	-1
Do n't waste your time . This is n't even long enough to qualify as a 'short story ' but worse , the writing is terrible , the characters completely unsympathetic , and it 's clear the author is shooting for 'cute ' but the story itself is painfully stupid and not even close to believable.You only live once - the 10 minutes it will take to read quickly through this 'story ' is 10 minutes you 'll never get back . Do n't do it - free or not . UGH - I 'd rather pull weeds .	-1
I thought this would be another Christmas reading treat , but I thought wrong . It 's a boy meets girl under the weirdest of circumstances - both were kidnaped just so they can meet , on Christmas Eve . The timing is the only thing Christmassy about it . It portrays some people 's twisted minds and devil may care attitude.When I write a review , the storyline is not so much a consideration for me as much as the lesson that may be derived from it . But not this time . The plot may come across as funny to some , but I do n't like it all .	-1
I know Zach is not an Alpha wolf in the story but his mind set is a little too Omega to make you feel really good about him . It is definately kinky .	-1
I wanted to like it , but it was not really my cup of tea ( to borrow from another reviewer ) . I like the paranormal aspect but ... ... ... ... .I do n't know . I fast forwarded ... ... ... ..	-1
I 'm all about suspending one 's disbelief , but this book was too silly . It was so unrealistic , that I found myself flipping through the last few chapters just to get to the ( very predictable ) end . The characters were n't well developed -- -you never got a sense of what types of people they were . And a operative becoming & # 34 ; emotionally involved & # 34 ; with a subject from a distance is just too ridiculous for words . The characters flip-flopped from being strong , to weak , to I-don't-know-what . I do n't think I 'd read another book by this author . The dialogue between characters was n't flowing either . Just not much to recommend this one , I 'm afraid . Look elsewhere for entertainment .	-1
You can almost picture this author as a blogger wannabe author living in his mother 's basement . The book is very transparent and seemingly is using it to express his political views rather than tell a good story . He also seriously lacks any knowledge regarding military tactics and techniques . He knows very little of logistics and survival methodology , but attempts to cover that up with constant angst among the characters . Very poorly written .	-1
After reading Bloodline of a Kane which I enjoyed very much . I was disappointed in Redemption . Where is the family saga ? What happened to al the uncles and cousins ? Redemption was all about sex with two freaks What grandmother would approve of your married grandson lettings your other two wives staying with her unless it is all about the money . I hope Crown Dynasty is a better read .	-1
This one I thought would be great but after a few pages the characters speaking in some crazy shorthand African American , it was too much and I had enough . Maybe I am not being fair in my review but if a book does n't grab me in the first few pages I wo n't keep going on . Pity about this one .	-1
I tried reading this book . One of the reasons I 'm not thrilled about it is the names are impossible to pronounce . I do n't understand why authors do this . Anyway , I quit reading it and thought that I would try again some other time . I do n't like giving up on books once I start them , but then I decided that life is too short to slug through a book that is hard to read . So , maybe someday I 'll come back to it and try again .	-1
Normally , I can finish a book in a day . For some reason , it took me an entire week and I still can not get past the middle of the book . I had to force myself to keep on reading but the more I read , the more weary I became of the main character . It may have to do with the first person telling of the story . There was n't much showing , mostly telling . It 's like being on a date and the other person keeps on talking . He claims to be modest but went on to describe how great he is in school , how wonderful he is in bed and how easily he handled the task of hiring an army . This is what this book feels like . After a while , I found myself not wanting to pick up the book anymore . Maybe when I have nothing else to read I will go back and find out how the story ends .	-1
Content Grade : C-Format Grade : FThis is a run-of-the-mill collection of formulas and recipes , none of which are new or particularly interesting.The major problem in the Kindle edition is the fact that there are pages after pages which repeat themselves which makes the book unusable . Further , the author included photographs as illustrations , but it looks as if many of them do n't show up and there are big blank spaces with a photo caption and no photo.I got this as a freebie , but today it 's priced at $ 4.99 . Even if the Kindle edition were perfectly formatted , this would be too much . Skip this one . You can find the same recipes on the Internet for free or in previously published books .	-1
I love the series but this short story is really just telling how she becomes a vampire and then hears of shadow falls . She does n't even enter the camp yet . This short story is not important to read and not that interesting .	-1
This book was very disappointing . It was very brief , and I do not think the subject 's basics were addressed sufficiently . Better books on the market for that .	-1
Phaedra lives alone with her kid sister and her crazy mother ( who 's locked away to the attic so she would n't injure or kill her daughters ) . She 's trying to handle school and keep social services away . All this while she has a doomed future of ending up like her mother , since her case of telekinesis has the nasty side-effect of the crazies . When Phaedra 's long lost ( well he left ) brother returns with a questionable cure to their mother 's ( and Phaedra 's ) condition , the book takes a turn to worse . Phaedra proves to be a whiny self-centered bastard who thinks she 's all high and mighty.In my eyes Bittersweet had lots of problems , but the story was somewhat interesting and kept me reading . I did n't like the main character Phaedra at all , the mystery presented in the beginning of the book had no real effect to the plot and was simply explained in the end . The secondary characters were flat without any real meaning -- you see Phaedra 's friends in the beginning and they swoon over her brother and then they 're pretty much forgotten . Also sad to say , Bittersweet is in dire need of editing . There 's lots of typos and some very weird word choices as `` manicured eyebrows '' that snapped me out of the story.The story had some good potential in the midway of the plot , when things really started happening , but the new crew that emerged was just blah and the explanation for the group of kids hunting hags did n't hold water.Since a big part of the story was that the mother is crazy and that 's what awaits Phaedra in the future as well , I think it 's fair to ponder about that a bit also . We learn that having sex with an incubus works like medicine against the condition , but in a fleeting moment it 's mentioned that also having a hysterectomy would cure you fully . Even so it 's passed as a no-go option because Phaedra thought her mother would not approve of her having one at the age of seventeen . So hmm ... option 1 ) losing myself and be a violent crazyoption 2 ) get rid of my uterus and continue being saneWhich would you choose ? The hysterectomy cure was apparently known before her brother popped up with the questionable antidote . And so we come to that . Since being crazy was a better option than hysterectomy , it 's no surprise , that having sex with an incubus that your brother and mom are already sexing up is a better option as well . Phaedra would totally do it with the incubus if her mother told her so ( seriously ) .The end of the book was tightly done and best part of the book , and I ca n't shrug off the feeling , that if the author would just have polished the beginning a bit more , it would 've been so much better . I do n't know ... I think this review came off a bit snarky , but I feel frustrated , since I wanted to like the book and it just left me shaking my head . I do think some readers might enjoy this book , so if the points I mentioned would n't bother you , do give it a chance .	-1
This book has time travel , parallel realities , cyborgs , an apocalypse , and so much else going for it that I desperately wanted to like it . The concept itself is rather unique and I loved the idea of it.However , the book itself is littered with typos , grammatical errors , and plot holes that I almost did n't finish reading it . With just a little work , this could become an amazing book , but as it is , it 's very hard to read . The shifting time lines were easy enough to follow once I figured out what was going on , and I liked how it looped back around to explain the beginning , but there were still way too many other loose ends and issues for me to recommend this to anyone else .	-1
This book had a lot going for it and would have been a decent read except for the heroine who was TSTL ( too stupid to live ) . Not only does she do stupid things but she screams and screams and screams through most of them . Get a grip , girl ! Some sympathetic characters kept me reading despite a cardboard villain who obviously forgot to take his meds . But in retrospect I would n't have missed a lot by giving up .	-1
The author got engaged and decided she wanted an engagement ring , then got all conflicted about that desire , did a bunch of research , and wrote this article . I like Kindle Singles , and like the author , I 've always felt conflicted about diamonds and engagement rings . So I was looking forward to reading this . However , I found it to be too introspective , too New York focused , too self-indulgent and too much like that one friend we all have who wants to know if she looks fat in those pants.I believe my negative reaction was driven in part by the product description , which suggests that the book is more about diamonds and the tradition of the engagement ring . It 's really about the author , with information about the history and traditions included as context and inspiration for her ruminations . If I had approached it from that perspective , I might have enjoyed it more .	-1
So I had read `` Night is Darkest '' by Jayne Ryon and it was wonderful , emotional , thought out and well written with an excellent plot line . It did have the menage elements in it but it just added it the story line . Now I realize that this book , given the plot line was not going to be an awarding winning book but I had never read any other books in the series and therefore I did not know that this book was going to be a menage just for the sake of sex between a bunch of people . I guess that sounds funny given that it is erotica but I am someone that , if I read a menage , I want all the characters to end up together in the end , fall in love . Dave and Kayla are the main love interest in the book but then the author throws in two other members of the `` crew '' to get stranded during the snow storm where they all get freaky together , even Dave the guy that is interested in Kayla . Now these other two members are a gay couple in love with one another but happen to also get it on with the all the other male members of the crew , so I guess they are all bi=/ . So , anyway I guess my problem with this story line is the simple fact that meaningless sex even in romance/erotica just feels dirty to me . Not to mention the author leads you to the conclusion that all the five characters from the construction crew still all get together and get freaky with one another even with the couples that were established in the other two books ( Kate 's Crew and Morgan 's Surprise ) like some big happy family . I dont know but that just felt really gross to me . If you are reading this book just for the jollies I say enjoy but if you like your romance a little kinky but still with love buy another book and dont waste your money on this one .	-1
The description was totally misleading and the supposed storyline is non existent . If you like crude sex you will like this one	-1
Did not like any of the books I purchased by this author . Did not finish the ones I started and did not read the rest .	-1
After reading Thaw first I was disappointed in this story . It was too rushed . The story line is captivating and as usual the authors talent is on display . But , had this story been expanded it would have been a much better tale .	-1
I 'm not a prude . I do sometimes read/enjoy erotica but as the mother of two grown sons , I found this just pushed all my `` ewwwwww '' buttons for some reason.It is about a highschool aged male and it reads like it was written by someone who is probably pretty young as well.I shared this story with my best friend and we both found it to be the sort of situations that a young male would fantasize about and not something either one of us found at all erotic . It lacks any sort of sophistication to me . It 's about a young man who is given an amulet that lets him be invisible while wearing it . There are scenes where he spies on a young woman his age in her room - he gets to watch her masturbate - another scene where he decides to go into a girl 's locker room at his high school and spy on those girls as well and gets to see two of the girls engage in lesbian activity.I do n't mean to be unkind . The actual writing itself - word usage , grammer , punctuation - was all fine . I also thought the premise of an amulet that lets the wearer be invisible to be unique . As an adult female , I just did n't find reading about teen-age sexual situations to be my cup of tea .	-1
The whole thing was confusing due to lack of character development and dialogue that was not consistent . Good thing it was short and free .	-1
The book is set in a quaint little lake community where few stay year-round and lots visit for summer vacations . The two characters central to the story , though , are Jess and Mamie . Early on , we learn that Mamie has passed away and left her estate to her grand daughter Jess . Jess and her boyfriend Russ travel to the property to tie up loose ends and sell it . When she returns , though , Jess is forced to revisit memories of her summers with Mamie at the cottage and start to question her family history.I had high hopes for this book . I loved the setting ; it almost made me think of the movie Dirty Dancing . I love a good coming-of-age story . I like stories with multiple narrators . And this book has all of that . But unfortunately , it was n't enough to save it.The story felt rushed . There were too many twists and turns in the plot for the author to fully develop on any of them in 202 pages . As a result , I felt no connection to any of the characters -- including Jess , who was confronted by some life-changing events while cleaning out Mamie 's home . The dialogue was n't realistic , the story as a whole lacked emotion , and the epilogue left too many unanswered questions . Honestly , I think there was enough content to warrant a series ( or at least a sequel ) so that readers would have the chance to really care about this family and the lake community.The narration was atrocious . Some chapters were told from Mamie 's point of view . Other chapters were written in the third person point of view ABOUT Jess -- both as a 17-year-old and as a 34-year-old . Generally I 'm a fan of this method because I think it makes for a well-rounded and complete telling of a story . But in this case , it was all wrong . I think I would 've felt more of a connection to Jess if her chapters were told in her voice . And having Mamie ( the dead woman ) speak directly to readers struck me as really awkward ; her chapters should 've been told in the third person.The only other negative thing I can say ( without giving any spoilers ) is that I had an extremely hard time wrapping my head around the various relationships in this book . I probably could 've if I 'd cared enough to actually think it through but with no emotional connection , I really did n't care . I just wanted the story to end.On the up side , ( most of ) the typos mentioned in many of the other reviews must have been corrected from the earlier editions because I only caught a few errors here and there . Annoying , yes . But certainly nothing that will detract readers too much from the story . So if its editing is the only drawback from the negative reviews that 's preventing you from hitting the & # 34 ; buy now & # 34 ; button for this book , then by all means ...	-1
I would n't call these books - more like & # 34 ; teasers. & # 34 ; Can read this in one afternoon . Too pricey for my budget !	-1
I liked the way this book was set up as a diary . It 's not the first book to use this format , but it uses it well and allows an intimacy with the characters you do n't normally get with other formats . I liked the slow reveal of Dakota 's past and the imagery used was rather poignant in many instances . I was confused at several points about Dakota 's age , after first thinking he was a minor , then later it was revealed he was closer to 19/20 , then later it 's stated that he 's 18 . The ending felt rushed , like the author needed to wrap this up and ran out of ideas . I thought a couple of pretty major plot points were not handled well , such as why the police were n't called or why any doctor , even just psychologist , would take a clearly severely injured person home instead of straight to the hospital . No , John waits until the following day to take Dakota to the hospital . The part that really annoyed me at the end and made me dislike John , Dakota 's & # 34 ; savior & # 34 ; , was the reveal that John had transcribed Dakota 's diary and given it to a publisher without Dakota 's knowledge or consent , and Dakota 's just okay with that ? Like I said , rushed ending . Overall , I liked it okay but the ending and the plot holes did n't make much sense . 2.5 stars .	-1
I have read most of the 'witness ' thriller/mysteries by Rebecca Forstner and found them great . This is the genre I think she excels in and if Golden Threads is typical of her expertise in Contemporary Romance , I think she should stick with the thrillers . Threads was rather sophomoric , dialogue contrived and dramatic , and there were endless descriptions of details . The main character was self- centered with no insight into her selfishness and I was really bored by the repetitions of her extraordinary beauty -- the cliche heroine who has no idea how beautiful she is , of course . The worst part for me was : readers are given to believe a really kind and giving person is transformed so drastically into a totally self absorbed and uncaring opposite -- by success -- and in a single event changes her back again . That seldom happens in real life . It 's like a moment-of-truth movie , book form ; and sappy .	-1
Sorry to say this was insipid . The story is supposedly about 2 extremely intelligent & dominant men finding their mate . From the way their characters are written they are lucky they can find their hind ends even if supplied with explicit instructions and a map . the heroine is no better . i had to force myself to finish reading it . do n't waste your $ .	-1
The kids were board to tears with this book . I do not recommend it at all . The illustrations were not very well done either .	-1
I was excited to open the book , very nice cover and picture . I enjoyed the introduction , but it was about putting stress in your life . But then I got lost in the book . I did not learn much , and the book was long . I gave it two star because possibly someone may benefit from the book .	-1
This book was one I would n't buy as the patterns were so off beat & would never , ever waste my time on . Ca n't imagine paying for it & even deleted it from my Kindle	-1
If I could give it negative stars I could . This is nothing more & # 34 ; pages & # 34 ; of copy/paste off of websites that was put together so poorly it looks like something upchucked into power point . I doubt the & # 34 ; author & # 34 ; has even held a knitting needle let alone tried to use them !	-1
Definitely for men.or teenage boys.. I think most of the projects are for a younger set ... I bought this thinking I could find something to make for some of the men in my family , however , as stated these patterns are for a much younger set . The skulltouke is cretty cool , however .	-1
Another odd book . I ended up deleting it . I was really glad this book was free as I could n't really get anything out of it .	-1
This was the first selection on my Kindle that I have not enjoyed to some degree . I rarely do not finish what I start but this is one book that I could not bring myself to finish .	-1
A okay short story . I guess what goes around comes around . That lady was crazy she got her revenge . DeGere must have did a good job making love to her because she wanted him dead . Overall a ok read !	-1
I did not like this book . I did not understand this book . Did not seem to know if it wanted to be a mystery or a romance . Turned out it was neither for me .	-1
Stories are too short and the characters have no dimension at all . I guess if you 're looking for just sex it could be worth the buy but even that leaves a little to be desired .	-1
I could n't finish this `` book . '' From reading the other reviews , I assume there is a market for ten-minute reads . Personally , I prefer to be acquainted with the characters before they are naked . These stories move so fast that they lose all credibility . One woman flys cross country and before you can spell `` bathe '' another woman is sucking her toes . Really ? Another about oral sex in a moving car consists of `` I do n't want to . '' `` Oh , he 's hard . '' `` Unzip . '' `` Finish . '' `` Zip . '' The End.The narratives are hastily constructed in the Subect-Verb-Object format . I awarded two stars only because the grammar and spelling , while not perfect , are technically far superior to much of the Kindle product .	-1
Boring sex scenes and a very poor editing job ( should I say NO editing job ) . Repetitive sex scenes that I did more skipping past than actually reading .	-1
I did not realize when I started reading this that it was by the same author of a book I just wrote a scathing review of earlier today . Had I known , I might not have bothered with this one.The story starts out being told from one point of view , then changes to another point of view , which is fine when it is done in a way that is not too confusing . So far it has n't been . Story is essentially about a group of 4 friends from college - two women and two men - who still live & work in close proximity to each other and are the best of friends . From what I can gather , this is all told from the POV of the two women ( so far anyway ) .I already had the feeling that the story line would be ridiculously juvenile but I pressed on anyway . There came a point in the story where one of the young women finds her boyfriend cheating on her and asks her 3 close friends to take her out to get drunk . This seems plausible and it 's best , if you plan to nurse your heartbreak that way , to have close friends with you . Or so I always thought . Not so with this author 's story , nope . Drunk-off-her face girl is taken home by her friends , and one of the male friends decides to stay with her and help her in her sickness . The girl is seriously fall-down , puke-your-intestines-out smashed , so she needs a friend right then . Apparently instead of really nursing the poor girl in her time of need , the guy decides to have sex with her when she repeatedly throws herself at him . He knows she is completely off her head drunk , has just suffered a heartbreak and so is emotionally unstable and like the 'good friend ' he is , he goes ahead and takes advantage of that . The next morning , when she wakes up with him naked in bed and confronts him , his response is basically a & # 34 ; you always knew I wanted more than friendship from you , blah blah ... you know how I have always felt about you , blah , blah ... and I asked you repeatedly if you were sure , blah blah. & # 34 ; No remorse , no apologies for taking advantage of such a good friend while she was in a horrible state , nothing.At this point I closed the book and deleted it from my kindle . In the other book I read by this author , she has one woman working her way sexually through all her close male friends until she settles for the one that makes zero sense for her to be with , and then in this one we have this giant , date-rapey , hot mess . If this is what the author thinks is a good story , I want no part of it .	-1
This book had some good ingredients : a military leading man , a loving mom in the leading lady role , and a psychopath out to wreak havoc . Unfortunately there was n't enough backstory development to make me like any of these characters very much , or help me sympathize with any of their feelings for each other.Sorry , but this one needed some work .	-1
I 'm cheap . Now that , that 's out of the way , I 'm always willing to pay good money for a good author but I like to buy new authors for less to try and get me hooked . THIS DID NOT DO IT . It was ssssssssoooooo unbelievably short . It was too short for me to even get into it and then it ends . It was a : here is Jane , here is Tom and here is the end of the book . I mean , REALLY ! ? Give me a break ! ! ! ! ! ! I 'm just glad I got it on sale and did n't pay $ 2.99 . That would have been a refund . I even got `` Casey 's Night In ( The Mirage Agency # 1.5 ) '' and that was even more ridiculous . There 's a teaser and then there 's garbage . This would be closer on the scale to garbage . I bought it on my iphone but now I 'm getting into buying books on the actual web where it lists the number of pages .	-1
The premise of this book was not bad . Two vacationing young men who anger a powerful person while on vacation are set up to be accused of drug smuggling . They are arrested and then there is a lot of sexual intimidation exerted on both of them to & # 34 ; put out & # 34 ; . They are more or less raped in several different ways by one or two men . The author could have made the story lighter and more enjoyable , but he chose not to . I am sorry about that . Anyway , I did n't enjoy it and regret buying it .	-1
Junk ... I gave my teen aged son access to my Kindle account to read shared books and he ordered this without the understanding that it would automatically download onto my kindle app device as well ... goodness ! I urge parents to take caution about sharing kindle accounts with your kids .	-1
And that 's NOT a compliment.2.5 RATINGThis was way too short to really grasp some real umph from . The sex scenes were mediocre at best . I actually enjoyed the poking and prodding more than the sex . Due to complete lack of emotion it was hard to get into . I 'm not saying I want to read about complete strangers making love , but could n't there be some passion involved . Something other than , `` Oh yea baby . '' and `` You 're so hot . '' There was n't even a description of characters in the story , not even of hanging appendages , if you catch my drift . I understand you want to leave it up to the imagination of readers but , I 'm reading an erotica . If I wanted to leave it all up to the imagination I would just listen to a recording of moans and grunts . It 's the same difference , no faces or bodies to visualize . Just words to read or voices to decipher.The only reason this story is even hanging on to a 2.5 star rating from me is because the writing was good , the story was free , and it took about 10 minutes to read . So I did n't waste time nor money reading this.Advice to Author : Help us out with some description . Describing someone as `` ... he was n't a slouch either . '' Does n't help . Hair color , eye color , appendage comparison considering it was more than one guy , height , complexion , I do n't know ... SOMETHING ! ! I was description starved throughout this book .	-1
I am fairly tolerant when it comes editing . An occasional misspelled , wrong word or bad grammar does disturb my reading experience . However confusing characters is inexcusable . I only read 1-2 chapters and gave up .	-1
This is a short story about a woman who agrees to host a young Special Olympian for the weekend . Only a small part of the story is about her interactions with the Olympian , most of the story is dedicated to the woman 's self-pity and dread of the upcoming visit . Her pity is laid on pretty thick ( most of her internal monologues are like & # 34 ; Why me ? Why I am in this wheelchair ? & # 34 ; ) and I found myself struggling to get through it.However , for those looking for a sweet ending ( albeit , one that feels a bit tacked on given how unpleasant the main character is ) may enjoy .	-1
This book turned out not to be much of a book . It was more like a biographical except from the writer 's experience in Kandahar . Not what I wanted to read .	-1
I have to say I was disappointed with this book , even more disappointed that I paid more than .99 cents !	-1
I tried to read this it sounded good . But I do n't know once I started I found myself skipping parts and being bored .	-1
I did n't find any of these funny , but that might just be my odd sense of humor . This book is n't for me .	-1
This book is NOT funny . Most of this stuff does n't even make sense . Even free , it is still too expensive . I could n't even finish it . I deleted it after 5 pages in . I do NOT recommend getting this book !	-1
I ca n't say I loved it , but I did not hate it ... it mostly bugged me ... the romance with Serena , Marc and Tony was good , and pretty hot ... although the initial lies they told were pretty dumb and as usual come back to bite them in the ass ... What I had a hard time with was when so many people in town felt Serena deserved what happened to her , even the sheriff and while it was mostly a small part in the beginning ... it just really bugged me ... that aside for me the book was just `` meh '' not bad , not great .	-1
I have read thousands of true crime books , and this was definitely not one of the better ones . Too short , and not near enough details	-1
The author 's opinion is all over this book and it 's actually offensive at times . He presents his negative opinions about LAPD as fact instead of simply focusing on the real facts and evidence in this case . There was certainly enough evidence to convict Lazarus of this crime but the negative comments were distasteful and unnecessary .	-1
Short story about that was mostly about the nosy neighbor in a small quiet community who has seen a were panther . Not really worth the effort to read and the twist is expected in the end . This was more like a teaser than what I would call a book . Happy reading !	-1
I liked the story but I thought it was a little long . I think it could have been shortened up a little .	-1
Save your money and buy some other book ... ..The book was very disappointing . I stopped reading it mid-way and would n't finish it .	-1
This book was n't anything that I expected . Its only about what is the aurther thinksNot rrally ghost storys . But if you like that shorta thing then u will like this book .	-1
This book brings everything i did not like about the previous books and magnifies them.Stupid dialogue , unrealistic responses and actions . Dues ex machina up the @ # %	-1
I am not sure what I am more upset about . The time I lost reading this gosh awful book or that it was labeled as suspense with some good reviews . In retrospect ... I was left in suspense wondering when the characters would develop depth . There is nobody to cheer on in this book . The heroine is dopey . How are we to care about her if She lacks any normal wits about herself ? The other characters are poorly rendered and one dimensional . So I have no one to root for and a plot that limps along towards a tortuous end . In the end , I got the most pleasure possible out of it by deleting from my reader . I LOVE IT NOT .	-1
This book is juvenile at best . As much as it might pain people to know , I am actually okay with books written simply . However this is not the type of book or format even for the writing to be okay with . I like simple and relaxing . Not like I am readng something written by a 13 year old . The only thing that seemed to depict the characters maturity was the colege clas scheduling and I guess the living on my own thing , though I cant agree with that because many people , atleast that I hung out with , from hs lived on their own . The sporadicness of the characters plus the unuestioning atmosphere was not believable . The acftions seemed reckless and carefree despite how originally the character was supposed to be anal and studious . I can get that people change because of their relationships but not their entire personalities in that short amount of time . I did not have sympathy for the main character . I just couldnt . We were not were given anything to hold on to . Yeah her life has been tragic so far but ... ..weres the emotional connection , the feelings ? I 'm sad or he 's being men is just not going to cut it for me . If anything I feel anger and annoyance . My needs consist of real people . Not just charcters .	-1
I had a very hard time getting into this book . I felt the writing style was extremely poor . Most sentences were along the lines of , `` I ate dinner and then went to bed . I went to class and then I did my homework . '' The only reason I kept reading it was because I always finish books that I start , and most of the reviews I read for this book were good . It did get better , I only had to read about 70 % of the book first . The ending almost made me want to pick up the next book . But there is no way I would pay $ 3.99 for the next book , especially when I got this book for free . The overall story was terrible . I know I definitely wont be finishing this series .	-1
I wish I had saved my money the writing was sophomoric the characters unbelievable , the story was improbable . But probably if I were 13 _ 15 it would be a good cautionary tale . Too few happily_ever_After books .	-1
Lily has got to be the dumbest heroine ever . She makes so many stupid decisions , talks herself out of the proper course of action many times , completely ignores her own instincts and concerns , and repeatedly brings herself back to her husband 's sphere of influence . Honestly , how many times do you need to be hit with a brick over the head to realize it hurts ? Could there have been any more clues about his `` work '' activities , or how unbalanced he was ? Lord , that woman was dumb . However , the author had me engaged enough to actually shout at the story a few times , saying , `` HOW STUPID CAN YOU BE ? '' That was why I gave two stars instead of one . Oh , another thing that irritated me was everyone was so immature . It was like reading about high school students , not college students , poised on real life . So , I can definitively say I hated the characters and the story , which is too bad , because I think the author might be able to write . I just did n't like this offering , and I do n't care enough about the stupidity of Lily to see what other dumb stuff she does by shelling out $ 4 for the second book . I 'm glad this was free .	-1
The story line did not go as I assumed it would from the story description . The subject matter that eventually revealed itself is not something that I can read a lot of , although I did force myself to finish the book . I would not read the next one in the series .	-1
not very funny , lots of repeats my 10 yr old liked it tho unfortunatly i expected a little more from it	-1
This book had some good review , so I got it . Problem is , it 's so long winded I just could n't get into it . If a book does n't grab my immediate attention , I find it hard to get through . Nothing against the author . This just is n't my cup of tea . It was a very slow moving first 25 % of the book , I was unable to force myself to finish it . I may go back and try to reread it some other time , but for now , I just ca n't get through it .	-1
I am a big fan of Andrew Grey 's novels , and this was the first one that I did not really like . It had an interesting idea for the plot , but I did not feel it was developed to the fullest potential . I thought the book was over before it began , and I wish there had been more detail , and that I could have come to know Darren and George better .	-1
I really liked the color . When I tried to put my kindle into the sleeve , I could not zip it up . It was almost an inch to short . I then put my kindle into the fire sleeve and returned the regular kindle sleeve . Now my fire only has a small thin cover .	-1
I HATE WHEN YOU ARE NOT TOLD THIS IS ONLY AN EXERPT . I PROBABLY WOULD HATE THE BOOK ANYWAY AS I WAS READY TO GIVE UP ON IT AND THEN OF COURSE IT JUST ENDED .	-1
This book was just below average . The characters did n't make sense to me , and the story was n't that interesting . Some authors can portray a full story in less than two hundred pages , but this one did n't work for me .	-1
I liked the first few pages of this , then I kept running into the kind of grammatical and spelling errors I would find in a fanfiction by an inexperienced writer . The one that was the last straw : gravelling instead groveling.The story has almost direct quotes from Twilight by Stephenie Meyer : `` You do n't know how long I 've waited for you . '' Ugh.It 's another story where the narrator speaks to all this time that 's passed but in reality it 's been less than a week or two . Things that should be dealt with in detail are glossed over . The other reviews speak to how it 's a great story etc , but I just do n't see it . Maybe it 'll get better , but there are so many other books to be read out there that are good that I ca n't spend the time hoping this one will get better .	-1
I could n't make it through all of this book because it just reminded me too much of Twilight . There are differences between the two books of course , but I just could n't get into it .	-1
The copious amounts of reviews that state that this book is a copy of Twilight are 100 % correct . Get away ! Get away quickly ! In some respects it is better ( no Bella ) , and others it is worse . The rubbish that spewed forth out of William 's mouth had me vomiting a little in my mouth . The similar , yet slightly more idiotic drivel that came out of Bryn 's mouth had me rolling my eyes so much at her idiocy I swear the people around me as I was reading thought I was going to have an epileptic fit.The insanely short time ( a couple of days ) that passed between meeting and professing undying and eternal love was whirlwind , full of annoying fights , unrealistic reactions and surprise , surprise everyone fawning over our damsel in distress.Now , there were actually some interesting differences between Eternal Eden and Twilight . I actually quite liked the potential intricacies of the opposing clans/committees/governments . The potential to delve in there and actually give this story a backbone however , was sadly missed.The writing was juvenile at best and the manuscript was rife with typos , grammatical and spelling errors . This is book 1 of a trilogy that I will not be continuing with .	-1
There is n't anything particularly wrong with this book , it just is n't my cup of tea . I could n't get into in even though it is a short story . I guess I was expecting something different , but did n't feel misled . Someone else might really enjoy this book . That is the risk you sometimes take buying a book online . I am one of those readers who really prefers to hold a book in my hand , so still getting used to ebooks and how find ones I like .	-1
Enjoyed the story and was interested up to the time were the trial started . I realize this is a legal thriller , but the court dialogue was incredibly long and boring . Could n't stay with the book !	-1
This book had missing pages this only made me mad . I not sure what happened BIT it was unsatisfactory nevertheless .	-1
I read this to my child he had no idea what a moor was and a few other words ... the book rambled and rambled not very good .	-1
Thought this would be a good bed time story to read to my 2 year old . But the pages are long and the pictures are small and not that good . He lost interest and I got tired of read it . Might be better for older children	-1
The book was a little fun but they were talking about the ugly duckLing and how the others was pretty	-1
I am a big fan of Kathryn Shay , but this book seemed lacking in both substance and character development . It was tough to care about either of the two main characters as they did n't seem to grow and evolve . At times the hero was completely unlikable and the heroine seemed both shallow and thoughtless . Not what I expect from a book by this author .	-1
Lucien is a drunkard , having gotten that way because when he was a very young man his older lover ridiculed him for his `` love '' composition . After living a charmed life as a prodigy in Russia and Europe ? Eight years later , he lives life on the edge with hatred for his father because his father does n't approve of him composing music and frittering away his life ? Grow up already ! Madaline 's mother is a first rate tramp . Whores around and then arranges a marriage for her daugther `` but no one 's supposed to know that she 's my child '' with a sweet , local marquis . That poor guy was so kind and sweet , going so far as to forgive Madaline when he CATCHES her in bed with Lucien . He just loves her so much , he is still willing to marry her . Ack ! Juliette was given to screwing ( literally ) where she might be caught . Madaline and Lucien have caught her mother more than once . In an effort to keep Lucien away from Madaline , mom sets out to seduce him . Why invite him you ask to their home in the country ? Because mom 's real lover is Lucien 's best friend . Everything about the night of the hail storm had me grinding my teeth . That had to have been one of the dumbest scenes I 've read in a long time.There were moments in this story had me interested . They were few and far between though . Not saying the writing was bad , the story did n't measure up in any kind of way ( for me ) to the many 5 star ratings .	-1
A big thumbs-down to Smithsonian Magazine 's decision to automatically remove the previous month 's edition as soon as the new one arrives on your Kindle . If I do n't manage to get the current edition read on time , they take away the product that I paid for . Bad marketing decision and I 'll be cancelling my subscription because of this . I 'd consider buying the magazine hard-copy edition , but the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth . National Geographic is more deserving of my money and I do n't feel cheated by them .	-1
I applaud the author for taking the time and effort to write a novel - not an easy task . However , this book falls far short of interesting or well-written . There is just far too much useless verbiage that has absolutely nothing to do with the plot - page after boring page of description and character conversations with no apparent purpose , other than to fill pages . The plot is quite shallow , and it does n't move along rapidly at all . I finally gave up about half-way thru and skipped to the last chapter or so to see how it came out . The ending makes sense , but is highly predictable .	-1
how many words do you need to say that this writer is not good ? I have tried to read this and other stories , thinking that surely one must be good . Wrong . People ... .do not waste your time or worse , money . I will not ever be reading Mr Cantrell 's work ever again . I have deleted the books I ordered . Mind you , I will say that everyone will have and are entitled to their own opinion . I 'll let you all decide for yourselves . If there was a star for bad books , this author would get it .	-1
I 'm not giving this story 2 stars because of anything the author did or did n't do per se . Unfortunately I just could n't get into this . I found the premise to be very new and different which is wonderful for a genre that 's been bombarded like this one has , but this just did n't work for me . Part of the reason I love zombie stories so much is the gore and utter hopelessness of a dystopian and dying world but with this kind of story it kinda takes all of that out of it . The zombies in this story are actually the living and breathing people and its the actual zombies that are considered to be human and normal so they hunt down those that are still living and seeing because they are the scary monster zombies . Not the ACTUAL zombies , who act totally normal ( this kind of defeats the reason why I love this genre in the first place ) . This was a prequel to a longer novel titled & # 34 ; The Dishonored Dead & # 34 ; and unfortunately this short story just showed me that it would n't be a book I would appreciate as much as others might . I 'm sure there are some great philosophical and psychologically interesting points in the book itself but that 's not really what I was looking for in this .	-1
My impression was the author tried to support his thesis by writing a fictional story . It did not work for me and I gave up early in the story .	-1
This book was interesting and well written with some likeable characters ; however , the murder does involve a sexual assault with perverse , brutally descriptive detail . Add some 4 letter words and one scene of incest and you have a read that will not be to everyone 's liking .	-1
Started reading the book , but found it to be trying and predictable , so did n't bother putting anymore time into reading it .	-1
Read 10 % the night before , and another 14 % the evening after and found I was still watchin ' the bobber waiting for something thrilling to hit . I was approaching the point where I was going to throw my rod in the water , so I started reading thru other reviews only to realize with disappointment that many ( if not most ) of the readers found the first part of the book the best part , whereas many others found the action sequence from 30 % on rather implausible . Huh ? On personal reflection , I 've got ta say that the characters and plot just are n't bitin ' , and with so many other fishin ' holes to explore I 'm just going to have to catch & release this little guy and hopefully find myself a bigger fish down the ways . Good luck to those that care to continue , but I think this one has been plain fished out ...	-1
This could have been the subtitle for this book . I like Brett Battles , enjoy the Jonathon Quinn series a lot . In this book he starts out with strong character development and an immediately likable Logan Harper . He reintroduces and old friend in this book which was a nice surprise . Harper identifies the bad guys and literally the next three quarters of the book ( on a kindle from about 30 % into the book until about 83 % into the book ) is a series of chases . Literally by plane , truck , boat , train and car . Literally . By then I did n't even care if they caught them . Unreal . Very frustrating . It dragged the story line to a complete halt for me . When it finally ended ? Not worth the wait .	-1
I am a voracious reader , and it took me days to get through this one . It is horrid . I applaud the author for her ideas , however . Perhaps the worst is that Darcy called Elizabeth & # 34 ; Eliza & # 34 ; . Anyone who has read P & P knows that she abhors that sobriquet . Her husband would never , ever , not in the P & P world , ever call her & # 34 ; Eliza. & # 34 ; Ever ! And someone other than Lydia exclaiming & # 34 ; La ! & # 34 ; Ugh ... .Lastly , an adopted son would not inherit in Regency England . No . I usually do n't leave comments , but this really was too much to let go .	-1
Very slow read . Lost interest many times . Characters are ok but story line just is n't my style . Liked the cousin better than the main character .	-1
This story is pretty tame . I did'nt really understand the attraction between the h/H . She 's a librarian & he 's a writer in residence at the college . The premise is great but the delivery lacked something . The love scenes are pretty low on the steam scale & of course there was the obligatory club scene .	-1
Sketchy story line with only moderately interesting characters . I did n't like it enough to finish it . Minimally offensive in some areas .	-1
She 's funny yes , but I ca n't forget the job she 's doing and I do n't find it hilarious.The author is rather good . although I do n't even the romantic scenes very well written .	-1
The writing is very simplistic ... dumbed down . Story line not credible . Too much to believe for `` young '' inexperinced heros . maybe targeting a young adult audience ? If This was intended for that I missed the categorization . Best I can say is that I did finish it .	-1
Easily the worst of the three Rick Brandt Science Series books I 've read so far.So far from believable for today , but taken when these were written , and who they were written for , maybe its a good book and I 'm too old and jaded.There was no description other than the generic `` its been formated blah blah '' so I had no idea what it was about.Like other books in this series , this book reminds me of a cross between Scooby Doo and Johnny Quest etc . I call these young person mysteries.The basic story is that someone is sabotaging some uber-secret rocket launches ( this written before any of the actual rockets into space ) so our heroes go undercover and the secret base where security is so lax that they actually get jobs there.Our heroes save the day ... ... ..******Spoiler Alert**************Spoiler Alert**************Spoiler Alert********but not before one of them is shot into space , lives by sending code back to earth using a monkey 's stethoscope so they can land him . All without a suit and living through a force of 12 g 's . ******End Spoiler alert**************End Spoiler alert**************End Spoiler alert********There 's a whole series of these books starring the young people ( Rick Brandt & Scotty and assorted others ) I 'll hopefully reading and reviewing them all under the heading `` Rick Brandt Science Series '' .Clean book , safe for kids , enjoyable for adults as long as your not expecting a huge adult themed book or complicated murders .	-1
After seeing this app I thought I would use it frequently . Unfortunately it just did n't have the information I needed . I 'm sure others will be happy with it .	-1
Good bedtime book , but the plot is a little thin , and the characters are not quite as well defined as they could have been .	-1
I do n't know any thing about this , bet the boyfriend got this too and also probably has not read this one because impulse .	-1
I deleted it from my Kindle so long ago , I do n't even remember whether I liked it or not . I 'm assuming I did n't since I deleted it , but I do n't know .	-1
A nice story . But seems disjointed and rambling at times . The plot is thin and easily guessed . In my opinion this is not one of Max Brands better works .	-1
SORRY I DID NOT ENJOY THE STORIES I WAS THINKING THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SHORT ONES . BUT THEY WERE TO LONG . SO I DID NOT EVEN FINISH THE FIRST STORY . BUT YOU MAY VERY WELL ENJOY IT . I JUST LIKE SHORT AND LIGHT READING .	-1
The previous reviews did n't give me the idea of how painfully slow this book was to read . ( maybe I did n't pay attention enough to their detail ! ) The language of the convent added to the atmosphere as did the daily habits of the nuns . Rather than a book that you could n't put down , this was one I hated to pick up and read . There were , however , some good moments and entertaining characters .	-1
I was going to read this book to my little sister but the bible verses are not in order ! You may like it but I do n't egzactley .	-1
I was not pleased with the book . Since I was looking for something to share with children from 18 months to 3 years old , and this was not it . Thank goodness I did n't pay anything for it .	-1
This kindle stuff does not lighjt my fire in any way shape or form . I do not like it , I do not like it .	-1
I did not finish this book as did not like the story line . This book is not to my taste .	-1
I started this book in late March . In the meantime , I 've read about 8-9 other books with my last reading of this one on April 1 . I 'm less than 1/4 through the book and I doubt I will finish in the near future . Some people may like the story line , but I feel it drags and is laborious to read .	-1
WRITTEN BY PARLEY P PRATT ! ! ! ! You have soooooo got to read The Story of the Mormons , from the date of their origin to the year 1901 . Link : The Story of the Mormons , from the date of their origin to the year 1901It is written by a propionate lawyer and historian . I love that he approaches this extremely detailed book as a very well referenced history and not opinion based book . For this book , ah , I do n't think so.. read the history and please with an open mind . Quite amazing ! ! Free book . Once you have read that one you will get that this one is as 'factual ' as it might appear . Just going on history .	-1
Kindle edition of this book does not have any images . I was confused that other reviewers mentioned seeing images . My edition of the book did not have any . Some instructional books can overcome this by extremely detailed explanations , which paint a good picture without images . This is not the case with this book.The new Guide to Knitting and Crochet starts with no introduction . The book immediately jumps into `` Siberian cuffs '' . It gives one paragraphs of instructions which are detailed enough to complete the project . However , since there is no introduction , general description or images you are not exactly sure what you will be getting as a final project.Most of the book continue in this vain : the instructions are about 1 paragraph long , only a few projects have titles that are descriptive such as `` A Very elegant bag in French blue silk '' . But this title is as much of the introduction or general idea of what the project is about is that you get . So I did not find it to be a good reference , as typically I have an idea in mind and want to find an explanation of the technique to help me accomplish my goal . This is not possible with this book.Ali Julia Review	-1
Poorly organized , misleading title , no pictures to show reference or completed projects . Do n't waste your time or money with this . Terrible .	-1
I do n't knit so I ca n't say how good the content is and clear the directions are . But I do crochet . There is no way I would make anything from this as there are no photos to show me what the finished product would look like . Maybe if you were experienced more than I am you could picture it , but I wo n't read through each and every set of directions trying to picture a product I might like to make . Not worth buying in my opinion .	-1
I guess I 'm getting tired of reading gory accounts of serial killers who mangle their victims in one way or another.Shiverplumbs the depths in this area.Adding insult to injury , the female heroine has a completely incredible way of beating the odds . The author swiftly transforms her from a meek copy writer into a female commando . Good thing , too , or she 'd be a dead heroine .	-1
The protagonist is a compulsive liar both to her prospective love interest and her best friend . The pacing is incredibly slow and convoluted ... not worth buying .	-1
This book was stupid . The two main characters knew each other in high school . Fifteen years later , they meet again when he is a gynecologist in her doctor 's office . Even though they were supposedly crazy about each other way back then , he does n't even recognize her . She devises a plan to have her revenge on him because of a supposed bet he had with his friends back in high school regarding her big boobs . When he finally realizes who she is , he devises his own plan for revenge . Both of their plans were stupid . I never really understood the bet he supposedly had . Also , for someone who always hated her big breasts , she sure did seem to throw them out there a lot . I really got tired of hearing about her big boobs . The ending just seems to happen with no climax . This book was just stupid .	-1
I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for a review . `` Lightning of Her Own '' by Levi Montgomery is a YA sci -- fi book , which I usually like , but I just did not like this book . I see all the good reviews for this book , however , I just could n't get into it , and after skipping pages and trying to finish the book , I just gave up . The book is slow slow slow . I became extremely bored and just never got invested in the characters . How any one can be as nave and clueless as Amarylla after a change within the world just does n't seem believable . I was relieved when she started to change and learn to survive and stop relying on everyone else . However , the relationship building ( the part I read before I stopped reading the book ) between Amarylla and Marlowe just did n't seem believable and totally unnecessary to the storyline . Too many other books to read for me to continue with one that I could n't get invested in .	-1
Mercy is written from the point of view of Georgina : a wife writing in her journal to her husband about her mission trip to Ethiopia . Instead , it turns into a first hand account of a zombie uprising.The note from her husband is a nice touch at the very beginning of the book ( imploring her to actually write in it ) , but I needed more of her thought process and emotional reaction throughout the entire book . There was a lot of narrating events or what other people had told her . I wanted the main character to freak out a whole lot more , it 's a zombie apocalypse ! At least in her journal ; people pour their souls into their journals.The main reason I struggled with this book was the timeline . The first fifty pages especially needed a more linear layout . I felt like I knew a whole lot about several characters , and then all of a sudden they would wash up on the beach and I would meet them for the first time . I felt like the main character was rambling , perhaps because she 's scared , forgets what happened , but it made it feel very disjointed . The flashbacks needed to be more clearly identified . I get that at the beginning of most chapters she 's flashing back , but then the tense would switch and leave me confused . I honestly read the first fifty pages multiple times due to timeline confusion , and I never recovered from it to enjoy the rest of the novel . Ultimately , this is why I gave it a 2.There are also a few other clarity issues . Some things happened on the island without the protagonist being there , and she still wrote about them . There 's no real reason why the other characters would tell her some of the stuff she wrote about , especially about things they thought about saying but then decided not to say.The author does make some good comparisons and real world observations . Georgina became more relatable when she talked about her daughter and her adoption from Ethiopia and I liked the themes of motherhood , even in the face of a zombie apocalypse , that it explored.The author brought about some important theological discussions halfway through the book , and focused more on the characters humanity and why bad things happen . I liked this , but I never quite recovered from reading the beginning of the book.I enjoyed the overall concept of what the author tried to do , but maybe it would have worked better ( at least for me ) if it was not written in journal form . Or if it was journal form , to be a lot more linear from beginning to end , or with clearly defined flashbacks.I really did like the adoption angle and role of the main character 's daughter Mercy . The last few pages tied it all together nicely in the end . There is something here , it just needed to be tightened up more.Review by : Erica of Sift Book ReviewsSift Book Reviews received a free copy for review from the author . This has , in no way , affected the reviewer 's opinion .	-1
Do not bother with this book ... unless you have never ever made a dip in your life . Even then , read the back of food packaging , you 'd find better recipes.If there was a ZERO stars rating , I 'd give it to this book.I was looking for interesting , different , or just plain good . Everything in this back is old or contains enough pepper to poison people.Go buy some Knorr veggie soup mix , or Cuginos dip mixes and you 'll end up with much better products than what 's in this book .	-1
... because I would have been pretty pissed if I had paid for this . Of the recipes in the `` cookbook '' only a few have any true relevance to the books . I mean `` ice cream sundaes '' ? ? ? Really ? ? Also , a great number are for various kinds of homemade ice cream . No different to what came in the packaging with your ice cream maker.I am guessing the hope was to entice people with a little sample . For me it did quite the opposite . I will be steering quite clear of the full sized version . There was very little creativity in what could have been a cute and cool little cookbook for Harry Potter themed parties . If I want a recipe for ice cream or a hamburger , I certainly would not be looking for one in a Harry Potter themed cookbook just because he ate one once ... .somewhere in one o the books.What a disappointment.EDIT : Additionally , I want to point out that originally this review was set with the other reviews from the Kindle sampler . Now they are lumped in with the full cookbook . The full cookbook may be much better and I really do n't think Amazon should have the reviews for both put together . My version had 10 recipes . Butterscotch Brew , Butterscotch Brew Ice Cream Soda , Butterscotch Brew Slushies , Double Chocolate Ice Cream Cones , Paddington Burgers , Triple Power Icy Lemon Pops , Chocolate and Raspberry Ice Cream Cones with Chopped Nuts , Pumpkin Juice , Strawberry and Peanut Butter Ice Cream Cones , and Ice Cream Sundaes . 5/10 recipes for ice cream , 1 for a hamburger , and 3 involving `` Butterscotch Brew '' . Any question why the people who got the sampler are n't happy ?	-1
This novel , if you can call it that was not what was expected . Having read some of his other work , I purchased this with high hopes . No such luck .	-1
I 've read other John Simpson books before and this one does n't compare to his other work . This story read like a script from a porn movie . I did n't believe any of the characters actions and the dialogue was so campy it left me rolling my eyes more than once . Sadly , this one did n't appeal to me in the least .	-1
I had read Angel Michelle book Envy , and it was one of the best urban gridiron books i have read , but the this one was a far tale from what she done . The story was slow and i had to push myself to finish the book . This is a story i would not recommend to anyeone .	-1
I really liked the first book , Initiate . It was really good , but this one ... was n't . I feel like a majority of the story had nothing to really do with the first . It seemed cut off from Initiate and it did n't really connect until the very end . I wo n't be finishing the series .	-1
Harry was more disgusting than usual . Jack was not even half the character she usually portrays . Nasty , but not even nice ! I did not like this one at all .	-1
The heroine is too stupid to be believed . Almost wanted to see her get what she had coming.Will not read the next book .	-1
There & # 8217 ; s truthfully nothing more I can add to what other reviewers have already said . Just go and read their one-star and two-star reviews for this book and you & # 8217 ; ll know exactly what I thought of it . It was everything that I & # 8217 ; m so tired of seeing in YA paranormal romance . There is the overdone love triangle , the insta love , the helpless little perfect blonde protagonist with her bratty , self-indulgent , petty behavior , and the new town she and her family moves to closely resembling Twilight & # 8217 ; s Forks . Skyla can run really fast and she & # 8217 ; s super strong and she and Logan can read each other & # 8217 ; s minds & # 8211 ; anyone thinking Twilight ? Yet , at the first sign of danger she turns into this whimpering little nitwit . Truth be told , I have more bad things to say about this formulaic story with its predictable barely-there plot , than good things . The one thing I DID enjoy were the mean girls being horrible to Skyla , and for some perverse reason I enjoyed those scenes more than Skyla and Logan & # 8217 ; s incessant kissing . Half of this book details every moment and every location possible Skyla and Logan finds to make-out , instead of moving the plot forward . And don & # 8217 ; t even get me started on the time-travel aspect of the story . Skyla didn & # 8217 ; t even know she could time travel , but guess what ? Next day she & # 8217 ; s time travelling by falling asleep in a hidey-hole at the top of her closet ! For crying out loud people , as if the choppy writing and plot holes and sudden jumps in scenes weren & # 8217 ; t bad enough , logic gets kicked out of the window as well . The only other good thing I can say about Moore is that she actually writes quite well . Will I read more of her books ? Yes ! As long as it & # 8217 ; s not romance or anything paranormal . Will I continue with this series ? Heck no ! I & # 8217 ; m sure a lot of readers will find this book entertaining ; it just wasn & # 8217 ; t for me . It consisted of everything I & # 8217 ; m so tired of reading in YA fiction , and it most certainly doesn & # 8217 ; t offer anything new . I & # 8217 ; m disappointed that it didn & # 8217 ; t live up to the fantastic read I was hoping it would be .	-1
The story line of this novel has a certain unique quality but in all honesty it looks like the author wanted to make sure she covered all angles , the love triangle , the hateful girls , the dreaded step-father and so on . The characters however are not likeable and have no depth and seem to do all these strange things without any real reason . At first I was quite entertained as the writing style is n't too bad but I was so glad to get to the end of the I love Logan I love Gage dilemma , and the whole Angels treatment . Reaching the end though I was ingtrigued enough to want to know what happened but at the same time deathly afraid to get into the series so I debated about what to do . I like to give things a chance and I do like to see where they are headed so I did the thing that is unthinkable , at least in my reader life . I skipped 2-5 and went to book 6 . Thank goodness I did because I saved myself from wasting more money , everything was pretty much at the same place . There are so many better books out there .	-1
I really liked this series in the beginning . Book one was pretty good , book two was much the same . But by the time I got to book three I was forcing myself to read the rest of the book . But it left it at such a cliff hanger I said to myself & # 34 ; you just have to find out what happens next & # 34 ; so I bought book 4 . Unfortunately.there is just so much going on and so much drama it was so draining . I like a good love triangle but goodness three guys is just ridiculous . And each of them has seen the future and they each say she 's with them , really ! I refuse to spend anymore on this series and I 'm disappointed in myself for spending the money I have spent already . I will find some who has read the series once the last book comes out so I at least know who she ends up with but besides that I 'm not investing anymore time or money into this series .	-1
OMG ! This book was just bad and I 'm happy it was free . The author had a good idea but it was badly executed . Even though this book is free do n't download it . You are n't missing much and I certainly wo n't be spending money for part two .	-1
I 'm actually a bit enraged about this book . This is the first bad review I 've EVER done and it 's only so I can shake some sense in whatever mindless hippies thought this book deserved a star at all , let alone five . No lie , I went out of my way to tell everyone I talked to that this book was awful . And just to say , I 'm actually embarrassingly tolerant of crappy books ( Hush , Hush and the House of Night Series come to mind ) . I never stop mid-book and I 'm intrigued at least a little bit . Not the case with this butt wipe of a book . Every time I picked it up , I had an internal battle with myself to just put it down and pretend like I never was stupid enough to spend $ 0.99 too much on it in the first place . Evenutally , I just said `` screw it '' and finished the book before I broke reading maxim # 1 - Never give up on a book . Pfft.First of all , what the crap ? There ca n't be anyone that superficial in real life . She describes herself as the perfect being with `` perfect wavy , unfrizzy blonde hair and crystal clear blue eyes . '' Really ? Nobody roots for the overdog in these stories . I felt no connection to her whatsoever . Then she automatically just has a spot on the cheerleading squad ? Just because she lives in the dead girl 's house who used to be on the team ? Unlikely.OH ! And another thing ! How realistic is having the `` two hottest boys you 've ever seen in your entire life '' already fighting over who gets you within five minutes of meeting you ? She was in that town for like three hours and she already had a best friend and two boyfriends . Which brings me to my next point of loathing : I hate love at first sight ! There 's nothing thrilling about a couple who just falls into eachothers arms . There has to be some suspense and passion for me to enjoy the romance . You know , the mystery guy who has secrets in his eyes ? Not only was Logan not a mystery guy , she could read his effing thoughts ! No fun . NOT enticing.And what the heck is up with going to a party EVERY single night ? ! ? For real ? No . Just no.What even was the story to this ? It was more about an immature high school girl jealous of a dead chick and completely oblivious to her own plights than it was about what she was and the predicament she was in . I learned a lot about vapid teenage girls and little to nothing about the Nephilim world and why Skyla is important in it.How about how all of the sudden she can just use her powers with slim to no practice ? Come on.This book had me caught up in all the minor insignificant details that drove me nuts rather than the parts that truly mattered.NO RECOMMENDATION ! In fact , shame on you for even considering it far enough to look at any reviews.You know what ? Scratch that.. read this book . If I had to put up with this stupid book than so does everyone else . I 'm taking you all down with me .	-1
I tried to read it . I would change books then try coming back to it . And then again finding myself changing books . For a female that proclaimed to be a fighter she seemed like she was always needing somwone to validate her worth . I couldnt listen to her complain about the negatives as she rolled over and just took it . I juat could n't finish it .	-1
This must have been written as a thesis project for a creative writing degree in a third world university . May have been okay as a very short essay , but tortuous as an extended metaphor . High school level writing .	-1
I 'm amazed at all these great reviews . I read the first chapter and gave up . Why ? Because it was SSSLLLLOOOOOWWW ! A good book needs a great inciting incident . NAILED started with all back story about the two main characters . It should have started with the discovery of the body . The back story can always be woven in later . Several reviewers mentioned foul language . I did n't encounter any in the first chapter but ... .I wish new mystery writers would do some research , and spend some time with law enforcement officers . Most swear little if at all . They are husbands , wives , mothers and fathers just like the rest of the world . I spent several years at a sheriffs department and rarely heard anyone using profanity .	-1
decent story with many typos ... Connelly had a fresh idea but took a bit too long to get to the easily predictable ending .	-1
I 'm not sure why I even paid the 99 cents for this trash -- I guess I ordered it thinking it was nonfiction . But it is n't , and it is truly one of the worst things I have read . In fact , I ca n't believe how many reviewers thought it was well written . Let me put it this way : it reminded me of a seventh-grade writer trying to shock her creative writing teacher . It is full of grammatical errors , wrong word choices , misspellings -- now , this could just be poor editing , but it seemed like it was really what the writer intended.The premise could have been interesting -- a young girl being molested by family members -- because we know that in real life this happens all too often . But the whole thing is contrived and really dumb . The end reminded me of the kind of ending my students used to tack on to a story when they did n't know how to end it : they said , in effect , `` and then I died . '' It did n't matter that I would point out to them that if that were the case , they could n't have told the story . They just liked the shock value . So it is with this story , I think . Please do n't waste your time . If I could have given it zero stars , I would have .	-1
I thought this was going to be an inspiring spiritual book ... the very beginning appeared to be uplifting and positive with insightful meditations . Then wham oh ! ! ! It says do n't watch movies ... do n't read books ... do n't watch tv ... do n't watch the news or read the newspapers ... do n't play scrabble or games ... do n't do this and do n't do that ... .ENOUGH for me ... I would not recommend this book to anyone ... I had downloaded this book from Amazon and thank heavens I can delete it ... and that is what I have done .	-1
Well this is garbage , do n't spend a cent over zero for it or you will be disappointed . I had high hopes because the cover and title promised so much more , but there really are better bad cop stories by better authors out there .	-1
If the thought of two men in uniform abusing their power to molest a young woman is 'sexy ' to you , then by all means , please enjoy this unimaginative pile of cheese . Otherwise , I would suggest you find something better to do with your time ... and genitals !	-1
I have a couple of issues with this book . First it seems more like a partial chapter out of a longer book . I 'd like to have seen what happened next , after her lawyers got done with the cops . Second , this type of book really has been overdone , cop rape in the desert is old . I kept waiting on a twist that never came .	-1
The book started out really good , I even recommended it to my daughter . I have n't read much steam punk , but this seemed like a good effort . However , the fairly graphic sex scene in the middle felt awkward and out of place . It definitely distracted from the story . The couple also knew each other for less than a day , something I object to when it comes to sex.Then the story seemed to lose it 's steam punk persona and become a paranormal horror kind of story . As others have stated , the ending was very rushed with the couple deciding to marry , after only a day together.Sci-fi , fantasy , and steam punk can all be outside the realm of reality , but relationships between people should always be consistent.I ended up un-recommending it to my daughter who does n't like graphic sex in books.At least it was free , and I did enjoy the beginning .	-1
A story as an excuse for some sexy scenes ? The sex is better than the plot , which is very simple and not the least bit mysterious ... a very short read , an amuse bouche ... ..	-1
I was hoping for a little suspense and gore . It was really short as well . Too many mushy love scenes .	-1
I did n't mind the alternate history presented in this book ; the goofy blend of old fashioned mannerisms , `` technology '' ( telegraphs ? ) and ghostbusters-talk was ok . It was funny at first but the second the author got too caught up in describing the hero 's physique and how well he filled out his trousers , I knew this book was going to take an unfortunate turn down steamy romance alley . There 's this throwaway gobbledly gook about ghosts and ghosthunters and people with magical powers but all the author cared for was getting to the embarrassing sex scene . Then some more stupidity and clumsy magic and the book ends with the hero excitedly coming back from the pharmacy with something for his wedding night ... Good grief .	-1
this book was horrible , i hated it . i paid 5.99 to have it sent to my kindle and that was a totle waste of money . I thought i bought a romance novel , but apparently i did n't because it was all about god . i believe in god , and i have no problem with the characters having faith but please , it 's a romance novel do n't throw god in my face every five minutes .	-1
I gave incredible sex two stars because I thought it was lame . Nothing in it was an OMG I got to try this . Most things were things that even most people have already thought of or are doing now .	-1
Most of the stuff in this book is going to be old hat to readers and more exotic practices are covered so quickly that I pray nobody would give them a go after reading a paragraph of instructions . About a third of the way through the book , the authors start recycling tips so you do n't even get the variety of tips that the length would suggest.There are many better resources out there for people wanting to try something new .	-1
Blah hum-bug ! This was a waste of my time and the many trees who died so it could be printed .	-1
This book was good at the beginning and I really liked it but as the book progressed it just got dumber and dumber . The reactions to situations were completely ridiculous , the co main character , tristan i think , he kept telling himself not to do things and then doing them anyway for every decision he had to make . That got on my nerves . The main character could n't follow her own path and just like everyone else walked the exact same path as all those before her . She made some incredibly stupid decisions and she was ridiculously predictable . The books concept was ok but the exicution was dreadful , predictable , and incredibly frustrating . All in all I wish I had n't bought it and would n't urge you to do so . Do n't waste you money or time on this book like me .	-1
I wish I could simply say it sucks and be on to the next book , but the storylime has potential . The problem is this ... it jumps around too much with no explanation and the writing seriously needs the help of an accomplished editor . I truly think if this book got a makeover it would be good . As it stands I would suggest you pass .	-1
At first it grabbed me and kept me completely enthralled and interested.However , I was very let down by the ending . Not really caring what happens to the characters from this point .	-1
I did not enjoy reading this book . I just really really did not enjoy reading this book . I will not read any more from this series .	-1
Thought it 'd be good . SO WRONG ! I was bored out of mind . Nothing good really happened in this book . No good grammer , plot , story line ... .etc . My seven year old cousin woulda hated this book , trust me . I read it to him.This book turned out to be a book for some no-brained chicken . Just so hook off Twillight , to get fans .	-1
The book just did n't really have anything to offer in the realm of writing . It was just a long list of topics one could write about and nothing else was of use .	-1
in brief , this is a bad romance . the longer form of the review is that I could not make it past 25 % on my kindle . actually stopped reading at 20 % but paged ahead a bit and it was the same . he is trying to get her to go to bed with him and she is saying no . just different places . all very boring really . and the fact that she witnessed the deaths of her father , and basically everyone in her home , and she `` just puts it behind her '' . as well as the rape , which makes her desire sex . hmmm . what youth wrote this ? I have talked with many who have been raped and that is not the reaction they tell me , in fact they fail to find sex fulfilling even with someone they love . and trauma -- witnessing murder -- that results in post traumatic stress disorder , a mental disorder . so along with the posts that complain about the lack of detail to the era . I find the lack of reality regarding human nature , very upsetting . the book , charaters could have been handled differently , which is what I was hoping for , but I can no long continue reading this book . my advice , do n't even start it .	-1
I just could n't get interested in ths book . It started off real slow and did n't seem to pick up any speed . Not impressed	-1
I read this wondering when the action would start . It really never did . Kind of disappointed with the purchase - I was hoping for a book strong enough that I would have another series to read but this was n't it . The & # 34 ; prepping & # 34 ; tips were interesting and I did learn a few things ( hence the two stars ) but overall not great . I definitely will not be re-reading it nor the rest of the series .	-1
Boring -- -just could n't get into the plot . Glad it was one of the freebies . Guess it was not to my tastes inmysteries	-1
Silly but fun . Not much on reality so good to get your mind off your troubles type of book . I enjoyed it .	-1
The book did not have a very strong story line . Not intriguing enough . The book might be a good read for an older teen or young adult .	-1
I started this book with high expectations . I love an alpha male just as much as the next gal , but Jake was a jerk . Not only that but Amy was too naive to be believable . I felt as if I was reading historical characters with a contemporary setting . The whole thing was over the top , and not in a good way.Ms . Chance is an able writer and I hope the other story I downloaded at the same time as this one is more believable .	-1
This story was not believable at all . All the great reviews made it sound like a great little story . It was n't . The h was whiny and TSTL . The H was an over the top alpha brute . He 's supposed to be a cop , but he practically rapes her . The `` blackmail '' storyline was really weak . There was n't really any chemistry between these two either . I liked the idea of this short story , but it fell flat for me .	-1
This was so uninteresting that I ca n't even think of anything to say about it . Now they want at least 2o words !	-1
Interesting stories.The concentration level which is required does or should I say does make good night reading as you soon give up trying to translate whilst reading . If you are really into fables you will enjoy it but not for a casual reader .	-1
I chose this rating because I hated it . I hated it because it was harfd to read , it was on kindle , and I could n't slip a bookmark between the pages .	-1
I downloaded this book for my Kindle because I thought it was in the genre of Victorian erotica . The writing is stilted in the Victorian style , but there is no erotica in the book -- just a simple story about a little girl from the country who goes to London . If you are looking for erotica , look elsewhere because you wo n't find it here .	-1
Archaic language with medical terminology has this book reading like a late 1900 's medical school test book with anatomy lessons , diagnostic techniques and long ago outdated ideas of treatment or ailments . I find it hard to believe as a mother and a nurse , that this is anything related to the title . Not reliable and a poor read .	-1
I was expecting relevant home remedies for today 's lifestyles . This is very hard to read and it contains items that may not be readily available for most consumers .	-1
The Governess was chosen for her youth and ability to look after the two children , Miles and Flora , joining the cook as another member of the household . The uncle of the children had instructed her not to contact him , to make all the decisions regarding the children herself , that he did n't want to hear from her at all . She was excited to have the position , and delighted in the children , also finding a friend in the cook.But all was not as it seemed , with two past employees appearing to be watching them on odd occasions . The Governess and the cook were struggling with what was happening ... the children , beautiful angels they seemed , but maybe they were n't so angelic ? Or was it the sanity of the Governess that was the problem ? I struggled with this book . It was difficult to read , with long sentences which did n't make a lot of sense at times . For me , the sense of horror was n't there , the passages seemed stilted and did n't draw me in . I had no connection to the characters either . I know it was written a long time ago , but it was definitely not for me I 'm afraid !	-1
It was not what I expected for a Loring book and I could not get interested in reading it .	-1
How do you review a book if there are pages missing ? Even the missing pages were numbered and the type was missing but still numbered the same number on blank pages . If waste of time .	-1
I was not impressed with the writing and could not finish the book . It was probably my expectations and not the author 's failure to entice .	-1
If you like a detective who decides you 're not guilty because he likes the look of you , this is the book for you . Boring , no action , no clues , hideously slow .	-1
This was a deceptive way to trick people into reading an excerpt of a novel that is available for purchase . Proven easily by the difference in the quality of writing between the two barely publishable story stories and the engaging novel excerpt which I wo n't purchase because of the deceptive ruse of which I wrote .	-1
There 's not much to really say about this book ; I 'm not sure if it 's just because it was 8 pages or what . Do n't get me wrong , I enjoy short stories , a lot ; especially if you 're busy , short stories really come in handy . I think I would 've enjoyed it a lot more if it was a longer , short story . Effie , the main character , was an enjoyable character , and Marchini definitely makes you feel sorry for Effie . I wish there was more I could say about this book , but unfortunately there is n't .	-1
I have read all Evan Currie 's later books , and enjoyed them very much , but I did not like this one . Like his subsequent books , this story has some great battle scenes and I liked the idea for a futuristic power station . Not quite sure where all the water to run it came from in the dead heart of the continent , but may be that 's nitpicking . Unfortunately I also did n't find the rest of the plot believable , I thought the female police officer was unrealistically stupid and I hated a lot of the `` Aussie '' dialogue . I 've spoken to quite a few Australian soldiers and I do n't recall any of them ever calling me `` son '' , let alone doing it in every third sentence . `` Mate '' may be `` son '' no.The rest of the background did n't gel either . I do n't know if Interpol agents cruise the world looking for bad guys but I suspect they do n't , particularly in countries with their own police forces . I am , however , sure that they wo n't be able to legally bring their own weapons and ammo into the country without filling in a lot of paper work first . Amazingly the country does have its own defence forces too , not nearly so large as America 's , but not so small that they can only field a single team of soldiers to deploy in the middle of the country . And the army bases , even by road , would surely be able to get some personnel on the ground sooner than a helicopter flown from mainland USA .	-1
It just was n't an interesting story . Period . Too long and too hard to read . The writing tripped over itself and did not make me feel like I wanted to continue with the story . I 'm surprised , usually these freebees are great ! I was disappointed but if it 's still free it 's worth the $ ... : )	-1
Avery nice short story.I liked the characters and the way they remember one another and the ending.Well done keep writing.SINCERELY , ARLENE LEMIRE	-1
This one is definitely not Christian-due mostly to the swearing . If not for the swearing , the book would not have been too bad . Very short .	-1
Only got a quick look in this memory lane shown by the hero and heroine . Because of a car accident in college , our heroine thought her hero had forgotten about her when she did n't hear from him . They both married other spouses and had children . Now because of snow and a flat tire , they meet each again . The magic is still there.Theila	-1
I made it about half way through the book ( because it is actually pretty well written ) but when we went from zombies to a werewolf to vampires I just gave up . Interesting concept but too much of a jumble of everything , as though all the elements of the genre were thrown in a blender . Very entertaining to begin with , but the repetition simply wore me down . Cut to about half the length and with some sort of real ending this would have been a great book .	-1
Way too racy for me . I tried to read it and see how it all turned out but the sex was a little too intense for me . Maybe if I were younger ?	-1
This book has gotten a lot of good reviews and I guess I can see why - it has a unique twist on the mystical and magical ; turning unicorn horns into an other-dimension portal . However , despite the intriguing premise the story falls very flat . The writing is amateurish , even sophomoric . Short , declarative , unimaginative sentences with a large dose of misused vocabulary terms , rough transitions and awkward dialogue . I got the impression the author clicked `` spell check '' and then called it good , which is never enough for a decent editing job . The writing was just too simplistic ( and not in intense Hemingway-like simplicity but in the Junior High short of way ) and the plot was never used to it 's full potential . There were many points of interest the author could have expounded on or used to create tension and suspense but instead just skimmed over , leaving the plot feeling superficial . I suppose I should say that `` for the price this is a good read '' but I do n't want to do that . Even though it is a freebie ( for which I am glad ) I still would n't recommend it for any reader with the basic expectations of solid plot development , character development and writing talent . It was merely a potentially good story with poor execution .	-1
I wanted to like this book , but unfortunately I was disappointed . The book moved along at a snails pace , taking too long to cover details that did n't seem important to the story . The actions of the characters were bizarre at best , and downright ridiculous at worst . As another reviewer noted , the premise for the story was good , and the book had potential in the outline of who the characters are and the circumstances under which they meet , but that was it .	-1
I enjoy romance , and it 's usually predictable . But the main character is all over the place . She loves her job , she screws around on wedding stuff at work . She loves the guy , but does n't seem to want to spend time with him . I could n't keep track of her motives , and that 's a deal-breaker to me .	-1
Where to begin - this book failed in so many ways . The story foundation is interesting but the characters are extremely flat . I think the author could have done so much with this but I just could n't connect to the main character or any of the characters . No emotion - good or bad . The best word to describe this book is BORING . Do n't waste your time !	-1
This book was so predictable and juvenile-feeling that I could n't make it past the first couple of chapters . Not for me .	-1
I came across this book while searching the Free Kindle Books list and the summary sounded interesting so I figured I would give it a try . Ugh . I ca n't start a book and not finish so I 've spent the last day trying to read through this book as fast as I can to be done with it - which is hard considering that 95 % of the book is made up of silly , non-interesting conversations between characters that are hard to follow . There were no descriptions of anything or thought processes so no picture could be painted . It was a very dis-jointed novel . We go from a silly conversation on a beach that takes up 4 pages and happens over 5 minutes to one sentence `` explaining '' to readers that they already flew back and settled into their normal lives . One evening out takes up a chapter and then 3 weeks goes by in a few sentences in the next chapter . Again , the story could have been really interesting and captivating but it feel extremely flat . I would n't recommend this book to anyone and I wo n't be finishing the rest of the series .	-1
I had to stop reading this about 8 % in because the punctuation and grammar were distractingly bad . I certainly was n't expecting Pulitzer quality or anything , but the errors were constant and truly , inexcusably bad . If the author paid an editor , she should demand a refund ; if she did n't , then she has no business being an author .	-1
I thought for sure this was going to be a romantic novel instead it 's more like a self conscious novel . I did n't know how much more I could take OF Josie 's self conscious and self loathing attitude . WHERE 'S THE Romance ? I do n't know how Jake and JOSIE ended up together . Come on ! She does n't know Jake at all and she starts talking about like him `` not because he was a superstar but because he was down to earth '' um ... how does she know ? Watching his movies , I guess . It was bland and boring .	-1
My very first read on the Kindle ( although not my first review ) ! The description drew me in and I was excited to begin this book . The excitement remained as the story unfolded , until I could no longer read any further and removed it from my Kindle and cloud.Let me try to explain . The story was a brilliant idea . Catchy , interesting and something I have n't read about before . It had the potential of being fluffy - check , girly - check , and romantic - check . Three good things to draw any person who wanted a slightly different twist to a Romance.By the end of the first chapter I was disappointed and annoyed at the heroine of the story . She was , in a sense , whiny . Not only did I dislike the main character , the grammar and punctuation put me off . However it took me a good 3 more chapters before I gave up and could take no more .	-1
Wow , I 'm surprised how many five stars I see for this one . The book is an easy read , that 's true , but it was also slow on the uptake , formulaic and the grammatical errors became annoying by the middle of the book.This is supposed to be the story of Josie McMaster and Jake Hall , but Jake Hall did not make an appearance until much later ; that is after listening to Josie ramble on . She 's not your typical heroine , but some of her antics became annoying by the middle of the book also.And the most annoying ( I know , I 've used annoying several times , and it is intentional because that 's how much I was annoyed with it ) is the ending . I do n't think this is a spoiler but just in case , if you do n't want to know , please stop here . ***POSSIBLE SPOILER***Bridesmaid Lotto ( McMaster the Disaster ) , though should stand on its own is actually the first chapter in a series of books . The ending left you hanging in an annoying fashion because it was so obvious that it is a ploy so that you will buy the next book . Think of the book as a nighttime soap opera , wherein you will need to tune in the next week so that you can follow the plot.I wo n't mind this if it was a good series because I do love mega epics ( exampleThe Eye of the World : Book One of 'The Wheel of Time ' , But Bridesmaid Lotto is so transparent that it was written that way to be commercial .	-1
If you want page after page of clothes closet contents , and fairy headed females fine . If not do not bother with this book .	-1
I really wanted to like this one . I felt the writer really tried to make this story atmospheric and to establish an atmosphere of foreboding , but never quite succeeded . I was also disappointed by the quality of the writing , which was unpolished at best . I could n't help but notice several small but distracting errors in grammar and punctuation , such as the improper conjugation of the verb `` drink . '' Like many others I note that this writer has confused `` breaks '' with `` brakes . '' I 'm sure I sound pedantic but these things really pull me out of a story . I did like the cover art , however .	-1
Girl sees hot guy , wants to meet hot guy , pretends she knows him from the past , hooks up and has sex in the stock room with hot guy . Not much more to the story . Read my review and you 've got the whole basis of the book . Would have been better if time went buy and she meets him again , and it turns into something real . Something with a more extensive `` plot '' or story line . Like the author turned a fantasy into a book . Get real .	-1
I got this as details claim 55 pages - which would be substantial short story . However , this is really a vignette length.The whole of this bit is much like the description : scant percent related to actual offering and 65 % ( or more ) dedicated to other works or praise for author . It is 4 - 6 pages ( at best ) of 55 claimed in details . Which is a let down . The description should better outlay what people are purchasing as the details and description lend to being more than a bit piece.A compilation of shorts would be more satisfying to a reader than paying 99 cents for an article length bit with much more dedicated to advertising other works.Also , when I search in fantasy `` epic '' I think Tolkien or Martin , not Aesop.That all said - cute kiddies story as long as one does not mind explaining why it is okay to lie as protag does.Christine	-1
Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsI totally was not feeling this book . Bound by Blood 's storyline and character development made no sense to me . Going with the premise of the story , Wolfman and Vamplady marry to solidify and unite forces in order to battle the Demons.She was to marry to save the vamp nest . How many years long do you think a marriage would last in the paranormal realm ? Hundreds of years maybe ? That was my guess . Then imagine my surprise when this bit of information is shared , '' She was n't supposed to have sex with him . The Council has been adamant about that . Drink him , yes , take his power , give him hers , but sex ? Forbidden . `` Now come on . Does that even make sense ? The Council agrees to marry off their precious Vamp Princess for unity sake but then no sex ? It is so , well , dumb . Who would insist on a marriage to take place but no sex . I swear you could hear my eyes roll.Then in the course of one day , she loves him . Morgan did n't know Jace previously . She was bartered away for the good of her people and it only took one day . Yep . He stalked her for years behind the scenes so I can imagine that his lust level was high and he claimed to have loved her from afar but it was all way way waaaaay to quick for me . Also , I do n't know but the whole `` love from afar '' thing was just creepy to me.Then I got confused once again . A trusted council member traps her inside a burning house . Supposedly this action was to see if she could or would burn badly after she had a chance to drink Jace 's blood . But you see , why the hell would he take a chance on that if that same Council member planned on ( and needed to ) set Morgan up as a sacrifice to the demons in hell ? Talk about a complete contradiction.Once again , my confusion ensued regarding the plans of each of the Wolf and Vamp groups . The Alpha and Council members never figured out each other 's evil plans toward one another . They never considered their opposition schemes ? Not very good leaders if you ask me . How do you lead people you are suppose to protect if you do n't consider your enemies strategies ? So basically , the story , the pace , the characters were all just a big fat turn off for me . Paranormal or not , the story has got to make sense to me . Good thing Bound by Blood was only a $ 1 purchase on Amazon .	-1
The Amersham Rubies started off pretty interesting . I was drawn in and my curiosity was piqued . Unfortunately , the conflict was n't resolved in a realistic fashion and I found the resolution too abrupt . This is another one that is meant to draw the reader into the series and not necessarily this story . Does this technique work ? I love historical fiction mysteries but this novella did n't draw me in . There was little character development but it was adequate for the short story mystery presented . I was into it until the solving of the mystery .	-1
This book started out so well , but I honestly thought maybe it was a prolog . It stopped before it started . I thought the next section was a preview of a new book , which I still believe as it never went any where to a conclusion either . If this was a sample book I wish I had known - may have bought the rest if I had known as it was interesting , but I do n't want to waste my time if all the books by her are like this.I know this was a free title ( I have gone on to buy several series because I liked the first `` free '' one I bought ) , but unless I received a bad download , which has never happened before , even free made this a waste of my time and space .	-1
I am so glad I did not pay for this . First , it is a short story . Second , it is totally unbelievable . The wealthy of the time would NEVER have listened to someone they believed was a maid ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-1
The story moved too fast , was too short and seemed to stop in the middle . I thought I was reading a full length book and it was about the length of one chapter . It definitely is a mini series . Too short . I would only recommend this book if you get the whole series and follow her whole career or make it a quick read on your lunch break at work .	-1
Wow , did I pay money for that short little story ? No meat and barely any potatoes ! tsk , tsk tsk . Not worth it unless it ` s free and I 'm a huge fan of her work .	-1
I know Romance Novels are fantasy books and just a way of light reading . But I found this book way beyond a fantasy . Most of the book takes place in one day in a single room with a stupid & sleazy interview . Its not `` fun '' & definitely not `` Sexy '' . Its Crude . It would have been sexy if Juliet & Zeus had been engaged or been married or courted for one day even , before all the sexual stuff ( I do n't want to be explicit ) took place . This way ( which I have NEVER read in the last 35 yrs I 've been reading Regency Romances ) it just comes off as crude & horny.I am all for Romance & sex . That is why I read these books when I want light reading.The hero Zeus comes off as a Man with no Spine.He stands in the room and does explicit sexual stuff Juliet asks him to do in an interview of all things.Come on ! ! ! You call that sexy ! ? Before I bought it , I liked the theme of the story.I liked the the Heroine 's character . Someone who will bend the rules of society & do something outside the box . It seemed like an appealing book.But after going through it , its extremely unrealistic and after reaching 64 % ( I forced myself after 40 % ) on the Kindle , I cant finish it . Thank God I only spent $ 2.99 on it .	-1
Within the first two pages there are hints to the quality of the story . Kate complains about the problem of `` what e-mail address '' to use so that the computer daters can communicate with her . Ca n't use the work e-mail or her private e-mail..What to do ? Really ? A talented reporter ca n't figure out how to set up a google or yahoo email just for the story ? Then , oh-my , they want photos to go with computer dating ad . What to do . run around and buy lots of clothes and then go to a photographer ? What ? A photographer to get a digital photo to post on line ? Who would do that ? I-phone ? Who would go to photographer to get a digital photo to post on-line.Then there was the sterotyped newspaper editor ( cigar chopping , short tempered misogynoist-girl reporters only good for fashion or living section ) and the rest of the men agreed with him . I had to check to see what year this book was written . Really starts off poorly and continues on that way .	-1
I am happy this book was free . I did n't read any of the reviews until after I read the book and I agree with `` do n't bother '' and `` poorly executed '' reviews . I thought in the beginning , it was going to be a good story . Then , Kate turned out to be a total B**** ! I really disliked her modesty and prudish ways . I felt a bit sorry for Steve that he fell in love with her and that she was just to immature . I congratulated myself on actually finishing the book and not trashing it .	-1
First of all I 'd like to say this book has promise and that it had an interesting story line . The main character & # 34 ; Aradia & # 34 ; was likable and over all I did like how it started out . I downloaded this book onto my Kindle Fire a few days ago because it was free and I like books about the paranormal , witches in particular . I get why indie author 's usually list the first book in a series free , to hopefully suck you into the story so you will then purchase subsequent books in the series . That being said this book still needs a lot of work as far as editing and working on the story itself , particularly some of the conversations between character 's which did n't flow naturally and in some cases made absolutely no sense at all . Some of Aradia 's so called jokes were not only not funny , but also made no sense and left me feeling like I was out in left field some where . Certain situations like the night with the werewolf at the police station made no sense and neither did the bit about the strange officer who helps her put the Roy the werewolf into the police station , like he is smelling her and gives off weird vibes to her supposedly but then he just disappears from the storyline . He also blocked the keypad so she could n't see the code when he put Roy into the cell , yet she and Roy just walk right out . also , there is NO TIBIA BONE in the arm ! The Tibia is a bone in the leg not the arm . Mistakes like this throw me off because they are easy enough for the writer to check and verify and such obvious mistakes like this detract from the story big time.I guess it all comes down to the fact that although the story itself and the character 's were somewhat interesting and show promise if worked on some more , I could n't finish the book . It seemed rough and unfinished , was hard to follow and just did n't suck me in at all . The weird conversations between character 's seemed forced and much of the slang/lingo used by Aradia was totally off for a teenage girl and not reasonable at all . Certain situations made no sense and although I liked Aradia and the story has potential , it still needs work .	-1
PARIS A TO Z by Marie Sexton.I read this by mistake . I wanted to read `` A to Z '' ( Book 2 in the series ) which was the story of Zach and Angelo . They met and developed a relationship in Book 2 . Instead I bought this Book 5 which is Zach and Angelo already in a relationship , and they take a trip to Paris . Three separate couples get together for a wedding . Some of them slept with others in the group before the current relationships , so there is jealousy . The main plot is Zach and Matt getting over their insecurities.It 's told in first person from two characters ' points of views , most of the time Zach , the rest of the time Matt . Zach is uncomfortable being around his former lover Jon . He 's also worried about some things with Angelo . Matt is jealous that his lover Jared is still good friends with Jared 's former lover Cole . The purpose of the trip is the wedding of Jon and Cole . With established relationships there 's less emotional buildup for the sex scenes so they were n't as exciting . One of them was boring . This is gay male sex with rear door activity.DATA : Narrative mode : first person Zach and Matt . Kindle count story length : 2686 ( 406 KB ) . Swearing language : strong , including religious swear words . Sexual language : moderate . Number of sex scenes : 6 . Setting : current day Denver , Colorado and Paris , France . Copyright : 2011 . Genre : gay male romance .	-1
This was not my cup of tea . I am glad that it was a free ebook , but I just could not do this at all .	-1
I do have two cats myself and yes they entertain me but I know most days their actions probably would n't be seen as book worthy to the rest of the world . This book was kinda cute at first but then it started to remind me of when I was a kid and my mom would have me go with her on visits to neighbors and I 'd sit through these stories that went on and on that you 'd just politely smile and nod through .	-1
I do n't know why but the story just did n't grab me . I really tried but it was very slow in alot of places .	-1
A very quick read , but I did like that the heroine was not flighty and was steadfast in her love and loyalty . I knew going in that the story would be very short , so no complaints there . However , I only give 2 stars because it is next to impossible to produce a 5 star rating with such a short story . No time for real character development or plot . It was a good free book . I am willing to chance buying a book written by this author .	-1
KThis story is the equivalent of two chapters . I have read excerpts that were longer ; I have read too many good short stories to be able to excuse the lack of developmentin story line or characters . There are some wonderful short stories for same pricewhich wo n't leave you frustrated because it ended before you could make a connectionwith any of the characters . The only reason I am giving this two stars instead of one isdue to the potential it exhibited . This could easily have been a delightful read but it appearsas though the author ran out of motivation . I hate giving bad reviews , but ca n't honestly dodifferently here .	-1
One of the lamest books I have yet to read . The characters were not interesting . The story was not overly predictable because the characters were so lame you never thought they could figure out their own story .	-1
I am sorry , but it was a waste of time . I love to read , but I did not even finish the book .	-1
I found this mildly interesting . The story line was ok , the characters were good and interesting . Not sure I can go with the futuristic plot tying into centuries of ancient history . Do n't think I will read more of this style .	-1
could n't get pass the first chapter it was s bad , it was so bad that I just did n't want to waste my time reading amymore .	-1
I 've enjoyed everything Rain has had a hand in writing except this . None of the characters felt real or even interesting . For such a short story , the boring bits seemed to go on forever and just when touching on something intriguing , the authors skimmed away to drivel again .	-1
Do n't bother with this one if you have any interest in how it ends . It starts out well enough , but the characters seem to develop multiple personality disorders or something as they go along . And , I still have n't figured out how one gunman with one gun , holding hostage three other people , managed to shoot three of the four , including himself . Pretty good start , but stupid denouement .	-1
Lalla Bains , a forty-year-old , twice divorced , ex-model , has been the unwilling recipient of attention and love letters from Billy Wayne . The day after he covers her car with poems on paper snowflakes , he is stabbed to death . With his final breath he tells her , `` The more there is the less you see . '' Even though he exasperated her , she thinks his death deserves more investigation than it is receiving . So she begins her own investigation even while working with the problems of the aero-ag business run by her and her father . Also involved is her friend and maybe fianc & eacute ; Sheriff Caleb Stone.While she does use words originally at times- '' His eyes left wet slug trails on my skin until I folded my arms over my breasts and broke the connection '' -- I found the book full of cliches and repetitions . The terms `` took off , '' `` banked over '' and `` aimed for '' were all used in one sentence . In another she writes , `` The wind had scoured the evening of its usual dust and debris , and now stars were punching holes in the velvety black dome over my head . '' We hear about her age , divorce record , and former career several times.The book has poor grammar ( `` alright , '' `` us girls have to stick together '' `` Go slow . `` ) .The men , on the whole , are obnoxious sexist pigs . Her actions do n't always make sense : A pen and paper drop to the floor of the car while she is driving so , instead of waiting until she stops , she reaches over , several times , to pick them up . Naturally , she loses control of the car and has an accident . Her car insurance had expired so she was driving illegally.A French phrase used a couple times is misspelled , differently each time . There is an unexplained and quick transition from talking to her father at home and talking to a group of first graders.Even though she has known Caleb forever , she does n't trust him entirely when it comes to exchanging information.One conversation talks about the danger of using meth . It has good information but seems to have been thrown in just for that reason , not to advance the plot.She never does explain Billy Wayne 's final words though they are mentioned frequently.I think some good rewriting and editing could have raised the level of this book to four stars.This was a free Amazon download .	-1
The idea of the book was good . The solution to the murder could have been done in a lot fewer pages . The story wandered all over the place . I nearly gave up on Lalla .	-1
Sorry for the bad review but I just could n't finish the book . I began with great expectations because the summary plot called to me and I thought it would be an interesting reading BUT the characters seemed forced in the story like strangers pitched from another book , maybe ? I could n't relate to a parent preocupied whith his autistic daughter arriving at a camp and instantly falling in lust with the therapist but I could excuse this if it was well done in the story but it kept developing worst and worst . It was finally boring because I could n't relate to the story or the characters . I know that it is difficult ( some say impossible ) to review an unfinished book but at least I can say why I left it and maybe help another reader .	-1
I thought this book would never end . I kept reading hoping it would get more interesting but it just was the same thing over and over , attraction then rejection for lame reasons . It just made no sense and Raphaela was just sort of thrown in to make a love story that became far too graphic towards the end . Very unbelievable characters who were impossible to relate to or like .	-1
This is poorly edited ( the main character carries a & # 34 ; bed role & # 34 ; ) , it 's derivative , and the & # 34 ; twist & # 34 ; at the end had me rolling my eyes ( I wo n't get into it because I do n't want to present a spoiler , but the numbers just do n't make sense ) .	-1
Be aware that this is not book length , but rather a teaser for another series.The use of language is poor ( full of unintentional anachronisms in character speech ) and the story is incredibly predictable . People who seems evil are evil . Situations that seem strange are strange . Danger appears and then is resolved through superpowers .	-1
This is a good short story.although it seemed as if the story starts half way through and you are being thrown into the middle . very much predictable , but glad it was free . Would have been upset if I paid for it .	-1
This very short story is about a young woman undergoing hyptnotic regression in order to uncover the cause of her fear of children . Very by-the-numbers , this story contains no surprises or shocks for anybody familiar with the horror genre .	-1
Reviewed at Another Look Book ReviewsYeah I think that the book blurb is longer than the book . At only .99 this is a super quick 45 min read max.I have read lots of Opal Carew books before and Three is not one of her best . I have to say , I love practically everything she has written . However not this little .99 ebook . From page 1 till you read `` the end '' it 's pure sex . But not pleasant meaning full sex or even hot erotic sex . Three just boarders on ridiculous . It 's just more like a porn show . So the story goes ... .well there is not story just sex . Lori has anal sex for the first time and it plays off like he enters her like she is old school.Then to tie it all together , Opal Carew tries to pull off that Lori and one of the brother 's Craig are falling in love . WTF ! Falling in love ? Just because she met him a few hours earlier , had sex with him about 4 times in those few hours , Lori looked at him like she could spend the rest of her life with him ? If you want to write a pure erotic book , do so . But leave it there and not try and throw a last minute romance spin on it .	-1
unfortunately , it was also the first thing . I was still in the process of reading `` regular '' books when I got my Kindle and was eager to start something . This short story seemed to fit the bill - and it was free ! ! I can see now why it was free.Terrible . No story or character development , no background , ambience or setting . It never gets off the ground before it just ends . Not a creepy concept at all , nothing scary , nothing believable , nothing worthwhile here . If Mr. Scribner had taken a little time to develop some plot , you could almost get to where you dislike the parental characters , but instead you are just left with a big `` WHY ? `` WHY does this story exist at all ? Love my Kindle , but will definitely be leery of the free stuff from now on . . .	-1
Aaargh ! So much potential in this story -- dashed because of the abrasive and unlikable heroine and her ridiculous dialogue.Even after Jolie Pritchard , a medieval studies major , learned that the gorgeous , kilt-wearing duke wooing her was a 400+ year old vampire , she continued to use all manner of modern-speak idioms that were incomprehensible to him . On the rare occasions that she explained them , it was in a rushed , snide manner that has the reader envisioning a tossed head and rolling eyes . Besides being obnoxious , this is inconsistent with someone having so much appreciation for his culture that she traveled overseas to pursue her medieval studies education.No doubt this was intended to be snarky humor , but it really missed the mark , instead coming across as insensitive rudeness . This continues throughout the story and ruined it IMHO . *Knight after Night* get two stars ( instead of one ) because Jackie Ivie did some interesting world building , and our antihero , Thoran Alexander MacKettryck , is swoon worthy in both manner and appearance . I would n't mind reading more about him if it was with a more sympathetic and better developed heroine .	-1
It was free , short and not very good . I would not recommend this book to anyone ever ! ! ! Deleting from my kindle and my cloud	-1
I hate these free books that are really a few chapters about a book they want you to buy . If they were honest about it I wouldnt mind.This thing is just garbage . Even at Free it costs too much .	-1
Without a doubt , one of the worst books I have ever read , and I have read thousands.I am tempted to give it a minus 5 stars - is that possible ? I thought from the 'blurb ' that I would be reading a 'backstairs ' type of book about royal 'pecadillos ' - a 'comedy ' in other words - what did I get ? -- I book full of inaccurate 'facts ? ' for the first part of the book , and then a mess of total vitriolic and one-sided comments about the current royal family.For a start , the authors assessing of past monarchs reads like fantasy - Edward 1 a 'good ' king ? possibly if you forget his desire to exterminate an entire race ( the Scots ) and his treatment of Robert the Bruce 's family when he captured them he may class as ? good ? to some eyes . Also Edward V1 was not succeeded by Richard 111 - Edward 1V was - Edward V1 was the only son of Henry V111 & was succeeded by Lady Jane Grey & then Mary 1 & Elizabeth 1 . Also , George V1 ' wife was Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon , later the Queeen Mother , George 's MOTHER was Mary , wife of George V. The latter part of the book was nothing more than an attack on the current royal family & a defence of Diana , who , as we all know , was absolutely 'perfect ' - ( yes , sure she was ! ! ! ! ) .I sincerely hope that , that if this is a sample of this author 's literary ability , she stops writing now , or , if she does attempt another book , she checks her facts before publishing it and at least it is listed in the 'fantasy ' section of Amazon books , so that people who want facts wo n't even look at it . - A total waste of money .	-1
Poorly written book with lots of editing errors.I tried hard to get interested in this book and had to stop reading it . I felt that the beginning of the book just kept describing all the dangerous fantasy forest animals over and over again repetitively . I could not make myself continue reading because it was not interesting .	-1
This was one of the first books I purchased for my Kindle when I was still new and awkward to using it , which probably accounts for at least part of my poor review . I had difficulty finding the foods I wanted to look up . I bought paperback calorie counter and have n't used this one since . In its defense , Food , Glorious Food does include instructions for how to use it , a Table of Contents , and an alphabetical index .	-1
& # 34 ; D is for the drooling dampwottle , who dibbles by the lake. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; G is for the gobblesnipe , and the gobblebat. & # 34 ; & # 34 ; P is for the pingo who makes a putrid pong. & # 34 ; This is truly a rather pathetic book . Your child is going to learn made up silly words instead of learning how to speak correctly . Kids do not need encouragement to make up words - they are quite capable of doing it themselves ! Deleting this book !	-1
A & # 34 ; widow & # 34 ; is a woman . A & # 34 ; widower & # 34 ; is a man . & # 34 ; Bare & # 34 ; is naked , & # 34 ; bear & # 34 ; is something you carry or endure . A chicken is in a coop . A coup is a stroke or a sudden seizure of power . For God 's sake hire a human editor .	-1
The book started out great , hooked me immediately . Deacon comes back to & # 34 ; set things right & # 34 ; with Rhea , and she goes after him with a shot gun . A great beginning ... ..too bad it was n't the beginning of the story , it 's a real shame that the reader never gets to read the beginning of this story.The parts of the story that are NEVER revealed to the reader:1 . The H/H meeting/falling in love2 . The heroine finding out the hero is the son of satan with & # 34 ; powers & # 34 ; ... . ( that could have been really fun reading ) 3 . The hero being dragged back to hellIn a nutshell : After Deacon leaves , the town gossips threaten to ruin Rheas reputation and her store . So she forges a marriage license , and claims Deacon died . Deacon can & # 34 ; feel her pain & # 34 ; and comes back to make her feel better so she can go on with her life . How he plans to do this is never explained . They come up with a funny scenario of where Deacons been ( since he did n't die after all ) . And they are forced to live together while they try to figure a way out of her lies ( sorry , no funny or cute scenes here either ) . All the while , both keep saying and thinking that Deacon is going to leave again , he ca n't stay . Yet half way through the book , Rhea decides the only way out of their problem is to legally marry in secret . It did n't make sense . Since nobody but them knew the marriage was fake , what exactly would secretly marrying for real solve ? ? ? The Judge she contacts to to secretly marry them , is a & # 34 ; family friend & # 34 ; but then she finds out about a family secret from many years ago . Who cares ? I felt like the better half of this book was missing altogether ( maybe it was in book 1 ? ) , and what was left was just a giant mess.Happy it was free ... .even happier that I can delete it from my kindle .	-1
I will admit that I only read the blurb and did n't realize that this was a paranormal and # 2 in a series , otherwise I might have passed . Anyway , it started off pretty good and then it just got tiresome . Did n't like the heroine at all . She was stupid and whiny . Deacon had the makings of a good hero and I did n't get the attraction . Maybe if I had read the first one ... Just did n't care enough about either one of these people to finish the story . Got it for free but do n't think I would have finished it if I had paid for it . It 's always disappointing to have a book start off intriguing and then have it fizzle .	-1
This book was so slow to start that it just did n't grab me and make me have any desire to continue to read just to get to any good part .	-1
Normally , I do n't give up on a book unless it 's really really irksome , it 's probably something to do with the whole , I paid money so I 'm gon na finish it thing . I tried , I really did but Imogen is just such a whiney teenager , I just could n't continue . The premise sounded interesting , I 'm a fan of zombie stories so , what went wrong ? The truth is , I 'm not sure . I just did n't like Imogen enough to care one way or the other what happened to her . The whole 'becoming ' bit of the story where we are introduced to the zombies was flawed ... a high wind ... really ? Let along one that could knock down a building and trap a load of teenage trekkers inside . Imogen is cruel , annoying and frankly not worth the paper she 's printed on . I hated the terrible grammar , the worse writing style and the inconsistent tempo of the story.Give it a miss . I have no idea where all the 5 star reviews are coming from , but I just could n't see what they were talking about .	-1
Great story . Excellent character development . But , poorly executed writing . If the author has no respect for the reader , why should the reader bother ? There are simply too many other authors and books .	-1
I did not like the storyline or the characters in the book . It was a book of misfits and losers . Even though I like it when private detectives have flaws in the books that I read , I found it hard to stomach Ridley flaws which is his personality , and how he ca n't resist his ex high school sweetheart . Other reviews call this book a mystery- but I did not see any clever detective work by Ridley or surprises in the book .	-1
I gave it two stars because I did finish the book but the storyline was poor . I 'm only glad it was a free book so all I wasted was my time .	-1
Short stories started off okay but the middle must have been left out leading to a dead ending . Read the whole book in . Half an hour , that 's what I call short stories . Sorry do n't waste you money . Or time !	-1
It seemed like an interesting plot concept from the blurb . I 'm not really a romance reader , but I thought , `` It was free , what the heck . `` I started skim reading after a while , and did n't finish the book . The whole `` he/she loves me/loves me not '' thing got kind of old after a while . And in spite of the male lead supposedly being `` gentle '' , he sure does manhandle the female lead an awful lot , i.e . `` throwing her over his shoulder '' , restraining her hands , etc. , which I found I did n't like .	-1
its okay but it was a short story should have known It was also going by to fast I mean come one after of few day your already in love I mean I can understand that sometime but not this one	-1
I keep kicking myself . I said before that I would n't buy ANY more books that have all positive reviews from people who have less than 5 reviews to their names . These are the type of people who write reviews for their friends just to pad the book with praise . All the while lying and deceiving unsuspecting potential buyers.This book is stone cold BORING and crappy . The sample was interesting but then once Emma 's father came and they were all `` snowed in '' at the house it just went downhill and boring . Do NOT buy this book ! OR any other books with deceiving , lying reviewers who JUST sign it one write ONE book review.One review and a glowing positive review ? People read more than one book . If they were a real reviewer they 'd review more . Then you ca n't believe people who DO review a lot because there are people who are paid to review tons of books and give them 5 stars . Look at a person 's review history and if they have an unbiased , honest count of 1-5 stars then that person is legit.Another factor ? If they author is from say Texas and ALL the reviewers are from Texas those are the author 's friends . That 's a big duh ! As , a Texan , I can honestly say I do n't know this author and despite being from the same state I 'm not going to lie and say this book was great when it was n't . It was truly boring and it 's sad and a shame how people deceive and lie over freaking book reviews.ALL 5 star reviews ? No one is that chipper and positive about EVERYTHING they read .	-1
I really like this author . I have read all of her books . And loved them all . This one was very juvenile and boring . I read half of it and then skipped to the end because I could n't continue reading it . Read her other books.mthey are much better !	-1
I had this book on loan and could n't finish it . Its not well written or edited . Its very choppy and had to follow . I read a lot of indie authors and this is the worst yet . I can get over misspellings or typos , but this was hard to follow . The characters talk very formal . I would n't expect a typical 18 or 19 year old to talk like their from the 19th century .	-1
I just could not get into this book . The premise is shaky , and the charachters seemed forced . If you have other books to read , read them !	-1
I acknowledge that I know little of Buddhist traditions , outside of a common American 's awareness of zen . The author 's perspective , though , was not at all what I associate with Buddhism and I found it completely unappealing -- life is awful , it always has been awful , and even if we make progress in reincarnation it will still be awful , but he knows the One True Way out of the mess . I made it about 40 % through , giving it the college try , but just found it too unpleasant .	-1
Stupidest book ever . Even free is over priced . The premise was interesting , but the stories were pointless . I 'm still in shock . I can not believe that this book has such a high rating , must be family and friends writing reviews .	-1
Twists on fairy tales have been really hot for the past few years and these two short stories ( setting up what looks like a longer series ) are firmly in that camp . While the stories go along at a really fast rate and the reader is swept along , they are n't all that fulfilling . Part of that is the main character , Veronica Grim . She 's a perfect cypher -- no flaws , no worries , no problems . Making her a bit more human ( although she may not be human -- I do n't know ) would have made these two tales a much more engaging introduction . Reading about a fairy tale Superwoman is n't all that fun . The other issue is with the world -- it 's unclear if the characters know they are fairy tales or what the rules of their world actually are.It 's possible that both of these issues are dealt with in a satisfactory way in the longer works in this series , but based on this intro I do n't have much motivation to keep reading .	-1
I was given a complimentary copy for review . The premise itself is quite good . Mild mannered Bob loses his job and goes on a killing spree . The author did have some good ideas , however those ideas just did n't come together very well .	-1
I was given a free copy of this book to review . This story premise sounds interesting but then you start reading this book . I had to force myself to keep reading and was sorry I did . The book was written in an unorganzied manner with grammatical errors throughout . The sentences were choppy and it was a chore to finish this book . Big spoiler alert ahead ! The main character is one person in the beginning of the story , loses his mind and starts killing and eating people , and then becomes a organized predator ? Really ? Need I say more ? Eating people and feeding meat pies to people ? I 'm going to take my mother 's advice and stop writing since I ca n't think of anything nice to write .	-1
The writing seemed amateurish and repetitive in several places . Lots of blood and Gore . Also contained cannibalism . Did not enjoy .	-1
When the authors prologue is littered with grammatical errors should you carry on reading ? ( `` like what I did '' no exclamation mark to show a joke - this is not ME its the author ! ) but woe is me I did as this author came highly recommended.The Pilot : Unbelievable from he first sentence ; if eyesight is not good enough for flying F16s why would a commercial airline take you on ? ! I got the right hump with the comment about Nurses not knowing what to do with a sick person er , Hello ! what do you think Nurses do for a living ! do your research ! The gore is so over done compared to all the other aspects of the story , its like the author wrote this little bit and just randomly slotted it in . Where is the air marshal ? surely the impact of crashing would have broken all the zombies ? great idea , badly executed.The Boy : more plot holes - if you go on holiday why would you leave food in your fridge ? how did he get back to the house ? out of the harbor ? some bits were good , the emotional aspect was quite haunting.The Fry Cook : the best little story yet ! engaging and with no errors ! The Inmate : really great start , you watch as a serial killer is made - then it all goes to poop . How/why did the locks open ? convenient plot twist that just dies a death.The Subway Passenger : I gave up at this point.The author had a great idea giving you little glimpses of the people mentioned in his main book ( which I now have NO intention of ever reading or wasting my money on ) , but failed to research anything ! plus the writing and grammar were awful .	-1
Once again I have to state this , I really do n't usually read anthologies or collections of short stories . But this one was free and it was about zombies , so I gave it a shot . ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***So I 'll just mention these stories and be brief about them.The Pilot - It was okay , it gives the perspective of a pilot whose plane is under attack by zombies during a zombie apocalypse . I do have to wonder , if he ca n't fly a military jet due to his failing eye sight . Why would anyone let him pilot a commercial jet ? The Boy - Okay so the guy makes it home and he hears something upstairs in the bathroom and when he opens the door he sees something so horrifying , so terrifying that he flees from the house in terror . Okay so what did he see ? Look , there are very few writers that can leave an ending open like that and have our imaginations do a better job than the writer ever could . Poe and Lovecraft are the only two that spring to mind . And this author is certainly not on their level.The Fry Cook - This was an awesome story ! Anyone who has worked in fast food or at a minimum wage job will love this story and be able to relate to these characters ! The Inmate - It had an awesome story about a serial killer and the zombies do n't show up until the very end , but honestly this story was good without them in it . Really it should n't be in this book since it has very little to do with zombies.The Subway Passenger - This was just lame . It makes you realize that the people who are on public transportation with you on your morning commute are just as boring and stupid as you think they are.The Sniper - Was a good story about a woman sniper who is stuck on a roof during the zombie apocalypse . It had very little to do with zombies , and more about a woman contemplating the mistakes she made in her life . ***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS*** ***END SPOILERS***If you 're really looking for zombie literature , you are n't missing anything great if you pass it by . But if you 're bored , it 's worth a read .	-1
I downloaded this book with high hopes , and was immensely disappointed . I was shocked that such a well liked author would have such child like mistakes ! Example a county is NOT called a county in Louisiana..it is a Parrish ! A tiny bit of research or a good editor would have caught that . This in itself would n't have stopped my enjoyment had more and more mistakes not been evident . I highly recommend an editor , or a reaserch assistant .	-1
I would call this a quickie . Quick to sex , quick to realize not much story , quick to find characters of limited descriptions . Just an easy uncomplicated quick read .	-1
I guess this was ment more for teenagers , cause I just did not get it . I was written for the younger crowd .	-1
i didnt even finish reading this book . i hated the fact that it is written in one person . i would not read books like that , instead of saving & # 34 ; me & # 34 ; or 'I & # 34 ; that person would say her name ugh	-1
It was n't that interesting . Not my kind of book it had supernatural stuff but it was boring . Not gon na try reading book two	-1
You lost me as a reader when you started calling vampire memory/mind tricks , `` Glamours '' . Really ? I did n't finish the story .	-1
I had high hopes for this when I started it but I have to say that this must be the worse vampires ever . No strength , speed or other powers except mind tricks . The story line gets even harder to believe when races that are suppose to be extinct all happen to be at this school.It is a different take on the vampire story but not one for me .	-1
After reading the first book in the series Branded , I was anticipating another winner . This one is really just ok . It deals with a very hard issue domestic violence . I just have a hard time accepting people meet for the first time , sleep together and are the ones for each other . There is a tease at the end regarding Emma Chisholm that will make me get the next in series .	-1
I have n't read the other books in the series , but there is nothing here to make me feel as though I 'm missing out on much . Puck and Ash are sworn enemies who decide to travel together and collaborate on a quest . Puck calls Ash `` Ice Boy '' about fifteen times per page . In my experience , a derisive nickname has more power if it is n't used constantly , but Puck does n't seem to share that opinion . Ash has promised a favor to a faerie queen , which involves using glamour to trick another faerie queen.If you are a fan of the faerie sub-genre , this may be just the novella for you . For me , after reading a handful of books , I 'm starting to think that I 'm the one who does n't get it . They 're beautiful , often selfish , adhere to a different moral code than humans , and tricky . Their powers are vague - it seems like that in faerie books , they possess whatever powers are necessary to drive the story forward .	-1
Loaded with sex , stupid plot . I would not recommend this book to anyone . Not much more I can say , but have to put a minium of words on my reviews	-1
Awful . If I could give it a lesser rating , I would . Definitely shallow . No depth within the story . In one word , Macabre !	-1
Hmm , just when I thought this story could n't get more disturbing , it did . Meant to be a darkly humorous piece , I felt the writing was quite good , but the content was more than I could take . Th whole book is written as a first person narrative , the thoughts and feelings of a stalker who has moved into the home of his obsession . He lives for months , Niven in the shadows of the home , never discovered . Eventually his obsession changes focus , leading to a bizarre ending . It made me quite uncomfortable .	-1
It did not go deep enough other than the fact a crazy guy hides in the closet . Wish it made more sense .	-1
This is a very short story . The subject matter is very dark and perhaps if it were written better , it might actually make more sense . I 'm giving this 1 star because the writer does n't do a very good job of telling this story . ***Spoiler Alert***This story is dark ~ VERY DARK ~ stalking ~ raping ~ murdering ~ perhaps not in that order , but that 's pretty much the whole story from the stalker/rapist/murders perspective and how he justifies his actions . Even though I disliked the story , the poor review is based upon the writers ability to write . It felt like the writer chose this topic for shock value . Nothing more .	-1
Baffling would better describe my overall impression upon completion.Would have been a great novel if characters were more developed . A few MISSING words but not as bad as most I 've read .	-1
Not interesting , poorly written . Laborious - not a good read . Hard to get into and stay focussed . Not recommending this author . Not a good buy	-1
i felt that this book was very hard to get invested into it wasnt very engaging i thought it was too boring and i just couldnt do it good thing it was free because i just simply did not like it at all	-1
A fast paced booklet to help you remove excess clutter from your home.The author , treating clutter as an addiction , jumps right to the point , and identifying 7 main kinds of clutter personalities . Included are labels like the Paper Pusher , Decor Disaster Victim , and the Chronic Collector ( just like the kind they make TV shows about ) .Right away , I feel left out . Yes , I have clutter in my home that I want to get rid of , but I do n't fit into any of these categories . Feeling excluded , I continued to read the book to see if there was any useful tips I might be able to incorporate into my life.After reviewing reasons why we collect clutter and some reasons for avoiding an excess of stuff , the author examines several areas of the home and how to purge them of unnecessary things . For me , the last chapter of the book , How to Maintain a Clutter-Free Home , was the most ( possibly only ) useful part of the book . But again , the tips are quite obvious and difficult to incorporate into one 's routine without external motivation.All in all , I was n't very impressed with this booklet . The book has a very narrow focus on certain kinds of clutter and is difficult to apply on a more general scale . I 'm glad it was a quick reed . I would have loved some hints on how to de-clutter my email inbox .	-1
This had the makings of a really great read , however the obsessive , and controlling , behaviour of the husband was a real turn off . .it 's nice to have someone love you , but when they dictate your moves , nah . ... .love this author . .but . ..	-1
This is a poorly written series , just as an example in one of the books a human police officer -male- continuously calls his shifter- female- lover mija ! ! I speak Spanish and NEVER would a man call his lover mija- it is a contraction of mi hija and means my sister-ew , just ew ! ! ! Also a pet peeve of mine is over bearing men and subservient females , especially when it borderlines on BDSM , not my personal cup of tea , just to forewarn others ! ! The books-of which I have read 3- are all pretty much the same plot over and over , some one is out to get one of them , especially one of the women , and they are kidnapped and the men ride in to save to day ... dundundun ... boring . I ordered the 3 books on my kindle and did something I have never done before and deleted all three of them ... no more Jennifer Ashley for me ! ! !	-1
There was simply too much in such a short story ! It 's called '1 Night Stand Series ' and I would accept it as a story about one night of sex , no strings attached , goodbye lover in the morning . I would even accept , that they decided to meet again . But adding all this eternal love and sharing lives after one night of kinky sex - that 's definitely too much . Plus , I found those sex scenes quite boring and not really sexy . I ca n't recommend this one .	-1
Felt like I was reading a guidance book or something like that.Most of the conversations were self help kind of guidance .	-1
I did n't really like this free short story that because it was basically about a gay guy sleeping with whomever he wanted , whenever he wanted , however he wanted . He got this new confidence in himself and acted older than he really was to get whatever guy he wanted . Male slut pretty much . It was written well enough so I continued reading on.Joey was a gay man looking for his next hook up . He finally sleeps with his dream male but then he finds out he was still in love with his ex-boyfriend . Joey could see the love in his eyes and decided to find his ex and hook them back up together . After doing that he then found someone for himself who was more than just sex . He found someone that he was actually falling for . For him it was normally - meet up with a guy , have sex with him , find someone next . But with this new guy he wanted to get to know him and actually cared to find out what his interests were.It was very sweet in the end and the ending was the best . Love is everywhere no matter how much you ignore it . I would recommend to anyone looking for gay male who goes through an epiphany . Lol	-1
I like a good horror read as much as the next guy . But `` Birds of Prey '' is so violent , just for the sake of being violent , that it should be called horror porn . And the story set-up ? Please ! These are not pretty characters . They exist solely to allow the author to write of more violence , guts , and gore . I have liked some of the author 's works in the past . But this one is pretty much worthless . Ca n't recommend it .	-1
I 'd probably have to more into the genre to enjoy a bit more . There were some hints at a storyline showing up , not my thing . Maybe I would have watched the cartoon	-1
It was not bad . It was too short of story . Best for children but not one I will keep reading .	-1
Ok this is manga and I know they do things differently then we do in the US ( yes I do know what about manga was my favorite when I was younger ) but come on Amazon you pick only a handful of manga to have on hand and tou choose this ! Why ? It just is weird and I wish I could get this story out of my head .	-1
This book was n't really good at all . As others have mentioned in their reviews , the story and main characters were very anti-religion . I 'm all for that but I really thought that the premise of the book was a more realistic viewpoint of a post-apoc situation where the population was much smaller . Towards the end of the book the story became very narrow and concentrated a lot of religious fanatics . I think the story lost its purpose if it ever had one to begin with . The environment was ready for the taking in terms of something interesting to be written about the peoples ' situation but instead it turned into something very disappointing .	-1
This book is a very long lecture on the evils of Republican Christian gun toting meat eating humans . It started off with how bad humans were and how good the earth would have it now because all the humans were dead . Now the world can go back to normal . Then the author introduced two Christian characters that were written so evil or stupid that the reader wants them dead . I love that the life long heroin addict is a better human than the christian leader . I thought that the sequences written through the eyes of the dog were innovative and well done until they also became lectures on the evils of humankind . Oh and then we get to hear about how bad it is to eat meat and that Republicans are human rats . That the only way that religious leaders can keep their flocks is by drugging them . The author even found a way to teach us that monogamy was not necessarily the best way to live . Give it a rest already . The author is certainly a talented story teller , I just got tired of being repeatedly bludgeoned by his prejudices . I guess all philosophy IS biography .	-1
I knew this was short , but if it had a good story , I might have liked it . There was nothing I liked about it .	-1
It 's that painful ! Yes , the other reviews are right . Poor spelling , awful metaphors , and grammatical issues abound . Aside from that , which really just means you ca n't take the darn thing seriously in the first place , I could n't give a flip about the characters or what happens . The plot is ridiculous and the twists are more so , but the characters are so showy to start with . Self described Wall Street bigshot , look at the fancy lawyer we know , my best friend owns the best boutique and a Porsche ... ok , you 've earned zero sympathy . My husband died and I 'm gon na go out to lunch with my pals . Ok ... I find out my BFF did something horrible , because I 've become such a genius detective , yet just let them stay in my house for a while before randomly confronting her . Simple minds ...	-1
I was given a free copy of Oil and Corruption for a review.The book was not very funny or suspenseful . It just rambled on with cardboard characters and never developed a rhythm or flow that the best books and authors fall into.If it sounds good to you , I think you can take a chance on it . It just was n't for me .	-1
So maybe , just maybe it got better , but it was just too painful to read any more than I did ! ! I 'm just happy it was a freebie on Kindle , at least ! The premise of the story actually interests me ; it sounded like a good set up for a mystery . I love a 40 yo tough heroine , but the characters were just so one-dimensional and trite - and irritating . And the belabored lusting for her assistant was annoying more than anything . Comparisons to Janet Evanovich just seem insulting to me ! Oh , and the crazy police officer determined to accuse her for the crime was ridiculous ! I freely admit that I did n't finish it , so maybe it got better , but I put enough time into it to know I just did n't care in the least what happened to these people . The bottom line of that is that I kept reading on for as long as I could take it , but then gave up - and I have to tell you that for me to not finish a book is extremely , extremely rare ! ! I ca n't remember the last time I could n't bear to read another line ... For some context , if it helps , probably my favorite mysteries are Sue Grafton 's Kinsey series .	-1
I think the plot is great but the profanity was a little more than I could take . I know this does n't bother some people but for those like me ...	-1
Never read the whole book about twenty pages was enough trash talking for me . I think it might have been a good story otherwise but will never know for sure due to language	-1
All she does is drool over the guy working for her , and not smart enough to ask for ID . She should just pick up coffee , she might get that right . I gave up on this mess .	-1
I liked this book but she spent to much time talking about nothing . There were a few laughs but not many but I did not figure out the killer . I did skip pages just bc it was talking about nothing interesting . This book has a lot of potential though . Just was not what I was looking for though .	-1
Well I finished it ( I mean it is only like 70 pages ) so I did n't hate it but this story was very meh for me . Nothing really happened short of sex and a random plot device to give the story depth . Rylee and Atticus both struck me as unbelievable . I do n't like stories where the heroine feels `` lucky '' to be with a rich and handsome man . I do n't like stories where the character is `` old '' ( the guy is 900 with a lifespan of about 3000 ) and they do n't act it . This story would have fit better as a mid series short story rather than an opening book.Edited to add that at the current price of $ 4.31 ... waaaaaaaaaaay over priced .	-1
If I was a sci-fi buff I may feel differently about this book . I do n't mind a little but there was something really wrong with this story that I can not out my finger on . I quit the book 25 % through it was just plain annoying and wasting my time .	-1
This book was beyond depressing . The author does n't think much of our future . I actually felt sick when I finished it . A little to hopeless and dark for me . Now I 'm going to go throw up ...	-1
I do n't understand all the reviews saying this book is funny and hilarious . This is a travelacount of a couple of people who do visit some important museums and old buildings during their stay in Europe and try out the local food , but beside that seem to have been stumbling around with their eyes closed , not gaining anything of the spirit , atmosphere or heart of the places they visited.If you think it is funny when a couple complains about people not being silent in the Sistene Chapel in the Vatican because [ quote from their book : ] 'We were told repeatedly that there was to be no talking and no photography in the Chapel , as it is a very holy place ' [ end of quote ] and then make a photo of themselves inside the Sistene Chapel , which is ok according to them because [ qoute : ] 'We were respectful ! ' [ end of quote ] , than you should get this book . If you do n't think this is funny , but just shows arrogance and insolence than do n't get this book.This book will not teach you much about London , Paris or Rome . The couple only vistit the standard tourist sightseeing places and give their personal opinion about it . There are no useful traveltips in this book . It is 2233 locations long , which means you 'll be able to finish reading this book in under 2 hours . There are over 50 pictures in this book , most show the authors standing in front of a building or inside a museum . I 'm a bit astonished by the reflection of the author at the end of the book that this trip had not broadened his mind ; I find it astounding that people can travel halfway across the world and not absorb enough vision to gain a broader insight.Reading the other reviews of this book shows that there are people who think this is a funny book , but I found it to be unappealing and not interesting ; I do not recommend this book .	-1
I read the first third and it was rough and slow reading . Then I took a break to read several other books . I came back to this book , night after night , and would read a few pages and just give up and pick another book to read . At the end of each book , I tried to read this one again.Mason is tortured by his belief that he is Arion , by his belief that Holly wo n't love him if she knows ( something ) , by his belief that Holly needs to love him of her own free will without knowing that he has Mated her as an Arion . There were several times that I was disgusted that this educated and seemingly strong woman would just knuckle under to Mason 's orders , particularly when it related to matters of trust - hers for him or his for her . He would basically say , `` No , we 're not going to talk about it , we 're going to screw instead . '' I paraphrased , of course , but it was pretty much the same result every time . She would want to discuss whatever he was keeping from her , and he would insist on having sex instead . And she would give in . Again.The sex scenes were blah , and it seemed more like some chemical reaction that made them need to rut constantly than a passionate need to touch each other . I get being in love and this was n't it for me.I got to 83 % and finally decided in the middle of a paragraph that I really just did n't care what happened to any of the characters or care how the book ended or care that I was leaving a book unfinished . I just felt relieved to be done . I skimmed through the rest of the book , and what few things caught my eye were more tortured Mason , tell instead of show about the Arions , and Holly being overpowered by Mason yet again to have sex . She 's crying desperately over something and two paragraphs later , she 's screaming in ecstasy . Oooookaaay.So , your mileage may vary , and it was definitely not one I enjoyed .	-1
This is by now a familiar trope - charming werewolf Scott meets an unsuitable ( i.e . male ) mate , Ted , an ex-cop who at least knows he is gay ... what can happen next ? I read it for a bit , and then put it down , and then read some more and then put it down.. it 's too predictable and too generic for me . I 've read this story already and this version adds nothing new to the mix . The fact that I did n't finish it means it does n't get 3 stars . It 's not particularly badly written ( nor especially well written ) and if I had never read a gay were story before , I might have enjoyed it more . I usually highlight sentences as I go along , a good book gets about 6 , an exceptional one gets about 9 . I highlighted 2 sentences here , it just did n't sing to me .	-1
I was ok with some of this author 's advice . He talks about giving away or selling everything you have , etc . Then I read more than half the book before he tells his readers he is 25 years old . The guy is not married and has no kids . No wonder he can give or sell everything . Anyone can do what he wants you to do when you are 25 . Some of his advice is just not realistic .	-1
The story might have been good if every second or third page had n't been missing ! It was so frustrating to be reading a page , turn to the next and it begins in the middle of a paragraph not related to the previous page . I feel like I just threw away my money and I do n't have money to do that with ! There were so many positive reviews that I thought I would be getting a good solid story , instead I got a Hodge-podge of pages most of which did n't follow each other .	-1
I think I would have appreciated this more had it been one of a variety of stories in one book instead of a stand-alone that was too short ( read it in 10 minutes ) with no real point to it .	-1
I deleted this after a couple of pages . just was n't for me . probably fine for others , but this just did n't hold any interest .	-1
I stopped reading after the 4th tale when I noticed that the main characters all seem to be the same woman with long black hair . ( And I 'm guessing here but I think the author uses herself as the inspiration for these characters since at least one of the names starts with her first initial and uses a last name very close to her own . ) The writing has a monotonous tone and when each story read the same as the last , I got bored . If you 're looking for originality and something to keep you on the edge ... move on . You wo n't find it here .	-1
I think I am in the same boat as most of the other reviewers here . The recipes really lacked creativity in my book . I guess , in a sense the author did deliver on the promise of meals that were fast and easy to make but adding canned soup to recipes really does n't cut it in my book . And that does n't mean that I am not into semi-homemade dishes . Those are some of the best dishes that I make for my family sometimes . But the lack of creativity and complexity in the recipes is what really disappointed me .	-1
While it was very well written , there were the occasional spelling mistakes . However , the reason I am giving it a low review is because it should have a warning . Spoiler Alert ! There is a very graphic rape scene , as well as very graphic memories of childhood sexual abuse . Also fantasies of extreme violence and memories of animal torture . Author went for the extreme shock value .	-1
This book feels like a complete let down . Both stories start with so much promise but end abruptly ... as if the writer could n't come up with an appropriate ending or simply could n't figure out where he was going with the stories and decided to just cut them off . In the first story , IF YOU GO INTO THE WOODS , showed real promise for having some kind of horrifying or terrifying end but simply fizzles . And the second story ? Well , there is nothing terrifying , horrifying or even remotely disturbing about it and it too ends without much of an ending . This book was like a balloon with a slow leak ... no exciting 'POP ' to it .	-1
What 's up with all the glowing reviews for this pair of short stories ? After reading them both , I 'm sitting here completely bored to tears . Neither story had a modicum of character development ; you get flat , single dimensional characters from start to finish . The writing was clipped and the paragraphs read like the musings of a junior high schooler . Amateurish at best . What 's good about both stories ? ... they 're short , so the boredom is over quickly .	-1
ETA 1-8-13As promised the author sent me a PDF of this short story to read . It was much more readable than the Kindle version but was formatted in a peculiar way that was harder to read than necessary . For one thing , paragraphs were indented and there was no blank line between them , and for whatever reason , the dialogue of the AI was italicized.The story has promise , but a lot of the assertions it makes left me shaking my head . For one thing , I never really believed one guy could run a ship of this size . I do n't care what kind of genius he is , there just is only so much time in a day.I also had issues with the time scale . This huge cargo ship the main character was operating was able to make a rescue run to another ship in almost no time . Just is not going to happen.I did not believe that some very minor patches was all it was going to take to get the rescued ship functioning again either.I would just get rid of the alien . Just did not like that at all . Did not like the goofy religious overtones at the end either.So , while I read the whole thing , and thought parts of it had promise , overall , I gave it 2 stars.Having said that , it does have a pretty decent amount of creativity and a potentially good story line.This is my original review.Original title : gave up due to formatting issuesAn interesting premise for a short story I got for free recently.The part I read had promise but the formatting errors I kept running across made it hard for me to follow the story . Periodically sections of the text would just be missing . I do n't know how much was missing but it was so annoying to me that I just quit on the book . A book I quit on gets 1 star from me .	-1
At some point I became interested in Alice 's future with her love interests so I bought book two . Unfortunately Alice seems to enjoy loving everyone who smiles at her . Once more `` love '' interests were added I kinda lost interest . I barely understood why she had two but adding a 3rd and possibly 4th..kinda ridiculous . If the wind blows too hard she 'll fall in love with it . The book was too busy with it 's overly winding plot .	-1
The obvious comparison : Arys ' being the most powerful vamp in the city , thanks to the boost in his psychic power , due to Alexa ; the `` homebody '' wolf-lover , Ajax ( granted , he is a wolf ) , and the evolution and growing power of both Arys and Alexa . Oh , and the constant sexual tension and growing cadre of lovers , all of whom she absolutely loves.Yes , Anita is human ( mostly ) and Alexa is , well , half human , half wolf , half vampire , and something else ... and mope-y and weak , too . Anita would have Alexa begging on her knees with a flick of her wrist , then take out all of the supposed bad-assets who would normally save Alexis with her other hand and , maybe , an eyebrow twitch.It is too bad that this book is so wordy and boring , with such a weak main character . I have given Trina Lee two opportunities to win me over ( the first and second books of the series , both of which I got as free downloads - boy , would I have been royally PO 'd if I had actually had to buy them . Sorry , Ms Lee , I am throwing in the towel . I ca n't even pretend to be interested in reading any more of this trite , wordy , unnecessarily and overly descriptive story .	-1
I read the first book in this series and thought okay I 'll give the second book a chance . I did n't care for the first book but I finished it which says a lot for me when I do n't care for a book . I did n't like the main female character at all . I liked the two male characters so that is why I gave book two a chance . No more for me .	-1
The first part of the book was n't too bad . However , the second half was boring . Too much sex and no real story . Disappointing .	-1
This was really bad , so bad I made it to 59 % and stopped in disgust . The tone of the book is juvenile , the characters are extremely childish , they giggle and carry on . The story is not historically accurate for the time , they spend way too much time alone with no chaperones . The plot is weak , a house party , thats it . The dialogue is even childish right from the beginning when the hero 's brother is dying . It is , supposed to be sad but it is so overdone and cheesy , it is what a 14 year old would think is dramatic . Poppy comes off as a flighty ninny , all her friends too . They are yappy . Declan is just kind of sleezy going after the young sister of his best friend , sneaking into her room the first night he meets her.At 59 % the house party is having a play put on by the girls , pages of bad acting that is supposed to be funny . ( Again , juvenile humor level ) Then poppy meets declan in the library where they kiss and makeout , then it goes into detail how he goes back to his room and masturbates while thinking of her.hey I know thats human nature , but the tone of the book is very childish and then it gets graphic and trashy.Not enough depth or talent to make this worthwhile , even for free .	-1
Yes even though this was a super short story I simply could not finish it . I did not find it erotic at all and found it actually very boring and geared more towards a younger adult audience , the verbiage was just not my style and found it immature . Really wished I would have liked it but I did not !	-1
I wish it would be clear about the fact it 's a chapter and the full book is $ 3.99 . Or label it as a trailer , teaser or what ever . Not to be mistaken as a real book	-1
If all you want is Hott sex then this is your book it 's got one sex scene but its hot and it has no story line at all no wonder its free	-1
Good but short . I 'm not clear if this a series or what . I liked the characters n enjoyed the story . It stopped just as it was getting really good	-1
I saw this was a freebie and decided that since I 'm loosing nothing I 'd go for it . Despite having paid nothing for it I still feel like I 've lost something in this deal , maybe the 15 mins it took to read this were more valuable then i first though . Anyway , I found this repetitive and boring to , and if that was n't enough there were numerous grammatical errors and typos that made my eye twitch .	-1
Very short stupid story . Then a preview of another story . I wanted my time back from downloading and reading this .	-1
There is just too much of everything in this book ... .too many times hitting her head , too much dialogue , too sappy , too discriptive , too many killers ... .ug . I would pick it up and then put it down , frankly watching the grass grow is more interesting than this book . Maybe the author just has not found her stride ... .but then I do n't know if she ever will because I do not plan to buy the sequel .	-1
So did reading this book , I guess I just do n't like common & # 34 ; romance & # 34 ; . Too long spent on describing love scenes and the scenery .	-1
I finished reading this book just 2 days ago . I can barely remember it and that is n't normal for me . I remember that the main vampire character is cured of his vampirism after 10 years , pretends to be his cousin so he can finish school . And , I have a vague sense of disgust looking at the cover . This is another book that I 'm glad I did n't pay for .	-1
Just in the first 10 % of this book there 's just way too much going on . I really lost interest in this very quickly . I thought it was really odd that the writer said `` God '' gave her the idea for this vampire book . Strange .	-1
Did not like the beginning of the book . The story was a better as you read it . Did not really like this book . Did not like the way the story was written .	-1
AAAGGGHHH . I 'm giving up after the first few pages . This book is impossible to get through - sounds like it was written by a high school student who has n't quite learned basic sentence structure and proper use of tense , but imagines he himself to be literate . In addition to incorrect tense , puncutation , grammar and verb form , the vocabulary and basic writing is juvenile.A few examples : '' He looked across at the other three mean , making sure they were ready , they all looked at him in readiness . `` `` ... but also any human who took the law into THEIR own hands '' '' Thousands of people go missing every year , many are never found , the Church always suspected that many were turned , but could not prove it or perhaps did n't want to . `` Do n't have time for more examples - have to run and DELETE this from my Kindle . Thanks goodness this was free .	-1
There are so many issues with this book that a list is the easiest way to point them out . Spoiler alert for anyone that has n't bought it , but I highly recommend you don't.The main character simply makes no sense . A warrior priest that is also married with a family shoots his way through most nights fighting Vampires . His family is killed in front of him , his church burned down and he is shot many times , left for dead . Within a week , he is back on his feet , showing no emotion at the death of those he loved and flirting with a beautiful `` good '' vampire . His dialogue is stilted and flat , moralizing and constantly shouting . Innocents get killed all around him and he shows not the least bit of emotional response.Every other character shows similar lack of emotion . A cop 's partner is shot in the head right next to him , and the man is at work the next day , casually mentioning the funeral is a few days away . The reader is never told the reason for the Bishop or his secretary 's actions.The action makes no sense . Casinos catering to rich , powerful people are guarded by less than 12 people , easily dispatched by the protagonist . The arch-villian vampire 's den is just as easily penetrated with few security measures . The protagonist takes an M4 round in the chest from less than 20 feet and his bullet proof vest shrugs it off , allowing him to continue to fight with no effect ( this is impossible , by the way ) . When our hero is wounded through his unprotected arm , he cheerfully goes about the next 4 hours or so with little effect . This is Hollywood at it 's worst , an early Stallone movie where the bad guys expend millions of rounds while the hero fights on , picking them off with a gunshot wound to the shoulder that does n't seem to bleed.There was potential here for character development , but the author never pursues any . Why does the beautiful `` good '' vampire act as she does ? Are there others like her ? When does she feed ? Where did she get her weapons training ? When did Bill the protagonist warrior priest get his considerable weapons training ? I understand this is the first book of a series and I usually give some leeway for a starter , hoping the other books would fill in the blanks . However , the flaws I 've pointed out are just the beginning of a much larger list . I wo n't be picking up the other books , nor can I recommend this one . By the end , I just did n't care about any of the characters nor was I satisfied about the too-predictable ending . `` Punisher '' comic books are better written .	-1
First of all , I must say that I got this book for free from BookRooster.com.The main part of this story takes place in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada , where a prominent politician has been found murdered , and another comes up missing . Three members of the CFBI 's PSI department -- agents with psychic abilities -- are on the case.This murder case , dubbed `` The Parliament Murders , '' is bracketed by the story of one of the agents being in a coma in the hospital some time after the main events of the book . The story of the Parliament Murders is being told through her dreaming/reliving during her coma . ( There is no way of knowing how her subconscious could know things that happened when she was n't present . Just one of many plot weaknesses . ) About a quarter of the way through the book I thought `` This sounds like The Manchurian Candidate . I bet these guys are being brainwashed . '' Around the half-way mark I figured out who the bad guy was . I was really hoping I was wrong , but , no . I was absolutely correct . Disappointing.I did n't buy the `` story within a story '' construct in this book . The coma and events immediately after the main character wakes up seemed completely superfluous . The main story could have easily , and less confusingly , been told on its own . As this was the second book in a series , perhaps the first book sets up this premise in a more believable way.This book also suffered from simplistic , obvious , and repetitive dialogue . `` We have to keep looking for connections between [ the victims ] . '' They were closing in on the link between the two men . They just had to figure it out before the second was killed . Yes , yes , we got that already , we understand . Write better dialogue or stop talking . I hope that real ( C ) FBI agents do n't state the obvious so often and with such conviction.There were editing problems , both with spelling ( lose vs. loose ) , and with continuity . For example , one of the characters notices twice that there are no cars in the parking lot ; two characters power off their phones , then one uses her ( now powered ) phone to unlock a door . First someone was shot in the head , then the bullet wound is in his arm.Finally , I had to wonder if this heroine is the most stupid cop on the planet . She decided to confront the suspect with no backup and without telling anyone where she 's going , and did n't realize her mistake until she was confined with him on a yacht headed to open water ? And then she willingly drank a beverage he gave her , when his victims had all been drugged with Rohypnol ? The conversation between her and the culprit was laughable and , again , repetitive.I wanted to like this book . I did n't . If I had n't committed to finishing it in order to write the review for BookRooster.com , I would have stopped reading half way through.As a side note , the formatting was completely messed up , making it difficult to follow the flow of dialog , especially , as statements by a given character would often be split by line breaks that should n't have been there .	-1
This short story is neither scary or funny . If you 're going to attempt humor in this vein , you need a deft hand and this is n't what is shown here.Only worth the time if you feel that demons wanting frozen yogurt is a real knee-slapper .	-1
I should have paid attention to the reviewer of the first book in the series . This story is the typical `` weak human needs rescue by shifters . '' Ad infinitum . Of course the nasty boyfriend comes back and needs to be put in his place . The end . If you have n't started this series , save your money .	-1
THE HEROINE IS SO IN LOVE , THE HERO NOT SO MUCH , UNTIL MUCH , MUCH LATER , THIS TYPE OF STORY LINE IS NOT FOR ME	-1
As a fan of the Anne Perry mysteries , this one sounded promising . Unfortunately , it is beyond boring and the main character is an idiot . Do n't waste your time .	-1
Stopped reading after chapter 3 - nothing grabbed my attention . very dry and slow	-1
I opened the book on my phone and thought I would sit back and read it while my son was in the tub , unfortunately , I finished it before the bath tub was done filling.And yet , I feel as if I had not read the book at all . It was more like an intro to a bigger story that the writer does n't want to tell . And if that 's the case , why write this at all ? Other than a few minor typos , this was written fairly well , although I have read more on the back of a cereal box .	-1
I am not sure this qualifies as a story . I thought is was very short . The entire thing takes place in less than a couple of hours . I do not think it is possible to resolve this sort of life altering sitution in just a few words . This woman would not be willig to share this child . She would want to hold and protect him , not allow this stranger , who had broken her heart , barge in and share him with her . I found it poorly written and unrealistic as well as incomplete . It was more like a chapter out of the midle of a book . It was not worth my time .	-1
A man on a train complains to himself of something being wrong with people wearing labels as he checks his Rolex , puts the top back on his Mont Blanc pen , and smoothes his Saville suit trousers . He 's cynical of people , even his wife . Life catches up with him at customs .	-1
The & # 34 ; fractured fairy tale & # 34 ; is pretty well-established subgenre at this point and Lanier does n't bring anything new to it . Her heroine 's bravado comes off as totally fake and the main theme of the book is how hot the prince is . The constant reminders of how attractive he is are so blandly expressive and repetitive , especially since there does n't seem to be anything else to their relationship.Too many jokes in the series depend on the heroine 's knowledge of fairy tale characters and situations and this fatally compromises the mystery ( and makes me question her intelligence since she spends most of the story chasing down false leads ) .	-1
I downloaded `` Stain of Mind '' after reading the other reviews about this ( VERY ) short story . It sounded like the kind of story I would be interested in . I literally had to go back and make sure we were reading the same story because I just do n't feel the same way as the other reviewers do at all.Scary - I did n't feel that way . I felt more like the author tried to come up with some disturbing scenarios for his serial killer to participate in but to me they seemed contrived and wooden . There was no depth to the protaganist - NO character development.The sex scene seemed to be thrown in gratuitously and I did n't find it erotic - I found it degrading to women . Yes , this is about a serial killer but the sex scene was skewed and unnecessary , I felt.Maybe this would benefit from being longer so the author has more time to `` flesh '' out the story ( ha ha ) but I guess I 'm comparing this to Blake Crouch and J.A . Konrath in their stories about serial killers -SERIAL UNCUT , BAD GIRL , DESERT PLACES , LOCKED DOORS , andBREAK YOU . Those are some of the most disturbing stories about serial killers I 've read .	-1
The narrator begins by telling us how easy it is to get away with murder , telling us that he could be watching us right now , that he would decide when we 'd die.Okay , promising start.He then goes on to share some of the easy murders he 's committed , murders that are -- frankly -- dull . At no point does he show us how it 's `` easy '' to kill . He does n't even break into a house.The first murder is completely unrealistic . She 's kicked out of a bar for being too drunk , but she drinks more with the narrator and is able to function normally . Okay . Then he kills a priest ( we 're specifically told he is n't Catholic , but then the priest prays in Latin -- a little confusing ) because he wants to get the attention of the community . Killing a priest may be shocking , but he just walked into the open church in the middle of the night where the guy was working -- hardly a master criminal move.Then he kills a child at the zoo in a scene taken almost directly from `` American Psycho . `` He spends a lot of time bragging about how he is n't like other serial killers because he does n't leave distinctive signs behind . That actually rang true , because there was nothing distinctive about the character in this book.In the author ' material at the end , Springer says this is the first time he 's written from the killer 's POV . I would suggest going back to the drawing board before trying again .	-1
If you enjoy Carroll 's `` Stories for Demented Children '' collection ( Unholy Cow , A Story for Demented Children ( Stories for Demented Children ) , Attack of the Sugar Plum Fairies , A Story for Demented Children ( Stories for Demented Children ) Drippy the Peg Legged Rainbow , A Story for Demented Children ( Stories for Demented Children ) , etc ) then you will likely enjoy this work.It 's the story of a young boy who gets lost and enlists a zombie to help him return home . Despite the author 's warnings , there really is n't anything in this story that would be too disturbing for a child exposed to regular age-appropriate media . The warnings make me feel that he may think this stories are edgier than they are . I do n't really appreciate the humor , but I know these get glowing reviews from multiple reviews , so it 's just a case of me not meshing with this particular style.The growing friendship between the boy and the zombie made this stronger than other works in the series , but I did n't enjoy the princess subplot and would n't want necessarily want to share it with my hypothetical daughter .	-1
Over all the story line was a little too predictable and it ended rather abruptly . This is n't a terrible read but I can not recommend it either .	-1
I usually do n't write reviews but this was just necessary i do n't want anyone else to waste their time or money ! this book was just terrible ! I was disgusted and i 'm not referring to the plot or the sex scenes . i honestly like the plot and where the author was going with it . the book truly had potential but it seems just as it was getting good the author got lazy and ended it ! i originally bought the book because of the price thinking that i was getting a deal but honestly i want my money back	-1
This was probably the creepest s*** I ever read . I got ta give it up to La'Tonya West it was funny as hell	-1
I enjoyed Blue Haired Alien Girlfriend up until the very abrupt ending of the story . The problem never got solved .	-1
Reviewing the Kindle version.This is the second short story by John Carroll that I read this week . I am a big appreciator of the short story form , especially in the SciFi genre . There is an interesting concept in this story , but there is very little development . The hero 's resolution of his problem is glossed over in a sentence and what should have been the most interesting part of the story never happened . Perhaps relating his adventures was 'not his job ' ?	-1
Sorry , but this book was n't very good . The story line was predictable and the writing was similar to what a junior high student might have written.Nothing special about this book at all and I ca n't recommend it .	-1
I was looking forward to this novel and the first couple of chapters did n't disappoint , however I lost what was happening pretty rapidly . Perhaps it was my own perspective , but it seemed like it was a supernatural romance and I am not `` into '' those . The hero seemed to be one thing one moment and another the next , here one moment , somewhere else the next.A disappointment because I probably should have been able to understand what was going on , but could n't . Perhaps it 's my age ... : (	-1
Story was good , however you never really developed any feelings for Ryan the brother . He was just so cold which is the point of the story .	-1
I got this book for free and read maybe 15 pages before I got sick of it . Its bad enough that most romance books are about beautiful skinny women but do you really have to make the man think about obese twenty something women to make his d**k go soft . I just found it rude .	-1
Its a nice hot story about two hot people , wet cold and stuck in a cabin in the wilderness in bad weather . Red hot sex was the logical and predicted outcome and it was well written , but stretching it to 9 000 words was a bit long .	-1
At its core , this is a story about a one night stand in a cabin in the woods . There 's no romance , no small talk , and nothing steamy or wild in the book ( except maybe some critters that might be out in the woods ) . The author writes intelligently enough but the structure and point of view of the story make it difficult for the reader to get and stay engaged . Melody has three paragraphs and then Chris has three and then Melody again ... back and forth , and back again ... eventually , I lost track of who 's thoughts I was reading ( because there 's not a whole lot of talking ) . Maybe they were telepathic and I missed that part ? In all honesty , I was so bored with this story that I started playing with the text-to-speech feature on my Kindle and let it read the rest to me while I puttered around on the computer . I hate to not finish a book . You 're about 65 % through the story before one of them starts actually making moves on the other . Given that this is supposed to be a short , erotic story , that 's far too late . There 's a lot of narrative that they each have about how much they want the other person , what they 'd like to do , etc . I suppose this is meant to add to the erotic nature of the story , but , after 6,000+ words of wanting and fantasy , it just comes across as petulant and pedantic . Get on with it.As others mentioned , there is no discussion of protection , before or after their interlude , nor does our white knight even think about pulling out . In the end , it 's a one night stand - what does he care ? Some have mentioned rough sex , but I did n't find it all that rough or aggressive ... she makes a flirty comment , after he called her feisty , that maybe she likes it rough ... and he figures that means she 's not overly interested in foreplay and get to it ... finally . For me , the sex was n't all that hot ... it was pretty run of the mill.Usually there 's a disclaimer in the product description but since there is n't one on this book , readers be warned that the story contains anal play if that is offensive to you . Finally , a note to the author - approximately 60 % of women in America are overweight ( with 33 % classified as obese ) . While that may not be something to be proud of , it is a fact , and those women do n't want to read a story where the hero thinks of a woman who might look like they do as a means to turn himself off . You might keep that in mind for your next story.In the end , if this story were shorter or if it had more actual action , it might have been better .	-1
Could have been good , but it 's not historically accurate . Language is not right for the time , the so-called virgin was way too eager to touch him and put her mouth on him . Plot could have worked , but it 's all just too contrived . Definitely not a romance . More like someone 's fantasy with modern dialogue .	-1
This book had the promise for something better . Perhaps if it had been fleshed out instead of rushed , it could have been . The author made an attempt at creating likeable characters instead of writing out and out porn , but that attempt fell short . The characters in no way resembled people of their time . An innocent young girl in society would not have just jumped into the relationship with such wanton abandonment . Much more finesse and skill would have been necessary to get her to shed the inhibitions of her upbringing , no matter how tempted she 'd have been . There could have been much more implied sexiness in the interactions between the characters outside the studio , foreplay for the main event . As I said , it could have been good , sadly it was n't .	-1
Plot had potential but the writing was very smple . unsophisticated and slightly juvenile . i didnt get to know the characters except on the surface . i wasnt drawn into the story . the sex scenes were graphic but didnt draw me in at all .	-1
This is a sweet romance and it has some adventure . The relationships between the two hero 's are funny and rascal which was kind of comical .	-1
Bomani is presumably intended as the eventual love interest but he is abusive and hateful.Also , the use of the present tense makes the narrative awkward and uncomfortable , sometimes even difficult to properly understand .	-1
I really tried to give this book a fair shot . I did n't get hooked into the story at all . I felt like I was reading a pornographic book for most of it.It seemed the author was trying to seduce you more than tell a story . I was disappointed . The idea of the book might have been good , but the execution was horrible .	-1
The premise was good , although the choice of wording of 'vampeen ' to describe a vampire/human hybrid could have been better.I liked the beginning , but it just go so ridiculous that it was laughable.I read one review where the reviewer said that the book was the author wish fulfillment . Which I could very well see . Fat girl with no friends and who is n't popular suddenly becomes over night , drop dead gorgeous and has an amazing guy on her arm.So much of the authors lore was so confusing and muddled . Especially trying to describe the transformation . And the fact that Kellan and Lexi 's love was forever and just ... ugh . It was so nauseating . Although I did like Kellen , my favorite character would have to be Kellans father and the stylist Ryan.Such a ridiculous book , ca n't believe there are more books in the series . The whole vampire , vampeen hatred for each other made little sense.There could have been an epic battle scene with the vampire chick , but that sub-plot was so downplayed ! I did enjoy Mike 's reaction though as the crazy over protective boyfriend , it was a bit laughable because it kinda came out of no where.Lexi 's insecurities about how she was fat I found to be really annoying.This was like some fanfiction with a Mary and Gary Stu . Could have been so much better if Lexi has some flaws besides feeling insecure about her looks . The fact that she had name brand everything , and her parents were rich were unbelievable . She was n't spoiled or snooty or anything.It was far to much like Twilight . I was especially surprised at the sudden mention of God at the end . It was very out of left field , why put religion into it , when it had nothing to do with it in the first place.The characters were not very flushed out and I think with more work it could have be so much better .	-1
Hmm ... this is turning out to be a tough one to review . For starters , I somewhat liked Gina . She is a widow with three kids and works for her brother . She is attracted to Vic , though shies away from any man who 's job puts him at risk . She 's tough on the front but is struggling with the death of her husband . Her kids are her life , now , and her oldest is protective of her.But then we get to Vic . There 's something about him that just rubbed me the wrong way . He almost seems too immature . Maybe I was basing my opinion of the protective alpha male on Lori Foster 's Edge of Honor men ( I read this shortly after I finished the first three of those books ) but they just seemed so cool and collected . Vic came across like a dramatic teenager . If I read the words `` kill me now '' one more time , I was going to burn the book . Gina wants to talk about their relationship . Kill me now . Her son glares at him because he 's protective of his mother . Kill me now . He needs to have a discussion with Gina 's son . Kill me now . Gina wants to tell her how she feels . Kill . Me . Now . Ugh ! The story line had promise . The idea that Vic 's job somehow compromises the security of the ones he loves has the makings for a good plot . I just felt like the personality of the characters took away from the story . I 'm sure it 's just a matter of preference , but I think that Vic 's personality would have been better suited for a romantic comedy as opposed to romantic suspense . And I probably would have liked him better in that setting . In this book , he just annoyed me .	-1
The synopsis for the book is accurate . I liked the idea of a party theme , and the opening and 'game ' part of the book I enjoyed . But , girl on girl just does n't do anything for me.The book did say there would be group sex activities- and there was- Richard watching/directing Lauren and Lenore . Yes , Richard and Lauren together were HOT . But , the other just , nuh uh .	-1
This review is for the Kindle ebook Strong 's Greek dictionary . My critique applies equally to the Kindle Strong 's Hebrew Dictionary.As advertised the print in this ebook and the navigation features are `` superior '' .That is n't the problem . This is : Unless you already know the Greek ( or Hebrew one as the case may be ) word you want to look up , or at least its Strong 's number , you ca n't use this dictionary . If you are using a non-koine Greek Bible ( that is , one in English ) , unless the words in it are keyed to Strong 's numbers , there is no front end translation into Greek in this dictionary.Lets say you want to look up the English word `` beginning '' . Unless you know that the koine Greek word is `` arche '' ( Strong 746 ) , you ca n't look it up in this dictionary.I have a print Strong 's Dictionary that lists all the words in the NT & OT alphabetically in English at the front with their translation into Greek and/or Hebrew with the relevant Strong 's numbers . Much more useful ! BTW , before anyone calls me up on this : In these Kindle dictionaries , once you find the Greek ( or Hebrew ) word and look it up , they DO give you the English translation and the definition is in English , of course.What you ca n't do is start out with an English ( or non-Greek or non-Hebrew ) word and find the definition here .	-1
People just do n't talk the way this author 's characters do . Please read the sample first , see if you can handle it . At 99 cents , go ahead and try if you like the sample , but blech . It reads like old poetry .	-1
I not sure how I feel about this book it was very different from anything I read before so l am at a lost .	-1
Going Home starts off very amusingly . I was instantly attracted to the characters ( not , ooh he 's so hot , but I love them ! ) , unfortunately , it was down hill from there . I really thought I was going to love this book , but after the first chapter , the book starts to disappoint.For one thing , Emily is attracted to far too many men , and just in the first couple of chapters ! She 's flighty and annoying , and I started to resent her . I do not like women who are ditzy and immature . They get on my nerves , and I kinda just wan na go up and smack them and say , `` Act your age , idiot ! `` Which brings me to my next point . I ca n't tell if Ms. Dennis 's writing is juvenile , or if Emily is . From her taste in clothes , to her favorite `` vampire book series '' I ca n't tell if she 's in her twenties or her early teens . She acts like some of the girls I used to go to school with . Her annoying obsession with shopping also grates on my nerves . Sorry if I sound obsessive , myself , but I 'm just stating how I feel.I always say I like a good , descriptive story , but there is a point where the author is going to far . For example , In Going Home the author tells us about the stripes on Emily 's bikini and what is in the sauce at a restaurant . It 's irrelevant and distracts from the important parts of the story.Emily 's relationships with Jacob and Pete move way to fast . Even if Emily and Pete are starting where they left off a date within the first three or four chapters is quite speedy . Not only are the relationships going too fast , each scene in the book is , as well . I understand if Ms. Dennis is trying to make it so a reader does n't get bored , but how can we get to know a character or what 's going on plot-wise if the story is moving at an outlandish speed ? Just a thought ... This book is too mainstream ! Addicted to shopping , in love with shopping , loves to sing pop at the top of her lungs ... what is new about Emily ? I 'll be honest , I love vampires ( especially hotties with six pacts and gorgeous eyes ) , but when I was reading this novel I felt like I 've read about Emily over and over . It 's boring . It needs something new , unique , unheard of . That 's how you become best-seller . Take the Twilight series . Even if people are n't so much into Edward and Bella , at least `` sparkling vampires '' was a new thing.I 'm not here to be rude and nag , but I need to tell the truth , my opinion . To make readers interested , it takes pizazz and originality , and I 'm afraid Going Home is n't any of the sort.Recommendations ? ? Honestly , I 'm stuck . I have no idea who would enjoy this . Mainstreamers ? Probably . How about you read it and tell me how you think !	-1
Author uses a fixed width font . Looks like it came off a typewriter . Its very hard to read comfortably . I purchased both this and the second book at the same time , and the second book looks great ! Please update this book with the font and formatting like the second book . I rated 2stars instead of 1 because i like the premise , just wish i could read it .	-1
I read a few pages and decided this was not for me . It was a little too unbelievable and out there . It was free , so I just went on to something else .	-1
I tried several times to read this book . I could not . It seemed to be written by a person that needs more experience with writing . I do n't like to sound mean but a few writing classes could n't hurt .	-1
did n't capture y attention at all and was annoying so i did n't get past the 2nd chapter . I would n't read it if I were you .	-1
I chose to read a sample of this book before I purchased it and I am glad I did so that I did not waste my money . I am very disappointed in this book . It is obvious that absolutely no thought was wasted on editing this book . Possessive forms were used when they were not applicable . & # 34 ; They 're & # 34 ; instead of the proper use of & # 34 ; their & # 34 ; . Before any of you jump on me , you should think of the fact that when you are offering a written story for sale , the very least the author should do is make sure it is free of so many mistakes . I was unable to be drawn into the story because of the numerous mistakes . Unless they are corrected , I will not be buying this book .	-1
After reading the reviews on They Walk , I was excited to read it , but I was having a hard time trying to finish because of the misplaced words , misspelled words , and I had to mentally correct the grammar so that I knew what she was writing about . Try this website if you want to get a handle on your grammar . [ ... ]	-1
The writing is puerile , stilted and the entire thing sounds like it was written by a 15 year old boy .	-1
As a horror story , this is a big disappointment.It 's a reimagining of Little Red Riding Hood , but it was underwhelming . Gertrude , an older woman , escapes from the constant watchful eye of her servant . You wait for something to happen , but when it does , it does n't make much sense .	-1
This book might appeal to teenagers more than adults . There were some good suspense scenesThroughout the story , however I prefer reading stories of people who are adults .	-1
This book is really just 3 very short stories . The first one , also the title of the book , is the best one . The other 2 are not so good . None of them are very scary . There are also samples of 2 other books . 1 about zombies and another about aliens which seem very childish , and almost comical . The alien one even had cartoon drawings .	-1
Being a grandmother who likes some young adult fiction I gave this one a try . The subject of Atlantis has lately caught my fancy . But in the first couple of chapters I was asking myself whether I could actually continue on with all the `` kid stuff '' . Then things smoothed out , caught my interest and moved me right along . However , I kept waiting for a connection with Atlantis . If it was there I missed it completely . Like another reviewer , I also kept expecting some kind of connection between Elliott and Nicholas . Darn ! That would have been so cool.I gave this two stars because inspite of all my unrequited expectations it held my interest right up to the last couple of chapters . I stayed up long past my work night bedtime , eager to read a fantastic ending . I got there and felt cheated . My attitude was : `` I stayed up for that ? ! '' Oversimplification and loose ends jangling all over the place . So many possibilities that fell far too short . I 'm glad it was only $ .99.This review will be down at the very bottom and probably no one will ever read it , but I feel better venting my frustration .	-1
I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review.I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a & # 8220 ; thriller & # 8221 ; as the description stated when I received an invitation to read this book.This was part of the description that came with the invitation , & # 8220 ; After the crash of a explosive-laden seaplane into the aft end of The Sea Empress as it left a Caribbean island , the luxury cruise ship has been refurbished and repaired and leaves Rome for it 's first trans-Atlantic voyage & # 8221 ; .OK . That was stated in the book as it began . Gives you the impression that something exciting was going to happen , after all it & # 8217 ; s a thriller . Not the case ! I felt like I was reading a newspaper of current events.The positive point for this book is that it is very short , so it was a fast read .	-1
Most of the new subplots were supposed to be humorous . Unfortunately , filling a book with dick jokes limits your audience- the jokes really seemed to be something that would appeal to 19 year old guys . Anyway , a combination military fantasy and penis humor novel is an odd style choice . I just did n't find it funny.So on to the writing . It is very inconsistent . You will finish reading a paragraph that is just silly and pointless , and then a scene will come up that is really great . I think the book would benefit from stronger direction , and some ruthless editing.The author continues with the punishment theme , and it gets stretched quite thin . He does pose some interesting points , but also occasionally contradicts himself.The author relies mostly on primary emotions such as happy/sad/angry and does n't make much use of subtler emotional distinctions ( pensiveness , joy , or even sensuality ) . He also does n't make use of visual emotional cues such as facial expression or body language very often . It makes his characters seem a bit shallow and incomplete to me ( the main character perhaps being the exception ) .The book did n't have a lot of sex in it , but what there was tended to be violent or unpleasant . I did n't get that . Also , everyone falls in love instantaneously and love is almost always unrequited , so there are almost no relationships except for the exceptionally dysfunctional one between the two brothers ( later there is also a relationship between two boys . But adults apparently do n't get together long term ) . I did not enjoy that.Overall , parts of it were good , but soured by unfunny humor subplots and shallow character development .	-1
I got this as a free kindle book . Had good ratings and it looked like a quick read so why not give it a shot ? I rifled through it in about a half hour or so . I put it down . I sat there . I thought about it . I still have no idea what it 's about.the 'Night Walk Men ' are what ? Angels ? Demons ? Norse Gods ? Hard to say . The only real thing I can get from this story is that they have the power over life or death . Or just death . Or maybe both ? I honestly do n't know.It also comes with an excerpt from his novel Thalo Blue which is placed at the end of The Night Watch Men . I tried to read that and had to just stop . Lots of artsy prose once again filled with comparisons , flowery language and metaphor but all that did was overshadow what little story I could pick up on.Oh well , nothing ventured nothing gained I suppose . I can see others have liked this little short story for various reasons but it 's just not my cup of tea I guess .	-1
This was free in the Amazon Kindle store , which explains the two star rating . I do n't understand all of the non-verified Amazon purchased 5 star reviews as they must have read something different than what I started.This is a rambling `` something '' that is all over the place , and I had to stop after 17 % through the Kindle version . I have no idea what point the author was trying to make except something about death , and the frequent references along the lines of `` wait , I 'll tell you about what is going to happen later '' became annoying fast . After 10 minutes and 17 % of the way through , I could n't `` wait '' any longer.As I type this review , there are over 150 short stories available for free in the Amazon Kindle store . I 'd pass this one up and concentrate on the others .	-1
I downloaded this when it was just called & # 34 ; The Night Walk Men , & # 34 ; apparently more stories have been added since then . That makes sense , because this just does n't really make sense on it 's own.It 's a story about . . . well , I 'm still not really sure . It 's about the & # 34 ; Night Walk Men & # 34 ; and it 's narrated by I'm-not-sure-who . Who are the Night Walk Men ? At the end of the story , I was no more able to answer that question than I was at the beginning of the story . They 're some sort of mythical creatures -- semi-gods ? Or maybe just representations of abstract qualities such as & # 34 ; fate. & # 34 ; They interact with humans and we hear about part of what happens to some humans . I could have handled the ambiguity , but I 'm just not a fan of the ponderous and semi-epic tone of McIntyre 's prose . I felt like every page contained a promise that the mysteries would be explained , but at the end of the story , I still had no idea what was going on.I do n't know . Maybe I 'm not smart enough to get it . It felt like second-rate Clive Barker to me ( without the gore ) .	-1
I choose this book because I wanted to learn about indians but I found it too violent to my liking was verysad when they died	-1
I guess that I could n't keep interest long enough to complete the book . As far as I read it was very dull and did n't seem like it was going anywhere so I quit . Since everyone thinks it is so good , maybe I will pick it up and see if it gets better . Maybe !	-1
I 'm sorry but this might be a bit long ( Waring little spoliers ) . I 've read this book a couple of times , the first time it was a fine book . Now that I 've read It again , it 's not . First off in the beginning it seems like the author is the main character recording what happened , but she constantly changes from third person to first person . Also there was lots of spelling errors , no period/question mark/exclamation point/e.t.c . she has also not used the right ending point , or not used an 's ' at the end of words that require a s. Such as `` thousand little cotton ball . '' Or `` couple of beer '' . I 've noticed that even if the main character ( Hayden ) is new to the world the author Is trying to create she does not do anything to help besides occasionally healing somebody . She spends most of the book sleeping , talking , being with jasper . She 's supposedly is a 'natural ' at fighting but she only really fights twice in the book . I think she 's meant to be a powerful heroine , but she Cries to much and is in bed being in pain , she has to much 'I love you ' and 'I 'm so worried/sad ' emotion . The author has plenty of creative-ness going on but crams it all together while providing excitement for a few pages , but chapters dull . Of course Hayden has never had her life seriously in danger with out her fighting girlfriends , muscled guy friends or as always sexy , muscled well fought boyfriend or 'mate 's a he 's called . Personally I never catch mistakes or anything but the story of the book , and even I caught them . That covers the book I think .	-1
This is quite likely the worst grammer I have ever come across in a published book . This author consistently uses `` new '' when she should use `` knew '' and `` to '' when she should use `` too '' . She also does n't know the difference between breath and breathe . These are just some of the more prevalent examples , there were others . I also became tired of all the blushing going on . I searched , and there are 44 instances of the word blush and that does n't catch all the times people just turn red . The most annoying part of that , is that most of them were the big bad alpha hero who turns into a tiger.The style of story and plot seemed more like a young adult title but there was too much adult content for that to be the case . The story itself had lots of potential . I probably would have rated it four stars if it were not for the nearly illiterate writing.This story ends rather abruptly and is apparently continued in the next book of the series . Unfortunately , although I would like to know more about the characters , I ca n't bring myself to actually pay good money to read such poorly written books . My advice to the author would be to hire herself a good editor .	-1
I HATE EXERPTS IF I WANTED A SHORT STORY OR A GLIMPSE AT A BOOK I WOULD EITHER SHOOSE TO SAMPLE A BOOK OR OPT FOR A LABELED SHORT STORY THE SHOW IS MUCH BETTER ! ! ! ! !	-1
Fair book . Not long enough to tell a decent story . Was disappointed in this one . Her books are usually very good.Not a favorite of mine .	-1
It 's ok if you like a short story that is formatted like a script . It 's a good thing it was free , very little plot or character development . I read it in about 15 minutes and at the end all I could think of was `` huh ? `` .	-1
I was very disappointed with this short story ... very predictable and simply not at all engaging . Was expecting more plot-wise , although the characters remained true to their personalities which is always enjoyable .	-1
Maybe 2 1/2 stars , the writing was decent , , , but ... .Follow the Money - Initially , the story seemed to be interesting . However , it was n't until 50 % that the story seemed to move forward . Interesting , maybe . Entertaining , no . I know that a `` main '' character does n't need to likable , but he should be at least believable . This guy was a `` dunce '' . A college graduate , attending law school , interning at a corporation , does n't seem to have anything `` between his ears '' . Other characters that could have helped with the story were n't developed very well . Basically , the main character ruined the story . A story that seemed to have potential , fell flat . The writing was ok , but the novel needed a `` lawyer '' for an editor . Basically , could have been good - but , was n't . I think I 'll pass on the next book .	-1
And after it became a dreadful , predictable story ... Oh that was a waste of time and money . Please , Ms. Driscoll , do you research first . It was very naive . It could be much better .	-1
The first pages of this novel are promising : Ned Kellington , a wounded British soldier comes to his senses near the corpse of a Frenchman , just after the Battle of Waterloo . Unfortunately , the first pages prove to be the high point of the novel , and it 's all downhill from there.Ned soon encounters a British nobleman 's daughter , Jane Whetherby , who is in disguise as a physician aiding the troops . Yes , we 're asked to believe that a nobly-born lady , without the knowledge or permission of her family , is wandering alone on battlefields as a young , innocent-yet-knowledgeable angel of mercy . We know that Ned has been injured and is perhaps out of his senses with pain , but Jane 's urge `` to frolic on cave floors '' with Ned in one night of passion can only be the result of some grievous blow to the head that the author has neglected to mention . And this episode is just the first of many in which Jane responds to Ned and to nearly every situation she encounters in ways that are self-contradictory , incomprehensible , or downright absurd.There is lust aplenty in this novel , but romance is sadly missing . For instance , Ned sounds more like an abusive caveman than a romantic hero : `` The problem was that she intrigued him as no other woman ever had . He was attracted to her to such a degree that just seeing her in another man 's arms was enough to make him want to march across the room , throw her over his shoulder and take her off to be thoroughly ravished . Just what he 'd do when he was finally done having his way with her , he had no idea . `` I wo n't be reading more by this author .	-1
I love historical fiction and purchased this book , recommended for me by Amazon because of prior purchases . This book , however , may occur in historical times , is NOT historical fiction , but more a repetitive description of & # 34 ; hard cocks & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; tight sheaths & # 34 ; ( vagina ) , and though there may be an underlying plot that is interesting , I 'm really not the slightest bit interested in reading over and over again about how & # 34 ; hard & # 34 ; a man gets , nor how intense the ardor . My rating comes from feeling I was reading a repetitive , historically set G-rated pornography , vs. anything of substance from which I could learn about actual events in our historical past . Some people might love this , but it was a poor recommendation for me and will result in my revising my lists on Amazon .	-1
Just like others said , this is an interesting attempt at presenting an ABC book for Wiccan households , BUT it suffers from a lack of pictures , drawings , or even large letters.Here 's some sample text : K is for the Kinship we share with all of Mother Earth.L is for Litha - a Sabbat of great warmth.Now if I were going to design an ABC book , at the minimum I would have had EXTREMELY LARGE letters for little one 's to view , and I would have had no more than two letters and their accompanying text per page . ( You do n't want things visually complicated . ) This might give some parents something to associate with each letter as they teach their children , but it 's not a book I think will work otherwise.Do n't recommend .	-1
I found the story too broad . It went from being new and different to bullying , to religious . It could have been made into a few different books if the topic was narrowed some . The illustrations were cute though .	-1
This was n't what I 'd expected . I would n't read any more of this series . There 's so much other books that I 'd enjoy more . It was what I 'd call a cutesy story . But it does leave an impression on you.Theila	-1
I did n't even finish it . It seemed so random , as if SJB wrote it as she made it up.blah is the only word I can think of .	-1
I did n't like it . The next time I will buy only one book of a series before buying more of same .	-1
I hate giving bad reviews , especially when I can tell the author has talent . But I have to be honest and say I did n't like the book . There was nothing but tension in this story . If I wanted to feel that much tension , I would read a mystery . This is a very short story . I think if it had been longer with more opportunity to explore the characters and time to better develop the plot and insert some lighthearted joy where the hero and heroine could explore love , it could have even been a great book . The author had original ideas and creativity . With time and polish , and maybe a switch of genre she could be great . If you like a lot of tension you may love this book . But I read Regency romance for lighthearted fun and fairytale balls etc . before bed to relax ; but this poor heroine 's situation just kept getting worse with no relief.I truly hope , however , that 10 + people come behind me with better reviews and that this author keeps trying . I look forward to more from her .	-1
Very short and not very hot at all . Rushed sex in the ocean , and a f/f scene with not much detail .	-1
Unfortunately the 'good bits ' were n't good enough to make it fun . It also suffers from rapidly changing thought processes , disjointed transitions and random additions . Attempts at describing local flavor came off as superficial and flat . Anatomical activities do n't actually seem all that likely.Seriously , if you want to read about a guy and two gals ... well , is n't it great if it 's a middle aged guy who is in great shape due to being a several year vegetarian , who is still thrilled with his wife of 23 years because she so rapidly lost her baby weight and her b*****s are still big and gorgeous ? So , lucky that his wife 's old friend from work ( WAY too much expository thinking to himself to get these facts across ) who , by the way , only has smaller b*****s , remembers the randomly thrown in fact the couple are nudists . The friend who takes them to a nude beach , reveals that certain piercings make the aforementioned body parts much hotter , whose wife thinks it 's great her husband finds her friend 'interesting ' ( and thank goodness the wife 's friend has lost that extra bit of tummy she used to carry around ) , and well gosh , it 's really great the wife seems to think the piercings are hot too wink wink ? Please , next time just leave out the fluff and the overdone internal musings that only serve to give an excuse to have the characters indulge in sex . Give it a paragraph , then write the sex . That is the point of this type of story so do n't waste time on a not-so-compelling backstory and cut to the chase . And try to make it at least moderately interesting sex . Better yet , make an interesting story WITH the interesting sex.Sigh.JTG ( edited to add two missing words ... ca n't type apparently )	-1
In a way is was a nice story about a middleaged , sexually liberated , attractive couple spending a day on a nude tropical beach ending up in a tree sum , but I would have liked that 'something extra ' ! So 2 ** is all i could affort .	-1
I give him credit for the original and witty jokes , some of which are actually really funny . Did n't like the incessant gross ones though . A few is fine but too much ... no .	-1
there are so many character bios at the beginning that instead of letting characters unfold naturally , their backstory was forced down our throats . Had I bothered to read the other reviews I would have noticed that this is only the first half of the story , so now I am left with a bunch of questions and a fear that the second half will come out at a high price - any more than 99 cents and I doubt I will buy it !	-1
This is the first book I read from this authorI have not like ... .Typos besides from that ... the main character had problems with the new guythat was not cause for ... .	-1
No way , could not keep my attention got half way through it and decided to cut my losses . Usually by that point in a book I can start to understand the workings of the story what has to transpire not so here . Short revamp : girl hears voices , try '' s to off herself , mother is crazy plus protective , girl goes to mental hospital draws strange pictures , girl escapes with boy and other girl who hears voices , they go to place to train , girl is a gateway to save them from demons , and etc . Gee I think I went to sleep writing that .	-1
I 'm with Shira46 , except I 'm going to go ahead and give it one star . The story is interesting and well told , but there 's no warning anywhere that this is just a teaser that leaves you hanging unless you want to purchase the actual `` book '' . This is NOT `` Book 1 '' , as the title would suggest . It 's an excerpt , and a cheap way to try and force people to purchase the book . Personally , I 'm so annoyed over the misrepresentation that I wo n't buy anything by this author . Very disappointing .	-1
The point of view changes were hard to follow , especially since the white space , paragraph breaks and what not was not designed to portray it . In need of serious editing , to the point that even if I liked the story , it was so distracting , I could n't enjoy it .	-1
It was what I would call a desperate read . I did n't care for the characters in the least and that made for a poor read .	-1
Very , very short and more poem than narrative . Not my thing , but others may enjoy . I did n't think it was badly written , but it was just hard to get into .	-1
I bought this book as a sales professional , I am always trying to & # 34 ; up my game & # 34 ; . I share some likes and dislikes with the author . I did enjoy his spin and & # 34 ; story & # 34 ; approach , but there were a few things missing . Business people , especially when we 're reading , like explanations or examples in a seperate font to better understand exactly where the author is coming from.The approach of avoiding the perception of being a sales person makes sense . His methods DO work , but is there anything earth shattering ? No.One aspect I completely agree with is regarding referrals ! There is a far easier approach to gain access to referrals easier . This method should be added to this book , and is an amazing tacticWhich you can read here . What makes sense about the approach mentioned , is I have used it extremely successfully and have had web site owners call or search for me - if that is n't a perfect example of gaining business by unselling I do n't know what is ! Plus it is far more relevant for today 's heavily eCommerce based world .	-1
This story is very different and has an interesting story line . Simplely stated : The dead come back as demonds , walking bombs or dumb workers ? The story would have been more interesting to me if there was some explaination of how it all began , and how everything changed so fast . The two brothers are just to simple , and the wife is the same . The whole world falls apart but this little village beats down this vicious army of evil creatures and their slaves . A bite does turn you into one of theseZombie . I had a hard time finishing it . Certain readers will find it enjoyable , but being a zombie fan , I did not .	-1
I started to check this out , but right off the bat was four-letter words and what I consider vile profanity . I post this information for people like myself who avoid novels that have to resort to gutter language .	-1
I did n't even bother to finish this story . It is the same old-same old : the sweet but slightly stupid debutant who goes from one bad choice into the next . After being warned repeatedly by her family she still wanders off into places with questionable men or by herself.She is n't meant to be seen as stupid of course . The reader is supposed to find her slightly skewed outlook as 'refreshing ' , as the hero does . I would question whether anyone that gullible should be allowed a season at all -- just marry her off and save the family embarrassment . I am fairly sure by the end of the story she wound up having to marry the hero because of a misunderstanding of the situation.The heroine 's brother has asked his best friends to help keep an eye on her , and the only person who seems to be doing so is the hero . He is supposed to be finding a wife for himself . I thought if the brother was so concerned he would be watching her better.I can not recommend this book . The main characters were n't believable . This one was too shallow for my taste .	-1
Most romance novels ALWAYS receive a 4 star from me but this one made me sick to my stomach at the end . Okay I know it was all to keep phoebe & # 34 ; safe & # 34 ; but the whole mistress thing really got under my skin ! I almost stopped reading it all together . Does n't everyone hate a cheater ? Even if he was just pretending it was low . It should have been written in a less offensive way that did n't make you want to jump into the book so you could wring his scrawny cheating neck . The best friend other wife was also annoying and unneeded . Made me have bad feelings towards Taylor . Not buying anymore books by this author .	-1
The story starts out with a first chapter and abruptly end almost mid-sentence . Do n't bother unless you like to be left hanging .	-1
When I first started reading this book , my first thought was , `` who is this guy 's editor ? '' The sentences were short and choppy , sentences that could very easily have been made smoother and less disjointed . I found myself mentally re-writing these chopped up lines into a more cohesive structure.Plot was weak , ending fizzled out . Steven Havill and Tony Hillerman are authors this writer should read if he plans to continue writing southwest mysteries . They know how to put it together and keep the interest sharp .	-1
Why should erotica be so crappy ? Do n't waste your time ; this is kind of boring - there was n't much in the way of real kink .	-1
I have read 93 books on my Kindle since August 1st when it arrived . THIS is the worst one of them all.I 've read this series up until this one and I simply can not finish it.Victoria is so mean and hateful to Quincy it 's unbelievable . She goes from loving to pi**ed off in nothing flat . AND why does she insist on calling him `` Gus ? `` That was OK when they first met and he did n't tell her his name right away but it should have ended there . I cringe every time she calls him that and when I start cringing during reading I 'm sooo done with that book.She made you believe she new all about ettiquite during the Civil War THEN goes out for a morning run in her jeans ? Come on ! Let 's get real here.The writer ruined the entire series with this one . She made Victoria a vicious Bi*ch and there was no getting away from it . It was just too much ! The only other problem I had with the other books { well , not the only one } was with Sophie and Jamie.If I ever download a time travel book where the H or the h call the other `` BABY '' near the beginning I 'll delete it immedately . Good Grief , the word BABY must have been used a hundred times in the book . { I 'm not kidding either . } I can appreciate modern woman being independent but I see no reason why the men had to be so sweet and patient and honorable for so long while the women continued to act like they were always right and the men were always wrong . There was almost no compromise on the women 's part.I think I 've read enough of this and will not read the rest of the series.In EVERY one of the books EVERY person at one time or another `` pinches the bridge of their nose , '' over and over again . And I mean EVERY one of the characters in every book.The stories themselves were OK but the writer used to many of the same phrases toooo many times.I could go on but your get my drift . It could have been a good series but it was too repetitive for me.When the story line is different but the dialogue is the same in every book it does n't make for really good reading . IMHO..	-1
Not my cup of tea , pretty boring . I was at least able to read it all the way through but deleted it from my device and library as soon as I was finished .	-1
I am laboring to finish this book and decided I just do not care what happens to the main character . Poorly written , poorly executed , poor all around . Am returning for a refund .	-1
I read about 50 pages and returned it . It was not worth my leisure time to finish the book . There are too many good books to read .	-1
I kept waiting for something to HAPPEN , and when it finally did , it was on the periphery . I could n't like any of the characters , except for may be Tometta , and so many of the sub plots could have been better developed . As it was , it was 200 pages of Buddy 's hormones raging . The authors missed the mark .	-1
The characters seemed well developed , some more so than others , but the plot meandered into a boring nothingness . Even when exciting things were happening , such as a missing neighborhood child , it feels as though the family is not really properly shocked when the perpetrator is discovered.I wanted it to get better because I did like the characters , but they led dull lives , and this is their resultant story . How it is possible to make a snoozer of a book about a family of six sisters , their mother , two of their husbands , a pre-teen , a bed ridden uncle , and their two African American maids , in the south during WWII is beyond me . The author even threw in a possible & # 34 ; negro uprising & # 34 ; , and an escaped German POW , but I still kept looking for more .	-1
I liked this story . It was different and emotional . The ending ( if you can consider it an ending ) ruined the story . Honestly to me there was no ending . It felt more like a slap in the face ending . To say that it upsets me that he erases her memory after the one day they are allowed . I agree with the other reviews that he needs to decide since she can not move on . She will spend the rest of her life alone because of this . She doesn ` t even take another partner..she remains alone and sad but he takes partners because of his eating habits creates lust . He is a selfesh jerk for doing that to someone he loves.That is wrong in so many ways . It ends miserably which to me is worse than a forced HEA . I am so upset with this story since up untill the end the characters were so good together and the story was good . If your not going to actualy end a story then why write it in the first place . The reviewer that says this book is depressing speaks honestly . Selfesh hero and a terrible ending that ruins any good thing in this story . Completly miserable and a waste of time . If there is going to be another book with these characters one where there is an actualy ending and will not be so depressing and unfilling I will gladly change my review . Till then I will not take another chance on this author .	-1
I expected sci-fi murder mysteries when I bought this book and that is exactly what was delivered . The stories were missing `` endings '' though . There was no satisfaction at the end of each mystery . They just ended . On top of that there were way too many characters introduced all at once to keep track . The defining personality points of each character that would make them unique and identifiable were only introduced for about half of the characters in the last two stories . Those traits were never introduced for the other half of the characters . There was nothing in this book that grabbed me and made me want to keep reading , except to find out the end of the mystery .	-1
Like TV scripts that could n't be sold to a network . ( And you know how low the standard is for that ! ) If you loved & # 34 ; The Man from UNCLE & # 34 ; ( and are old enough to remember that ) this book may be for you .	-1
I stopped reading it . The characters were dull , flat and truly boring . If they were able to speak , I doubt that you would be able to tell them apart . The reader is fed bits of information at a time , about each person . It was slow and truthfully , I just did n't care about the characters or the story at all .	-1
You know the old saying you get what you paid for ? I paid nothing for CATHARSIS and got very little more than that . Now if you are looking for violence , gore and meaning less killings , this is your book ! Jonathan Face has potential , his words flowed from time to time , but the story was meaningless . What do I mean ? There was no reason to care who died . You did n't know much if any thing about them . The book started well and went in a spiral down after that . Just death after death and in the end , no reason for the carnage . Disappointing .	-1
Too much sex and not enough quality story telling . Intimacy with a better story line would have sold this book .	-1
This book starts off strangely to say the least . It is dark and hard to understand what is going on between the two characters . I could n't figure what had happened at the beginning until I was into it a bit . I felt the story line was not believable at all .	-1
I read this story with my grandson and found it was very hard to get into the story . We only read half the book before choosing something else .	-1
I really enjoyed the first book . I even enjoyed this book so I guess I 'm realy rating the series . I wish I had known it was going to take 5 books for them to get together and I would never have started the series . Usually if a series is several books long it covers Several romances . I 'm done after book 2 and very disappointed .	-1
It starts great but had a really hard time trying to like the characters , I was thouroughly confused as to what was going on , was he a ghost ? what happened with the original owners daughter , which was never concluded , and then the end was just so badly wrapped up that I was a bit upset I even spent the time trying to engage in this tale ... ... sex was ok but a bit too non emotional for me . All in all this was a waste and thank goodness I did not pay for it or else I would have been really upset .	-1
I ca n't believe I 'm saying this , there was too much sex in this story . It 's all the characters did together . One bout after another , but with very little descriptive variation . Kim 's house is haunted . Jill , her best friend , wants her to get out of the house but they have a huge fight before the reason can be explained and Kim ends up going home with Tyler , a perfect stranger . What ensues is several chapters worth of unvaried and frequent sex the likes of which would put most people to sleep . The actual writing is fairly good . The author has some story-telling skill . I just wish she 'd go back to the drawing board with this one and try again . Tone down the sex , make it more realistic , make it hotter , and put in a working plot and subplots .	-1
It 's a very short book with very little character development . Although I am not a prude by any stretch of the imagination I would have liked to see the characters do something other than have sex . By the end of the book even the sex was boring , its like the author could n't come up with any other dialog or description . I 'm glad it was a free book but you get what you pay for . I 'm thankful the only thing I lost was time .	-1
It was hard to jump from book to book in this Kindle version . I like one that has easy to use & # 34 ; Jump to ... & # 34 ; searches in it . It is hard to scroll through the whole bible looking for the particular book you need . At least an easy way to get back to the Table of Contents would have been most helpful .	-1
Mike I loved your book `` Lust , Money & Murder '' So purchased all your other books . Give me another good book and I will buy it .	-1
This book is horrible . There is no real plot it is just some ranting . I was going to keep reading to see if it got any better but the grammer is also horrible that most of the time I could n't understand what she was even ranting about I just knew that she was angry . I was shocked that anyone else would have like this book . I recommend you do not read this .	-1
Does n't really say anything , is n't funny , is n't interesting , just personal rants on nothing . I like to finish what I start , but this book I should have deleted after the first page .	-1
I think this book might be ok , but did not live up to the hype it was given by some other reviewers . I ended up being really disapointed and deleted it off my Kindle.It was compared to Stephanie Plum , and I did not find it anything like that . I found nothing really humorous and I do n't know if it is b/c I was expecting something funny and it did not happen , or I had just set the bar too high.This book might be fine if you go into it with little - no expectations . Heroine had a couple good lines , but I found her moral stance on not writing a womans column b/c it is demeaning , but being a writer for a tabloid a bit strange . But then I am fairly anti-tabloid , so that could be the problem.Also did not find it believable that the guy would be so nice to her after she trashed him on the front page . I thought it was a little too farfetched , and was not for me .	-1
Why pay even a dollar and clutter your kindle when ell of this is available elsewhere - and for free ? Just go to the author 's blog !	-1
I read this whole series mostly out of curiosity to see what the author would do . The answer ? A whole lot of nothing . These books are boring , repetitive and totally unsatisfying . You know how most YA fantasy makes you either want to be part of the adventure , or wish you were in that world ? Not here . I 'd run screaming from these psychopaths and their effed up island .	-1
Dear Coca-Cola is a boring book that I 'm glad I did n't pay money for it . There is nothing in it to make you want to read further .	-1
PASS ON IT ! ! ! Pretty much a waste of time I would say . Not even good toilet reading ! ! ! Keep searching ... ... .	-1
This was written as letters to different companies complaining about their products but the letters are pretty much from the same character that comes off as stupid or very ignorant .	-1
I guess that I 've read too many wolf breed books , because I found this boring and predictable . Typical plot of the alpha bucking the system to find his mate even though the rest of the pack want to kill her . The female character 's most persuading trait seemed to be her terror , but I guess that was enough for the guy to put his life in danger to mate her . Confrontation with the alpha-bitch to be , check , big meeting with pack leaders where alpha must plead his case , check , violent rogue element within the pack , check , blah blah blah . The steamy parts were not really hot because the couple was compatible almost from the beginning , would have been better with conflict . I just finished Ral 's Woman , short but superior in every way , super hot guy in a fresh alien setting , get that one instead and save your 7 bucks on this one .	-1
The book starts with a dream sequence or memory of a love making session . Which of these I 'm not entirely sure . There was definitely a story line , but the fact that the story went back and forth between the two main characters who are in different countries and also back and forth between present day and memories , it just did n't flow for me and I gave up after 3 chapters . All in all - the book just did n't do it for me .	-1
The beautiful , but pale Laura Brenton is separated from her handsome and very wealthy husband . Michael writes romance novels , and Laura has lived lavishly on the money while having an affair with a 25-year old man ( a little younger or `` decades younger '' than she is , depending on who is telling the story ) . Laura meets with Michael to collect his signed copies of their divorce papers , while plotting to have the entire estate all to herself . Michael , however , comes to the meeting with a rose , some champagne and the desire that they reconcile - though he remembers to bring along a little `` insurance '' just in case that does n't happen . When any chance at reconciliation fails , both Laura and Michael are determined to come out of the relationship as the winner-takes-all.What I liked about this book:1 ) It had a nice cover ; 2 ) It was short - it took about an hour to read , and I was happy not to have wasted any more of my time ; 3 ) I learned how to work many of the features on my new Kindle as I made notes and highlights of all the typos , grammatical errors and editing mistakes - an impressive number given that the book was so short.What I did n't like:1 ) Sentences flowed poorly . `` Laura took a few steps back and stopped in front of the looking glass . Laura turned around and she moved closer to the mirror while gazing at her reflection in the looking glass . '' As she examines herself , she notices a few lines around her eyes , which upsets her greatly . She then looks `` at her pale nearly flawless yet pretty complexion with a smile . '' She `` tosses back her hair '' - not once but three times in two pages.2 ) Commas are missing , typos abound ( `` No . Not not yet , '' Michael says at one point . Later , Laura says `` It will all be mine off course . `` ) 3 ) Word usage is downright strange in places . For example : `` She closed her eyes and shook her head before taking a deep breath and opening her orbs '' and `` the young woman collapsed to the floor atop her spine . `` 4 ) Bad writing , no editing . She tells Michael `` And I 'm not your wife , '' but nine sentences later , she says `` I am your real wife ... '' Michael is called `` the handsome man '' again and again through the book - we get it , ok ? Michael `` focused his sight on the large black door that lay embedded in the wall a few yards away from him . '' ( are n't doors generally embedded in walls ? ) Michael always `` snatches '' the pen , usually while `` gazing '' at the rose . The writing style , overall , was immature and sloppy . Someone fell `` with an audible crash . '' A `` tiny vial '' shatters into `` thousands of tiny fragments '' ( must have been very tiny ... ) 5 ) Even if grammar and bad writing do n't bother you , the lack of character development and any pretense of depth to the story should be enough to deter you from purchasing this book . The author gives us no reason at all to identify with either Laura or Michael , and the suspense is so poorly developed that it evokes nothing in the reader . Without writing a spoiler , I 'll just say that the ending is totally unrealistic and unnecessarily gruesome.Do n't waste your time with this one.I was given a copy of this book by LibraryThing in exchange for writing a fair and honest review .	-1
The only reason I bought this book was to see how the series finally ended , save your money . Boring and it was hard to follow because the story went everywhere , drugs , sex , construction , prision , homosexuality and everything else in between ! Save your money and borrow it . It will be a waste an hour you will never get back !	-1
The stories ramble on and on without ever getting to the point . The stilted prose is supposed to be appropriate to the time , I guess , but leave the question , 'If you ca n't say what you are talking about , then what is the point of droning on ? ''	-1
Getting started with this book is a bit overwhelming . You 've got the female main , Dani , who is a detective and her uncles , aunts , step-siblings , mother , father , the guy her mother thought was her father ( long story there ) , best friend from the police academy . . . well , you get the idea . There are two families that are mortal enemies and they all have lots of members and back story . And then there is another family that hates one of the families . Into this mix , Dani falls in love with the son of a man she 'd sworn to hate.Or in lust anyway.There is a plot in the midst of all this , but it is n't any great shakes . The bad guy is telegraphed pretty explicitly , so any suspense the author had a chance to work with is dispelled before it even has a chance to begin its work . A big canvas is a great things for an author . An overcrowded canvas , especially one filled with nothing more than stick figures , is n't so great .	-1
Book was horribly boring . I normally love the books by this author but this one , no . I actually returned it and got my money back .	-1
I found the basic plot and outline of the book to be intriguing . There were a number of interesting escape concepts . However , the grammar , syntax and overall literary quality needed a great deal of improvement . One example : '' The windshield was cracked from when the impact sent the cars in the carrier into the air , bouncing into the ceiling . `` Ouch .	-1
Temporary Duty has a few good points . First and foremost it was a clever idea . But as the book went on it became more and more disjointed and lacked the sinews to keep the joints together . It was like a bunch of short stories were put together which came out of the same milieu but with no thought to how they fit with each other . The character development was erratic , and sometimes the protagonists seemed to be entirely different people in one of the stories versus the other . On the whole I would say this book lacked either a good editor or beta readers to tell Ric Locke when he needed to do more work .	-1
The initial plot sounded quite promising . About the first 25 % of the book deals with the two enlisted men and their relationship with the aliens on a spaceship . Despite some tedious detail , this was quite engaging.Thereafter , the book deteriorated quite rapidly . We are given not just stereotypes of military ( more particularly Navy ) officers , NCO 's etc , but caricatures . Would a Naval Captain be put in charge of the first human contingent to go to the stars with alien visitors ? Surely , the intelligence agencies would have found a way to slip someone on board as well . Would the Captain , who is going to be flying fighter planes modified to take space engines off the spaceship , arrive and immediately announce that none of his pilots were going to learn the alien language ? Such rampant stupidity is hardly believable . What 's more , even after a couple of years in space , they have not learned anything of the alien language ( sorry the enlisted men learn to order beer ) and the Captain still sticks with his decision , despite being at the mercy of the enlisted hero in translating everything and hating every time he has to have the hero translate something . One would have thought that the team to go into space would be handpicked for intelligence and flexibility , given that humanity had no idea what it would meet out there.Please do not get me started on the school boy fantasies vis a vis the female aliens and how the hero ends up with two of them . As for the depiction of the IRS , it is laughable.About 50 % of the way through the book , I felt like giving up . I did finish it , it was not time well spent .	-1
Weird ... Entire premise is explained in the first five pages , plot barely goes outside of it . The rest of what feels like a thousand mostly unnecessary pages grimly and grudgingly grinds to & # 34 ; to be continued ... & # 34 ; It must take a special talent to write a book with not a single acceptably positive character . I understand complexity of real people , but there is none of it here . Just grey mice closer to repulsive side of spectrum . You almost wish the comet strikes only the people described in the book ...	-1
I ca n't really tell you why but I read 8 % of the book and just lost interest . I liked the premise , and I came back to it several times trying to continue but I just did not want to read any more of it . I am not even sure why . So , it gets one star . YMMV.I got it for free so no financial harm was done . But as there is plenty of better stuff for free or at low cost , there is no reason for me to read something I just am not interested in .	-1
Kevin George writes well , however I was not impressed with Interception & The New Space Race.I 've read countless trilogies , and each have a satisfying ending that ties things up , yet peaks your interest for the upcoming book.Weak plot , wandering storyline , and the worst part , killing off characters . It 's tough to care much for any characters since they kept dying shortly after you begin liking or disliking them.I fear my favorite one will be next , and for this reason I likely wo n't read the follow up .	-1
Maybe it was the double-spaced lines , or maybe the lack of continuity in the story but I just could n't read this beyond a few pages . The authors failed to establish who they were , where they were and why we should care . It just was n't interesting .	-1
My book club decided to focus on fantasy and this book came up as a possibility because it was free and the series already had a couple of books published . We found this author promoted on a site with a few other fantasy SPA . One was Jack Eason and I liked his book . The other was a Jack D. Hawkins and I do n't think I 'll ever finish that horrid book . So this one was n't as bad as Hawkins because I did finish it . Otherwise , I have n't a single positive thing to say . Just awful writing and really boring .	-1
Maybe it is me , maybe I am not a good judge of reading material or maybe it was just not my type of book..but I did not enjoy reading it and in the end deleted it before completion.sorry Vickie	-1
I do not appreciate filthy language . I did not read far before I deleted this book . It does not fit what I want to fill my mind with .	-1
This was not my type of book . I actually did n't read a lot of it because I do n't like this type of stories .	-1
I did not like this book at all ! Another one my mother and I were both reading , she could n't finish it , I did , with my same hopes of it getting good . It just seemed to drag on and on and on . How it is Amazon 's # 1 Romantic Comedy totally blows my mind , there is n't much romance at all in this book .	-1
Writing style was appropriate for the era in which these were published , but it does n't always translate ; a bit tedious to get through . This was a free Kindle book , and it is worth that for some people , and I would have downloaded it again without any prior opportunity to go through and sample , but generally this is n't going to appeal .	-1
I do n't think the characters were complex enough and so the author added more . It made the book feel muddled .	-1
This book got a lot of rave reviews and again I am in the minority : I found it very slow and finally just gave up at around 70 % . After H/h met and fell in love without knowing each other at all , I at least expected to get some in depth characterization to back up their attraction/love but it just did n't materialize . As a result I just did n't believe the love story at all . The & # 34 ; secondary & # 34 ; characters were better but I got tired of the & # 34 ; I 'm not good enough for him & # 34 ; which did n't make much sense and went on for way too long . The story was okay but there was n't much fun , wit , humor or charm in this one . I ca n't recommend it .	-1
Ok I had read the reviews and was curious . As I started reading , it reminded me of a movie- Gidget with James Darren and Sandra Dee . Gidget in this case was going to a party and was paying the person to be mad over her to make the other guy jealous and of course she was dressed to the nines . The same thing happens where the mad you want to made jealous is the one to be your date . It works out well in the end when the guy is mad for you and in this case he was already mad for her but she did n't know it . It would have been better if the author could have kept it clean , but the kissing is one thing , its another when your suitor pratically molests you at a party and your mom catches you . Come on ! I know that stuff happens , but really I happens far to much in many of the author 's books . If you want to read some great authors , try Nancy Lawrence , Regina Scott , Elizabeth Chater .	-1
Almost too sweet and cloying ... no real intrigue or development of plots or characters ... Too predictable ? But well-written , true to the period , and a pleasant way to while away some time , maybe on a plane , or a beach ?	-1
My other review disappeared , censored , I guess . I 'll try again . Do n't even waste the $ 1.45 on this book . The writing looks like it was done by a teenager , sentence structure so bad and terrible dialogue . I only read the beginning because it was so bad I could n't read anymore . I love books about people moving to other countries , but this was awful . The author apparently was from England , not the US , so her language is a bit different , but that did n't account for the poor sentences . Do n't waste your time .	-1
I enjoy and gravitate towards books about people moving to or visiting other countries . This book was silly and the author seemed quite proud of her sexual experiences while visiting France . I 'm glad I had n't paid a lot of money for it . : (	-1
I tend to rely on other reviews to decide if a book is worth trying out but was misled on this one . I could n't even get to the plane crash before deleting it . If the main characters are n't well portrayed there has to be something else to hold interest and I could n't find anything to redeem this .	-1
Ex porn star rescues two kids from a crashed plane hoping to get a monetary reward.Sorry , I could n't get past the first few chapters.Unlike Halstead 's other books , this one started so slow and unappealing to me that I had to shut it down and delete it from my Kindle.Sorry Jason .	-1
A so-so book . Not great in any way , and kind of cheesy , but readable . Worth reading as a free book , but I 'm definitely not going to pay much ( if at all ) to read a sequel .	-1
Neither scary or particularly interesting . Rather sophormoric and poorly written . Maybe she 's a ghost hunter , but she 's not a writer . Her experiences are n't even that believable .	-1
I do n't understand all the 5 star reviews . I really wanted to like this book - I kept trying and trying until finally finished , but all it left me with was a feeling of 'thank heavens that 's over ' . The plot starts out with promise but somewhere along the long becomes almost left by the wayside - like it 's getting in the way of the burgeoning relationship of Detective Cole Kincaid and Reporter Laurie . Which would be great if either of those characters were remotely interesting or likable . They 're not . We never really know much about them to learn to like them . Even Cole 's past is heaped on us in an apparent effort to give him some 'character ' but it does n't work for me . Just seems forced . For me , no character in this book was overly interesting or likable . The book was n't the worst I 've ever read but unless you 're stuck with nothing left to read , I would n't recomment it . Sad because I really like to support my home state authors .	-1
This book , for me , was a dud . Did n't like it . Did n't pay for it . Did n't understand it and did n't finish it .	-1
I expected more in this reading but , it was okay . This short story was exactly that a short- short about 39 pages . It was easy to get into but then seemed like too much was crammed in the few pages and the ability to connect , love , hate or identify with the characters just was n't there . It was a okay read , not horrible and yet not mind blowing let 's make this into a longer book .	-1
Very rarely do I really like first person romances , I like to get inside all of the character 's heads and I ca n't help but feel the author is just being lazy when they resort to first person . I was constantly pulled out of this story because of the use of first person , every description and action just did n't flow and sounded more like commands than natural observations or movements . That aside the story was n't terrible and it was short thankfully but I did n't find it particularly special or funny . I did find it a little unbelievable and naive of the main character to think this guy was her soul mate after spending a few hours with him where they basically did n't talk but hey apparently that 's her thing . This is definitely more of a suggestive romance than anything spicy or erotic and the whole thing is over fairly quickly with the usual romance misunderstanding causing the characters to break up only to end in a song so there you go .	-1
Kind of boring at first , lots of explanations and way too much telling and not showing . My heart simply was n't in it . I skimmed a lot . The plot was interesting but did n't grip me . I do n't know for sure what I disliked about it all ... maybe I simply do n't care to know the inner workings of a caf & eacute ; or something . The romantic interest for the main character did n't impress me much either . Overall I think the story came pretty much out of nowhere and I felt as lost as the woman from the story when she suddenly owns a caf & eacute ; and finds she needs to cook with magic even if she does n't know how .	-1
This book started out good , but then just got way to silly . I hate not finishing books , but almost didnt finish this one .	-1
It seems like I only do reviews for the truly awful books ... but I feel like I need to keep other people from wasting their time like I just did . There really are not a lot of redeeming qualities to this book . The writing felt like it was geared towards early teens ? ? The main character was a complete moron . A couple examples ... and be fair warned that there are some spoilers : She gets in all this trouble ... almost loses the cafe ... because her friend accidentally delivers the spelled food to the wrong person . So instead of telling them it was the mistake of her friend , she pretends that she screwed up . Then the friend never tells anyone and so thus we go through the extremely lame plot line of her watching the weird outcome and scrambling to keep her restaurant . Then the psycho ex kidnaps her ... but has no gun or knife..and she willingly gets in the car . Then the boy toy is tricked in to coming there but she plays along with psycho . Who in the world does that ? Everything was hugely predictable , no real magic , no steamy romance just BLAH ! Do not waste your time on this book . I feel cheated and I actually got this for free .	-1
I must agree with one reviewer : you do turn the pages quickly but simply to get to the end of this quickly . Mystery takes forever and the main character is just plain dull . Her side-kick and best pal is a characture and not in a good way.Add poor editing ( AGAIN in a kindle book ) to a poor storyline and you wish you had given it a miss .	-1
The plot line would make for a great short story . Interesting locale with pertinent historical references added . However , it is a sad time when I start counting the words in one sentence ! I got up to 82 words ! ! ! In one sentence . The stilted language was so distracting that I gave up . It is obvious there she had no editor , as even a grammar school teacher would have red-penned the life out of it . Give us more of the well formulated characters and less pretentious wording .	-1
The premise for this story was interesting , but I found the finished product to be severely overworked . Too much story in too little space . Not an author I will be picking up again any time soon .	-1
Usually love hockey romance but this was on `` ok '' for me . Nothing about it sticks out in my mind . It was a suggestion therefore I read it .	-1
This free short story was rather confusing . It starts off with two men in a room . The man 's name is Kokabiel but they do n't mention the name of the other man . They are obviously both demons or so it seems . The scene changes and Kokabiel is talking to Lucifer about how she was in love with Her . They keep talking about Her like we are supposed to know who She is . Those two first scenes were confusing . The scene changes and it is a battle scene . Here was when it got interesting . The battle scene was written pretty well and then it was done . It was basically the battle between good and evil . It was Kokabiel against an angel . He kills him , but then feels remorse for him . The next scene was Kokabiel back in his room with the same man from the beginning . The sex scene at the end was pretty good as well but that is about it . This author knows how to write sex and battle scenes . Everything else sucked . That 's all .	-1
Barbara Elsborg is an amazing author in her genre , which is typically erotica . Her books are full of mystery and romance , her characters are smart and well written , not to mention funny , bright and heart-warmingly endearing . But this book fell flat in almost every way . The writing was good but the plot line was terrible ! The other reviewers , for the most part , wrote good reviews , which convinced me to get the book but looks can be deceiving , do n't be fooled ! Only one reviewer talked about the amount of rape that was in this book and that was it ! There was so much abuse in this story it got old after awhile , not to mention I think that it is nightmare worthy . By the 35th chapter enough was enough ! Keep in mind there are 40 chapters in the book plus an epilogue so most of the book is immersed in this ongoing horribleness.My take : This book goes through many twist and turns that add to the plot and create what I guess would be a good thriller but the heroin never received a chance to truly succeed over the bad guy and defeat evil which to me is just a bad book.Basic plot : young woman is basically a shut in because of poor parenting , loveless home life growing up and raped when she was 16 years old . She has pretty much cut herself off from the world to try and stay safe ( this makes the detectives jobs really hard when trying to develop a character base for finding her later on in the book ) . Crazy psychopath brakes into her apartment saying that he is going to marry her , beats her up and kidnaps her . She tries to escape several times but is unsuccessful . This crazy man kills an older gentleman who tries to help her and rapes her for the first time ... it gets worse from here and we are only in the first third of the book . The story takes you through several states and a lot more rape that is very detailed . Crazy guy drugs our heroin and forces her to marry him in Los Vagas and then goes on to kidnap a 3 year old little boy . Turns out that crazy guy was the same man that raped her when she was 16 . She got pregnant but lost the baby . Crazy guy tries to create a family in place of the family he lost when he was a boy ( his mom was murdered along with is brother , but this comes out much later ) . So on and on the story goes until our hero finally comes into play . We learn bout our hero as well throughout the book along side our `` ode to rape '' storyline and why he is so obsessed with crazy guy . He tracks crazy guy to Colorado and he meets h and little boy there . but it is like chapter 30 before any of this happens and by that time the little boy is brainwashed into thinking that crazy guy and h are his new mommy and daddy and every time h tries to correct the little boy she has the crap kidded out of her . By chapter 35 h and H have escaped and the little boy is finally back with his family but this poor woman is so traumatized by this whole thing that she refuses to speak with the police . Our H breaks through her shell and then magically h gets over being raped , tortured and kidnapped just like that and sleeps with our H. WHAT , that is the stupids thing I have ever heard . That is just not possible ! ! ! So within the last five chapters the story line has come along enough that h and H have developed a relationship and can defeat the bad guy and our epilogue has them living happily ever after one year later . Now is it me or is it a complete and udder miracle that h does n't need intensive therapy after all of this and she can have a normal marriage with our H. Of course the two main characters never say `` I love you '' to each other , not even once but I guess that is to be expected . =/So if you 've stayed with me this long I applaud you ... this was a long rant but come on this book was horrible . I have loved most all of Barbara Elsborg 's books but this was so not like what she normally writes . Skip it go as far away from this book as possible . YUCK !	-1
This is a short story that hints at a bigger story and leaves the reader thoroughly unsatisfied . I guess there was a plot and a point , but I 'm struggling to understand what that could 've been.I was very lucky to get this when it was free on Amazon .	-1
This book was very poorly written ... what is the problem with editing ... .hit me up or something ... it was terrible . The story left a lot out left you wondering what , why , hell who - just not good ... but hey what do you expect for free .	-1
This read like something was to come ... it never came . Maybe it will show up in part two . 2 stars for the time the writer invested .	-1
I did n't really care for the first book I read but the glutton that I am , I decided to give this series one more shot . I should have listened to my gut instincts and not wasted my money.Who in their right mind would be celibate for 10 years after having a great sexual m & eacute ; nage relationship ? Come on , let 's get real . If I were seventeen and going to college , I would still date if only just to forget the guys I left behind.I HATED when Patrick described how it felt when he and Sim shared different women and she blurted out she only slept with the two of them . Please spare me from pathetic women . At the age of 27 years old and she had no one in her life for 10 years . The reality check bounced on this one.She left the small town to make something of herself but the book only went as far as saying she went to vet school ... did it take 10 years for her to complete vet school ? How did she support herself while she was away ? She must have had a job but then did she just up and quit that job to move back to the little town she hates so much ? Why did n't she plan ahead and talk to ol ' daddy herself ? Instead she leaves everything up to mommy dearest which from the sounds of it , did n't have any pull with daddy ( doormat comes to mind ) . Then daddy told her he would n't give her a job ( Mommy the doormat has no say in this ) . Which I did n't understand because what over protective dad would n't give his daughter a job ? This just screamed WRONG on so many levels ! Again , SAVE me from pathetic women ! I did n't care for the Heroes much either ... how can they love the heroine when they share her with a couple of friends ? These guys served together in the Navy but Sim was only in for 3 years before he was discharged and Patrick was in for 5 so they did n't know these guys too long . I served in the Navy for 22 years ( and 2 wars ) and I still have a great friend/battle buddy that I hang out with about once every 9 months or so . What I 'm trying to say is I NEVER had sex with him and I most definitely would n't offer my girl or boyfriend to share . People who love someone just do n't share them with friends even if they did save your life or you theirs . I can understand the Heroes ' relationship with the heroine and even embrace it but not these add-ons ( friends ) .I thought I would have something in common with the Heroes since they were in the Navy , I could n't have been more wrong . There was n't any Navy lingo to relate to . It seems there was n't any NAVY ( or military ) research at all . I 'm wondering if the author looked up anything ( other than where the current conflict is ) . After reading this book it would have been better if the author had the Heroes go into the Army or the Marine Corps . First of all we ( in the Navy ) are NOT soldiers we are sailors . Always have been always will be . Active duty Navy do not have units ( there are some reserve units out there ) , even the SEALs have teams not units . The SEALs are the only ones that have covert operations and they are not gone for `` tours '' . They are on fast in and out missions . The author mentioned Patrick ` spent his leave from boot camp in his Class A 's ' ( which the Navy calls Dress Blues or Dress Whites ) or the friends were ` seasoned soldiers ' and ` Iraq and Afghanistan on multiple tours ' or even when they refer to coffee as the ` sludge ' ( no matter how thick the coffee is ) it is called Joe ( or a cup o ' Joe ) , and another thing , ` got your six ' is a term not used in the Navy and the only reason I recognize it was because of the time I spent with the Army ( 2006-2010 in Heidelberg , Germany ) . I now work at a VA medical center , and asked a few other Navy veterans if they knew what ` got your six ' meant and they had no idea ... now ALL the Army and Marine Corps veterans knew what that statement meant.I even hated the ending . She was so against ending up married and pushing out kids in the small town ... .what happens ? Yup you guessed it ... she even asks the guys to marry her ! I 'm usually not so nitpicky on details except when it comes to current military . These errors took the pleasure out of reading and I ended up grinding my teeth . This book was deleted as soon as I finished reading it .	-1
This book takes thedubious honor of being the worst book I 've read allyear . Fooledby the rave reviews , I wasted ninety-nine cents downloading this drivel to my kindle.Jade is supposedly a competent LA police officer . Five years earlier Mac Stryker was his training officer . Mac is morning the murders of hiswife and daughter and of course becomes a raving alcoholic . While Jade confronts an violent man in a car , Mac is too drunk to assist . Jade justifiably kills the man and Mac is booted from the force . Five years later , their roles are reversed and she is Mac 's training officer . Inthe mean time , someone is sending her boxes of dead flowers , trashing her house and stalking her . Her supervising officer hates her and is hotforMac . Mac meanwhile is hot for Jade . turns out that Jade 's sonis actually Mac 's also , theresult of a one night stand that was the best ight of her life . Unfortuantely , he has no recollection of it . The plot drags in Jade 's alcoholic father and fiance and a cross dressing commander . Of course , it all ends happily.This book is awful . The plot is ridiculous the characters cardboard . It veers from police procedural to very , very bad romance novel . For instance , Jade 's supervising officer is a proceduralnit picker except when it applies to her . She ignores Jade 's complaints about being stalked and flagrantly sexually harasses Mac . Jade is supposedly so intelligent she falls into bed with someone too drunk to know what is going on . Her apartment isburglarized and her child threatened but she does n't call the police . The dialogue is trite , the pace glacial and the prose preachy and boring . LA police officers should be offended . Every thing about this book is lethal . Avoid at all costs .	-1
This is a `` bodice ripper '' plain and simple . The reader must suffer through the two main characters constant longing for one another . The hero `` Mac '' molests the heroine `` Jade '' on every possible occasion . He kisses her or rubs against her while she resists her yearning for his manly chest to be pressed against her ample bosoms . I kept expecting to read `` NO , no , we must n't we must n't . No , no ! The zipper is on the the other side stupid ! `` Parts of this book were simply incomprehensible . For example , She is a training officer on the LAPD for 5 years who can not afford a babysitter and lives in a small apartment . He is a recovering alcoholic gambler who can afford a condo in a gated community and a housekeeper . He is a cop who returns to duty after a 5 year absence . I guess he was lucky at cards or mall cop pays better than I thought.The characters are weak and stereotyped . Jade 's Irish heritage is personified in her recovering alcoholic father who keeps referring to everyone as a `` Lad '' or a `` Lassie '' . The only thing missing was a leprechaun jumping out of the woodwork with a pot of gold . After reading this I needed a couple of drinks.But the most disappointing aspect of the book is the fact that the author , an accomplished police woman with years of experience missed a great opportunity to portray female police officers in a manner that would reflect their real contribution to a major city 's police department . After the positive reviews I had high hopes.Please try again Ms Bennett , but read a little Wambaugh , McBain , or Linington first for inspiration.The technical aspect of the book is it 's saving grace . Spelling and grammar are both well above the quality of the typical $ .99 book . So I gave it two stars for that .	-1
Was n't gon na waste my time on a review but then read at the end of the story what the author wrote about herself and starting a new publishing company ... ... ..good luck.This story had few errors so gave it 2 stars , but content wasa nothing ... ..the 4 & 5 stars it got have to be from people that know her and did it as a favor . Sorry , but not a thing in this book to rate 5 star , or a 4.As to the part she wrote about starting her own companybecause all stories out there are so badly written and all the same ... ... .her samples included in this book Where all about the same ... Breaking Through started with a blindfolded woman and a man telling her what to do . All the samples have that same vain running thru them . Sorry , but you put itout there and just letting you know how I see it . They read about the same to me , and there are some Very good erotica out there to read , still good luck with your business .	-1
I 'm glad this was free , I 'd been so mad if I had paid for this nonsense . This should n't be called a novel there are places on line where you can get much better stories.Absolute turn off .	-1
Another short story that would be nothing without the fornication.It was n't completely awful , but it did feel rushed . So instead of phrasing things differently or allude to sex , more emphasis was put on the sex at the expense of the plot.I would have liked it better if it had chosen to do one or the other , certainly not both .	-1
If you ca n't play the guitar , do n't start a rock band until you can . If you ca n't write , do n't publish an ebook until you learn how . I feel terrible about leaving this kind of review , but this is a prime example of someone who has some skill in storytelling but not the technical know-how . I honestly wonder if the author is 12 , because that 's how he/she writes . There are formatting issues all throughout the book on darn near every page . Punctuation is still a mystery to this author . So are plot and human relations . The book reads as if it were thrown together in a week , but never revised or edited . The sex is technically accurate , but 'technically accurate ' is the last way you want to have your sex scenes described . You should be going for HOT here ! The only good thing I can say about this book is , thank God I did n't pay money for it ! Based on the description , this story held a lot of promise , but that promise was just not realized in this edition . I seriously recommend the author take down this book , revise , edit and revise again , rinse and repeat as often as necessary until this story is so polished that it shines . As it stands right now , I would n't line the birdcage with it . I 'd rate it zero stars if I could .	-1
This book was very disappointing ... .I read the review on Frogslap.com , & thought I was downloading an Alaskan adventure ... .instead , after a few pages the language became foul , & the sexual content was OFFENSIVE -- tried to get it off my new Kindle & still have n't been able to figure out how to make it go away & neither could the man at Staples !	-1
Jessica Tandy ( who really deserves to RIP after all those years on Broadway ) has a boyfriend she does n't like and frozen dinners in an apartment back home . She has a whole host of Western world problems . I do n't know . I found it hard to care because she was so unlikable . Bringing up that earn gazillions a year when you first meet someone is n't going to endear you to me . Focusing on things other than herself would have been a great start , but the author obviously did n't want to go down that route . Instead the reader 's left with a main character they do n't care about and a book that falls decidedly short of the mark .	-1
The book description caught me , so I bought it immediately . For free ? ? Why not ? There are so many things I did n't like about this story ( I make 50K a year , what about you ? ) , but do n't have the time to list them . I will say that it sometimes read as though it was written by someone for whom English is a second language . Quick read ? Yes . Worth the time ? No .	-1
If you enjoy reading about any of the above , then this is the book for you . It is a compilation of traditional gore and horror with a softer human touch .	-1
A nonsensical storyline , awful dialogue , and bad grammar ... The time I spent reading as far as I did was too much . Save the time and skip this one .	-1
This was so brutally awful it was like a parody of a book . I 've read better character formulas , and certainly better dialogue , from grade school children . As a matter of fact , I am in awe at how truly awful this book is . I may need to go back and revise my other reviews so this one has the one star rating all to itself . If I could give it less than one star , I certainly would . It 's funny because at first I was annoyed , then I was insulted but then I was laughing so hard at some of the phrases and bizarre grammar that it became hilarious . So if it was supposed to be an ironic treatise on the written word and how much stock we put in the ability to communicate with language , then you 're a bloody genius . But if it was just your writing style , then the gods help us and please , do n't give up your day job ...	-1
I 'm not into Werewolves ; was a little mislead by the description . But it was n't overdone too much about werewolves , just not really my taste . But it was written well	-1
I read all of the reviews , and thought , what the heck , it 's free , it 's short , I will make up my own mind.The biggest issue that I had was the infomercial style conversations . To say that the interaction was stiff , superficial and one dimensional would be like saying that the ocean is a bit wet . Its also salty and contains a vast aray of life and wonders yet to be explored . Which pretty much sums up my feeling of this book . It had promise , but it was like a polaroid from the 90s.But as its free , give it a shot , form your own opinion .	-1
I have n't even finished this book yet , and frankly I 'm not really sure I will but I might only to get a good laugh . The writing is ridiculous Flint comes across as a robot and the author ca n't seem to find any other way to connect her sentences than by using the word whilst . Seriously ? ! She even uses it in dialogue , mainly Flint 's , poor guy , must suck to have no personality and lack any human characteristics , then again he 's supposed to be a shifter so maybe she thought she was being cleaver ? The writing is beyond amateurish , written in first person , I 'm pretty sure the author thinks we readers are idiots since she basically spoon feeds us everything.Here 's a little taste of what this book brings to the table : - '' No I 'll be driving home tonight . '' He answered.- His reply hit me hard in the face , like a plank of wood.SERIOUSLY ! ? I could go on with more entertaining tid bits but I guess you 'll just have to check out this delightfully dull story yourself . Be warned though , free might be too expensive a price for this one.Okay I ca n't help myself here 's a little more from good ol ' Flint : -I 'm happy that I got to spend four hours with the beautiful girl who stumbled into the bar , where I play pool . I watched your face while you slept , and I put my jacket over you to keep you warm.Why thank you captain obvious for the update !	-1
The plot did n't really make sense to me . It just all went too fast with no real depth . The author also uses grammar that is n't normal in every day English , words like sullied and whilst . There were a couple others but she uses whilst a lot and it was irritating because it always tripped me up . The Tribe name could 've been something easier to pronounce also since its used 2 or 3 times a page . I like when a story is able to be read smoothly . But overall if you want something to read it 's good and it is free ! The one really good characteristic of this author is the erotically descriptive romance scenes .	-1
the first 30 % was okay at like 35 % it got random at 50 % i gave up and quit reading it i dont want to read book 2	-1
Gertrude is a heavy-handed caricature of an evangelical college student . She sees a couple kissing , concludes that the woman is married to somebody else , and decides to follow them . Gertrude is also chubby . You wo n't get a chance to forget this , as Marquez brings it up a couple of times every page.The action in this story is completely unbelievable . Even the most judgmental evangelical I know ( and I do know a couple ) would n't assume that a man who was n't wearing a wedding ring was n't married to the woman he was kissing ( not all married men wear rings , for one ) and then follow a couple with the intention of videotaping and humiliating them . This story just seemed like an excuse to create a character and humiliate her .	-1
terrible writing . dont remember if paid 99 cents or if it was free . either way it was a waste of my time and money .	-1
I thought the stories were pretty blah . Like I said in the title they were n't horrible or anything but they were n't great either . The first one should have been called Psycho : The Booklover 's Version . I did like the second one though , Browsers . I miss used bookstores in my area and it really made me nostalgic for that feeling you get that he describes wonderfully . The way you keep looking because that Certain Book might be just on the next shelf . The last story was just kind of plain . It had the shock feel that has been done so many times already that you pretty much know what 's coming after the first sentence . Worth a read for the price but do n't expect too much .	-1
Not very interesting , a little dull and boring . Have liked some of this author 's other work but was disappointed with this one .	-1
First , let me say that the grammar was excellent throughout the stories , with the exception of a misspelled word ( `` harry , '' rather than `` hairy . ) Now that I 've given the positive side of this `` book , '' let 's discuss negatives . There was no meat to any of these stories . It was like the author thought `` I have a great idea for a horror story . I wonder how few sentences I can write it in . '' I realized these are supposed to be short stories , but they read more like synopses of novel ideas . The concept of the first story was intriguing , but thrown at the reader so quickly and summarily that you do n't have time to get invested in the story . The last story , about knick knacks was the only one that really worked well as a short story.I 'm tempted to say that I 'd be interested in reading a full length story from the author ( Scribner ) , but I do n't think I actually would . Every single character was the same . There was no personality to any of them that distinguished any one of them from another.Again , the grammar was fantastic , and it 's rare that I compliment someone 's grammar , so if that 's all you really care about , then this book is for you.In summary , the book was free , so I ca n't complain about the cost or ask for my money back , but I if possible , I would ask for the fifteen minutes back that I spent reading it .	-1
I purchased this along with all the other books . I thought it would be 100 pages about the story but it was nothing with very little devoted to it . I found it to be a waste of money , I already had the next book and did n't need to read those chapters twice . I was up to buying anything about the story but am disappointed that this is what I got .	-1
I liked the story of Falling Off the Face of the Earth , but the execution of the novel was a problem . There were just too many scenes of people having conversations that did n't go anywhere and doing things that did n't move the story forward . If the focus had stayed on James and his transition from the big city to a small town , then this probably would have worked a little better . But the storylines with the adopted sister practically every man in town coming out as gay just weighed the book down .	-1
I am a tad peeved because I paid for this book a couple of days ago and now it is free . The stories were extremely repetitive and did n't do anything for me . The book is fine as a freebie but I would n't pay for it .	-1
Was not for me . I wanted a cookbook and not the who intro to the blogger and their submitted recipe . I deleated it . Glad I did n't pay for it .	-1
I have been cooking for a very long time and really enjoy reading a good cookbook . I do not enjoy cookbooks like this as it is too narrative . I prefer well organized books that become good references when you want a new yummy recipe.this was not one of those books .	-1
I was looking forward to reading this short story , but there 's really not much here to involve the reader . And I do n't mean because the story is short or brief ; I mean that the content of it is flat and uninteresting to me . There is no real sense of the unexpected or of fantasy.The author 's intention and the outcome of this short are obvious from word one , and the fantasy/magical element is confined to the mere mention of wizard robes and a few magical spells . The overall storytelling felt predictable , bland , and almost factual in style , and could not gain my interest.The actual story Dorrin 's End is 77 locations . The rest of the download consists of excerpts from the author 's other works , but this short story just did n't grab me enough to make me want to check out the excerpts that followed .	-1
This quick read starts off great . You actually start to like the loser of a main character and the plot starts to get good and interesting , humorous and plausible ( in an odd way ... the megalocorporatons , that is ) and then it just ... ends . Huh ? ... press back button a few times ... no , I did n't skip anything ... hmmmm ... okay ... The premise COULD be a great story . This presentation is not even a teaser ... not even a virtual taste . It 's like the difference between walking into a doughnut shop and driving by a doughnut shop . Walking in , you 're enveloped by that sweet yumminess and you ca n't wait to sink your teeth in , mouth watering and toes curling in anticipation ( ok , maybe that 's just me ) . Driving by , you get a whiff of the baked goodness inside but by the next block you 're smelling the exhaust of that Mack truck in front of you and the doughnut is long forgotten . With this book , I would n't even honk while driving past that doughnut shop . The majority of the characters are flat , unnecessary or totally missed the mark , and it appears that the author just could n't follow through to bring the story home . You 're taken down a path and left in the middle of nowhere ... good luck gettin ' home ! This story , with a bit more cultivating could have been so much more .	-1
... not much of a tale ... not much of anything really . I guess it was supposed to be some sort of parody , but it really fell flat on most levels . The humor is really dull , and the story twist is barely there . Fairly well-written , though .	-1
With the rest of the series being so engrossing , this one was an eye roller for me . I just could n't wait for it to end ! ! All of the other mates in the series are very different , but entirely loveable . But Nero ? Just wanted to punch him in the mouth and tell him to get a grip or get the hell out ! I also found it hard to digest that Maverick , who has n't any patience with much of anything , seems to adore this freak . But , not to fear . The books before and after are great , and I will continue to read them . Every author deserves a bomb .	-1
It 's really hard to quit on a book when you read the first installment and it was good enough to make you excited to read the second ... .and then you are reading this crap ( 2nd book ) and you feel like you are in the middle of some `` junior-high , romance jealous bull crap '' ! ! What does any of a love triangle , hippie commune have to do with the end of the world genre or the first book ? you keep turning the pages thinking surely we . are done with the `` Jimmy-Julie-Paula '' crap but NO ! ! We 're not . It goes on till the end of book and the big cliff hanger is Julie 's pregnant and Jimmy 's had a vasectomy ! ! ! wow , and I pre-bought the 3rd book ! ca n't wait ! ( sarcastic )	-1
I had trouble following the narrative . It felt like the author was writing to someone who knew what he was thinking and I did n't quite catch the flow . I honestly did not finish this one . It was too hard to follow . Was the main character psychic or just nuts ? Maybe I will try to finish it and possibly revise this , but it is n't one I would recommend to my friends .	-1
This initial short book , one of a planned series of books on the author 's theory , was fairly easy reading , with no obvious ( to me ) hallmarks of the normal self-help scam . I was disappointed when I discovered that this `` book '' was just a teaser - more to be revealed in later volumes ( number and prices undisclosed ) . So I think I will limit my investment in this theory to the $ .99 already spent . Could be a big mistake ?	-1
Review may have spoilers : I can not recommend this book.Heroine is a Mary Sue- three men are in love with her . She ends up hurting two of them . She rescues injured miners , helps the poor , educates needy girls , takes care of her orphaned step-brother , etc.Characters conveniently die off when their usefulness to the plot is over , eg , baby Daniel , her Gather , and finally poor Doyle , who was nothing more than a plot device.In addition Kindle formatting was all off , making for confusing reading as POV switched .	-1
I just did not like these characters ! They were rich cry babies who did n't actually have any reason to feel sorry for themselves . They were just annoying and I could n't enjoy the story around them . They would have been tolerable if they had n't been rich snobs , a fact which is illustrated in every scene .	-1
A bland plot with annoying characters that include a `` smart-mouthed '' ( not to be confused with `` smart '' or `` funny '' or `` likable '' ) reporter and two of the most stereotypical older people you 'll ever come across , coupled with an ending you can see coming a mile away all added up to a waste of my time . Think of Hollywood Scandals as the literary equivalent of People or US magazine and you 'll be on the right track . If that 's what you like , go for it . Unless my wi-fi goes down and I ca n't get out to Amazon to buy new books ever again , I wo n't be reading the other two books in the collection .	-1
The story was interesting and with a revamp or two could be better . The main trouble with it is that the girls are such brats that it is impossible to like them . In fact I was really hoping they would end up as victims . There is a small mark to denote a new section but the story could have been formatted a lot more neatly than it was . I actually think that stretched to novella length it could be a little better . The nurse side story was very interesting but handled way too quickly . Oh , a side-note to the author , it is ok to just write & # 34 ; she said & # 34 ; occasionally instead of constantly using other words .	-1
I try never to write a poor review because I know how hard it is to write but this story leaves me no choice . Between the subject , the characters , and the writing I Just can not find one thing to make this book worth the time to read it . Sorry .	-1
After reading this book , I 'm still not sure whether I liked it or hated it overall . I liked some parts and hated other parts . It was better than the first book in some ways , but worse in different ways.The story was certainly entertaining , and kept me turning pages . I really did want to know what happened next . So , in that sense , the book is a success in its own right , and a worthy successor to book one.However , this book is sold as a middle grade book , but I find it entirely inappropriate for the average middle grade kid . It might be okay for those on the older end of the spectrum , depending on the individual 's personality and such . I would definitely not want MY kid reading this . ( That is particularly sad , because the first book was well-suited for the middle grade reader . ) The book begins well enough , with Flea and his foster mother now living in a new town . If you read the first book , you know that much was expected . To my pleasant surprise , Flea has finally found a bully-free zone . His life is pretty good ; he 's even making friends . Of course he misses the North Pole , but he 's finally found a good school in the normal human world . Not bad.Then , the book angered me for the first time . For no apparent reason whatsoever , we sit in on one of Flea 's science classes , where the teacher lectures the class about how we now know that global warming is false . She claims this is `` proven '' and her reasoning seems to be that there is a freak snowstorm . Aside from the terrible science of claiming that one freak snowstorm somehow `` proves '' anything at all , the thing that bothered me was that a SCIENCE TEACHER was spouting this nonsense to a class of children . At first , though , I thought that this was obviously some major plot point - a stupid plot point , but clearly important . I was wrong . It is n't . It is just some throwaway garbage . We never revisit this concept again . Nor do we ever go back to the teacher and somehow weave this into her as a person ( which would make it a character point ) . Now , you might suggest that putting this scene in helps play up the oddness of the weather and how people are struggling to understand it , but I do n't think so . It struck me as nothing more than a pitiful attempt at political brainwashing . In fact , the scene was entirely gratuitous . ( If any readers are reaching for a dictionary , gratuitous means unnecessary . ) While I am on the subject of things that annoyed me , I have to mention that the grammar is terrible . The author claims that this is a revised version where the grammar has been cleaned up . If that is true , then I wince to imagine what the original must have looked like . The most persistent and annoying grammar issue was the author 's apparent hatred of `` a '' and `` an '' throughout the text . He either drops the indefinite article completely , or replaces it with the definite article ( `` the '' ) . This is especially annoying in wrongly-worded phrases like `` all of the sudden '' and `` in the matter of minutes '' ( both phrases he overuses to the point where you could make a drinking game out of finding them ) .Also , another issue was stupid inconsistencies . Is Scruffy a male or a female ? If you go by the pronouns , Scruffy must like getting gender changes often . We also have name inconsistencies , where someone is doing something and then some other name will continue the action . As a result , you are wondering whether the characters are randomly name swapping or whether you missed some crucial bit where two characters actually switched places or something.So , anyway , we get to the North Pole , and the book annoys me again . Do n't worry , I wo n't spoil any major plot points here . So , Scruffy invites Flea to come visit the stable anytime . Then , just a few short pages later , Flea is bored and has nothing to do because all his elf friends are hibernating . So , you 'd think he would pop in and visit Scruffy , right ? Nope . He chooses to remain bored instead . He also does n't explore the rest of the North Pole village . He has a reason for avoiding the Ice Bank ( fear of what could happen to him if he gets too close ) , and of course he has n't earned entrance to the Toy Factory yet , but the rest of the North Pole is wide open and much of it unexplored . This is why Flea sits around with nothing to do for days . But then , later , when things get busy ( he 's back in school and his elf friends are awake ) , THEN Flea decides to find some time to visit Scruffy . Go figure.And , of course , we also invoke the maxim that Flea 's questions must remain unanswered . We 're used to Niko refusing to answer Flea 's questions ; we all know he never has time for anything but expounding on how he does n't have time for anything . But , when Flea confronts Santa with a direct question , you 'd think a simple `` yes '' or `` no '' would be in Santa 's capabilities . ( A `` maybe '' or `` I do n't know '' might have sufficed , if that were actually the answer . ) Fair warning : the ending is grisly . Many readers will be very upset by it , especially the younger ones.I also believe that many younger ones will be very upset about how the author handles Rudolph . In fact , I 'm older , and I was , well , let 's just say not pleased.Some of the smarter younger ones will pick up on the fact that Santa is a liar , too . I do n't think you can do anything worse to the Christmas legends than turn Santa into a bald-faced liar . It 's subtle and most kids probably wo n't realize it , but there will be those that do . I imagine most young kids wo n't appreciate it.On the plus side , this book does a better job of explaining the motivations of the secondary characters than the first book did . I spent less time shaking my head and wondering why someone would do this or that thing . This area could still use some improvement , but it is leaps and bounds better than the first book.This author 's ability to keep me hooked and turning pages despite not really liking many of the places we were going on the journey is truly remarkable . I have to give him kudos for his storytelling talent . I can find no fault with his execution.The problems all lie within the content itself.There is currently a fad for twisting classic and traditional tales and icons . This book caters nicely to that crowd . Unfortunately , that fad is primarily an adult phenomenon , and this is marketed as a middle grade book . As I said at the beginning , I think this book is not appropriate for a middle grade audience .	-1
It ok book	-1
I couldnt get into this book . I wound up not even finishing it which is something i never do . Its a shame really	-1
Let me say that I love my animals . We have 3 dogs ( 1 that 's 16 1/2 yrs ) , 3 cats , 2 pet ducks and 1 pet chicken . I just could n't get into this book and I really wanted to . I got this for free so I 'm not out anything but I just thought this book was just too 'cutesy ' . Sorry ... my opinion .	-1
When I came across `` conscious '' when the author meant `` conscience '' , I could read no further . Time and again the author made egregious errors ( `` to '' for `` too '' for instance ) , and finally I had to stop , delete it , and go on to another author.Too bad , because Gallowglas shows a lot of promise as a writer . Needs a good editor .	-1
This is the first time I have been led astray by CleanRomanceReviews.com . This is a review of the Kindle edition . I have no idea how this book made it on the USA Today Bestsellers list . It is in SORE need of editing , both for content as well as sentence structure and grammar . I felt like I was reading a book that was written by two or more people . I was reading along , minding my own business , and wham ! Here 's a vivid description of what was under the h 's nightgown . ( What ? ) It was weird and out of place . Then , I was blessed with frequent gems such as : `` They would always been so close . '' ( Huh ? ) Not well written , not particularly a good story . I do not recommend this - it 's going back .	-1
Did n't finish the book . It was very confusing . I lost interest in the third chapter . I am at a lost for words .	-1
The plot looked interesting so I decided to give it a try . Really wish I had n't . The writing is not good , the editing is lousy , and the story is boring . If you are looking for a good read this book is not for you .	-1
the writing is pretty awful and the story is never thouroughly hashed out . the cadance of the dialoug is so off putting that i found it hard to read . while the actual love scenes were fine , the sexual nature of the characterss thoughts prior to the culmenation were a little too graphic .	-1
This book started out with 2 interesting characters who might just be perfect for each other ( it is a romance novel , after all ) but face a long road before they get there . The writing is not bad : she brings the characters to life in the initial chapters , setting the stage for what could be a complex story of growth and healing . Her writing style is pleasant to read - not choppy or overly simplistic , and her wording is varied without sounding like she 's trying to throw in words that do n't fit just to show off . i had some hope . i did.At least in the start . At this point , i do n't think i can even finish this book without heavy drinking.For a book that deals with the human heart and the healing of emotional wounds , the author just ... falls completely short . i would wonder if she has ever actually met or spoken to a woman who has survived an abusive relationship , even once . The idea that a woman who has been so savagely abused in so many ways that she was driven to desperation and violently fears and distrusts all men can just simply choose overnight to blindly trust everything and everyone and throw herself into glee after a matter of a mere 3 months is beyond my ability to suspend disbelief . Not to mention the many times Our Hero mentally compares her to a child while struggling to control desire - wow creepy . While i am all for believing in the healing power of love and the discovery of true passion ... Our Heroine lusting after our hero like a cat in heat is a bit much - the author is trying to create anticipation and tension and it comes off as just ... kind of gross , not to mention the above mentioned completely unbelievable personality switch.If you need the author to have and maintain any sort of grasp of the characters you are supposed to identify with ( which i clearly do ) i would suggest you skip it . Wish i had .	-1
I am a big fan of vampire romance novels and was given a complimentary copy of this to review . Overall I felt the story was too short and did n't give any background information on the characters . We are immediately thrust into the story near the culmination of the characters relationship . Since I did n't feel that I knew the characters at all , I did n't really care what happened to them . There should have been more information included on each characters background . Characters also just appeared with no information on them at all . The author also gives us no real understanding of his vampire world and what the vampires ' capabilities and limitations are . Overall I would not recommend this book .	-1
Valor was n't a very long book , but it felt long . I think that 's because the action was slow to begin with and did n't really start until a third of the way through the story . Plus the style in which the story was told made it seem longer , which I 'll explain in the next paragraph.The one thing I dislike about stories in first person is that more often than not , the MC comes across as flat with no personality and ` tells ' the story instead of describing the scenes with emotion and sensation . Unfortunately , that is exactly what happened in Valor . I never feel drawn to MacKenzie because it 's like I 'm reading a technical paper when she describes everything , including describing any action taking place . It 's always ` I did this , and then this happened . ' One example is when MacKenzie is in the gargage near the beginning of the story and another one is part of the big scene at the end.I realize many people do n't care if a story is written in a telling , monotone manner . But bland , flat writing is a big peeve of mine . If it happens once and awhile in a story , it 's not so bad , but throughout the whole book , and I mean the whole book , not just sometimes , is really unacceptable , I do n't care how good the plot idea is . Show ; do n't tell us readers the story.Continuing on with the lack of descriptors , there 's no ` emotion ' whenever the author has MacKenzie go into internal dialogue , and boy is there an overwhelmingly large amount of internal chatter going on with MacKenzie . It felt like a teenager talking or texting non-stop . It 's not just because MacKenzie is emotionally 'detached , ' which is OK for a character , it 's the way the author does not convey feelings or sensations through MacKenzie 's thoughts and speech . The author again tells instead of shows us MacKenzie , that is not a 'detached ' character , that is poor writing . The dialogue scenes are few and the action scenes are n't described in a way that makes me feel a part of them.I ca n't really tell you much about MacKenzie other than she 's got red hair , the gargoyles consider her a witch , and that she does the usual teenage girl angst over Valor . ` Does he like me ? Or does n't he ? ' MacKenzie 's angst moments came across as artificial ; it was as if I could see the author thinking where more drama could be inserted into the plot . The whole situation between MacKenzie and Valor was a typical romance formula.The gargoyles on the other hand were a great idea . I loved their background history and the harpies , also the names of all the gargoyles . It was fun to read about the pack 's reactions and adaptation to their new world.The author had a bad habit of jumping days and time in the story without notice so it sometimes took a while to figure out where the story is in the timeline . The story could jump forward or back without any warning ignoring the use of any chapter or paragraph separators to help the reader figure out where we are in time . At one point the story switched forward in time , then backward , then back to the present and then into the future all within four paragraphs . It was very confusing.The formatting had some problems . Dialogue between two different people often ran together in one paragraph , making it difficult to tell who was talking . Pages where not completely filled with text , sometimes only filled with a couple short paragraphs leaving the rest of the page empty , but continuing on the following page.The author had a good idea when creating Valor , with the history of the gargoyles and the names . I think this story would have been much more interesting if the author had concentrated on developing the plot about the gargoyles , the harpies and possibly the nefarious activities of her step-father . Instead the author focused on the teenage angst of MacKenzie and this story turned into a simplistic teenage romance when it could have been so much more . If you 're interested in teenage romance stories and do n't care how simple the writing is , than you 'll probably like Valor . The story unfortunately , does n't have much action and the writing style is too flat and dull . This was the most disappointing , and glaring flaw with this story , the telling rather than the showing.The flaws outweigh the good idea the author had about gargoyles and harpies . I can only give Valor 2 stars	-1
i like bosch , but so hard to get into a story that just ends ... ..i guess a good quick read ... . ok	-1
Sophisticated Stephanie has spent most of her life proving that she is worthy to take over her father 's business . Little did she know that the foundations of her world begin to shake when hunky Quintin storms into her office to insist that she breaks off her relationship with his 17 year old son , Rob . Rob who ? ! ? ! The pair then tries to find ways and means to get rid of Rob 's fixation on Stephanie . Quintin then slowly begins to realise why Rob is so fixated with Stephanie , but will he be willing to clash with his son over Stephanie 's affections ? What a pity . The beginning of the book started off with quite a lot of promise , but unfortunately , the story started to falter and limp its way to a rather bland conclusion . A rather bland read and I was barely able to finish the book ( and only did so as I had nothing better to do that day ) . You really just wanted to smack some sense into all the characters and tell Rob to grow up and stop being a whiny kid .	-1
I tried getting into this book and it felt really boring and unrealistic . I should 've known better than to download it when I saw the super long description on the book main page , but since it was free , I decided to give it a chance . Even for free , I feel that I wasted my time and had a hard time finishing it . I do n't see how a woman like Stevie , or at least how the author portrays her , would allow the things to happen to her that do in this book . One moment she feels very intelligent and strong , and the next she reverts to being like a child.It was really cliche and predictable when she sleeps with the father . Who would do that after the father accuses her of trying to get his son ? I know it happens a lot in books , so I was hoping deep down that she would be a little better rise above what usually happens.I feel if the author would add some depth and have it not be like a carbon copy of the usual outline of these types of stories , I probably would have rated it a tad bit higher .	-1
Normally I love this author , but this particular book did n't have much of a plot and I did n't like the characters as people . The best part of the story was when he discovered that the sarcophagus was an old movie prop but had the discretion to not immediately blurt out the fact . There was some story tension going for a bit there . Maybe a murder would have helped . Or his soon-to-be-ex could have shown up on the scene . I dunno . Lacked drama . If a book cuts back in drama it should up the romance factor . Moonlit strolls on the beach while discussing one 's philosophy of life , I mean , not more sex scenes ... ; ) Oh , and he should officially break up with the person he 's LIVING with before getting a new partner.Josh Lanyon is a GREAT author , make no mistake , this one just did n't do it for me . I think his most scary novel was `` A Ghost Of A Chance '' . That was shuddersome ! I had to get up and turn on the lights at one point , actually.A Ghost of a Chance	-1
. . . but I did n't . There are quite a few flaws in this book , the most obvious being : Scene breaks/transitions -- there are a few , but for the most part there are n't any ; Poor editing , the book is riddled with instances of wrong word choices -- I suspect from over reliance on spell checking programs , since the things I 'm referring to are things like using `` he '' in place of `` the , '' `` hear '' in place of `` her '' and `` to '' in place of `` too '' ; the final glaring problem I 'll mention is the fact that the story reads like a mish-mash of `` Firefly '' and `` Battlestar Galactica '' with a dash of genetic engineering horror added in for a Geiger-esque effect.It 's rather disappointing .	-1
Not even a good space opera . I kept reading long after I should have deleted it waiting to see if it developed . Do n't waste your time .	-1
This book has a great premise . A young girl get 's locked inside a home that has a security system designed to keep intruders out . But , nothing about the security system is really meant for the intruder to be inside the house . So , when she ends up locked inside with her friends little brother and sister , she has to keep them safe from two killers.The start of the story is a little slow and I felt like it could have gotten into the action faster , but once the action started you really want to know what happens.There were a few things that deterred me from really liking this book . First off , there were multiple typos and grammatical errors . This really pulled me out of the story , especially in the beginning when it was a bit slow.The other thing that pulled me out of the story was that it would suddenly switch from one persons point of view to the next . It was confusing and I had to go back and read it over.This story has promise . I really did like the storyline and think that with some editing it could be a really great book .	-1
The writing could not lack more emotion if it had been Mr. Spock who had penned this mess . This is so far removed from dog-like grace that I found myself wondering if the author had ever even seen a dog let alone lived with one . At least the whole $ .50 went to a good cause .	-1
Unless you get it Free , and even then , it is not worthy of your `` reading '' pleasure and time.This writer needs an editor big time .	-1
This is a short that continues where something left off or is intro to something coming . Or , perhaps a little of both.The story ( due to prequel status and also as after status ) is not a complete story . The characters were fleshed in prior story and are pretty unknown to any not reading first . The end is not a finish - but a `` cliffhanger '' to be continued next book . Is outlined as prequel in description so fine.Still , the character fleshing could have been better for any not reading first . As one is expecting cliffhanger due to description - the rest could have included a bit more back story . So that any wishing to read this and one following could read as stand alone ( when combined ) . Without having to read first one to have running start when going to next . Even in series types stand alones are stronger in my opinion . I do n't mind reading serials - but prefer NOT being beholden to reading entire an series to gain characterizations of intergral players . A good example is the `` In Death '' series of books . One can read them in any order and still have a full sense of the major players as there is always some backstory to provide basis so a reader knows the characters right off . This short hinted at some , but left one wondering where some thought processes came from and what happened prior . Which can be great inducement if the writing is done well enough to pull reader to go back and start at beginning and purchasing that book too . I did not find the writing in this short particularly strong inducement to purchase further books by this author.The reasoning is due to some of the writing was disjointed and jumped about without smooth transitions . Dialogue did not seem natural ( to my ear ) in some cases . The overall plot was not cohesive due to the jumps between past cases of dead fellow , Roark 's wife 's past case , the case for the hiding agent or former agent , the disconnected thoughts between all that plus the human trafficking ( though it appears is all supposed to be related - if so ? Poorly relayed in less than cogent manner ) .The premise is a good one ( really quite good ) but this preview is not a good showing of ability . Story arc development and pacing need a lot of work . Though was fairly well edited.Christine	-1
Description : When Summer Showers moves to Whispering Mountain for a new job , she takes an offer to stay with her cousins-in-law Dillon , Denver , and Dalton Durden until the remodels on her house are done . Cue the menage quarto ! The Good : Summer is an enthusiastic partner , and the sex scenes are scorching hot with tons of variations . Also , I really loved Summer 's job . She 's a landscape engineer -- how cool ! The Bad : This book is basically a bunch of good ideas with no craft whatsoever . I can see the author 's raw talent trying to claw its way up here , but it 's buried under poor writing ( telling not showing , stilted language , weak character motivation , head hopping ) and underdeveloped characters . Ms. Alexander has an innate sense of structure , but does not have her storytelling basics down . It made for a very frustrating read.The Naughty : Erotic , foursomes , public groping , anal , trains.Editing issues : Minor typosPublisher : Siren PublishingLength : 166 pagesFinal Grade : DHappy Reading , Theodora from IR Book Reviews	-1
This slight book is a collection of Aesop 's fox fables . The illustrations are colorful , but not very creative . The fables are told in a straightforward way that will probably limit their interest to most children.Note : The fox dies at the end , something that may be of concern to parents of younger/sensitive children .	-1
Character development was a bit shallow , playing on some rather obvious miscommunication between MCs . A bit of an easy out , and not as good as it could have been . Story line was OK , but came together too quickly and too conveniently just at the end .	-1
SURRENDER AT DAWN is a very short story , timewise and length of tale . It has danger , unfriendly interaction , some sex , and a mutual parting of ways .	-1
I agree with other reviews that the beginning of the book is pretty long and by the time we get to America I could n't stand the female lead and I gave up .	-1
Not worth the effort to download and review . Would n't bother to read it past the first few pages . Pure junk .	-1
This book falls into the same trap that the Potter books do . It 's jsut not all that interesting to read about someone learning to do something . The faculty-student interaction is one of the dullest things that can be written.Other reviewers have discussed this at length , so i will curtail mine.This a free book . Its not awful . Get it and read yourself to sleep as i did .	-1
Lots of action in this coming of age S & S fantasy , but very little depth or consistency , in either character development or plot line . Despite the action , found myself yawning , anxious to finish . Might 've liked it when I was thirteen .	-1

This book was so-so for me . I thought it had potential , but that 's really it . I did n't even try to read the others in the series as I was disappointed in this one . I tried , really I did , but I guess it just was n't my thing .	-1
I just could n't get into it . The two protagonists were so bland and one dimensional it was a chore to keep reading . The good doctor was just `` too '' good , while the baseball player was just too perfect . The villain only lacked a handlebar mustache that he could twirl the ends of and the one love scene that I managed to make it through literally put me to sleep . I tried ... made it through 50 % of the book and that felt like a major accomplishment . It should n't be this hard . I almost bought the boxed set last week . I am certainly glad I stifled that urge ...	-1

Joe Burroughs was accused , tried , and convicted of a murder . He was sentenced to death and spent five years on Illinois 's death row . This is the story of his release . I gave the book only two stars because it has the feel of a series of newspaper articles , not the feel of a book . There is no emotion , just a statement of the facts .	-1
***Spoiler alert . You have been warned***My dear god , I should have known this would end up as a rant . Even though First Frost is barely an hour 's read , it left me sputtering and muttering for three times as long . My fingers are sore of making annotations on my Kindle . Behold , my opinion of this little piece of work.Ms Estep is writing in dangerous territory . Writing about a school for special kids with magical powers is tricky business ; it automatically reminds of other successful YA-series that follow this formula . Series like Harry Potter , House of Night , Vampire Academy , Fallen ... Just to name a few . Because of this , an author 's work , how original it might be , just looks like a fake . Like the author thought , hey , this is popular , let 's write something like that ! I 'm quite sure Ms Estep did n't think like that when she came up with the Mythos Academy . It 's quite evident that she put some thought in it ; the school inhabits all different kinds of mythological creatures . Even though myths ( yes , that is my newly invented abbreviation of mythological creatures ) seem to be the new angels ( like angels were the new vampires ... etcetera ) , it 's still a fairly new sub-genre , so definitely nothing clich & eacute ; there.Now let 's talk about what made my face go `` No you did n't ! '' . For educational purposes I will add some quotes from the book so you can see what I 'm talking about.We start our little story with our heroine in the locker room at school . We immediately get introduced to her special powers . `` I was a Gypsy with psychometry magic . A fancy way of saying that I saw images in my head and got flashes of other people 's memories and feelings off almost everything that I touched . `` Well , that sounds pretty cool right ? It definitely has a lot of mystery potential , where Gwen uncovers secrets using her powers . The Gypsy part makes me frown a bit . But we 're still on the second page , I guess that we will get more info about that later.We go through a bit of explanation of her powers , and I am still in happy YA land . Celine is content . `` Yeah , I was just that kind of loser , a book-smart Gypsy girl who sucked at pretty much every sport you could think of and probably a couple that had n't even been invented yet. '' Huh . There is the Gypsy thing again . Still have no idea what all that 's about , but I guess we 'll see . I 'm a bit annoyed though that we have another awkward and clumsy heroine here . Why ca n't they just be mediocre at sports ? Do they always have to be get a ball in their face ? Even though I personally am as clumsy as every awkward book geek , I do n't find it an endearing trait in a main character . Let us continue.Something bad and freaky happens . It actually had quite a shock-factor , which I enjoyed . Gwen 's reaction to said bad thing : '' And that 's when I started screaming.I screamed and screamed and screamed . `` Okay that is pretty awful . I 'm sorry , but I 'm not one for repeating the same word over and over again . I 'm a fan of synonyms . Or descriptions . I find this quite lame.A few pages later we meet Gwen 's mother . `` Concern Filled my mom 's eyes . She was a Gypsy just like me , which meant that she had a gift like me . `` Now this awkward . The logical conclusion of this sentence is that a person that is a Gypsy , must have a gift . I still do n't get the definition of Gypsy here . Call me racist , but I always thought Gypsies were those people that live in trailers and travel around the world with their families . So is n't it quite obvious that Gwen 's mother would be a Gypsy if Gwen herself was one ? Seriously , at this point I feel like I 'm missing out on some secret pact that Gypsy from now on is a code name for a supernatural person , like witch.A little bit bewildered , I continue reading . Enter grandma . Guess what , she 's a Gypsy . `` ... the same violet color as her eyes-as all our eyes were . `` Now that is freaky . Grandmother , mother & daughter all have violet ( ? ) eyes . First , I have never seen a person with eyes that could be considered violet , but even if we completely disregard the fact of people with purple eyecolor , I think it 's disconcerting that three generations have EXACTLY the same eye colour . But oh well , this is urban-fantasy , so I 'll go with it . For now.There is some family talk , some `` oh my god , my mother is so weird , she always talks about Greek gods and goddesses ! '' . Yeah , yeah , we get that . Pretty standard stuff . Unless your mother talks about killer unicorns , I 'm not that interested . We talk about volcanoes and quantum mechanics at dinner . Get over yourself please.Now we arrive at the most offensive sentence of the whole story . `` I did n't know then that this would be the last time I ever talked to her . `` Oh COME ON ! Seriously , this is not cool . You do not do something like this . This completely ruins the surprise in a horrible way . Really , I ca n't even begin to tell you how I feel about dropping such an important part of the story just seconds after an uneventful phone call . No dramatical build-up whatsoever . BOOM , hey , my mother will disappear/die ! Ugh.Let 's examine dear Gwen 's reaction when she finds out the bad news that she will never speak her mother again . `` I had started screaming again . `` Figures.Insert some self guilt . `` And cried and cried and cried some more . `` Are you kidding me ? There is really nothing more to say than `` verb and verb and verb some more '' ? ! Use it once , and I will be forgiving . Use it twice in a twenty page story and I will begin to doubt if you even put some effort into this . And if this story has ever seen an editor . Or a proof reader.Now , we come to the Harry Potter-style part . A mysterious Professor arrives at the house . `` She was short , with a body that looked stocky and strong inside her black pantsuit and white shirt . Her black hair was pulled back into a bun , and her eyes were a soft green behind her silver glasses. '' Right . Give her robes and grey hair , and who have we gotten here ? ... That 's right , Professor McGonagall ! And there is more , look what she has to say ! `` Because Mythos is n't just any school , Gwen , '' Metis said . `` It 's for kids like you . Kids with magic . `` You 're a wizard Harry ! Oops , wrong book.Our ever eloquent heroine has some questions for McGonagall . `` What kinds of kids go there ? '' I asked . `` What kind of magic do they have ? Are they Gypsies like me ? `` Well , DUH . Every kid with magic is a witch ! Or wait , you call that Gypsy . Wait , now I am confused.McGonagall vaguely answers '' It varies , depending on the student and her background . But the Vikings and Valkyries are very strong , while the Romans and Amazons are very quick . `` Ahhh , that 's how the Roman empire was so successful ! They were QUICK ! So when they were fighting Asterix and Obelix in France , they would just go like , oh-my-god-we-capture-your-land-so-quickly-it's-so-quick-you-didn't-even-see-us-coming ! And the Vikings were just like ARRGG , I 'm strong . I 'm gon na hit you in the head with my big axe , I 'm so strong . And Valkyries , that usually are pictured with wings , they 're not quick ! Nope , they 're just strong . Like tanks . With wings.How can you take this seriously.Now , enter the super cool classes at Mythos. '' Myth-history ? '' I asked . `` What kind of class is that ? `` Well dear , supposedly `` booksmart '' girl , it 's a CLASS in which you learn about MYTHS . It 's a very hard to grasp concept . I would n't understand it either . I looked it up on Wikipedia.McGonagall thinks it 's still a mystery though . `` Metis just smiled . `` You 'll see , Gwen . You 'll see . '' `` I guess she will see . `` Almost like ... she 'd known my mom or something . But that just was n't possible . I 'd known all of my mom 's friends , and Metis was n't one of them . `` It 's absolutely IMPOSSIBLE that your mother knows someone you do n't ! You know every single person in her life , from the moment she was born up until now ! I bet she has like , big photobooks with their pictures to keep track of them . Must be hard work to keep up with all the mail men. Gon na skip a part here , otherwise this rant will last forever.Mythos looks spooky , blah blah blah . They have Minotaur statues , big deal.EVERY SINGLE KID HERE IS LIKE SUPER DUPER RICH AND THEY ALL WEAR LIKE DESIGNER CLOTHES AND PLATINUM WATCHES AND DIAMONDS.I do n't make that up . It 's in there . `` I had n't quite believed Metis when she 'd claimed there were other kids out there like me , kids who could do amazing things , but now I was seeing it for myself . `` You have frigging magical grandma , and you do n't believe someone else can have some powers too ? No comment.Then there is super awesome guy that fights with swords . And please sit down now because this might be shocking ; '' He noticed me staring at him and gave me a slow , suggestive wink . Was he ... was he flirting with me ? He did n't even know me . `` No he DID N'T ! A guy that flirts with the new girl ! That HAS NEVER EVER HAPPENED BEFORE ! I 'm going to skip to the last line though . There is some more mindless babbling that really is n't that interesting any more . `` One thing was certain-my life was never , ever going to be the same . `` I agree . Mine wo n't either .	-1
Jennifer Estep will be greatly liked by Harry Potter and Twilight readers , and all young people that liked books from Kristin Cast ( Marked , etc . etc ) , because this author has put together all the right ingredients to please young adults : a young witch that has just lost her only parent , a mysterious college , a librarian that she will have to assist that already dislike her , rich girls enrolled in the same school that look at her coldly & an handsome boy that look at her hotly ( that 's why I gave it two stars instead of one ) . FIRST FROST , however , does n't qualify as a book , because it merely introduces the main character , explaining what is her `` Gipsy Gift '' and how she entered this nondescripted High School , where she will learn to fight a nondescripted enemy ( we only know he has frightful red eyes ) . PERIOD.I believe that this very short story could be described as a prequel , or as teaser chapters of a larger book , because it stops just before the plot starts to develop . I would be really disappointed if I had n't downoaded it as a free Book .	-1
The book started well enough , but soon got bogged down in itself . The transition of the character was clumsy , there were multiple grammatical problems including switching from first to third person in the same paragraph . The whole thing seemed rushed and as if were written by someone very young . The premise for the story was fine , but it was not very well-developed . Note to author : The name is HAN Solo , NOT HANS Solo !	-1
I tried to get into this story but just could not , I skimmed through alot of it , which in a whole this was a very short story , so really not alot to skim through . I just did not understand it at all and found it lacking everything ! Just kinda gross , as I could never dream of finding anything erotic about having sex among a pile of disgusting trash , no matter how drunk I can be !	-1
No pun intended `` Dumpsterotica '' was complete garbage . Amazon gave it 3 stars so I figured I would download it and give it a shot . It was listed as a romantic comedy on a page I subscribe to . I found absolutely no comedy in the story at all . I think this is more of a `` fetish '' story . It definitely was n't a story for me .	-1
Silly says it all . Amazon wants twenty words . Save your money . It 's about an old married couple that does n't get along . In the end they share a toothpick .	-1
The author was probably trying for an old world slant or a formalized oriental feel , but the writing style and story line really come across as amateurish . There were few to no typos , which I appreciate , but the story just left me feeling kind of flat .	-1
Not what I expected . Good thing it was a sort story as it was not very good . The characters needed to be more developed .	-1
None of the stories held my interest , even as short stories . This could have been due to lack of interest on my part as I do n't usually read any of the genres represented : Romance , science fiction , paranormal , horror . So sorry , but will not be eagerly anticipating further books from these authors . I do not enjoy reading stories by authors who use foul language in developing their characters or whatever they are trying to do by using it . Perhaps they need a thesaurus ?	-1
Not the style I usually go for . May be a good read to someone else though , so to potential readers I would say go for it .	-1
very predictable . no plot twists , nothing . better than staring into space , but not much.sometimes fewer words are better . really .	-1
All you have to do is go to McDonald 's or Starbucks and get a job until you land the job of your dreams . Simple as that .	-1
I only read the first 2 chapters . This could be one of those that just takes a while to get started but I was n't in the mood to find out . The storyline was n't my favorite .	-1
While the characters were likable , they were so cliched as to be boring . Anyone who 's read more than a few romances has read this story in a dozen different versions . Dowdy , shy librarian falls in love with a handsome playboy and does a makeover to win him . Everyone is amazed to find she really has a good figure after all . And they do n't even recognize her ? Hello ? Did her face change too ? Sorry , but there was no conflict , no plot other than will they fall in love ? which is answered almost immediately.I received a complimentary copy for review . Sorry , it was n't worth my time .	-1
Now the story for this series is not original in that it is easily predictable to the avid romance reader but what is gripping about it is that it is not quite the run of the mill erotica ( or yaoi if you insist ) The Good : This is a great start to a series . Though I thought i was going to be reading a manga on my kindle I soon realized it was a novella.The characters have potential , chemistry . Even though it was forced upon the reader to acknowledge it very , very early on in the book the author is consistent in her writing.There are not many spelling errors or grammatical faults . Those that exist , for 99c , can be overlooked.The Misleading and therefore very bad : This is one of the most frustrating erotica 's I 've ever read.And it is not the good kind of frustrating either.-This series has brought out the frugal , penny pincher , book bargainer in me in the worst way . The kind of way that refuses to give anything above 2 stars.-this book is 99c and about the length of a regular chapter . I know what you 're thinking 'That 's not so bad . It is only 99c ' . Do n't be fooled . Books 2-8 are all $ 2.99 . If you are intrigued enough to buy the whole series you will spend almost US $ 25.00 on something that , when compiled is about 9 chapters long.This brings me to my next point : -This feels like the rough draft for a much longer book : The world building is well done but brief , the character perspective is a bit one sided for something not written in the first person , the main character 's name is misspelled throughout the entire series , I saw that every . single . time . The beginning has it spelled as 'Maelstorm ' half way though the first book and right though the end of the series it 's still misspelled as 'Malstorm ' . I 'm dockin ' points for inconsistency.the internal conflict with the protagonist needed to be elaborated upon.- reading this book was like watching a plant outgrow it 's pot i.e . in desperate need of room to grow ! It got to the point where the story felt compressed and that is what , in my opinion separated it from being an erotica . It was n't rushed just very compressed . And that was aggravating because if that were the case then why not wait to release all the chapters at once rather than sell each chapter for $ 3.00 a piece ? If I were a fan I would feel like I was being robbed or at least taken for being a completely devoted fool . But I do n't like to be angry because of the frown lines and whatnot.Now if this were an actual manga I would understand releasing the story in parts because the drawing takes time . And i would understand the cost because the art would take time . But there is no art . Just a very interesting story being released a chapter at a time . And then even in mangas there are several chapters released at a time . Even without the drawing/art , it would read like a play with just dialogue ... I 'll end my review on this thought : I 'm not saying that the other reviews on this site , for this series , are all wrong but while you are eager to find out what happens in the end like i was you could end up paying very near $ 25 dollars for a series that , if compiled , might scrape by and pass as a poorly written novella.If you are a lover of books of all kind , like me , and you 've just about read them all then you 'll realize that someone is trying to make a quick buck here . I despise when authors do this or allow this to be done with their work.The thing about this book that really gets you though is that it 's a not raunchy , quick , steamy , just-about-the-sex erotica . There 's a very alluring plot with amazing potential with adds to the irritation . Every chapter/ book is a tease . They do n't end with cliff hangers alluding to a new book they end like a page break at the end of a chapter.The very same way this ( Maelstorm 1 ) 'book ' ends , all but the last of the series ends.I can not in honesty give this book 5 stars . Not when there are whole yaoi/ gay romance novels out there for the cost of one chapter.My final judgement on this book : Buyer Beware .	-1
Ok so here it is . He comes off as annoying , she comes off as spoiled and their romance is just so darn boring . Even the `` fight '' left me yawning . DId I mention how rushed everything was . It was almost like the author was trying to get something out in the mail in 20 minutes . I like the other books in her series , but this is not one of her better offerings . It was too short , too annoying and over priced . It can be read as a stand alone . If it were up to me you could skip it and go straight to book three . However , the start of what will be book three comes at the end of book two . And that is the only reason I have it two stars .	-1
I did n't care of Tara in Kelon book 1 , but I was hoping she would redeem herself in her own story . She did n't ! I was going to skip book 2 and just go straight to book 3 , but I wanted to read about Melron , one of Kerr 's brothers . It so was not worth it . Tara is certainly not afraid to use in feminine wales to get what she wants . I 'm glad I did n't read this story first , because I would have never read any other in the series . I also think these books are a little pricey for how short they are . These can be read in two to three hours .	-1
Disjointed , without tension . Nice idea but unformed . I got this due to reading Zombie trailer park , ( 5 stars ) . This was a let down .	-1
Could have been better planned and thought out . The characters left me cold ... Did n't get into it .Disappointed afterJeaniene Frost 's other books .	-1
Brought to you by OBS reviewer Heidi*Beware of Spoilers*Devil to Pay is another short story in Jeaniene Frost 's Night Huntress series . It originally appeared in the anthology , Four Dukes and a Devil . Cat and Bones are in the story briefly , but they are not the main focus . There is quite a bit of Bones 's Grandsire , Mencheres , though as the story is about a vampire he sired , Elise.Blake is hunting death . He 's been possessed by a demon for months and fears for the people the demon will kill using his body , and he feels unbearable guilt for the people he 's already killed . He will do anything to end it and knows that his death is the only way.But when Elise comes across his battered and foul smelling body , she refuses to let him die . She takes him to her sire , Mencheres , to see if he can save him , but is devastated to learn that he ca n't . Now they are traveling to the Salt Flats in Utah to render Blake 's death in a place that the demon will not be able to find a new host and will be forced to die as well . But with the growing attraction between Blake and Elise , will she be able to send Blake to his death ? This short story was pretty bland to me and it just did n't have the exciting and humorous feel of a Jeaniene Frost story . To say I was disappointed would be a huge understatement . And , it does n't seem to add anything to the Night Huntress series.The characters were boring and one-dimensional . I wanted to like Blake and Elise , but I just could n't connect with them.Also , I found the storyline to be pretty predictable . You knew that they would n't end up killing Blake in a permanent way , and you also knew that they would n't bring him back as a human . The happily ever after was written all over this tale and there was nothing that really surprised me.This review and more at openbooksociety dot com	-1
I read a quarter of the book and besides acting like arrogant idiots , these cops are the worst of the worst . They brag about the garbage they can get away with on duty and basically do very little else . They make the police force look bad . I 'm used to mysteries that start at the beginning or near the beginning of a book . This is n't one of them and I could n't get into enough to even finish it .	-1
This book was free from Kindle , so I chose to download it . It is the first of a series , as I understand . The book is simplistically written and not very entertaining . I would not read any others in the series .	-1
This book missed its opportunity to be pretty good . First almost the entire book is filled with Veronica 's whining internal dialog . She got to her sisters wedding and spent all of 5 minutes at it . Author missed an opportunity to give us the entire date and show us their attraction and interaction amongst the crazy family , which I did not see much of at all . She was a tongue tied and freaking out ditz the entire date and I saw no reason this guy would n't run screaming from the nightmare that was his date . Premise was cute , but execution was really bad .	-1
Why does this character exist ? At least , why does she exist in the year 2011 ? Perhaps in 1950 a girl was considered to be beyond prime marriageable age at 23 , but now ? Why does she put up with her family ? Why do they treat her like the dirt under their feet ? Why does she care ? She 's self-supporting . She did n't even need to attend her sister 's wedding , much less panic because she -- gasp ! -- did n't have a date.Why did I buy the book ? It had some good reviews and was cheap.It 's not worth it at any price .	-1
I hate this book ! I forced myself to get through it . Thank goodness I only paid 99 cents ! The story had so much potential , but the writing style , story structure and ending KILLED it ! The characters were too flat ... they told their story without showing their story . I felt no emotions , no love , nothing ! ! ! The writing was stale . I just HATED it !	-1
I should have read the description better . This book was just a little too far off of normal for me .	-1
The sheer timing in this book is off . The revelations of characters and the character insights are weirdly placed . It seems like this book is a victim of horrible editing . Once you edit you must go back and reread to make sure that the scenes still mesh well . This author really missed the mark.When placing characters in a room you have to be sure it makes sense when they magically appear in another room and these details make it even weirder when it comes to sex scenes . Where people are positioned makes all the difference between sexy and being some sort of pretzel contortionist performer.It 's strange how this book kind of teases you through it because just when you do n't think you can stand the writing any more bam ! she can magically write several scenes in a row that make sense and are well thought out , thus advancing the characters ' depth and the storyline . As I said before : a victim of editing , really , really poor editing . I would pass on this one guys .	-1
I can not believe that I allowed myself to read this book , or junk . I 'm appalled with myself . If you 're looking to get off , then by all means , read this book ; otherwise do n't . read it .	-1
I read the first few pages , only to put this one down and try and figure who the author is . It reads like a friendless 16 year old girl writing a short story in a diary to hide her loneliness . Dialogue is awkward and the story line is cheesy and trite . If this is writing then I would make a killing publishing some of the short stories I wrote in middle school ! Maybe I just hated this novella because I hate insecure characters . Most people have no reason to be insecure . You are who you are , people are either going to like you or they 're not- 90 % of the time its not up to you . Maybe you can relate to Jane , and so you are going to love this book . Either way- its your time . You can choose to waste it reading this book .	-1

I do n't mind reading a predictable story or characters , but I draw the line at this book . Took till half way through to get to the point of the story . Characters personalities were flat . Kind of book you speed read through to see if it 'll start getting better , but it never did .	-1
It was an okay book not worth the price there asking for though . This book should be free , luckily I got it while they were running a free promo . The characters are pretty boring and flat . The story line wasnt that bad but the situations that the two main characters get themselves into just seem unbelievable . It 's an okay story for being free at most .99 otherwise it 's a waste of money .	-1
This book had so many shoot-outs , I felt I was reading a script from an old episode of `` Gunsmoke '' By the time the author revealed `` who done it '' I 'd already figured it out ; I just did n't care anymore .	-1
The plot is okay but the writing style was not too good . The ATF agents run rogue ... get a tip from a snitch and run off immediately to corral some heavily armed bad guys on their own ... ..this does n't happen in real life . The pair keep running into thugs armed with machine guns but they can handle them just fine with their sidearms . Amid all this violence , the cops never take a hand . The FBI is clueless . Get real.This could be a good book but it needs editing , a pass on the Wild West nonsense shootouts all over the city and a more realistic approach to law enforcement including ATF , The FBI and Secret Service since this plot line was approached as a Presidential assassination attempt . I do n't think the author meant to write a fantasy.I 'm wending my way through the endless list of freebie indie books offered daily . I have found some gems but most of these books are not great reads although this book shows some promise of better things to come .	-1
It was just ok. No mistress ever just leaves with no drama ! Too unrealistic . It could 've ended in so many different exciting ways . Just not really impressed .	-1
This was a short story about an interracial couple , Bonnie and Conrad . The concept of the story was elementary and the characters were very one dimensional and lack luster . I just read the book to finish it but did n't feel interested in the characters or their lives at all.Beyond the base level of the story , there were so many typos , punctuation errors , and incorrect word usage that I wonder if the book had been edited at all . The editing , if any , was atrocious.There should be a new publishing commanding - `` Thou shalt not self-publish '' .Storyline : C-Depth of Characters : DBook Editing : FFFFFFFFFFFF	-1
This series was so boring . I got halfway through the book and I could care less who made it out alive and who did n't . It was juvenile , somewhat stilted and sometimes downright comical . People showed up with no explanation , did n't know who they were or where they came from . Characters seemed like they had the substance of a paper doll . All in all ... even for .99 cents , it was a waste of a morning for me .	-1
I 'm always reluctant to write a bad review because of the work that all books require to write , but this one was pretty bad , in my view.I thought it was a cheezy kind of book on self actualization , and the characteristics of self-actualized people , written by an author who seemed a bit too full of himself or his ideas.Worse yet , the book did n't really say much on how to become self-actualized , so it was mostly pages of descriptions that went nowhere . Thank heavens I bought it on a free day . I would not recommend this book to anyone.Instead , I would recommend that people who want to know more about self-actualization ( and Maslow 's hierarchy ) readAdrift : Seventy-six Days Lost at Sea , which is a wonderful true story that makes a beautiful point ( from stressful experience ) that Maslow 's hierarchy actually might be better upside down , with self-actualization at the bottom , not the top .	-1
Have you ever read a book , and the female just made you so angry , you just wanted to slap the book around ? I so totally would have done that if this book was not in a very expensive tablet.Seriously , this chicks name should have been Beatrice . *Tech 9 sang a song about it , look it up*	-1
The story and writing was n't interesting to me , and I did n't finish reading it . Unimpressive . Even as a free purchase , I regretted making it .	-1
Ok so you have cleared your mind , did you stay with Ryan or just used him as your toy ? You have to be really bored to read this raw material	-1
I like the Orchard Mystery series , so I was delighted when I saw that I could purchase a short story by Sheila Connolly for my Kindle at the low price of $ 2.99 . What a disappointment ! The very , very short story took 15 minutes to read , and was not up to the usual quality of the series . Most of it was backstory on the heroine of the series , and as such it made it more suitable for someone who was not familiar with the premise of the Orchard Mysteries . Unfortunately , I just got around to reading the story in November , and since I made the purchase in September it is too late for me to get a refund . This story should have been offered for free due to the length -- as someone else posted , it would be no longer than 15 pages if printed . I kept looking for the rest of the story , until I realized I had finished it !	-1
NOT FOR ME . I NORMALLY ENJOY READING TRUE STORIES BUT THIS JUST DID N'T HOLD MY INTEREST.DEFINITELY NOT A PAGE TURNER !	-1
I tried several times to read this book and found the repetitive way that this writer wrote this story out to be frustrating . Not only do you read the same lines over and over again but it is over explained as far as the writer 's processes and reasoning for changing some wording . Could n't finish this book but felt compelled to leave a review .	-1
Yes it could have been better . I think the author just rushed to finish the book and got a little bit carried away with the story line in her head . It would have been a great story had she taken her time . I will know more after I read the next book .	-1
This book has a good plot , but needs some help . In some places it over explains things . In others it doe n't explain enough . The dialog is short and choppy . I do n't know any 17 or 18 year old girl who calls their parents mother and father . Everyone speaks very formal . Its hard to relate . There are blatent editing mistakes . I had a hard time following the dialog because there are missed quotation marks in alot of places . Again its a good concept , I want to know what happens with Kiera , Cooper , and Amanda .	-1
I 'm actually a bit leery to write a review at the moment because I just finished the book and feel as though I must have missed something . This book was all over the place ! Mild spoilers to follow ... I do n't like to summarize books but the main story is that Clara lost her parents , lives with her Aunt and the book starts out with her mad at a friend named Eric for taking some pages from Clara 's journal . Clara ca n't remember anything before going to live with her Aunt , so as readers we 're left with very little information as to Clara 's past.After Clara 's Aunt is taken she goes through this big escape from the bad guys and ends up flying ( without question ) to Ireland with the old man she worked for in Louisiana ? ! Once there she sees a child in the night jumping/falling over a cliff and goes to investigate . She then follows this red caped girl into a cave and ends up in this other world . Again , not many questions run through her mind nor does she question her sanity as most would . Clara goes on to be taken by pirates , rescued by this bad guy Edmond who had her captivated for some strange reason not explained . She gets rescued by a guy named Finn , finds out she 's in this parallel realm/world ... and is STILL not asking questions ! In the end Clara defeats the bad guy by quoting scripture and having faith in God ? ? I did n't understand the Biblical references in combination to the mythology . How can you believe in both and make that work ? ! Clara quotes Biblical scripture then goes into different realms and enters Hades ? ! ! Explain that again ? ! The world building was seriously lacking ! ! There was so little explanations given as to what was going on it left me thinking I 'd missed something . I went back so many times to read the previous pages again just to make sure I did n't accidentally miss something . The foundation for this story was not well thought out at all ! I do think Mrs. Peery has talent for writing . The descriptions in the book were at times beautiful and breathtaking . The author had a way of capturing small beauties in life and nature and translated them into a beautiful description for the readers . My overall review is more like 2.5 stars but it would 've been a lot higher had the story been developed more with a firmer foundation for the characters to stand on . I did n't feel at all invested in the characters , and even Clara was hard for me to relate to . I just wish there had been more thinking done before this was published because there were ideas with merit , it was just executed poorly IMO	-1
I just had to give this 2 stars . I am not a fan of this author 's writing . The sex is over to quick and some of the characters ' actions did not make sense . Also , you ca n't tell which character is doing the talking , you half to guess . I will not be reading any more from this author . One more thing , the characters had to much head space . I hate to much head space .	-1
Although this is sold as a & # 34 ; story , & # 34 ; it 's more like a collection of scenes starring a generic action hero type character ( he drinks too much ! he 's a loner with inner torment ! ladies still love him ! ) and a barely-there plot . Nothing about this made me want to read more .	-1
someone might like it but I did n't in the end so I only one or two chapters in the end .	-1
As a general rule , I figure that a novel needs to have characters that the reader cares about . Even if you hate the character , that 's enough , and this novel has characters that are pleasant enough to suit anyone.And as a general rule , the setting needs to be interesting . Livi is in a small town flower shop during the VietNam era , which is certainly adequate . A brother has died in the war , a farmer has died in his field , loading a round bale on a Sunday.The author needs to have a full toolbox of vocabulary and grammar , so that the words have humor , grace and color , and this author certainly has that.In fact , this novel has everything it needs except an arc . This is a slice of life like a piece of cake : it just lays there . A novel needs to be a video clip , not a snapshot . In a stand-alone novel , the arc is about how things happen to change the protagonist . In a series , the arc is about how thing happen to change the characters surrounding the protagonist . InDelivery , however , nothing ever seems to happen.Because it has all those other elements , though , this might be a great book to read if you ca n't sleep . It certainly is n't going to keep you awake , wondering what 's going to happen next . By the time you get a third of the way through the book , you 're pretty sure that what will happen next is just more of the same.Obviously , a lot of hard work went into this book , by a promising and talented author . Given a plot , her next book could be a great piece of literature .	-1
In the first few pages it 's set up so that you know she will be accused of her ex 's murder before it happens . Then it turns into a silly romance novel . The heroine acts stupid , which makes me loathe her . I admit , I quit reading it long before her husband was killed .	-1
The story was alright , but very short . It 's about finding love during world war two , for two young recruits , and learning what gay was all about .	-1
The best flash fiction makes you feel it was just the right length . Not every story is the right one for this format.There was too much left out of this story , too much left unsaid . The tragedy of the situation is assumed , but not felt by the reader . I also did n't feel it conveyed a sense of the time very well . . . it could have been any time , any place -- not in the sense that a great story is universal , but in the sense that there was just too little to distinguish these characters and their setting.This is more like an outline for a story than an actual working story .	-1
The only thing I liked about the book was the first story anthology about a little girl over her best friends house . This story has a juvenile feel to it , but it should because it is about a little girl . The rest of the stories have an extremely juvenile feel to them when they feel like their trying to appeal to adult . The stories were all very run of the mill and there were a few who felt like they were the same story . I usually never feel that way , but this felt like a waste of $ 0.99 . None of the stories are frightening or even a bit creepy.I think there are about 6 volumes , but this one was the first and the last for me .	-1
I like the whole concept of the story , but wanted so much more . The characters needed more depth and development . However the storyline is intense .	-1
I have a big problem with being mislead . And this author 's notes were a tad misleading . For 2 major reasons . First- Everything that was in the author 's notes was n't necessarily in the actual book content . Sorry , if you mention it in the notes , should n't it be in the book ? And second , Amazon really , really needs to put in the book description that this is not a straight M/M book . It 's an M/F story . Ugh ! Boy was I surprised ! I love stories of BDSM , but only if they are M/M .	-1
I 've read better labels on cans at the supermarket . Very rushed , very choppy , not like the description ... I was very disappointed	-1
Should NOT be under romance ! The 3 women are completely stupid and sluty . One of the worst books I have ever read . Delete .	-1
Not as good a read as other books . It reaches climax too soon and leaves the reader wanting more even though it ends .	-1
One of those dumb books that 's just an excuse to write about sex . Generic sex at that . No real plot . Ca n't imagine how anyone could have given it more then two stars .	-1
I let the reviews sway me when I should have read the excerpt on the description page instead . It 's a fair representation of the bad pseudo-intrigue the novelette goes for . It 's an interesting period romance , but the writing is not clever enough to pull it off . The author goes for sparkling dialogue but the heroine comes off as slutty and too modern . The hero is overly concerned with his erection . If any line in the excerpt makes you curl your lip then do n't bother downloading ; you will find the rest of the book dull and frustrating . I got halfway through and deleted it . Download Heart of a Knight instead .	-1
A delightful story but way to short . I enjoyed the characters even if they were not fully developed . Not enough background was given . I will look forward to more stories by this author	-1
I can not rate this book book because I was not able to really get into the storyline . For some reason after the first two chapters I was totally lost so did not finish the book .	-1
I ended up reading 15 % on my Kindle and deleted it . It was just so dull I could n't make myself finish it . The story line seemed interesting , but the book inself was not .	-1
2.5 stars on this one.This was not the worst rendition of a Greek mythological romance but it was not the best either . It seemed a bit weak on story and heavy on sex and sexual tension . I did n't understand the dangling story thread of the wire that Simone wore to The Monsters Ball . It was mentioned several times but it had absolutely no relevance to the story st all.The book was spot on in how petty and cruel the gods were.My issue with the story was primarily this ... Simone was a virgin for twenty-six years and she , basically on their second date , begged Thanatos to show her fleshly pleasure . From virgin to vixen in one page . Now , that 'll give you whiplash.It was a quick and fairly uncomplicated story . The climax was a bit anticlimactic and the ending was a little on the weak side but it a quick and easy read .	-1
The premise was good , but not well developed . The two main characters did n't like each other good . Then suddenly the next day he is fighting for her , but they still do n't like each other ? I kept trying , but could n't finish .	-1
With all the free Kindle books available , I 'm sure there are plenty of other good books to read . After reading that she steals from graves ( since she is too lazy/unmotivated to find a real job ) , I gave up trying to read the rest of the story . Even worse than the disturbing lack of morales in the main character was the disjointed writing . It was like being in a car with a driver who was learning how to drive a stick . Stop and go and stop again . Between the poor writing and heroine 's lack of ethics , I could n't get past 15 % of the book .	-1
Found this to be childish and could not get past the third story . Maybe OK for a teenager , but this is juvenile humor .	-1
The storyline started off ok but the writing was rather stilted and did n't flow well . As the book progressed this became rather irritating as the characters ' conversations were n't natural . The speed of the relationship development between Savanna and Jason just was n't believable and the love scenes were poorly written . I struggled to finish this book .	-1
The story line was ok , but not great . What bothered me the most were the many , many grammatical errors . I was irritated beyond belief .	-1
Not worth the time . The characters in this story all started off experiencing a tragedy . It 's a mixed up triangle that never got off of the ground . Most if it was Savannah and Jason giving each other google eyes and thinking they had to `` help '' each other get through their sorrow , but I did n't see any of it . Every day was the same old thing . I got through it but I wo n't pick up any more of this author 's books . The writing was `` awful , '' no imagination at all .	-1
I did n't care for this story . I mostly disliked the main character and was irritated by his incessant babbling . It might have been better if it had been a longer story with an actual plot .	-1
I liked the way this story started off . It caught my attention immediately . Unfortunately , it quickly grew boring and way too repetitious.The main character ( the only character ) was well developed , but there was absolutely nothing redeeming about him . I soon came to despise him.If not for the author 's excellent writing , I would n't have finished the story . It had an atrocious ending.2.5 stars	-1
Fairly well written , so I gave it two stars ; but it had me wanting to pull my hair out by the end . It leaves you with nothing but contempt for the protagonist , Charlie , as it displays his OCD tendencies so succinctly you will beg for it to end . Thank God it was short or I might now be replacing my self-destroyed Kindle . Excruciating !	-1
When I buy a book on a topical issue , I expect the author to provide a balanced view , not just castigate the protagonist/prime character . This I read a bit , skimmed more , and finally retired in my Kindle Cloud library . At any time , should I feel that I need to take a second look , I can do that , but the negative approach turned me off .	-1
I read this but did not like it . Lots of swearing and sex . Recieved complimentary copy for review . Story line was ok .	-1
While the sex scenes were super hot , and the book is sex mostly , it seems like a very young author wrote this . Just the way the wording and the way the book flows seems like it was either written by a child or a very inexperienced writer . I do n't know if I 'll even read the second book , to be honest .	-1
Sorry , but these are short , and I mean short stories , called a series , that are all about sex with just a brief smattering of a plot . Anybody can write about sex . But this author could not even come up with a decent plot ? I noticed that all the books in this series are all very short . Why are n't these being sold at the price of novellas ? I 'm really disgusted with the lack of character development , scene development , and the shortage of all other descriptives that are usually included in a book . These are not books . These are little ditties , using sex as the marketing modality . Please , take down the price of this garbage to about 0.25 per short story and you might get some takers . But after they read the first one ... .I doubt you will have enough money to buy a loaf of bread . By the way ... .hire an editer .	-1
I did not like the writing in this little story at all . I believe that most high school honors english students can write a better story line as well as dialogue . There is a definite lack of depth to both the characters and to the plot . This , to me would be the initial story outline to be built into a solid , meaty novella . This author really needs more writing skills before she/he `` publishes '' again .	-1
i could n't get past the first few paragraphs . it opens with a sex scene with two guys . the author mixes up their names repeatedly . i took this as a bad omen and decided not to read on . for crying out loud if you are screwing up that early on there ca n't be much hope for the rest of the book .	-1
I really struggled with keeping my interest in this book . I kept putting it away in hopes of coming back with renewed interest . I was unable to finish it .	-1
How exactly does the author justify taking half a dozen King books , throwing them in a blender and calling it an original work ? There were recognisable elements of Christine ( two close friends who wind up at odds and a demonic car ) , Needful Things ( drug running and a re-named Ace Merrill in the form of Mike Menger ) , Cujo and several different short stories . Come on , Mr. Bain . Write your own book . This one reads like seventh grade fanfiction .	-1
The characters were very one dimensional and the mystery stalker was not very mysterious . I read through to the end so I guess that can count for something .	-1
Well the Titel and Cover of the book always got me curious..so when I got it for free I gave it a try , but the story was nothing for me . I found it boring . The Characters have not been intressting for me , maybe coz I am not much a fan of Rockabillie.The story I found also a little boring , too predictable .	-1
Did n't really care for this novel the beginning was strange and I 'm not quite sure that I 'd buy it because I did n't like the sample	-1
I hate to say this , but I think the reviews for The Wrong Path by Vivian Marie Aubin du Paris are overrated on [ ... ] and [ ... ] .Maybe it 's just me , but I did n't consider this a 4 or 5 STAR book.First off , from the book description I was expecting way more drama.Secondly , Annabelle , the protagonist , was n't likeable . Not even a little bit . She is a nave crybaby.Example ( SPOILER BEGINS HERE ) : Parker is not a nice guy . He drugs Annabelle 's drink at a party , with intentions of date-raping her . A few weeks later , after his first failed attempt , he tries to force himself on her again . Will comes to the rescue and abandons Parker in a parking lot . Annabelle wants to go back and get him . ( Him being Parker , the guy I just said tried to rape her twice ! ! ! ! ) I wanted to stop reading the book right then and there . Seriously , what is wrong with you , Annabelle ? ( SPOILER ENDS HERE ) Also , she places entirely too much importance on being a part of the `` in crowd '' . Not to mention , the girls who are a part of the `` in crowd '' are stereotyped from their freshly styled heads to their manicured toes . And , the people who are n't a part of the `` in crowd '' are all Goths and druggies . ( Can you get more stereotypical ? ) Agh , I feel bad for ripping on this book . I REALLY wanted to like it . Based on all the stellar reviews , I had extremely high expectations going into this novel , and they were NOT met.I gave The Wrong Path by Vivian Marie Aubin du Paris 2 STARS . I thought it was slow , lacked excitement and was full of clich & eacute ; d characters . If you are still interested in The Wrong Path after reading this review , then purchase it on Amazon Kindle . It only cost a dollar.-XOXOTO READ MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT : READING , EATING AND DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF	-1
I really did not get the whole point of this story . Um ... why would Mrs. Perkins want her dressed like that all the time and go out of town for long periods of time ? I like a good sex story as much as anyone but I like a story with my sex stories . This was mostly a pointless book and if it took two years for her to get some from her boss then maybe shes not all that with the huge tits .	-1
As I read this piece of feces , I kept hearing the voice of Charlie Brown 's mother saying wah wah wah . I get that it 's a short sex story , but there should be some sort of plot or something . I get the maid fantasy thing , but Jesus , put some thought into it .	-1
Although this one is the best written of the series , that 's not saying much . This seemed to have the most thought out plot and character development of the three ...	-1
I agree with other reviewers that feel the heroine 's actions went so far beyond the constraints of the social codes of her time ( especially given the girl 's upbringing , sweet nature and supportive family as implied by the author 's words ) as to make the book too unrealistic to enjoy . I am usually quite forgiving in such matters - if the greater story is well done , I am uncritical of minor slips in historical accuracy - so understand that this one , aforementioned departure , is quite egregious.If the author had made the setting a fantasy world and thrown in some additional elements to make me believe that this was a `` regency-like '' fantasy world . OK . If the author had made this a longer story so as to develop plausible explanations as to how the heroine could get to that point . OK.I thought the idea behind the story was a good one . There was potential here and I wanted to like this story , I just could n't get past the heroine 's implausibly salacious forwardness with the hero . I was unhappy with the quality of this book when I got it for free . I think it 's definitely overpriced now at 99 cents .	-1
I love vampire books and was really excited to read SNAP , but unfortunately it was just disappointing.Maxie Gwenoch is the main character who accepts a position as managing editor of SNAP , a high fashion celebrity conglomerate . The book starts with her being a strong , successful business woman.Jean-Louis is the handsome the art director and reveals to her the organization is run by vampires . There arent just vamps in this book but also shape shifters , weres , and demons . And of course they have a century old castle in Hungary and a feud with another Vampire Clan.My problem with this book is there is no development of the characters . No chemistry in the romance between Maxie and Jean- Louis . The moment she decides that she likes him she goes from a strong woman to a petulant teen . I really didnt like this book and I will not read the sequels . It end on a cliff hanger and I do not even care what happens next . Im so disappointed since the reviews were good and I love vamp books . too bad .	-1
Poor writing in my opinion , and its a fragment of a book . Basically I just paid $ .99 for what you can usually find as a sample . So definitely a one star .	-1
Maybe it 's because I lived in England but whatever the case may be , I have a hard time with words like & # 34 ; blimey & # 34 ; and & # 34 ; arse. & # 34 ; Maybe it 's because I never met blokes that actually said those words . Anyway , was the first tale 'dark and twisted ? ' I did n't think so . Is & # 34 ; have I got a surprise for you today ? & # 34 ; really a question ? I did n't think so . Move on.. there are too many books out there to choose from .	-1
Just could not get into this book at all . I tried flitting around the book , hoping it would be interesting once past the very boring start but just never found anything to sink my teeth into . No doubt there will be some who love it , but not me . Will revisit it sometime down the line and see if it catches my attention then but from what I read of it , I do n't think that will happen .	-1
It is not as good as the first book ( Overcoming ) but I wanted to find out what happened between these two lead characters since it was hinted in the first book they had a past . The book felt rushed . I did not like the update on the overcoming leads . I think it could have been better .	-1
I got this because I usually like Nevada Barr . I thought it would be fun to read something different by her . I did n't think it was all that good	-1
I can only assume the kindle era has put the pressure on established authors to dump any old thing out of their word processor and on to the market.This weird little story was n't particularly fulfilling . Nor was it up to Barr 's normal ability to spin an engaging tale.Short page counts from established writers will become my screen-out element to choosing something for my kindle .	-1
Roth Beowolf is a changeling protector . As the title suggest , he can shape shift into different animals and he is despatched by the thirteen princes to protect individuals from time to time . His latest assignment is to be a bodyguard to the petulant and spoilt Rainey . Rainey is a bundle of contradictions - intellectually smart , yet emotionally stunted , spoilt and petulant , yet soft hearted . Sparks fly between Roth and Rainey , but would both of them act on their feelings ? In the midst of the deluge of paranomal romances , it is refreshing to read about a romantic novel set in a different world and history . Clearly , the inspiration is from the mythology and tales of Egypt . The book started off with much promise - we get hints that Rainey is not the brat as she seems and Roth is not as unfeeling and cold as he is . Unfortunately , the characters do not really change much ( and at times , you find Roth a rather annoying twit filled with self righteousness and arrogance ) . The story drags on horribly and with all that words , it is rather surprising that you hardly see any sort of development of the characters or their relationship . The ending and conclusion between the characters were rather rushed and perfunctory . This could probably be to lack of editing or beta readers perhaps - which may have helped to tighten the storyline , delete the unncessary and correct some spelling and gramatical errors.Nonetheless , the whole concept does show some promise and I would keep an eye out for its sequels .	-1
The storyline was okay , but if you 're going to put your work out there for sale to others , please get it edited . The mistakes in this story take away from it .	-1
Not happy with this , first it is not a complete work , but something that equates to the beginning chapter of a larger piece to come , but as far as I know may never be finished . The premise was interesting and the writing well done but I wanted the whole thing not a teaser !	-1
Well I was enjoying the book until I got to the weird dream part and it just went down hill from there . Yes I might like to know how this end but I do n't think part 2 is going to sing to be either .	-1
This book took off with a very strong start : Abby discovers a girl drowning in the water , but is unable to save her . It 's a really good way to put someone right in the middle of the story . Unfortunately those first pages were also the best in the whole book . The further I went , the more downhill it got . Till I had to struggle to finish the last chapters . That 's why I decided to not do my usual summary / introduction . I just do n't feel like it after reading this book , I 've had enough.Then what was the reason that made this book go from a good book to something I do n't want to read anymore ? It 's not something that I can explain in words . The excitement and suspense just went away , right after the start . And I did n't like what was left . It also was hard for me to see story as a whole , it felt more like you watched different scenes without any connection between them , no transition from one scene to the other.I also had problems bonding with Abby and Brian . Abby acted a little bit too dependent and she was n't the kind of person that knows what to do and what not in certain situations . Like a normal person would . Brian on the other hand is too pessimistic . There is n't a page where he forgets to mention how dangerous he thinks Abby is and that this time she will kill him for sure . And he keeps thinking such things , even after he knows that it 's not something Abby has control over and she has no intention at all of killing him . With no other funny or lovable characters in the book , it became a bore to read about the latest Abby action or pessimistic thoughts.I know I 've put Romance as a tag , but in reality it 's hard to find in the book . Although there is a certain pull that Brian experiences . Abby is no doubt the most beautiful girl he has ever seen , but that is because of the mermaid genes . And Abby seems to like Brian just fine , too . And then they are suddenly a couple ? What did I miss ? Where is the slowly budding relationship ? Where are the kisses ? The emotions they have to experience ? There is n't even a confession ? And no they do n't have the ability to read their minds . So this was a bit of a disappointment for me.Conclusion : 1 heart . The start of the book was intriguing , but it failed to keep my attention . I had a hard time bonding with Abby and Brian , who are n't very likable to me . Furthermore the romance was very hard to find and not the best to read about . Such a shame for a book with such a good start !	-1
It is very rare that I do n't finish a book and while it is no longer impossible for me to do , it is still very difficult . I have no doubt that one of the reasons I was able to make this a DNF read was because I had recently read its prequel and many of the problems I had with this book I had also had with that one . While I did make myself finish DESTINY DIVIDED , Book 1 in the Shadows of Destiny series , I accepted halfway through DESTINY UNITED that this series and its heroines are obviously not for me and there was no point in my continuing.HEROINE , Erin / Aila ( 21 ) : DESTINY UNITED is about Erin / Aila Bolton , the younger ( foster ) sister of Sage Peterson , the heroine in DESTINY DIVIDED . Erin is setup as being the opposite of Sage personality-wise , however what she is supposed to be according to descriptions of her ( what we 're told ) and how she actually is ( what we 're shown ) are two very , very different things . Erin As She 's Told is a timid nice-girl with an anxiety disorder and a reliance on alcohol to cope with her illness . She suffers from panic attacks when she has to go into a new place and/or be around people whom she does not know . She does not trust easily because of her unstable upbringing , and a traumatic event in her youth made her even more distrustful of men in particular . She is smart , nice , well-behaved , and always wanting to please people . You get the idea , right ? Now , let 's compare her with Erin As She 's Shown . This Erin initially gets nervous going alone into a bar filled with people , she does it and manages to be calm enough to flirt with a group of guys so that she can get them to buy her drinks . Other than that , we 're not shown any addiction-battling or proof of this supposed dependence . Erin 's anxiety disorder is also not consistent , at times crippling , at other times nonexistent . She makes sure to always have a boyfriend , because with her avoidance of new and/or crowded places , it 's convenient to have a guy who will shop and pay for her things . Erin describes herself as being too nice and accepting , which makes everyone treat her like a doormat ; I never saw evidence to support either of these statements . She whines frequently and acts immaturely.Erin also does what I absolutely hate that characters sometimes do : rebelling for rebellion 's sake . Marcelo is sent to protect her because there are sorcerers and werewolves who want to kidnap or kill her , yet she continuously tries to make a stand , put her foot down , show she 's independent , and not listen to Marcelo because she can take care of herself ( despite all evidence to the contrary ) . Despite the fact that she knows nothing about the supernatural world , or that she can not fight , cast spells , and does not have powers . At one point they run into three sorcerers who try and harm them , and Erin is upset that Marcelo has killed them and wants to call an ambulance . They just tried to kill you , sweetheart ! That 's not being softhearted ( as Marcelo sickeningly sweetly sees it ) , it 's being stupid - as is her continued wilfulness towards him.HERO , Marcelo ( 800+ ) : While I liked Marcelo , I could not buy the developing relationship between them . That he lusts for her , sure ; we hear enough about her hot little body for that part of their connection to be completely believable . However , he 's an 800+ year old vampire , and something that I 've come to realize really annoys me in vampire romance books is when a very old vampire does not seem to mind having a romantic / sexual relationship with a 20-year-old who acts about half her age . Even if physically they 're well-matched , mentally and emotionally he is hundreds of years older than her - I mean talk about cradle-robbing ! She acts like a willful child with him - albeit a child with apparently nice breasts and butt - so why is he so profoundly affected by her ? Why has he decided within the space of a few days ( out of the ~300,000 days he 's had ) that she is his mate and that he can give up the quest to find his human wife ( who was also turned ) that he 's been on for more than 800 years ? ! STORY : Other than Erin 's personality , I also had issues with the pace and flow of the story and how in the first half she and Marcelo seem so disconnected from the rest of the sup world . We abruptly and jarringly are told the entire history of Erin 's other `` persona '' ( Aila ) when Marcelo comes back from looking on the internet while she was passed out post-transformation . He tells her ( and the reader ) this entire back story that we were not even given hints to , as if he came across it in a Google search result or on Wikisupspedia . Also , the reader is n't told for quite awhile about the battles and power struggles between the different supernatural species or the events with Sage that precipitated all this , making it unclear at the beginning to the reader as to exactly why Erin is being pursued.PORTRAYAL OF ALCOHOLISM & ANXIETY DISORDER : Finally , I was dissatisfied with how Erin 's anxiety disorder and alcoholism were woven into the story . It seemed at times that the author forgot that part of her character 's history , then remembering it all of a sudden and throwing in a scene in which she is about to have a panic attack or has an urge to go to the bar nearby . I really disliked the times when her anxiety disorder and the pills she takes to combat it are depicted as being weaknesses . Marcelo alludes to this several times , however it was n't used as a character development component in which Marcelo overcomes his ignorance about mental illness ; instead , the manner in which these parts are written makes it seem as if these statements are indeed true and the character development they relate to is Erin overcoming her disorder by making herself do so . This plays right into one of the most frequent myths / misunderstandings about mental illness : that a person can just snap out of it , if they really want to . Believe me , if it were that unbelievably easy , I do n't know of any person with a mental illness who would not do it . * This review is of a copy provided by the author to Fiction Vixen Book Reviews . Review originally posted on the Fiction Vixen website .	-1
I did n't care for this book too much the characters and the story line was just unrealistic . Happy it was free	-1
This is one of the first books that really made me sleep cause is only about a girl with insaecurity issues that overcomes it with boobs to become a slut or person who used his boobs to go forward ( in the book only talked of the process to buy her boobs ) .	-1
Not really what I expected . But it was Free . Not much to the book I was actually looking for Bible stories	-1
Answers are clearly visible from the start and it reads more like poetry than riddles also the book is very short	-1
Old riddles in ancient english.Some bearly make sense and other are just a waste.None are clever or worth reading a second time .	-1
Did n't enjoy it . I said what I wanted to say I do not understand why I must write so many words that are n't needed it seems like a waste of my time and the person that has to review what I wrote .	-1
thank you zoe harcombe for debunking some diet facts.however , your explantions are too complicated.why not say , & # 34 ; eat the right foods in smaller amounts.exercise as often as 4 to 5x a week. & # 34 ; you will be healthier and lose weight .	-1
I feel the writing was very amateur . There were parts where I thought & # 34 ; oh good something is happening & # 34 ; ... and then it was mildly entertaining with somewhat confusing action and poor descriptions with which to build a mental image . I would not recommend this book . It was hard to get through and had a horrible ending .	-1
This book is so boring and predictable . The first two chapters were good then it all went down hill . There are only few characters and they are not well developed . If you want an exciting and suspenseful book to read you should read `` Gone Girl ''	-1
Although I liked the plot there was too many problems for me . The naivete of a 45 year old man was silly and theirresponsibility of the main characters could not be overlooked .	-1
The best part was the end so I could go on to a more interesting read . I did read the entire book so I gave it 2 stars .	-1
I enjoy BDSM , but this book , while it had an intriguing plot , disappointed me . The writing was good , but the repeated rapes and attitude of `` you just raped me but I think I love you '' was off putting , to say the least . Not to mention the `` I 'm being raped but it feels so good '' attitude both of the characters had .	-1
I purchased this title on allromance.com but I tend to post all of my book reviews on Amazon , hence the lack of verification . I 've read Ms. Lockwood 's work previously and I thought this story would have promise . In a nutshell , it was just too much . I know in some instances , romance has elements of fantasy but this story was just tasteless and too far fetched . Reading the synopsis , I thought that there would be promise in a complicated tale but with it being a short story , my expectations were too high . I did n't connect with any of the characters and I found Raina and Hunter 's actions to be deplorable . Your brother just died and you 're moving in on his girlfriend before his body is even cold ? Raina sleeping with Hunter so soon was the beginning of the end for me . I will continue to read Ms. Lockwood 's work but this was n't my cup of tea . Writers should always tell a tale as they see fit but I think this could 've potentially been a good story had it been developed a bit more and the characters made better decisions .	-1
This book was too short and just did n't capture my attention like I thought it would . Now if Omar thinks that I am going to buy all 27 book at 99 cents he has been smoking something . That 15 minute short story was not that good .	-1
This story was fairly well composes but every part of it was impossible which detracted from the writer 's creative gift .	-1
Was not up to the type of book Patterson used to write.Did not care for this book , was disappointed but glad I did not buy it .	-1
For those of you looking for a short read , this is for you . If not , you 're out of luck because this book is very short ! For me , this was a turn off ... I found the storyline to be rushed . I do n't have any idea as towards what is going on , and the ending was abrupt and forced . Some parts of the story are cliche . A scary man watching you from a dark corner ? A `` beach bum '' who turns out to be somebody ? For me , the worst cliche is that of the two girls . These characters are based off of the virgin/whore dichotomy ... how original ( sarcasm ) . The `` friend '' is an outgoing boy crazed one-night-stand kind of girl , while the main character is a shy , waiting-for-the-one kind of girl . And , of course , the innocent one is attacked and given powers . The whole plot is a giant cliche ! I most certainly will not be reading the rest of the series .	-1
The only thing worse than taking a chance on some no-name author is seeing a really great author , ordering her latest work with the expectation of a familiar ride & getting disappointed . I have almost everything that Lora Leigh has ever printed , but this was just ridiculous . I have followed her from publisher to publisher faithfully , overlooked some chronological miscues & plot black holes ( Breed series , anyone ? ) but this was just insane . Minimal backstory , a blink of angst & a couple of rolls in the hay to happily every after . Lora , you owe me a fecking refund or a FULL STORY !	-1
I figured since it was by lora leigh it would b good . No such luck . I just pissed away over $ 5 on a 65 page book that held no plot nor character development . Absolutely awful and a waste of money . There were 2 decent sex scenes . That was it . No back story . No details . Long review short . Do n't waste your time or money on this so called book . It 's a waste .	-1
Okay so I just brought this novel and the first few pages were interesting but then the plot jumped to some other character that was n't properly introduced to the readers . It was over all poorly constructed story . Also I agree with some of the other readers that the dialogue is too introverted . Reading the summary I thought oh this book should be good but I was extremely disappointed .	-1
Reviews are a tricky thing . It 's people 's opinions and we all think differently . Most people gave this book a stellar review while I hated it . I hated it so much , I skimmed through most of it . It was like trying to swallow peanut butter without a liquid chaser ; so so very hard to do . I do n't think I 've ever given a book a single star rating but I had a lot of issues with it and hardly any pluses.The main chick ( I do n't remember her name ) , was forgettable . She was whiny , and so very annoying . I could n't stand her . Maybe that was the author 's intent but I for one have to like the main characters some in order to give the book a shot . She was a healthy woman with body issues and continually whined about having to mate with the twins , Deep and Locke . She did n't like them at all in the beginning when Locke , the nicer of the twins was nothing but kind to her . Deep was crass and very blunt in the way he spoke to her which she had issue with.I do n't mind the menage going on but it was so far out there I could n't accept any of it . I 've read both books in the Soul-Linked Saga where there is one woman with multiple partners at once and that author told the story beautifully . Even though it was all fiction , it was believable and well written . This story was a bunch of this and that with some sexual encounters tossed in . Just awful.I will say , it may be necessary to read the first two books to understand the plot and the world better which I did not do . But a book should absolutely be able to stand on it 's on even if it 's in a series.The editing job was poor as well . In the end , I did not finish it and I asked Amazon for my money back which they refunded immediately .	-1
This was the worst three dollars I ever spent , and that includes the time I got food poisoning from that vending machine sandwich . I 'm all for steamy sex scenes and some erotica ( love me some Lora Leigh ) but there has to be some substance and story line to go along with it . This was just one long , boring sex scene after another . Then after several days of the main characters boinking like bunnies they are all of a sudden in love . Additionally , the female main character has absolutely no back bone . The male main character drugs and kidnaps her and she still just wants to have sex with him . It was amazingly difficult to finish , but I kept thinking that maybe there would be a glimmer of realism to salvage the hours I spent wading through this mental sludge . Alas , there was no light at the end of the tunnel . Unless you count the number of times I rolled my eyes into the back of my head and then back out again because the material was just so disgustingly stupid . Do n't waste your money people . Run away and do n't look back .	-1
I almost could n't finish this book - it was that bad . Unfortunately , even when I do n't love a book , I have to see a story through to the end to see if there are any redeeming qualities . This was answered with a resounding NO ! Ugh ! This story drags on forever and ever . It took me a couple weeks of picking it up and putting it down to finally start skimming pages . I did n't miss a thing . The time travel theory was bad , the love story was bad , and the end was bad . I would not recommend this book to anyone !	-1
To be honest I did n't finish it , I quit before the end , felled by a lack of realism . I think that even a novel has to be a least , in some limit , within bonds of realism . I did n't felt this one did . But then , I left before the end	-1
I have not read this short , nor will I ever . I looked at the `` preview '' that Amazon offers , and in the fifth paragraph , Dane 's ride is mentioned . It is a `` rattrap '' . While Rattrap is evidently a character from Transformers , a beat up car is a rattletrap . Did the editor for this book flunk high school English ? Did the author ? I could n't get past it . It sounded interesting , but for heaven 's sake , check your colloquialisms , this is embarrassing . It was a minor detail , but if a little thing like this is wrong , it 's a good bet there a bigger problems with the writing .	-1
Short hence no character development . Story and characters and dialog are just flat . Did n't care about the characters or what became of them . So in a way , it was a good thing this was a short story !	-1
This was really not written very well - basically it was just about the sex scenes which were not skillfully written - The story was clumsy but I gave this author another shot and bought the next book in the series and that was a complete rip-off . It cost $ 2.99 and was really just short , short story with more of the same bad writing .	-1
This is a book written solely for the sex , I get that there are a lot of people who really like that so that 's not the issue I have with this book . It 's just that the sexy scenes were n't sexy and there is just a suspension of disbelief that I just could n't attain . I mean I GUESS I can see jumping the bones of the guy who left you broken-hearted and pregnant ( even though he did n't know about it ) as soon as you see him , even though you just tried to maim him . I can understand the guy being all hot and bothered by her but when the guy finds out this big secret and he just is all , whatever , I 'm here now wish I knew before , now let 's go have sex . That 's weird , a guy is either going to be super pissed or scared off by Charlotte 's deceit . THEN , THEN oh hey we 've been apart for 10 years , let 's get hitched ... .really because in 10 years you do n't think either of you have changed at all ? ! ? Ok , this is a book about the sex not the story , but really both aspects are pretty lacking ... but I guess it was free ... so ...	-1
to much of everything . he treats her like crud and she likes it . glad it was free . i would not pay money for this book .	-1
not what I expected . A little more romance and story.Short on story heavy on sex . Not a great read . I expected more from Liliana Hart .	-1
Ok if you want read about sexual experiences this is great book . I like a story with some romance not just sex .	-1
The characters express their `` eternal love '' for each other with quickie sex minutes after a ten year separation . Later that same night , they talk over their serious life issues and life changing decisions between orgasms . Really ! ? ? The storyline is terrible .	-1
I mistakenly downloaded this book and did not finish reading , once I realized that it was erotica . You may like it , I deleted it .	-1
Where 's the plot ? It was slow , the book begins with her having sex with someone she has n't seen in years ? ? Who left town and is now suddenly back and the romp happened within minutes of him getting back into town..Huh ?	-1
There are no pictures in the Kindle version so I am not even going to waste my time with it .	-1
This was a little too much , not what I was looking for . May be someone else 's cup of tea , just not mine ! ! !	-1
I understand why this book is free . I don & # 8217 ; t know who would pay for this book in their right mind . I tried several times to read this and I couldn & # 8217 ; t .	-1
No plot , just a girl who should be a porn star . Do n't really call this `` writing '' No romanceNo twistNo suspense.Not my style .	-1
If all you want is to read about sex ... and that includes 1 woman and 3 guys at a time ... then this is your book . There is nothing more to say than that !	-1
This book was hot but the fantasy that 3 men would be with one woman is too totally out there ! Cheesy	-1
What happens with the businessThis is all about one person , and what she gets . Where is the rest of the story .	-1
I started , but I 'm not into having sex with too many guys at once , and could not get my self to finish the book . If it 's your cup of tea you might like it . I rather have nice , spicy , sweaty sex with one guy ! !	-1
I do n't mind reading a nice erotic story every once in a while , but this was disgusting . It was not erotic , it was gross . Think your regular porn video with one girl and three guy ... just no .	-1
Nasty ... .stupid ... and just awful . I hated it . One slutty woman 3 hot guys who all want to & # 34 ; share & # 34 ; her ! ! ! ! ! One day each get a turn..then at the end they all take her ... .Oh HELL NO ! ! !	-1
This book could have been great for someone into the whole freaky foursome thing . Not really a romance novel or short . It really does n't deserve the one star I gave it .	-1
It started out as intersting but something about lost my interest-it seemed nt to be a good read for me	-1
A child is born from an egg and sperm from the old Earth . It is very far into the future . What is left of all the oceans is called Oceanus . This child is raised to be the Queen of the Hourglass . She is to mate with the Clock King . They are to have a child to help rebuild the humans.I personally did not like this book . It was brutal just getting through the novella . There was n't an ending to the story . The book just ends . **SPOILER** She did n't conceive and then the book was over . I really did n't like that part . You ca n't have a book without a beginning , middle and end . Even books with sequels have an ending of some way !	-1
This story had so much potential with an action adventure plot line , but it was too hard to become invested in the characters and story . The story starts with little interaction between characters while we are delivered an incredible amount of history right up front . We are n't left to guess , which I much prefer to be slowly acclimatized to the back-story throughout.At the beginning of the story , the readers are given an impression of Emily preferring to spend time alone , almost coming off too good for friends because they do n't understand how to achieve sen while she does . Then she undergoes a transformation , cutting her hair , wearing new clothes and instantly surrounding herself with a group of friends . For me , the change was too dramatic , too quickly . I understand the change , but like the back-story , it should have been brought to attention in layers instead of instantaneously.The emotions were left empty . As Emily experienced grief and joy we were simply told about it , never brought into the emotions to experience them with her . The manner in which Go No Sen was constructed had no power or hold , it was hard to keep focus . The sentences did n't have a flow , they were mostly short , choppy sentences that left me frustrated with the imagery being broken up adding to the lack of feelings . There was also an overuse of exclamation marks , again personal preference , but I felt that the story would have been the same without them.The author does have exceptional knowledge of different types of martial arts as we are taken through move-by-move of each fight and the training at the dojo . I also greatly appreciated the different point-of-views scattered within the book . Like I said , this story had potential , I was excited to read an action adventure with a female protagonist , but was highly disappointed .	-1
I will be the first person to admit that I am picky about reading . One gets the feeling that the author self-published this book . Either that , or the publisher did not bother with a proofreader . The author is comma crazy and , honestly , that drives me a little crazy . `` When in doubt , leave it out . '' As to the story line ... it was very predictable ; I figured out who Devin was disguised as very early in the game and had the plot figured out just as quickly . I like to be kept guessing for at least a little while . It was n't all bad , but I found I simply could n't wait to get to the end of it in order to be released from the self-inflicted hell of reading this book .	-1
I read reviews posted on the initial product page for this book and I am highly disappointed . The characters are stiff , wooden and annoying ; the dialogue never goes anywhere . I kept thinking things would get to a point pretty soon ... but it did n't ! There never seemed to be a point to any of it , jumping from one unconnected scene to another . Do n't bother with this if you appreciate good character development , realistic dialogue and storyline . Much as I love horror and the paranormal , I could n't care less what these stupid women do .	-1
Where waste eat ? I did n't realize this was THAT short of a story ... . So much unsaid ... .need more . Leaves me in limbo	-1
It 's good , if you love Stephen King and his weird stories . This was justtoo weird for me , but just maybe that am getting older and taste havechanged some . Although a good Stephen King diehard would like this .	-1
I read the preview then read some comments and excepted this to be a really great book . It had potential at some spots where I thought , okay great , here comes the story , the character connection , the romance or anything . The only thing that came out was the mother and sister being shown as the masterminds ( if that ) and psychos and Diablo being the muscle with a limited brain . I was sorely disappointed in this book and honestly feel it was a complete WASTE OF TIME . Do n't read it ! ! Also , I saw it supposed to be over 400 pages , which is another reason I went with this book . Sorry ... my copy for Kindle is probably at no more then 150 if that . I even flipped through it when I was done to make sure I did n't miss something . Nope , nada , nothing . I do n't expect page counts to be 100 % accurate , but from 400 plus to 100 plus is a huge difference in my opinion .	-1
Very short story , glad it was free . I did n't like the ending , it just stopped in the middle of the story and really did n't fit . It seemed it was more for shock value rather than really contributing to the story . Wo n't buy the rest of this series .	-1
FIRST : This particular product is not a romance ; there is no sex , no seduction in any form but RAPE . AND MORE RAPE . CONTINUAL RAPE.Yes , I used caps . Why ? Because I want potential buyers to know this upfront . While I firmly believe people can read whatever they wish , that choice should be based on truth , not deception . The author should have been as honest about the repeated rapes as she was about the violence . ( EDIT/ADD : And no , not because I have anything against rape in books ; I just was n't prepared to read about it in this book . ) Like some of the others , I downloaded this as a freebie after reading the blurb , which is buried somewhere within the excerpt , so allow me : A TRAGIC , MODERN-DAY LOVE STORY ... He 's a ruthless , drug-lord who kills at the slightest provocation ; she 's a sassy , foul-mouth , twenty-one year old who takes crap from no one . Put them together and watch the sparks fly . And fists.Add their greedy , backstabbing , amoral families to the mix and you have mayhem.Add the FBI to the mayhem and you have tragedy.Gringa is a modern-day , tragic love story that will have you laughing , crying , gasping and above all wishing there was more.WARNING : This book contains language your mother would definitely NOT approve of , scorching sex scenes that may keep you up at night , unnecessary and un-called for violence and is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18 or anyone seeking world peace just yet . ( 18 years that is , not months . Well , months too . ) **********So I thought , `` Hmmm , interesting twist -- a bit wacked , but interesting so why not ? '' Also , the `` warning '' has such a cutesy , tongue-in-cheek tone , does n't it ? Here 's `` why not '' . As mentioned , there 's no romance . No sparks flew between them , unless you count the times he stared at her while she quaked in fear . She 's left alone to be bullied by his mother and sister ; a strange man walks into her bedroom and sexually harasses and assaults her . There is also strong implication that the `` hero '' and his sister are engaged in an incestuous relationship . The `` hero '' says maybe all of 5 words until just before he rapes her anally . ( And yeah , I wrote the word -- why not when some of the erotica sold here contain it in their `` warning '' ? ) The FBI ? Nope , sorry -- huge no show for me , must have had car trouble . For that matter , where was the romance ? Because I got the tragedy . And if I ever had the misfortune to experience such `` scorching sex scenes '' , then I 'll definitely be up at night.SECOND : This is not part of a series ; IT 'S A SERIAL . An author should know , so I wo n't waste my time explaining the difference.THIRD : Who 's Diago ? Did we read the same book ? Let 's see , file size = 210KB . Check . Print Length = 449 pages . Really ? In what universe , printer or ereader ? Because after running a macro to clean up the crap formatting , voil & agrave ; ! ... I got 70 pages , with Location ending at 1071 ( original = Location 3040 ) . I 'll make it easy -- that 's 2/3 of NOTHING stripped out.I 'm sorry but who indents to 1/4 of a Kindle screen ? And at this day and age , are consistent paragraphs for straight text so difficult that several sentences would start in the middle of my screen ? Even a manual typewriter had a set Tab key ! Finally , how does `` Chapter Three '' end up in the middle somewhere but there 's no other chapter headings ? The truly sad thing about this mess ? Crap formatting , grammar and punctuation ( and I mean to the point that I had to pause and mentally construct some sentences to get the gist ) and misleading blurb aside , the storyline concept was good and had such potential ! In fact , the beginning was creatively attention-grabbing and the first half was not bad.Skimming the reviews already here , I agree with most of what Junecstraight wrote , so I 'll just end this with `` ditto '' . Like the heroine , I need to take another hot shower and scrub real hard .	-1
Thought it was a little gross.Ending was not good at all . Not sure what would have improved it.I usually love to read Karin Slaughter books .	-1
A very bizarre story line and rather distasteful . I would not recommend that you buy this book . Again , the book stops very abruptly and then you get a few chapters of a new one , very frustrating .	-1
Did you enjoy this sample ? No , well wait ... yes , thank you for the $ .99 I saved by seeing good reason not to go with 4 and 5 star reviews . Written by someone who professes to be a comedian , sounds mentally off balanced , to put it kindly .	-1
Well from the cover made up of a photo of a couple of hot dogs , which has been cut and paste onto a basic blank computer art image with the title and authors name typed on , you knew straight away this was self published piece that not a lot of time was put into it and no one else is obviously involved in editing or getting it to Kindle . But not all self published stories are terrible , there are some brilliant undiscovered authors who have written some great stuff . At the time of this review this was a free download so I thought I 'd give it a go . I 'm glad I did n't pay money for it.I imagine this is written by some kid in a high school English class or something where he gets in trouble or something and the teacher demands what are you going to write about Jeffery . Oh hot dogs he replies thinking of his lunch or trying to get a laugh . You 're going to write a whole story about hot dogs . Yeah sure am , Jeffrey replied , and set out to prove he could . Unfortunately he failed.No Free Lunches just does n't go anywhere , nothing happens , it 's just a bunch of scientists annoyed that they have been called to this room , away from their important research on AIDs , Cancer and the like to discuss hot dogs and how to lessen the rate of little kids choking on them . None of them want to be there but some are enjoying the free lunch provided . That 's it that 's the whole story , nothing happens at the conference , no one kills anyone , no one sleeps with anyone else , no one cracks a witty one liner , no one really does anything.Plus there 's obviously been no editing , even by the kid 's teacher . We start of describing the scenario and suddenly Shutup for a damn second this was importanter ( yes this is the word used ) interrupts the setting description as if someone is now talking . `` Just as he was decided that he 'd doled out enough gravity and had started to open his mouth to speak '' is an example of a typical sentence in this kid 's story . I think Jefferey would have failed this assignment . It does only take 5 minutes to read if it 's still free and you want to check it out , but there are a lot of better 5 minute read free Kindle reads on Amazon . If it now costs money , definitely give No Free Lunches a miss .	-1
I know this was tongue in cheek , but , it made no sense in any way . The only possible purpose of this story is an attempt to prove that no group of people anywhere , no matter how brilliant , can get together and agree on anything -- -even the shape of hot dogs ! ! !	-1
I bought the book thinking it would have a story line or at least something to give the book depth , but it had nothing . There was no plot and nothing to the characters . Yes the book had sex , but even that was n't very good .	-1
Scribner , in these three short stories , spends too much energy thinking up unusual situations and not enough time helping his readers understand the situation or how his characters respond to them . One of the stories is just a scientist describing the ( unlikely ) results of an experiment , leaving me to wonder what the author was going for . Am I supposed to be impressed that he could think of an unusual situation and then reveal it via exposition ? What is the intended response to these stories ?	-1
The MacKenzie Brothers Quartet are short very short stories that just leave you hanging . My opinion there was definitely room for more to the stories , they just abruptly ended and the next book was a totally different brother with a totally different story .	-1
clumsy writing - not worth the $ 2.99 paid for it - was a very , very short story with no substance .	-1
Really ? She must be something ! The woman is unconscious and he falls in love with her enough that his brothers can & # 34 ; see it on his face & # 34 ; ? She falls in love with him too ? This story takes place over 2 1/2 days , 1 day Cat is asleep . Ridiculous . It could have been an interesting story , they all could have been . Instead it reads more like a dirty term paper.Danes story was more believable ... ... but really they are all too short with no substance . Try again , take the idea and actually write a story , not just a brief 48hrs to life long love .	-1
This is the NOVELLA OF NOTHING . There is nothing erotic in it at all . It starts out in a BDSM club but do n't expect any BDSM . Nothing happens at the club except a misunderstanding and when they get together , it is all Vanilla . Oh , they both have some piercings . Big Whoop ! The one love scene is very blah . Add to that , the characters do n't seem to have any reason to be in love with each other , barely know each other although she has mooned after him since adolescence , and he would have nothing to do with her because he is 10 years older . That 's still a good reason to stay away in my book . Even the `` case '' he was undercover on got blown and it never amounted to anything . That about sums up this book : never amounted to anything !	-1
I do n't know how the rest of you feel , but when these `` short '' excerpts are put into the book section I feel taken advantage of , ripped off and a bit used based upon my loyalty . Yes , we are aware these are not full books when we download them ( if we do download ) , but this is supposed to be a full book download site . Right ? I just do n't feel this is the right place to `` advertise '' this way nor the right way to treat customers . I do n't know , maybe I 'm being unfair but I already purchase a lot of books directly as a result of getting free full downloads . As many of you may know by now , amazon has done away with their referral program where the different sites such as kindle buffet used to get an income because of the people viewing their site and then purchasing from Amazon . That is why we 've lost those sites and must now search on our own . This is just Amazon 's way of replacing the income they received from those sites . We 've lost a service from kindle buffet , et al , and are further subject to these games .	-1
First of all , what the hell . These tricks are for ten years olds to impress them ( No wonder he worls on shows with ten year olds ) .Secondly , why did I even waste my time reading it.Lastly , Its just not cool .	-1
I my opinion this story was rushed . There was no proper developement . I did not like it and would not recommend it to a friend .	-1
This story did n't work on any level . The sex was not remotely sexy , the heroine was beaten down , and the `` hero '' ugly in thought , word and deed . I strongly suggest you look elsewhere .	-1
Quick read that sparks your interest , it just does n't execute effectively . The premise was there it just faltered for me .	-1
Wish there was something to tell . A woman meets a guy has sex with him and a year later runs off with him . DUH	-1
I kind of went back and forth while reading this story . First I liked it , then I did n't . First , in this day and age a smart person would NEVER pick up a hitchhiker , no matter how good looking . But I get it , this is fiction . Getting past that , the hero and heroine struck up a harmless , fast friendship that seemed to turn into a sexual thing before you knew it . There really did n't seem to be a lot of heat or emotion between them , it was more like a therapeutic encounter . He had an ex-wife who was a disappointment in bed , she had a lazy ass boyfriend who treated her like s*** . So they decided to have a one night stand . In the morning he goes his way , and she goes back to the ass . At times I found myself getting angry with her for putting up with him and letting him treat her that way . She actually gets engaged to him . Then , 3-4 months after her one night stand with the hitchhiker stud she gets a call out of the blue and off they go to build a life together .	-1
Sorry ... just could n't get into it . Boredom set in early and I just could n't shake it . This is not to say that others might find it a good read .	-1
The Dream by Maria Savva was original but chaotic . This novel was all over the place . It was intriguing and suspenseful , but also confusing and choppy . This story did n't flow very well . Halfway through the novel , Savva completely changes the rules . It seemed like she needed a way to resolve things so she just added a magical trip through time , but it was forced and perplexing . I was also surprised because this novel was n't very romantic . I was expecting a phenomenal love story , but I did n't find one . There were quite a few different people in Lynne 's life throughout the course of this novel , but we did n't really get to see any of the relationships develop from beginning to end . There was n't a guy to root for until the very end of this novel , and that was disappointing . The one relationship I would have loved to see more of began right when the novel ended.I enjoyed the overall theme of this novel ; it 's all about finding your right path . I also thought the concept for this novel was extremely cool . Unfortunately , it was executed poorly.I gave The Dream by Maria Savva 2 STARS ( 2.5 STARS ) . Most people have rated this novel really high . I am in the minority on this one , but it just did n't do it for me.-XOXOREADING , EATING AND DREAMINGFOR MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT : READING , EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF	-1
I have only recently added Childs to my list of favourite authors , Second Son being only the third novel of his I have read . The first 2 in the Reacher series were excellent , and firmly established Childs as one of my new favorites , however this short insight into Reachers childhood was not . While you could expect Reacher to have been a force to be reckoned with from a young age , the idea that high ranking members of the Militery were taking his orders and advise from the age of 13 is kind of ridiculous . I think if this had been my first Childs novel it would have also been my last , so if you are new to Childs read just about anything else first. ! ! !	-1
I just could not get & # 34 ; into & # 34 ; reading this book at all . Found it to be disappointing , and I usually do n't feel that way about a Lee Child book .	-1
I received this book in exchange for an honest review . No compensation was given , offered , or received.Before I get started , I 'd just like to state that I did not finish Falls the Shadow . Falls the Shadow was a little difficult for me to really invest myself in . The premise and plot were actually very interesting , it just did n't really captivate me for some reason.As I understand it , all of the events in Falls the Shadow take place in Midgard after Ragnarok which is supposed to basically be the end of the world except for the fact that the earth is supposed to be repopulated afterward . Now that gods like Odin and Thor are dead , the power-hungry are searching for powerful artifacts/treasure the gods once used so they can awaken Loki.There are a number of main characters throughout the story but I honestly did n't connect with any of them . Lady Amena was interesting but that was about as far as my connection went . I do n't know much about Norse mythology so I kind of felt a little lost sometimes . I appreciated how each of the characters ' story lines lead up to one another . I think the execution was well done . Each characters ' storyline wove neatly together . There was never any confusion as to who I was reading about.Unfortunately , I did n't particularly enjoy having to keep track of so many people and different story lines . Maybe it would have been easier if I knew the characters better . But , for me , it was difficult and made getting into the story harder . Of course , I 'm not used to this type of writing either , so I might just be out of practice too.The writing itself was well done . It made me feel like I was in a different world or rather that I was reading about a world that was n't my own . Honestly , I admire that in authors . Not everyone can do that.All in all , the premise was really interesting but , for whatever reason , I just was n't captivated .	-1
It 's not that the writing is bad . I just found these stories too depressing . I like a light humorous read . I finished the first one and wished I had n't . There was nothing redeeming a out the main character .	-1
I 've just stopped reading at 53 % into story.I am having soooo much trouble reading this due to incorrect grammar , spelling and punctuation.The biggest roadblock in the way of me finishing this book are the inconsistencies in the story.I 've just decided to check reviews to see if the problems I 'm having reading this have put anyone else off as well . I laughed when I read another review saying they 'd stopped reading at 53 % as well ! The proof reading could be the problem . Some sentences are actually repeated nearly exactly a paragraph or two later , with a slight change in the direction . Its like the author has thought of a better way to word it but does n't delete the original sentence.The concept is great , and the story telling creates great visuals for me . Its just that theres way too much rambling . Its a wonder Ebony can actually walk in a straight line with the amount of time she spends in her own head . I 've had to stop ready and flick back through the story three times because the sentence I 've just ready totally contradicts what was written previously.Ebony is annoying ... well the mistakes in the story make her less loveable . But , I 'm probably much older than the intended audience so , as this book is free , maybe give it a go if the description has caught your attention.I 'm still not sure if I 'm going to finish the book or not . I 'm pretty stubborn about giving a book a fair chance though . So far I 've been skipping paragraphs , I 've even just glanced at a page or two before skipping ahead . I may just read the last chapter ...	-1
I read to 27 % which was part way through the cemetery scene but I could n't go on it was too over explained and not enough actually going on . The protagonist is ridiculous and annoying and very childish . I would say maybe my 13 yr would read this book but I do n't think it has enough wit or storyline to even keep a child her age engaged in this `` magical '' world .	-1
Interesting premise ... but author seemed to need to make up witch rules as she went along to conveniently help the heroine get out of jams .love interest stiff and boring .	-1
Not too many indie writers have real talent to write but this author does . Shes good.Problem is , all the dozens of typos and mistakes take away from the pleasure of reading a clean book.With this authors talent , she should spring for professional editing.If it had been edited properly , I would have given a higher rating .	-1
I read about 5 chapters of this book and then stopped it was not what I thought it would be that is for sure - sadly I would NOT recommend it to anyone at all : (	-1
I do n't think Prentis ever decided what he wanted to write - a mystery , an action adventure , or a romance novel . Whatever it was , it was n't very good being any of them . It was just too much work trying to get through the book .	-1
This book could have been a great book but it was so poorly written it did nothing but piss me off.First The time line . It was very hard to follow the book mostly because it sounded like this happened one day and then this happened the next , when there where really about a month or two in between events.Second The sex scenes sucked . They where the worst Ive ever read.Third It took so much to get to the main point of the book that when it did happen you where almost towards the end and then the book ended . Plus she gave in WAY WAY WAY to fast.- Oh that reminds me HOW can you fall in love with someone IF YOU '' VE NEVER TALKED TO THEM ! How the hell does that happen ? He kidnaps her and they cant speak because he does n't know english ( though for some odd reason his sister is the only one who spoke it , they never explained how or why she spoke it just that she did ) but three days later she says shes in love with him ? Sure sure Dumbass ... .Just Buy this book at your own risk , who knows you may not care about the faults and find it a good book , lord knows I did n't like it .	-1
Reflecting on our motives , thoughts and words is helpful . A little on the new age edge for me ... some great quotes and some good self checking exercises . A fast read for me and worth it as a catalyst for self reflection .	-1
Not much to show for it . I realized that as a short book , it would not go into great depth or detail . However , instead of being- as I had hoped- a book looking objectively at selflessness and selfishness as different personality types and showing how one could use either to benefit , it was little more than a scold from your mother . Selfishness is bad and selflessness is good , and you just have to change from selfishness to selfness and your life will be ice cream and unicorns . Pure black and white , no nuance.In reality , almost all of us lie somewhere in the grey area in between . Pure selflessness is every bit as bad as pure selfishness when it comes to living in the real world . Selfishness in the right amount can motivate us , and selflessness can open us to possibilities and make us enjoy what we have . If you are not able to make use of both , a meaningful life will be a very difficult thing to attain.This one dimensional approach is not unique to this book . It seems to be commonplace in the `` self-help '' genre , so I can not be too upset with the author . I will also give the benefit of the doubt in that the length of the book made it very difficult to impart any significant information . However , as an electronic book , the length constraints should not be a major issue . The author would have been much better served had they taken the time to flesh out their premise and address the subtle issues that arise when dealing with any two opposing concepts . A less judgmental tone would have helped , as well.We are all told as children that being selfish is bad . Then we grow up , and the selfish people are the ones succeeding . I would much rather have read about how you can use a balance of the two traits to get ahead without becoming a person you would not want to be than to be lectured again as if I were a child that selfishness is always a bad thing .	-1
There is a semi happy ending , but it really was not my kind ogay story . Probably good for a serious reader .	-1
Mixed up characters ( Jorden with Jared ) so that was confusing . More depth could be achieved in the story events and with the characters . The story has promise if revisited by the author . I found it original and compelling if not for these issues .	-1
It was really hard to figure out whether I needed the adapter for New Zealand , since the pins look like they fit into our sockets . But they do n't . So , if you are from NZ , you do not need the adapter . Just charge your kindle using your computer .	-1
this should be included in a kindle purchase ! I love you amazon , but come on ! Just think about it , please .	-1
These days things are so costly why have this as a separate purchase ... for crying out loud stop the madness include it with the purchase Amazon its just a charger ... people please !	-1
I expected this adapter to be an answer to problems I was having charging my Kindle Fire ; it only did it part of the time.Nothing more needs to be said .	-1
i thought this would be a good case but i found it cumbersome to use as you always have to hold it or put it someplace when you are using your Fire .	-1
Sorry I have to agree with the other person who gave this book 2 stars . I just do n't get why Brynn did n't wait until William woke up to have a talk with him . Paul showing up so LAME ! ! I know and everyone else knows Brynn is going to be paired with Patrick ! I do n't think I will make myself suffer through book 3 . ALSO am I the only one who thinks being mortal is better than being immortal ? I mean they ca n't do anything fun and EVERYTHING has to go through a council LAME again !	-1
This book is ... . so disjointed and bad I could not finish it . I got 80 % thru it but got so disgusted with the contradictions in the characters and unbelievable character interactions . This is book is so bad there is not a single thing that can be built upon to improve it , the combat is unrealistic , the so-called survival skills smack of a hobbyist and not a dedicated one at that , for they are often wrong , the personal interaction and magic is so unrealistic and contradictory that you need to just accept anything . There is no consistency , well except for being consistently bad !	-1
Maybe I am a perv , but I was hoping for more explicit details.Book is somewhat dull and very boring.Waste of time .	-1
This book had a good premise - a retired KGB agent sent from modern Russia to kill a member of the International Monetary Fund . Unfortunately , the premise was the only good thing about this book , as the characters and situations were simply implausable . Just before an important vote , a US IMF member is killed by faulty brakes on his brand new Lexus and despite the police being surprised , the incident is treated strictly as an accident ! Even the new widow is unbelievably stoic about her husband 's death and is more interested in planning the funeral than grieving or questioning . Coincidently , his brother happens to be a retired CIA operative and he alone is suspicious . Even when a second member of the IMF narrowly escapes a terrorist-style bomb and the brother tries to impress the importance , do the US authorities seem somewhat interested . Where 's Homeland Security , the FBI , even the CIA ? Without giving away the whole plot ( although it would n't be a loss ) the story moves to Russia , where the brother , his gutsy girlfriend and the original KGB agent team up to right all wrongs . The few interesting looks into today 's Russia are dwarfed by the repetitive , angst-ridden political intrigue . If we heard a certain politician was ambitious and ruthless once , we heard it several times . The chase scenes were yawn-worthy and I found myself paging through to find something of interest . I kept reading to see when the US would finally show up ! They never did ! What a waste of a good premise !	-1
I downloaded a 'Sample ' prior to buying . Quite honestly , I never got past the first page ! The grammar , etc. , was infantile . The other reviews I read were kind by comparison to my own feelings . The Author needs not just a good Editor , but a remedial course in writing . I 'll take the other critics word in that the story is good , but having a 'Science Fiction type imagination ' does not make one a writer !	-1
This book was just ok to me . Not near as good has her previous series . Yet I have to say that I did enjoy it . Megg Jensen is the type of author who knows how to reel the reader in and make them want to keep reading . The story line was just inconsistent and characters needed to be more realistic .	-1
CAUTION : SPOILERS.This book has an OK story line but was very repetitious . By this I mean that I lost count how many times stated facts were repeated . I love Kellan , Trevan , Mags , Bryden , etc . several times , it got to where I would skip paragraphs because the were repeats . Also why is it that everyone just stands around when something happens , such as when the king is attacked , none of his guards enter into the fray , when Sebrina is killed by Kellan , Kellan waits for Lianne to talk to her sister instead of attacking .	-1
Poor storytelling , world building , and character development made this story hard for me to get all the way through . Too many developments seem based on single conversations , or actions , or seem to come out of the blue . The main character comes across of flighty , insecure , and weak instead of strong and capable .	-1
If there is something in life I hate the most its things that waste my time . Sadly , I have to say that this book fell under the ` wasted time ' category.The story is told both from Lexie 's and Torin 's perspective , and then a third perspective called Wolf , which we wo n't get to know who it really is until the very end . I think that was the only mystery that took me by surprise , though I should 've seen it coming . After all , the friendliest face is often the most vicious . The beginning was a classic mistake of starting a book by explaining the background , making it drag a bit . I also felt like there were too many characters being introduced and most of them were really fodder , as in no deeper purpose whatsoever than to be bodies lounging around Lexie 's world . What few interactions Lexie had with her mom only served for me to hate her.For all of Lexie complaining about her new family 's rule over her , she never actually defies them . She just goes along and quietly cries in her bedroom . Lexie says she does this to not cause trouble for her mother and make their new life easier , but really . Would n't you rebel after having your stepbrothers a step away from molesting you ? ! Her stepbrothers are ubber creeps , especially Maxim and on occasion Alik . They 're always smelling her , and acting really possessive with her . What really freaked me out was when Maxim confessed to having spied upon her at night , watching as she slept and had arousing dream . If that was n't a cue to stop reading this , I do n't know what it was . My mistake was not stopping then.The supernaturals in this book were the usual . The dhamphyrs are half draugar/vampire , half human . They 're born that way and have to deal with the change and the choice when they turn eighteen . They have all the usual powers , super healing , strength , speed , etc . I imagined them as the vampires from Buffy the Vampire Slayer , which made me laugh , because when their emotions run high their face changes and they sprout fangs and change eye color . The pricolici or lycans or werewolves , whatever you want to call them , also have super powers but seem to rely heavily on their animal instincts making them pretty dangerous if a bit unhinged . When they shift they smell like sulfur . Not sure why ... Lexie and Torin 's relationship felt very fake to me . I guess it was the entire `` fated '' thing , which apparently is code for `` I 'll throw myself at the boy that has been appearing in my dreams , even though there 's something really weird about him and I do n't know ANYTHING about him '' . I guess I thought Lexie would be smart enough to at least interrogate him before she gave him a tonsil checkup.Lastly , I usually do n't comment on grammatical errors because it 's very rare when I find one . And I do n't know if it was my copy ( I won the PDF version in a giveaway ) , but it was errors galore ! I feel I should point a few of them out : tail not tale , eventually not eventully , dose not does , except not accept , open not opened , altar not alter .	-1
I did not like this book at all . The whole book felt like it was very rushed . I could not get into the book and relate to the characters at all . I think the whole book was spaned over a one week period . Meeting a guy and within the next minute you are already kissing him . Do n't waste your money on this one . I will not be buying the next book .	-1
I 've just begun reading this book , and while the premise is interesting , the spelling , grammar and lack of editing in general almost make me want to stop reading ! I have n't checked yet - is this a self-published book ? I ca n't believe Amazon would carry this , even if it 's free . I mean , sentences beginning such as `` HER and Thunder . . . '' ? ? ? Are all this author 's books so poorly edited ? I feel like I 'm reading a book written by a middle schooler ! I hope future books by this author are more fully edited ; she has a good idea with this book , but it could be an excellent read with spelling and grammar corrections , and a few less predictable side comments !	-1
I 've stopped short of giving this a one-star review because I can see that a lot of effort went into writing this book , and it 's obviously a cut above some of the junk that finds its way into the Kindle marketplace , BUT ... Why is n't it formatted it correctly ? I was so looking forward to reading this . In fact , I still AM looking forward to reading this , if and when the author releases it in readable form . Unfortunately , when I went to open it , all I could see is page after page of text with NO paragraph indents ... which makes this far too hard on the eyes to bother with . The only bright spot in this scenario is the fact that I downloaded this as a freebie , so I am spared the inconvenience of trying to return it for a refund.We 've all been to school . We all know how fiction is supposed to be formatted . Even someone who has suffered a temporary bout of insanity and forgotten can simply pull a book down off the shelf and see at a glance that paragraph indents are a MUST . However talented the author of this book may be in other respects , she should know better than release a book without them .	-1
This was a very short stories about a possessed doll . The story was pretty simple and kinda expected . It was ok. Would only recommended toting if its free .	-1
I am shocked that this book was published by Ellora 's cave . I usually really like or love the books taken on by this publisher but this book was pretty awful.There was a lot missing from this book . Two of the characters were having sex before the end of the first chapter . Sometimes an author with good character and world building can justify quick sex in a book but these characters were obvious strangers since they are n't even the same species and the author did n't even attempt to introduce you to the world or the characters before they were having sex.Another thing that kind of made me shake my head and say `` Huh ? '' is the male anatomy that sends electric currents during sex . Seems a little to BDSM to me and seemed like it was the author 's way of getting by with minimal detail on a sex scene and talk about quickie ! My God ! Give the reader more than a few quick thrusts , a shock and ooh baby the best orgasm ever ... This book had potential but the author did not put the time or effort into making it of any great value and I am greatly disappointed that I spent $ 5.00 on a book that should be given away or not sold for more than $ .99 .	-1
I never write reviews unless I really like a book or I really , really hate it . This one has to be one of the worst books I 've read in recent years . The premise sounded like one I would like , but the female lead was so unlikeable , whiny and just plain annoying that it was hard to drum up any enthusiasm for the menage relationship ( why they liked her outside physical chemistry was a complete mystery ) , the writing was atrocious ( very poor grammar and even worse editing ) , and having the female lead start a conversation or an interlude with Matt and end it with Max ( or vice versa ) when Max was n't in the room or scene was just plain sloppy . Also , for all the dialogue about not having jealousy between the brothers , the author clearly had a partiality to Matt over Max which just goes against this sort of book , at least from my persepctive . Still ca n't believe I read the whole thing ( I was ready to give up just before the half-way point but have a hard time dropping a book before I finish it and I kept hoping it might get better ) . If you like this type of scenario , do n't waste your time or money on this book - there are many better ones out there .	-1
This book is seriously creepy and now I remember why I do n't usually read thrillers ! They are way to creepy and I have nightmares for days if they are well written.This book was partly kind of boring and partly creepy . This book is written from two perspectives , from the P.I . Hank Mondale 's and from It 's perspective . When the story was told from Hank 's view it was kind of boring and I found it difficult to continue reading . His whole personality was boring and lazy . He is not a very likable person . Then we get to read the story from the monster It 's view and then it got seriously creepy . The way it thinks and describe things just gets under my skin and I found it hard to continue reading because it creped me out . And it is not the only disturbing person in this story . There are someone else that is really horrible.I would think that this novel is really good and it is very well written no doubt but it was not for me . If you thrillers and if you like things to be described in a way that it will be hard to get that image out of your head then this is for you . If you do not like that then you should stay away from this book . I wish I had . The images this book gave me will be hard to forget .	-1
I guess I did n't read the info about the book that closely . I 'm just not a fan of short stories . I probably would n't have purchased it had I paid attention to the length .	-1
Far too derivative for my liking as there were just so many similarities between this and the labyrinth from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . Magic school ? Check . Four participants ? Check ? One of them was n't originally supposed to be there ? Check . Gender ( and for some of them , personalities ) of the participants ? Check . The list goes on . There were a few original tidbits buried in there , but overall this novella is solidly a 2 star and no more . *Review re-posted from Goodreads.com	-1
When I first checked out the reviews for this novel a few weeks ago I was a bit nervous as a few of the reviews were left by folks who left nearly identical reviews for the author 's other books . Well I hate to say this but I could n't even finish this book . I read about 80 % of it before I got frustrated and tossed it down for something else . Another reviewer mentioned how the main character is depicted as shy yet comes on extremely strong when they first meet . No joke . She almost seemed obnoxious . Also I just could n't figure out what made Darcy so special that she was worth all of this angst that Regan put herself through . Outside of being engaged to the biggest jerk on the planet I never really felt like I got to know her . And finally the editing was ... bad . I am seriously not a nitpicker in this regard and usually roll my eyes when people complain about this issue , but there were at least a few cases where words in a sentence would be switched around . This would created an entirely different meaning in the sentence and I would be pulled out of the story to try and figure out what she meant . Ugh , I really hate leaving a bad review like this and perhaps for $ 5 many people will enjoy this story , but I was just left wanting .	-1
In general , I enjoy most mystery/thriller books . However , this book labored too long over the thoughts of the characters which were irrelevant and then withheld information vital to the story . I realize that this is supposed to be a mystery but the evidence can be revealed without giving everything away . This is the sort of book that generally makes me want to put it down and pick up another book and I have done that in the past . I did finish this book ( due to the characters in the book ) but to say the the ending was a surprise is not truly accurate . The reader was not given the benefit of all the information . By comparison , Chalk One Up to Murder , gave the reader all of the information and if the reader made the connection great - but if not then the ending was a surprise.On the plus side , the characters were well developed .	-1
The author has better than average writing skills , hence the two stars rather than one . Most likely would be better in another genre . However , it 's almost impossible to read if you have the slightest military experience , in my opinion . Neither enough of a farce to enjoy as such , nor military SF like Ringo or Weber . It 's rare for me to not finish a book , but this was just too annoying to me . If you your life experience is limited to college , you might not find so bad	-1
The first story was decent . Not too predictable ; not the same over-done porno plot lines . However the other two stories after that just built themselves up and died . They really were n't worth the time it took to read them . Granted they did n't take too much time to read however it was still a waste . There was no details , no depth , and no imagination . I would imagine anyone enjoyed reading these stories .	-1
There are 3 stories in the book , each progressively more graphic , but together the 3 are maybe a 20 minute read . What 's the point of these stories if they are n't long enough to turn you on ? The author writes well enough , the situations are creative , and I like the premise of a series of stories set in one little town , but I did n't like the majority of the book . I buy a wide range of erotica , but I did n't like the men in the first two stories ... I 'm not a fan of stories about opportunistic or manipulative sexual situations.My other gripe was that the first 10 % of the book is the introduction - I can only guess it 's so that you do n't get any of the actual story when you download the sample - and I do n't like that kind of thing . Luckily I got this as a freebie or I 'd have walked away from the story for that fact alone .	-1
This short story was a major disappointment to me.The characters seemed like broadly drawn stereotypes ( especially Gask , his racism was just over-the-top ) . There was no real mystery or tension to the plot . It was also surprising to me , since this story was published in a major anthology , how sloppy the proof-reading was . Errors kept jarring me out of the story .	-1
Overall , it was interesting and held my interest . But I think the mystery of the aunts losing money showed foolishness ( while sweet , they did n't gave a true plan and they would only be able to sell so much before running out of $ , or losing their source of income ) .The romance was kind if sweet , but not sure it was enough for her to be upset with him for leaving . His reason was quite legitimate and so she came off irrational and stuff.They only went on 3 dates , so the proposal after he had been gone for months with no contact was unrealistic to me , too .	-1
In the beginning , the author tries too hard with witticisms . They come one after the other like a barrage . The introduction of characters is too busy . Midway through the story begins to feel less manic and there are some enjoyable passages . The Clooney interludes are ridiculous , even for tongue in cheek.Not my favorite	-1
I ca n't imagine how this author achieved any literary awards with this Middle School writing and flat characters . Not worth the price if it were free .	-1
I did n't get a strong feel for the characters or why I should really care for them . They hoped for a mate , been betrayed , felt lust/love and they were happy . No true feel for anything really or why I should continue.I 've read Mayburn before and she can rock at world-building and creating interesting characters . Unfortunately , this short fell ... short . : (	-1
I read this book after reading the fourth book in the series . I enjoyed the fourth book so much , I was sure I would like this one too . And sure enough , it started with a bang ... ok , more like a slash and a scream , but she had my attention from the very beginning . However , as she introduced the main characters my attention slowly waned.Jesslyn came of as abrasive and bitchy , with moments of stupidity at the worst times . Aiden liked to puff his chest but seemed virtually importent in the face of Jesslyn 's bitchiness . There was no chemistry between Jesslyn and Aiden . As a reader i was sympathetic to Jesslyn 's history but she was also pretty abrasive , like stupid abrasive . Aiden for some reason found that attractive . So of course in a matter of like a week , their in love . I could n't figure out how it happened so quickly , because basically they 'd had one date.I look back on this book and i 'm not sure how I finished . At about the point & lt ; spoiler > that Jesslyn decides to go down to the lake despite the fact that she knows the serial killer is targeting her , alone , in the dark , in the middle of a thunderstorm , I was pretty done . I was hoping the guy would kill her , just so the story would be over . & lt ; /spoiler > The book as a whole seemed move about the writer putting together dramatic scenarios , than about about scenarios that really made sense . The book seemed to drag on and on , not because it was overly long , but because the story construction was so poor.So as much as I loved Deadly Games , I wo n't seek out any other books by this author .	-1
Did she not have an editor ? ? So boring ! Terrible plot , ridiculous and unrealistic dialogue that the author obviously thought sounded clever but really came off as stilted and clumsy . I had zero interest in these characters from the 2nd chapter on . I had to force myself to read the second half of the book . Now I 'm just pissed because I believed the other reviews and bought the whole series.I 'd return them if I could.Do n't bother with this book or this author . I certainly will avoid all her work in the future .	-1
I have read many werewolf/menage stories ( but Irish Wolfhounds , seriously ? ) and the quality of this one just was n't there . For me it was more of a short story . Definitely not enough detail . It kept referring to the `` incident '' that happened while Autumn was in the military as being a the source of many of her problems and fears , and how she was uncomfortable around men , etc . She definitely did n't have any problem with the two guys just minutes after she met them , and when it came time to reveal the `` incident '' it was really pretty anticlimactic . This is the first time I 've read this particular author and based on this book I wo n't go out of my way for another .	-1
I hated this book to the point where I stopped reading it about 10 pages in because it was just stupid I do not recommend this book to anyone ever .	-1
First let me say ; shame on me for finishing this horrible book . Second ; based on other 's reviews , I 'm obviously in the minority.The topic was interesting and the potential was there . The first chapter or two was pretty good but it went downhill fast and the execution was just terrible . I thought the overall plot was weak , the characters superficial ; the entire story choppy.All throughout the chase the story just kept getting more and more ridiculous . Ultimately , Rand meeting Lord and helping him & # 34 ; see & # 34 ; ; Rand & Jade using their collective & # 34 ; gifts & # 34 ; to deflect capture ; the demise of Mr. P ... ... what an unbelievable waste of valuable reading time . Like I said , I could slap myself for finishing this stupid story.Thank goodness it 's over and there are other engaging books to read .	-1
Do n't waste your money . I agree with the other reviewer a few reviews down . This is sooooo bad . I do n't usually write many reviews , but I hate to see anyone lose their money over this . I ca n't believe it 's 2.99 . I paid .99 and THAT WAS TO MUCH FOR THIS BOOK .	-1
To short a story for avid readers of this author . This story like his other 'short ' stories leaves you unfulfilled and diappointed wanting more .	-1
Not bad , worth the ninety nine cents . Somewhat far fetched but what historical romance does n't have a portion of that ?	-1
I strongly caution you to be wary of this book . It is a dark psycho story that spins slowly and ponderously down into insanity . There is no good feeling about this story and it left me with the depressive wonder of why I read it all the way to the end . I also believe that I read this book under another name , but I do n't know what it was . I regret that I read it a second time . If you want to be depressed , read this !	-1
I like many of Victor Methos books , but not this one . It was not written up to his standards . The storyline was not interesting , the book was not well written and I simply did not like it .	-1
Lynda Chance excels in writing Alpha males but this time I felt Mike was too aggressive and Megan was too submissive . I felt like this was more date rape than romance . Mike was all about what he wanted and rolling over Megan . She would be thoroughly under his thumb . While this is not unusual for Lynda Chance heroes something about Mike set me off .	-1
To much sex and graphics and bad language . Stopped after a few chapters and returned it . would not recommend this book	-1
I tried to like this book but I did not . I did not like the era or the storyline . Had it have been medieval times I probably would have liked it . It was well written I just did not enjoy the story	-1
I found this mystery to be kind of boring , Maybe the subject matter just did n't i ntrest me.I do n't think I would read another book in this series .	-1
I am sure if you 're into dolls this book would be good but I was just bored by chapter 3 .	-1
No , it did n't grab my attention enough to give it a good review . I was hoping that this series from the author would be better than the other one I tried , still not the case . Maybe it 's not my cup of tea , but the story was boring , the heroine rather dull , nd I did n't like any of the second characters .	-1
& # 8220 ; Dynamite Fishermen & # 8221 ; by Preston Fleming is set in Lebanon in the early 1980s -- I think -- during the time when Henry Kissinger was US Secretary of State . The characters are almost interesting , most being in the US ( or some other country & # 8217 ; s ) diplomatic corps ( in truth & # 8211 ; spies ) with the local spies and the spy-wannabes they run , and the detailed short history of the never-ending mid-east conflict within the political realities or the era is quite good . It is the time of the Iran-Iraq conflict.I don & # 8217 ; t have much to write in review because actually there is no story here . It & # 8217 ; s more like a diary than any other story mode . The author tells this anecdotal story mainly via conversation among his characters , as they walk the ever-mysterious fine line between betrayal , info-gathering and violence & # 8211 ; which characterized Beirut at the time . For me , the story never once made sense , never moved beyond a snapshot of the dangerous life of foreigners in Beirut at the time.Throughout my reading of this very short book , I kept hoping that the story would actually begin , and once in a while it almost did -- in fits and starts . The shooting scene in the apartment was well done , for instance , but sadly that & # 8217 ; s all there is to say about this attempt at fictionalizing a fascinating , recent mid-east history.It & # 8217 ; s a 1.49 , rounded down to a 1 . Sorry , this book just isn & # 8217 ; t very good , and mainly because there is no story at all , no denouement , no thrills , no point of view & # 8211 ; just dialogue without a discernible plot	-1
i love to read and have over a thousand ebooks . this author is creative and you care about the characters but it is apparent she does not read her own books . each page has glaring grammatic and spelling errors as well as misuage of words . it is so bad it makes you lose the story line . i will not buy any others even though i want to see the story of the third brother . authors please read your books before publishing .	-1
Do n't bother reading this story because it 's a waste of time even for a free read ! Do n't bother go spend your time with a good book	-1
this book was short , sweet and to the point and at times a little confusing . I did n't really understand the premise of the story other than the tribes desire for more babies to be born without the need for a father figure while drugging the girls to do so . There was really nothing sexy about this book .	-1
The material in this book is accurate , but consists of very filler advice . There were too many references to the authors other book that goes into more depth . I felt it was basically an informing advertisement .	-1
Fast read . This story jumps *right* into the bedroom . About 3 pages in , Josh has his hands down Mikaela 's pants ... And the story jumps *right* into the ending . There 's neither slow build-up nor slow release which is a bit disconcerting.The sex was hawt ... but the rest kinda felt wishy-washy . Weak backstory , weak characters , weak build-up , weak dialogue . Not sure whether sex can be a story 's sole saving grace ...	-1
This was not a good choice for me . I did not like the book at all and actually put it down before I finished it .	-1
Difficult to get into , and too many French words and phrases.Too much inappropriate behavior.Not worth wasting time reading.So . l. Skipped through it .	-1
I liked the idea of reading a book about the french country side and wine making so i picked this one up . The story and the experience of reading this book however was alright . It fails to hold your attention as the characters are weak and superficial . The romance between Maggie and Laurent is not appealing at all . The mystery confused me quite honestly and i had a difficult time remembering the first names and then surnames used for the same person in the book . I wish there was some consistency there . It was alright .	-1
Reading this kind of made me feel as if I was plopped into the middle of a story without much context . I wish there had been more background presented . I assumed they 'd left earth because of the zombies , but then they were totally surprised that the zombies existed ( I guess the solar flares made them leave ? ) .More like a military story with zombie elements than what I would consider a true zombie tale , I found myself not caring much about the characters or the eventual resolution of the story .	-1
It was an easy read but very predictable and very much like others in the genre.I had to re-read the description to remember the plot . So I guess for me it was forgettable.Sorry	-1
The writing in Enchanted Heart was excessively verbose , to say the least . Also , the author seemed to have a love affair with alliteration . Marty 's reaction to Caid 's kiss was a `` swirl into the dizzying depths of delight '' and her nipples were described as `` pink petals of pleasure . '' I just picked two examples at random but the entire book is composed of excesses like these . Frankly , such language becomes boring after a while so I ended up skimming over lots of the book . There was very little dialogue in relation to the large amounts of narrative which is another style that I do n't like and leads to me skimming rather than reading.An important point of an historical book , even a romance , is using facts accurately and there were multitudes of errors throughout the book . Some examples are : the book spoke of the Comanches in Texas using teepees but teepees were found on the Great Plains and used by the Dakotas , Lakotas , Cheyennes , and other Native Americans of that area . Propriety was very rigidly enforced , so there was no way that Caid 's and Marty 's behavior at the campfire or them taking off alone for hours without a chaperone would have been tolerated . Buck would NEVER have cursed in front of Marty or Greta let alone used language like that when addressing them . Greta could not have been safely moved after receiving a compound fracture of the leg and I do n't see how she could have survived at all , even with a doctor 's help given the state of medical knowledge at the time . It is extremely unlikely that Marty could have lived through her miscarriage even if she lived long enough to have a transfusion for which Buck would not have had the necessary equipment or any knowledge of the ABO blood typing ( which was discovered by Karl Landsteiner in the early 20th century ) . Mulling over these and other inaccuracies spoiled the flow of the story for me.Perhaps most importantly when reading a romance is to believe in the love between the characters . For both Marty & Caid and Greta & Buck , their overwhelming , instant , heaven-sent , all-encompassing love was simply not believable . I really did n't enjoy reading this story and I would not recommend it to anyone else .	-1
Poorly written and ripped from the tabloids . The only redeeming quality is its merciful brevity . Should be rated negative stars , or ten thumbs down .	-1
This is a very short and simplistic short story about a widow who gets a monthly delivery of flowers from the same delivery man.Readers looking for a short and sweet story may enjoy this a great deal , but it was just too simplistic for me to get into . Also , I know it was supposed to be a short and sweet retreat-from-reality type of story , but something about the male main just seemed a bit stalkerish and weird to me .	-1
Some readers might like this kind of book but it was too much of a thriller for me but it was as if God was really watching over these kids in their adventure . Although fiction , this kind of stuff may actually go on in real life . I have to admit that the author makes you feel that you are really there .	-1
This was so dumb . Normally I 'm okay with bad books , but this one should have been free . Actually , Melanie Marks should have PAID me to read it . It needs a LOT of work . UPDATE : Sorry , when I first wrote that I had just sprained my ankle so I was n't in the best mood . Sorry 'bout the word choice . Still does need work though .	-1
If you 're going to a new school , do n't read this book . It may give you nightmares . That is how I experienced it .	-1
I bought this novel back in 2012 , so when I finally got the chance to read it , I was more than thrilled , but then I was let down immensely . The novel begins with two girls , Beckett Smith and Chloe Baker , at the Aurora Bridge , talking about an event that has taken place before the novel started . Honestly , I think I would 've enjoyed this novel a lot more if it was told from both Beckett and Chloe 's point-of-view , but it was n't . It was only told from Beckett 's point-of-view . Also , I did n't really connect with any of the characters . I 'm not sure if this was because of the characters or the way the story was told . Overall , I was n't really a fan of this novel , however , I do think that this novel could help a lot of young people who is struggling with being accepted and is considering suicide ... this novel teaches you that there is never a reason to go to that extreme , and I absolutely loved that aspect about this novel .	-1
Not even sure why I downloaded this but it must have been free . Even if that was the case it was too much . I never finished this book .	-1
This story was really quite horrible and so absurd at times , that it actually made me laugh once or twice , although I 'm sure it was not the author 's intention . It was n't even sexy ! I definitely do n't recommend this one .	-1
Did n't realize what this was when I purchased it . Not for me . I was looking for a romance novel . This is porn .	-1
And poorly written . Bouncing around from point of view constantly you can barely get a grip on the story , that it 's over all a waste of time .	-1
super short and corny . did not like it , just my opinion . I felt like it did have potential maybe as a full novel it would have been better .	-1
In short , limited appeal to adult audience that expects more filled out characters and more detail construction of action . I could see 12-14 year olds enjoying it . I love space opera , space action novels but this attempt at publishing is a bit premature for this author . I 'd suggest repackaging it for marketing to teen audience .	-1
The story idea was great and I looked forward to reading this book . Unfortunately , it did n't live up to expectations . The writing was okay but it was flat . The story was outlandish . Who can leave a home , job and dog for a few days , rent a car for that time period and then nonchalantly decide to stay for a month with no personal repercussions ? Who can think he 's being kept as a hostage and can have his property taken from him because his sister is a spoiled brat ? The characters were flat and at no time did I feel involved in this book . It was an exercise in my patience to finish it . This is the type of review I hate to write because I know the author worked hard but I just ca n't find much good about this book .	-1
I tried , I really tried . But Elmo had no depth for me - somewhat cardboardish . I 'm sorry . I really wanted to like this .	-1
I read this book thinking it was a mystery story . Forget that ! It was the life of a minister trying to find out a silly secret . It was funny and I really liked the characters but a mystery story it was NOT !	-1
I bought this book by Elysa Hendricks , because she is a very good author . I have read her books before . I expected the writing to be of the quality of her `` Moon Series '' even if not scifi . A good author knows how to make characters jump off a page , use imagination , plot creatively and keep the reader engaged . I 'm happy with a variety of authors from Catherine Anderson to Patricia Briggs , so when I find a good author I generally buy the author 's books . Wow , was I disappointed ! The book was such a waste . I sincerely hope Ms. Hendricks does n't become known for this type of book , because it 's such a waste .	-1
Wow , where do I begin ? This book is worth exactly what I paid for it $ 0.00 . The main character , Claire , is a whiny , poor me , spoiled brat . She is needy and stupid . The writing is terrible . The scenes are not described well . You keep thinking that it has to get better but it just does n't . I have no idea why everyone gave this a 4 or 5 star . I could n't even finish it . Other than supposedly being gorgeous , Ethan has absolutely no personality whatsoever . You THINK he likes Claire but other than one dream Claire has , you do n't get the impression he likes her at all . Claire is obsessed with him . She barely knows the guy yet all of a sudden she is begging him to tell her what to do . She is needy and clingy and it 's embarrassing to read.The one pseudo positive element of this book is the potential for a good world to build with . The premise of where the vampires came from is somewhat unique . However , the writing was so awful and contrived , you felt cheated.Not a book I would recommend to anyone .	-1
First and foremost let me say that this is NOT a complete book ... Oh no , it takes you to a point and then abruptly stops ( except for the quick pitch to buy more of the author 's books ) . Yes , it states in the description that this is the third installment in a series but it does n't state that it apparently starts in the middle and ends there as well . I 'd call it an excerpt at best . This is possibly the worst book , or part thereof , I have EVER read . I really feel sorry for the English teachers the author acknowledges at the end of the story ; their careers are probably over after that citation.The author seems incapable of saying `` he said '' , `` she said '' , etc.. He sometimes states the name of the person who is speaking multiple times in one sentence . He jumps from person to person like a mouse in a giant fire-ant mound . There are enough grammar and punctuation errors to sink a battleship , and the run-on sentences are exhausting . `` How about an example ? '' Okay , here goes , but if you do n't find anything wrong ... then I suggest you buy and read the entire series ; it will suit you just fine . ( Paraphrasing here ) : The author writes that Jim and Jessica take a Greyhound bus back to Memphis and suffer through a long , cramped bus ride with passengers who are eating Harold 's Chicken and licking mild sauce off their fingertips and a handful of passengers who stink of ass and musk . If you 're not laughing by now let me break it down for you ... Would n't you love to be on a bus with passengers who smell like ass and musk and in addition get to watch them licking mild chicken sauce off of each other ? Sounds like my kind of a bus ride.If you want to have one last chance to save yourself before you jump into this train wreck , read the author 's afterword FIRST , it will tell you everything you need to know about the fantastic journey which awaits you.Look , I 'm willing to read and give a chance to almost anything ; and if I 'm going to review it , I am going to read it completely . That 's just the way I operate , but when I read books like this one cover to cover ... I rue the day I made that decision . Why not just water board myself ? ? ? It would be easier to endure.Suggestions to author:1 GET AN EDITOR and then follow his/her advice ; if they say it sucks ... believe them.2 Give away the FIRST installment ( as you call it ) so people have a clue as to what is going on.3 `` Know when to hold 'em , know when to fold 'em , know when to walk away , know when to run '' .

Very boring . Could n't read it the whole way through . Actually I do n't think I made it past the 10th page . I do n't believe that pleasure reading should be torturous .	-1
This book could have been sooo good . The first 100 pages had me feeling Ana 's despair at her situation . After about chapter 11 I was annoyed with this book , not because the story was going where I had hoped , more like the story became extremely choppy . The first sex scene in the book was literally 3 sentances and LEFT ME GUESSING IF THE REALLY HAD SEX ! I had to reread the pags to see if I missed it ! So if you do n't want goary details about sex that is great but it should n't leave you guesssing . Also there were so many they 're gon na be together they 're not gon na be together moments or they are together but then something happens to break them appart . Its like the heroine can never be happy or have a moment to enjoy her life . Maybe that is what the author wanted but then the story still should have been written better after chapter 11 .	-1
At first I could n't stop reading , then it fell apart . It got too slow . I started skimming the pages . I know it has good reviews , so maybe I 'll give it another chance later . I still kept it , so that means it was n't that bad , just ok .	-1
I really enjoyed the second story , but the first and third were not a enjoyable for me . Other two stories were jut both style , and more confusing to read .	-1
I 'm glad this was a free ebook at Amazon.The Good : The very unusual opening , gives the book a unique beginning.Bear shifters are n't as popular as were-wolves and were-tigers , so it 's a refreshing change of pace.The Bad : Some of the phrasing reads awkward or flat out does n't work , like to the point of completing keeping me at arms ' length instead of losing me in the story.Lora seemed a bit flat to me , too flat for a main character.I 've used guns before . I 've shot everything from a double barreled shotgun , to a 9MM . Unless Johnnie 's handgun was a.44 Magnum { which will not fit in a shorts pocket } , it will only piss a bear off , even if he hit the heart area of the chest , the bear 's skin is tough ... so the bear running off bleeding profusely and the blood spattered on Lora 's shirt was too fake to me .	-1
This time around , Josie goes to the UK to take on a ghostwriting job . I bought this book because I wanted to see if it was better than the first and I thought the author did have talent . I could n't get into this one though I hung on to the end to see if it improved.Unfortunately , although the premise could have been good and followed on from the first novel , Bridesmaid Lotto , there was nothing in it . Firstly , as the author would have known , three months is not enough to write and deliver an `` autobiography '' in good enough shape to send to a publisher and that part should have been believable . The heroine does very little writing - two weeks to the end of the contract and she has written all of five or ten pages . She does n't actually sit down and interview her subject , they just canter around the nightclubs and indulge in terrifying sports , thereby making the tabloids happy . The boyfriend , Jake , from the first novel makes a few phone calls to her - not very convincing since he 's supposed to be keen on her.The characters were very superficial , the status of the biography subject should have indicated bodyguards , but there were none - he seemed to roam around pretty much on his own - and the heroine was totally unqualified to ghostwrite a novel for anyone . These two factors alone should have been up to scratch.All in all , my hopes for a better novel were dashed .	-1
Honestly for anyone interested in the series , I 'd suggest you just skip this book all together . It was a complete waste of money seeing as I skipped through most of it . Between how boring this installment was and how gullible Josie continued to be throughout it took me nearly 3 weeks to force myself to read the darn thing . I 'm sorry to be so harsh but I like to get sucked into a book , see everything through the characters eyes . And all I could think about in this one was , 'When will something exciting happen ? 'Unfortunately I am not the type to give up on a series , I need to see it through and since the third installment has such high reviews I 'll probably look into it . However I would still recommend that you not waste your money.Sorry Rachel , just did n't care for it .	-1
